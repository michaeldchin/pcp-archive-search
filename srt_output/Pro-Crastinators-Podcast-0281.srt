1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
During the Ben Effort Arc, which is long over, that was sure was a time and place. We're past that now.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Remember when this show had effort and every episode started with like an actual edited segment of like a joke?

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, actually. I think Jesse and Davoo did that a couple times and that was it.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That happened pretty often in the olden times.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We set expectations too high.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's true. We were still young naive fools who thought podcasts were stupid, not realizing that nobody cares about the presentation.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They only care that something is in their ears in another tab while they're doing literally anything.

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They're only half paying attention to what's being said in the first place.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, I mean, that's me. I understand. I too am a consumer pig who just wants more slop in my trough.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, today's episode, we got two guests. We got Kazi.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hello, I'm a pony character. I'm Yiffy Snout the Pegasus and I'm here to talk about the pony movie.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That sounds like an OC that would do very well.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not hungover at all. Neither has been.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And we got Crack as well.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Good morning. Oh, man. Oh, man, I'm dying.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm trying to bring the energy.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Before the episode, you were doing a bit. You were doing a bit where it's like, oh, I'm going to be so energetic,

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but you clearly have blown out all the energy you have already.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's gotten a lot.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, yeah. I was giving it all I had. I woke up Harganine. She's real upset about it.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Good you. Good, good, good.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I woke up Ethan to take his microphone, so we're on the same level.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm glad that it's ruining not only our lives, but the lives of everyone around us.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The collateral damage of the podcast, just wonderful.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We have to release this episode at 10 in the morning so everyone else can live.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The story.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We were recording in the afternoon and I just think that that's bad because then I spend the morning being like,

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
well, I've got to record in like six hours and then six hours later, I've done nothing.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My day is basically over and then it's time to record and then I got to do audio editing

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and then it's 8 p.m. by the time I'm done.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
My day is over. It's ruined fruit fly.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, we got to get up and I got to get my day going in the morning, same time as lifting.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Same time as lifting.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, that's fair.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's fair. When we're sitting around at five in the morning and you drop on me that we have to record in five hours

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and I didn't know.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That makes me so sad.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, well, good.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So this is what we're doing now.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh god, we didn't.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay, on the count of three, let's say sync.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
One, two, three, sync.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Sync.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
One, two, three, sync.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Sync.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh god, I guess this is just going in the episode.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Fuck it.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Fuck it.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They love it.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Then it's content.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Everyone is fucked.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It is content.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's inside baseball.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's candy.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I got some good content right here.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You ready for this?

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You ready for this?

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh yeah.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Lay it on me.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Lay it on me.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What?

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You hear that?

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The pot open.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The first morning monster.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Here we go.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This isn't just time to do drinking or spying, snapping.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, I got my seltzer here.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So we all watched a fucking movie this week.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We watched a film.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It finally happened.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's finally here.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's finally here.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The bro analysis community is saved.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The drought of content is over.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's okay, everypony.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Your TF2 analysis anarchy episodes will continue.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't worry.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We're working on them.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Dr. Wolf has content to make content out of.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We're meeting through the rift cafe right now.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We're hanging out.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you doing in my analysis channel?

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How did you get here?

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wait.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I just remembered the whole fucking commission.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Was it me and Steve?

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Kazzy that commissioned you to draw the entire brony analysis TF2 analysis community?

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Can we show that image on screen right now?

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sure I still have it somewhere.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But yeah, no, give and Steve, they paid me like $80 to just redraw the analysis anarchy

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
poster.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't add anything funny to it, they said.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Just draw it again.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There was no joke except just draw it and we'll pay you to do so.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You were the joke.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Just to make the puppet dance.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You were the punch.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then we printed it out at like a fucking staples and like on just like computer paper,

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
brought it to brony gone.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then I think steel viper like took it and she went up to like all of the, you know,

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
all the people on the poster and had them sign it.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Someone crossed out who's the guy that did the really bad shit.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Tune Critic Y2K.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Tune Critic Y2K.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Someone like scribbled out.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I drew Tune Critic Y2K and just because like he was on the poster and I was supposed to

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
redraw it.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So I was like, I'm just going to, I guess he's, he guess he's in it and someone scribbled

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
it out and I'm like, that's appropriate.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's, it would be, it would be unfair.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It would be unfair to draw a false equivalence between the rest of them and Tune Critic Y2K.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You know, I think I have a photo of the signed poster and I can get that for us too if you

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
want.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I just hit my mic really hard.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Maybe I'll edit it out, but if I forget, at least I'll edit it out.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, you know what?

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, you know what I did this week?

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Speaking of, speaking of hitting your microphone and editing shit out of your recording, I

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
am going to be, I'm going to be a Tails gets trolled canon.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I am the voice, I am the voice of the Dark Lord in the audio books and the Tails gets

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
trolled audio books now.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And as well, as well as one of the cultists in the scene, in the scene where they, where

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
they drink blood and get their neutral powers.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It seems appropriate considering you're the voice of the Dark Lord in real life.

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's just when, when they drink the blood and get the Satan powers, the Satan, Satan's

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
voice basically comes from nowhere and just says like, Hey guys, here's the deal.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You got to use your powers and you got to not get emotional or else I'll kill you.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay.

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Good luck.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Bye.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And that's my line.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Congratulations.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't wait.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm so excited.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm so excited for that to come out.

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ben, I got to tell you listening to the PCP, like a nightmare.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, I actually do it sometimes, believe it or not.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But like listening to it is.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
When you need to pick me up, you're just like, I need to feel better about myself.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You know?

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,600
Well, no, that's not even true because listening to it is really just like a hearing of retelling

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,000
of my own life because I see Ben like literally every other day.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So every single like thing that Ben does, every time Ben does anything, like I also was there.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And so listening to the podcast is just me hearing about what I did that week.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Listening to the PCP is like journaling.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,400
You know, this is why, this is, wait years ago, this is why I kind of like stopped listening.

162
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,800
This is why I stopped listening to Digi Brony After Dark to the side channel because I just

163
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,400
lived in Trixie's house and I was like, well, now I don't have to listen to your content

164
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,240
anymore because like it's just a hearing someone talk about things that I already heard you

165
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
tell me about.

166
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Yeah.

167
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
It's just my life.

168
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Exactly.

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
That's what this podcast is.

170
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Like actually.

171
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Yeah.

172
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Yeah.

173
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Think of how far things have gone listeners.

174
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
I know.

175
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
They used to live in the same house and now they want to kill each other.

176
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
What a strange tale.

177
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
I mean, those two things can happen at the same time.

178
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
What a twist.

179
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
What a twist.

180
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
That was the beginning of the end.

181
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
That's not even that uncommon of a thing to happen.

182
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
It's not.

183
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,080
When you stop listening to the side channel, that's the beginning of the end.

184
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Oh, absolutely.

185
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
For any friendship.

186
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,080
You realize that they're not like a super content creator, God, they're actually just

187
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
a human being is boring.

188
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Where's the horse cast, huh?

189
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,640
I want more of that.

190
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,480
The horse cast.

191
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Where's my Blu-ray copy?

192
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Oh, for a second, I thought you meant the pony cast.

193
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
No.

194
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Whoa.

195
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Whoa.

196
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
That takes me back.

197
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,480
You know, Ben knows this and Gib knows this, but Tom, you don't know this.

198
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
That means.

199
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Sounds like most things.

200
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,600
Me and Munchy and Ethan and Steve and Acro.

201
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,080
Like three years ago, we recorded one episode of a podcast where we reviewed the horse

202
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:22,280
cast, like we recapped the horse cast and like I found that podcast recently because

203
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
it was up on YouTube.

204
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
I think it's set to private now.

205
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,120
It has like fucking 200 views on it and I realized that like I was listening to the

206
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,600
horse cast when I was like a 15 year old kid.

207
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,880
So what you're saying is we should just release that podcast as this week's episode.

208
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Yes.

209
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Yeah.

210
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:55,840
I remember watching that and how people like everyone was like so kind of unsettled by

211
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,480
how weird, yeah, cringe and like knew the relationship was between all of us in the

212
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,400
horse cast early days.

213
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,120
Yeah, especially me.

214
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,480
I paid attention to what they thought of what I was doing because I always hated that.

215
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
I was like, Oh God.

216
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,080
It's the most embarrassing thing ever.

217
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
I don't know how to speak to anybody.

218
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Oh really?

219
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,920
Are you embarrassed by the horse cast?

220
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Well, in like a general like I was like really shy and obviously like bad at speaking to

221
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
people.

222
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,280
I still am, but like less so, but like I don't like want to hide it.

223
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
It's just funny.

224
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,360
It's just funny how bad I was like doing all of that stuff.

225
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
And yet I was on a podcast for like five years.

226
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,280
I mean, like that podcast, like the first one was like your first time like talking

227
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
to Jesse.

228
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Yeah.

229
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Period.

230
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Was it not?

231
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Yeah.

232
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,040
And in voice call, I think it was, we were going to do the horse cast, but Digi or Trixie

233
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,640
was a was not able to be there.

234
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,400
So we were in a Skype group.

235
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
We just did it.

236
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,040
I had never talked to him before.

237
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,000
I talked to him in text, but yeah, it's so weird because it was extremely awkward.

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That stupid little, like I back in the day when I was a fucking child, I like re listened

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to the horse casts and like there's imagine doing some such a thing.

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,320
I think there was some joke like made in the horse cast.

241
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,920
I don't know who said it might have been Jesse where they were just like, oh, I love to go

242
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,000
re listened to the old horse cast.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,360
And I was thinking like, yes, oh my God, I literally do.

244
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Wonderful.

245
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
So funny.

246
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
That's terrible.

247
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,360
So there was a horse movie.

248
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Yeah.

249
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
It just came out.

250
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,160
How'd you guys like the pony movie?

251
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,360
Five out of 10.

252
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Really?

253
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Let's move on.

254
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Really?

255
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Yeah.

256
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Oh man.

257
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
No, I thought it was great.

258
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
I didn't get that.

259
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
I didn't get that much out of it.

260
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
I didn't think it was that great.

261
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,360
I didn't hear that much about it.

262
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Yeah.

263
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,360
See, my thing, I really quite enjoyed it.

264
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,760
It was sort of comfort food, if you will.

265
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,360
I can tell it's not like the best thing ever, but it was the best pony movie I've ever

266
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,160
seen because the rest of them, they have they have they have a problem with like six protagonists

267
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,360
plus new movie specific characters and villains.

268
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
It's never enough time.

269
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,360
But like with this new thing, it was like, oh yeah.

270
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,360
It's a pony movie built from the ground up to be a movie.

271
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,360
It's got the three acts, it's got the hero's journey.

272
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
It's got cute moments.

273
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
It's got funny moments.

274
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
It's got great music.

275
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
I enjoyed myself thoroughly.

276
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
It was a very nice time.

277
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:53,360
I compared it favorably to the, you know, the two part, the premiere episode of Gen 4.

278
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,360
That one is like famously terrible.

279
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
It's not that bad.

280
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
The second one is really bad.

281
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
The second half where they go on the quest and what did I say last night?

282
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,360
I said, I honestly swear that you won't die if you let go.

283
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
So dumb.

284
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,360
So it's better than that, which is not a high bar, but it's something.

285
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
So I mean, it wasn't a nightmare.

286
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,360
It wasn't a complete disaster, but I'm, you know, we were watching it, Kazi, and we're

287
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
just like, oh, they're in like a spooky valley.

288
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Do you think they're going to meet their next friend now?

289
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
And then she did.

290
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
And we were like, well, okay.

291
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
I mean, what's so weird about that?

292
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Like the story is progressing.

293
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
I called.

294
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Things happen.

295
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
It's like, wow.

296
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Things happen in a fucking movie.

297
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,360
It just wasn't, it just wasn't, I know, but it just wasn't very engaging.

298
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,360
I, by the way, I called, I called the, I didn't know what the plot was, but I called it like,

299
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
oh, the unicorns don't have magic.

300
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
I bet the Pegas I can't fly either.

301
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
I was like, yeah, they can't fly.

302
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,360
I was like, wow, they have wings, but they can't fly because it doesn't make any sense.

303
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
It doesn't make any sense.

304
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,360
It doesn't make any sense.

305
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
I'm a genius.

306
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,360
I don't remember what the Pegasus name is that they end up, the two Pegasus.

307
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Zip and zip.

308
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Zip and pip.

309
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Zip and pip.

310
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Zip, I guess she was just falling with style in that scene.

311
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
She's just doing flips.

312
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
She's just doing flips.

313
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Believe it or not, I watched the movie twice and I was paying attention to that the second

314
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
time.

315
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
And yeah, she's kind of just like jumping on rocks.

316
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Okay.

317
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,360
But then she like comes up from the side of the cliff and it's like in a way that you

318
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,360
couldn't do unless you had some momentum to fly.

319
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
No, it's fine.

320
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
It was a big jump.

321
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
But also it's a child's film.

322
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
That's just some classic misdirection.

323
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
That's a Tony Hawk maneuver.

324
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Okay.

325
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Here's one thing that I don't understand.

326
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,360
When they leave Pegasus Kingdom and zip and pip both come along and I'm like, I thought

327
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
we're supposed to hate pip.

328
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Pip is like obnoxious.

329
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Pip is like an annoying Instagram influencer.

330
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,360
I kind of thought she was set up to be someone we don't like.

331
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,360
But then she comes along and it's like, well, she's just here now.

332
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
She's just one of our friends.

333
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Friendship is magic, family.

334
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
We have to be friends.

335
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Well, I'm like, oh, really?

336
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
What do you mean?

337
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
They're bringing her?

338
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
It's a, it's, it's, it's zip sister.

339
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
You know, you can't just, you can't just throw out your family.

340
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
She had a moment where she was like, I can't believe you ruined everything.

341
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
She could just stay at home.

342
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
She can't.

343
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
What do you mean?

344
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
She was on the run.

345
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
The royals are on the run.

346
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Yeah.

347
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Did you watch this film?

348
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
It was out of necessity at first.

349
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
And then it was like, and she was like grumbling and with what's his face.

350
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
It's like, I can't believe they fucked my life up.

351
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
And he's like, yeah, it sucks, doesn't it?

352
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
The cop, the cop.

353
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Wait, did I just agree with the characters?

354
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
The cop pony.

355
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,360
And then it was like, oh, then they just sort of hung out and realized it was fine.

356
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
It's cute.

357
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
It's a really cute movie.

358
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
I like it.

359
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
I just, I don't know.

360
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,360
It's like, why is this person that I don't like along for the ride?

361
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
The same, I felt the same about the cop.

362
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,360
The Instagram lady and the cop are both, they both shit.

363
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I hate them.

364
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Bruins it.

365
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
The main character is a nice story.

366
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
The cop is great.

367
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm like, really?

368
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,360
These guys, these guys are going to be in the show that you expect me to watch?

369
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
No, no, no.

370
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,360
The cop is great because for not even one moment, is the cop ever like a good guy?

371
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
No.

372
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
He's always petty.

373
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
He's never right.

374
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Why is he here?

375
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Go away.

376
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
It's great.

377
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
You know, we're teaching the kids.

378
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Yeah.

379
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Don't trust the cops.

380
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,360
My little pony, you know, they implicitly said ACAB.

381
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Why did they play?

382
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
I think you are supposed to like him by the end.

383
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,360
He's one of the main characters, a cop and a man, by the way.

384
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Why is this guy in our movie?

385
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
Get him out of here.

386
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
It was really funny.

387
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,360
The beginning of the movie was hilarious to me because we meet the dad, right?

388
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,360
And he seems like a competent, good head on his shoulder.

389
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Nice guy.

390
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Good father.

391
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm like, oh my God.

392
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
That's shitty facial hair though.

393
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Shitty facial hair.

394
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Well, everybody has their flaws.

395
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm like, is this like a respectable male character in My Little Pony?

396
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
This really is a new generation.

397
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Dies between cops.

398
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,360
We're back to where we should be.

399
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Oh no.

400
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,960
Okay, I was so sure that he was not actually dead that it was going to be revealed that

401
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,360
he was actually on a long trip like Arnold's parents to the jungle or something.

402
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
You just went to a farm.

403
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,360
You know, they never once mentioned that he was dead.

404
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
So he could appear in the show.

405
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,360
I just stepped out to get milk for 10 years.

406
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
No, no.

407
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
See, I think that was genius.

408
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,360
It was genius not because they'll bring him back, but because they're showing that Sunny

409
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
has grown up.

410
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
She's aged.

411
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
She's gotten over it.

412
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
She's learned to accept that her father is gone.

413
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
You know, you easily make her whole character.

414
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Whatever it was.

415
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Oh, my dad died.

416
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
They didn't do that.

417
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
She's over it.

418
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
No, but that's quite good.

419
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
She doesn't cry about it.

420
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
It's not a big deal.

421
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
It's like, oh yeah.

422
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Sometimes your parents are gone.

423
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
You've got to work on things yourself.

424
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Yeah.

425
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
No, that's great.

426
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Here's the thing.

427
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
And here's the thing.

428
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
When I die, I hope that none of you ever get over it.

429
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I hope that you do spend the rest of your life moaning about, like, I miss Ben so much.

430
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Ben, I'll get over it so fast it'll make your head.

431
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,360
Otherwise I'd be really offended from beyond the grave.

432
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,360
It'll make you spin in your grave so fast that you'll dig a fucking tunnel to hell.

433
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,360
That's how you got to do it.

434
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,360
So I just thought that was pretty disrespectful of her to not spend the whole movie being

435
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
like, my dad's gone.

436
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
He was such a cool guy.

437
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I mean, whatever.

438
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,360
I never assumed that he was like a rare poochie.

439
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,360
If you just don't love your dad that much, you know, it's fine.

440
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
It is what it is.

441
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,360
I never assumed he was going to come back because she says, she kind of talks to the

442
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,360
picture frame and that's like a thing you do if they're dead, right?

443
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,360
That's not a thing you do if they're, like, away.

444
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
That's what I was thinking.

445
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
He's right in the painting.

446
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
No, I think if he had just been away for, like, years, it would be you could also just

447
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
be like, talk to the painting.

448
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
I mean, you know, either way, he's gone, right?

449
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
And you're like, I wish you were here today.

450
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
Maybe.

451
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
They have wiggle room that if they wanted to bring him back, they could.

452
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
I definitely think they, I really thought they were going to.

453
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,360
He was going to show up, like, in the final act and be like, oh, hey, that's all the conflict.

454
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
You did it.

455
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
You did it.

456
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
I said all the clues and then you did it.

457
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
You're like a real daughter.

458
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,360
You followed the breadcrumb trail that I left for you.

459
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Oh, it turns out he had entrapped himself in the gems.

460
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
It's just like sore.

461
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
Why not?

462
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
It's just like sore.

463
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
He's just like sore.

464
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,360
Oh, the gem.

465
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Should we talk about the gems?

466
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Should we talk about the actual plot of the movie?

467
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Well, OK.

468
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Spoilers.

469
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,360
I mean, obviously spoilers for the whole fucking movie because why would you.

470
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,360
There is not a single person in our audience that either A hasn't already seen this movie

471
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
or B doesn't give a single song.

472
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Why did you watch a podcast about a movie you haven't seen?

473
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
Absolutely.

474
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,360
You can't make hours of content about a movie without spoiling it.

475
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
You just can't.

476
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Ben, do you remember?

477
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Me and Ben watched this movie together.

478
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I was a little bit tipsy watching the movie.

479
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
I just want to be clear.

480
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,360
If I don't remember some things, it's because I was like five or six trulys deep.

481
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
You drank an entire pack of trulys.

482
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Almost.

483
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
You drank like nine or ten.

484
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Almost.

485
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
But we watched the movie.

486
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
The only way you could get through this.

487
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,360
We watched the movie just you and me because I had Netflix and you were at my house.

488
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
And we did that.

489
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,360
And then Munchie was like, I also want to watch it and make a party out of it.

490
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,360
And so, you know, we sat down in the living room.

491
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
No, no, no.

492
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Wait.

493
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Funny story.

494
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
You were like, I have Netflix.

495
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,360
I was like, oh, well, can I watch the pony movie here?

496
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
And you were like, yeah, I can watch.

497
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,360
And you were like, let me ask Munchie if he wants to watch with us.

498
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,360
And you asked him and he was like, no, I don't want to watch that movie.

499
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
And then you were like, well, I think me and Ben are going to watch it.

500
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
And he was like, oh, shit.

501
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Well, in that case, don't watch.

502
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
No, I do want to watch it actually.

503
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
But we watched it anyway.

504
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
I changed my mind.

505
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
We watched it anyway.

506
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Well, you watched it twice.

507
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Yeah.

508
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,360
No, well, it was because you were talking about the gems.

509
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Because we all were watching it again in the living room.

510
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
And then you showed up towards the end of the movie and I sort of got up and hung out

511
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
with you in the kitchen.

512
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,360
And then we heard people shouting from the living room.

513
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,360
And Ben was like, I know exactly what's going on.

514
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
They see the third gem in the background.

515
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
They all just noticed the third gem.

516
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Because when we were watching it and we both were like, oh my god, there's the freaky looking

517
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,360
lantern with the most sparkly jewel in the entire universe.

518
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Well, there it is.

519
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
There's the McGuffin.

520
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,360
And it's frustrating that it's on screen.

521
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,360
And I can tell, OK, there it is.

522
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
You're supposed to do that.

523
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
You're supposed to screen.

524
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
Why is it there?

525
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
At what point?

526
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Do you mean right at the beginning?

527
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
At the end.

528
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
No, no, no.

529
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
At the spoilers.

530
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
What she's looking at.

531
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
What you said.

532
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,360
After she comes back from the quest and the quest has failed.

533
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,360
I mean, she finds it right after that, though, doesn't she?

534
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Yeah, but there's a minute.

535
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
In a moment.

536
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Yeah.

537
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
OK.

538
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Yeah.

539
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,360
She she goes home and she's just like fucking around with her stuff.

540
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,360
And it just like is there in the like lamp.

541
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
That's for some reason.

542
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
The jewel is fine.

543
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
I'm not saying it's a problem with the movie.

544
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm not cinemas in stinging it or anything.

545
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
It sounds like you are, though.

546
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
No, I mean, what's the complaint like?

547
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah.

548
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Of course.

549
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
They want you to see it at that moment.

550
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
You're supposed to realize.

551
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,360
Not only does it make sense compositionally in a metatextual sense.

552
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,360
It makes sense that Sunny having this object since her childhood is like not looking at

553
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
it as a MacGuffin.

554
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
OK.

555
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Just as like an object that's been part of her life.

556
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,360
You're not going to like make that connection, especially since up to that point, there

557
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,360
wasn't even an implication that there was a third gem.

558
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
That was like the revelation of that scene.

559
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
OK.

560
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
But obviously there was going to be a third gem.

561
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
OK.

562
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
Yes.

563
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Of course, obviously, like from our perspective.

564
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Yes.

565
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,360
And that's why they show it, so you can bring that home.

566
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,360
But you didn't see, do you see the gem earlier, like in the beginning of the movie?

567
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Yes.

568
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Do you kind of see it?

569
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Yeah, he's building that little thing.

570
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
I don't know if I see the gem, and I can't remember.

571
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
David, explain where he got it.

572
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
I don't think so.

573
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Well, he's an explorer, architect, archeologist.

574
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
I want to find out why nobody likes each other.

575
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
He's an earth pony.

576
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,360
And they're in their earth pony town, just like the other places just had the gems because

577
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
they're birth writers.

578
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Because they have them.

579
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Yeah.

580
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,360
I mean, I was looking for an explanation on the second watch.

581
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
I didn't get one.

582
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,360
A distant descendant of Star Swirl of Beard.

583
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,360
That's why his beard was so shitty.

584
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
It's just so many generations removed.

585
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
It's just the magic was gone.

586
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
His horn nearly gone.

587
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,360
His beard terrible.

588
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,360
What I'm saying is not even a complaint.

589
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,360
I'm honestly complaining about like, oh shit, the movie got one over on me.

590
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,360
The movie got me to understand the stakes, and then it showed me on the corner of the

591
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
screen, the object of the jeopardy.

592
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
And I'm sitting in the theater.

593
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
I'm pointing.

594
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
I go, oh my god, there.

595
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
There it is.

596
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
It's like Dora.

597
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
It's like watching Dora.

598
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Yeah.

599
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Yeah.

600
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Ben's plan.

601
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Ben's clues.

602
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Yes.

603
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Yeah.

604
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Guys, I'm going to be real with you.

605
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,360
I've seen this movie twice, and I still don't know what the fuck happened.

606
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
What?

607
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
There's so much going on.

608
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
What do you mean?

609
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
You don't understand.

610
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
There's so much going on at any moment.

611
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
I'm too busy.

612
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
I'm too busy paying attention to the spike.

613
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,360
It's so dense.

614
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Every shot has so many moving parts.

615
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Well, there's a pony.

616
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
And she wants to be friends with people.

617
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
No, I'm joking.

618
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
I know.

619
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
She doesn't want to be friends with people.

620
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Why do you even say that?

621
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
She wants to be friends with magical people.

622
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,360
I just, towards the end, you just kind of get like mind fucked.

623
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,360
And then like, the red cop.

624
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Yes, this movie mind fucks you towards the end.

625
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,360
Like the red cop gets in his big fucking Avangelion.

626
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,360
And I'm just like, I don't know what the fuck's going on anymore.

627
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,360
Like, I no longer know what the plot of this movie is because he got in the big robot.

628
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Everything about Sprout sucked.

629
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
I'm saying that.

630
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
No.

631
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
I'm proud of Sprout.

632
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
It's like the stupid, funny idiot.

633
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Sprout's angry mob song is the highlight of the movie.

634
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Oh, it's a bear.

635
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Absolute bear.

636
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
No, I hate it.

637
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
I hate it.

638
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
It is.

639
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
I hate Sprout so much.

640
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
I agree.

641
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Yes.

642
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
That was pretty genuine.

643
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Angry, angry.

644
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Genuinely, the funniest part of the whole movie, probably the best part is the part

645
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
because it's stupid on purpose.

646
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you know what movie?

647
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
You are stupid.

648
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
I agree.

649
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
But you're doing it on purpose now.

650
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
I'm with it.

651
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
He did the White Stripes Seven Nation Army music.

652
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Yeah.

653
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Oh man, that was so cool.

654
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,360
When, yeah, when that song came on and it's sort of like a rock medley, I was like, are

655
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,360
all the songs like, like references to other pop, because the Netflix description of the

656
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,360
movie is like ponies go on an adventure set to like a, like a pop soundtrack.

657
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,360
And I'm like, are they, are all the songs like, like adaptations of pop?

658
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Oh.

659
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,360
Yeah.

660
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Everything's like a, like a loose ripoff.

661
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Are they really?

662
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
That's really tough to know these things.

663
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,360
And that song I could tell that it was like a medley.

664
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
I don't mind.

665
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
I don't mind.

666
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,360
I'm just wondering, because if, if all the other songs were derived from pop hits, like,

667
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,360
I do think there was originally going to be like, just like licensed music and Hasbro

668
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
is like, we're not paying for that shit.

669
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
No, I don't, I don't think so.

670
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
I'm sure this was always the plan.

671
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Probably.

672
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
I think I have an essence.

673
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
I just remember the Lady Gaga side of it.

674
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
10 out of 10.

675
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,360
I was surprised just because, just because, you know, the old show was, you know, it had

676
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,360
its, its original like, like songs.

677
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,360
And then, you know, to hear these like, I don't, I don't, I think I don't like it that

678
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,360
it's like real world pop songs are what we set the movie to.

679
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
It's like, oh, okay.

680
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,360
No, I think it's good because they're sort of doing this in the style of a musical, right?

681
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Like every time they do a song, it's, it's non-diagetic.

682
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
A musical review.

683
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
Yeah.

684
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,360
And the ponies are always doing like the, the musical actor face where they're smiling,

685
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
they're extremely big during the song.

686
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,360
It's, it's very much like seeing a musical on a stage.

687
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,360
And in that kind of setting, this is the kind of music they would have, which would be like

688
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,360
sort of a, a pop amalgamation.

689
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
True, I suppose.

690
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,360
I liked it a lot because, I mean, it sounds better than just a generic, any given pop

691
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,360
song because of the, the lyrics were like, true.

692
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:29,360
I don't usually pay attention to lyrics and songs, but I really liked, I don't know,

693
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,360
something about the, the arrangement of the words in the music was good.

694
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
And I liked that.

695
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,360
I don't know how to describe it, but I don't know.

696
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,360
How do you just, how do you say lyrics good in a specific way like that?

697
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
You just say lyrics good.

698
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,360
I appreciated the, the syllables, the syllables were replaced excellently.

699
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,360
The phonetics had a flow to them.

700
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Masterful lyricism, poetry, it was poetry in motion.

701
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
It was poetry in audio.

702
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Yeah, like when they said, here's a corn, it's on the cob.

703
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
Here's a bag.

704
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Like that kind of, like when they said that.

705
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,360
I felt like the rub bit was, was lame, but the corn on the cob was perfect.

706
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
I don't remember.

707
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,360
There were some parts in like the Izzy song where they're trying to like learn to be

708
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
unicorns where there was like some awkward rhymes.

709
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
But like, yeah.

710
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
No, no, the rap is good.

711
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,360
It was actually good rap.

712
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,360
This, this movie actually gets some points for not making a cringe rap section.

713
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
Like it actually worked.

714
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,360
I kind of like it a little bit.

715
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,360
It was like only, it was only like 50% cringe instead of 110% cringe.

716
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Like, oh, I was moving.

717
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
No, no, you're right, Tom.

718
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
It was bang.

719
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,360
The last movie I watched was Space Jam, a new legacy.

720
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,360
And they had like a rap in that that was actually like physically destructive.

721
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,360
Like I'm pretty sure I aged 10 years watching.

722
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
You took psychic damage.

723
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Yeah.

724
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Am I, am I crazy?

725
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Has LeBron like ever rapped?

726
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Does he, does he do any, any music?

727
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
He didn't rap in it.

728
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,360
It was like Elmer Fudd who rapped it.

729
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
I don't mean in the movie.

730
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,360
I mean, in general, has he ever done like, like, like a, like a rap album or something

731
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,360
like Pull Day?

732
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Yeah.

733
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
He's been trying to get into it for a few years.

734
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
I thought so.

735
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,360
So I like, like, it wouldn't surprise me too much if there was some of that in the

736
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,360
movie, but if it's bad, it's like, well, that's not good.

737
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,360
It was probably the most painful movie going experience I've ever had in my life was that

738
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
three minutes.

739
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,360
I don't remember what song it was.

740
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,360
I don't even remember what is happening, but there's one song that has like a little,

741
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,360
there's a little aside where just there, they're singing about the adventure that they're

742
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,360
on and the cop pony just like, there's like, if we fail, we'll go to jail.

743
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
And I'm like, prison.

744
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
They'll go to prison.

745
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
He doesn't even rhyme it.

746
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,360
He says if we fail, we're going to prison.

747
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Ben laughed so hard with that part.

748
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Because it's just like, you're going to, you're the one who's going to put us there.

749
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
He loves fucking jail.

750
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,360
The cop.

751
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
What are you talking about?

752
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
So damn much.

753
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
This entire movie.

754
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
He's so fucking into it.

755
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
No, it's good.

756
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
No, it's good.

757
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,360
It's good because otherwise we don't want the kids to forget for a moment that this guy

758
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
is terrible.

759
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
He's a cop.

760
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
He loves, he loves jail.

761
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
No.

762
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,360
That's not even true.

763
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Why is he in on my show?

764
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
Get out.

765
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:17,360
I didn't get the sense that he was like authoritarian with his police chief stuff.

766
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
That's the whole movie.

767
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
He's just supposed to be mildly annoying.

768
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
But like, he's really a good guy.

769
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
He's supposed to be like, oh, I'm your friend.

770
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
But like, I can't.

771
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
That's his whole shtick.

772
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,360
And like, the whole, like the whole rub in the beginning is that, is like, hey, Sonny,

773
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,360
look, I'm your friend, but like, please stop doing illegal things.

774
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,360
It puts me in an awkward position, but he's not like fucking immediately thrown the book

775
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
at her.

776
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Yeah, that's the other guy.

777
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,360
Okay, but the whole reason he's out on the adventure is because like, well, I got to

778
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,360
go and put her in jail because she consorted with some foreigners and that's not cool.

779
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Well, it ends with the kids.

780
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Yeah, because there's like hundreds of years of indoctrination in the culture.

781
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
This is annoying to me.

782
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,760
Like, his whole thing is like, I got to go find, I got to go arrest her.

783
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,760
I guess she might also be in danger, so I guess I'm going to save her from danger.

784
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,760
But like, the point of what I'm doing is I got to go find her and burn her to jail.

785
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Until they get to the campfire and then he turns around.

786
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,760
Yes, but then they, well, but then they, is that, I don't remember a moment where he's

787
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
like, you know what?

788
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
I changed my mind.

789
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Actually, there was a big moment where he literally, is he brings out the letter that

790
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,760
that Sonny and her dad made in the beginning of the movie.

791
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
And she's like, this is why I came in the first place.

792
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Cause I was told I had friends here.

793
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
And like in that moment, he's like, oh, you know what?

794
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
I want to do my part.

795
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm going to help.

796
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,760
This is something, this is actually something that could bring us together and is a good

797
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
thing.

798
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
And that was a good moment.

799
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,760
Oh, yeah.

800
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Okay.

801
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
His police thing was only at the Pegasus area.

802
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
You know what?

803
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Cause they were all in the other room.

804
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Getting another truly at that moment.

805
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
He missed that.

806
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Yeah, genuinely.

807
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
You know why I don't remember that moment?

808
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
The emotional crux of the film.

809
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
He just was powerful.

810
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Okay.

811
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Okay.

812
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,760
I do remember that moment, but what I remember is that I foolishly forgot about the letter.

813
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
I like, it seems obvious.

814
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Oh, that was obvious.

815
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Oh my God, dude.

816
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Come on.

817
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Yeah, but I forgot about the letter.

818
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,760
So when she pulled out the letter, I'm like, oh, I remember that.

819
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
I remember they set that up in the movie.

820
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Oh my God.

821
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,760
The movie got me is like, I forgot about that too.

822
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
And it's so obvious.

823
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Cause I was like, why is he even here in the first place?

824
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,760
And then like, it's so, it's like so blatantly obvious.

825
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
I'm like, oh God, I'm an idiot.

826
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Oh, no.

827
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
He did set it up.

828
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
It does make sense.

829
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
The kids movie bamboozled me.

830
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Okay.

831
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Yeah.

832
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
I was sitting there waiting for her to pull the letter out.

833
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
And then she did.

834
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,760
And Ben was like, oh my God.

835
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
And I was like, man, are you kidding me?

836
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,760
Like this movie, this is a masterpiece.

837
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,760
This is an absolute masterpiece.

838
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
The Citizen Kane.

839
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,760
Did Orson Welles write this movie?

840
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,760
Did Alfred Hitchcock set up the Jeopardy?

841
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,760
I'm on the edge of my seat.

842
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Right, but the cop is bad.

843
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Yeah, no, like towards the end, I was like, well, you know, he turns around and I'm like,

844
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,760
I'm supposed to enjoy this character, but he's not going to stop being a cop.

845
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
I know that's not going to happen.

846
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
So I can't enjoy him.

847
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,760
The movie, I think I did enjoy the movie more as it went on.

848
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
Izzy was cute.

849
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
I like Izzy, frankly.

850
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
I think she's pretty adorable.

851
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Izzy's great.

852
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Sure.

853
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Yeah.

854
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Izzy gang.

855
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Izzy gang is great.

856
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Izzy's good.

857
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
Sonny's good.

858
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
I like Sonny too.

859
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Sonny had the best like fuck your shit face throughout the entire movie.

860
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Like every time something blatantly stupid happens, she's just like Jesus fucking Christ.

861
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
I'm sad with these fucking smooth brains.

862
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
What am I going to do?

863
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Sonny's my favorite for sure.

864
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Sonny is just right 100% of the time, just like me.

865
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,760
And just trying to win everybody over, wake them up.

866
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
It's great.

867
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
It's wonderful.

868
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
Wow.

869
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
What an interesting character.

870
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Just being right the whole time.

871
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,760
I'm trying to like visualize the characters, but I can't help but envision the Gary's Mod

872
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,760
pony models as the characters.

873
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,760
I can't think of what they actually look like.

874
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
I'm seeing Gary's Mod right now.

875
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Oh no.

876
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Oh, it's terrifying.

877
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,760
The designs are pretty good.

878
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Yeah.

879
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Okay.

880
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
I don't like.

881
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
At the end of the day.

882
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
At the end of the day.

883
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Hair cut.

884
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
I don't really like.

885
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
The zip hair cut is.

886
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
The zip hair cut is.

887
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
The zip hair cut.

888
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
The eyebrows.

889
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
The eyebrows are not great.

890
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Everything else is probably as good as they could have done.

891
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
In 3D.

892
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
I don't know.

893
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
I like the eyebrows.

894
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
What's wrong with them?

895
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
You don't like them because.

896
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
It's not that any of the.

897
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Toneys look.

898
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
I don't like candy sometimes.

899
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Particularly bad.

900
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,760
I just, I still don't like the 3D.

901
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,760
It just looks like any other like Dreamworks.

902
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
It is much more generic.

903
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
Production.

904
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
It just has that generic 3D look.

905
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
And like it.

906
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Yeah.

907
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,760
I guess they did it well.

908
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
It looks good, but like I don't like it.

909
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
I don't know.

910
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
I don't think that's a nuanced opinion.

911
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,760
I think you just haven't seen a lot of 3D.

912
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,760
The, it's.

913
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,760
As someone who has seen a lot of 3D.

914
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
It's pretty true.

915
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
It just looks like a lot.

916
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
They have the same eyes.

917
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
They have the big.

918
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Well.

919
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
The same Disney eyes.

920
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
There's.

921
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
I wouldn't go that far.

922
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,760
There is some subtle differentiation in the stylization of this movie.

923
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,760
It just doesn't go nearly as far as like the material that came before it.

924
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
You know?

925
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Because even Sunny's action figures of the main six look much more visually distinct.

926
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
Well.

927
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Than the characters themselves.

928
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
I liked how those looked.

929
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,760
I liked that they were clearly like carved wooden figures.

930
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Yeah.

931
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Who looked like.

932
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
I mean.

933
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,760
I like that Twilight's dead in this movie.

934
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Every time.

935
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Okay.

936
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
I was wondering are like those are.

937
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Those are like real like historical figure.

938
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
Correct.

939
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
It's very.

940
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
The main thing.

941
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
The main thing that did in fact live.

942
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,760
I don't know that they are historical figures.

943
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
I think it's unclear.

944
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Yeah.

945
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Yeah.

946
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
They're in the canon of like her dad's storytelling.

947
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Yeah.

948
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Or are they fictional characters?

949
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
No.

950
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
No.

951
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,760
And in the ruins of the Pegasus city, they have like Twilight's symbol.

952
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
I guess.

953
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
But like I feel like you.

954
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
Okay.

955
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
That still doesn't necessarily confirm.

956
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Yeah.

957
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
That could go.

958
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
I guess it could.

959
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,760
But I felt like the implication was very much that this all happened.

960
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
I thought so too.

961
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,760
I guess the whole story is that like, oh, we all used to live together because of this

962
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
story of Twilight and everybody.

963
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Yeah.

964
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
No.

965
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
It's very funny.

966
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
My understanding was back in the day.

967
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
I agree.

968
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
I think the implication.

969
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I think the implication is that like the, that is, it's just canon that like all the

970
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,760
events of Gen 4 happened at some point in the past.

971
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,120
But like 10,000 years ago, it's like Dark Souls 2 is like there's a whole kingdom built

972
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,000
on top of the old kingdom and all the names are different.

973
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,260
And as everyone's died, you know, a hundred times over, it's been so long, completely

974
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,260
legendary.

975
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
Yeah.

976
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:43,560
But you see, you see, yeah, there's a bunch of things that have Twilight's cutie mark

977
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
on it.

978
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,200
It has like a necklace with it on it.

979
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,880
You see it in the stained glass window.

980
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,760
You also see Rarity's cutie mark, like Rarity's jewel, cutie mark shows up in the, in the

981
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
same window.

982
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Okay.

983
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,400
But let's think about this.

984
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,120
Why would Rarity's cutie mark be in the window?

985
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,240
Is it more likely that?

986
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,560
Because she's one of the, because she's like a fucking, a mortal from like a brief moment

987
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,800
in time versus someone like Twilight who would have lived a long time.

988
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,000
And we know the window's not that old, right?

989
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,400
Because this is in a station where they used to all meet up, used to all come up and shit,

990
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,760
but like it's, you know, it's fairly recent.

991
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
It's not ancient.

992
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Yeah.

993
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Yeah.

994
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,720
When they talk about it, it sounds like, it sounds like, oh yeah, the pony races used

995
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,240
to get along like, like 20 years ago.

996
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
Yeah.

997
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,240
It's like within, within a hundred or 200 years, it's not thousands of years.

998
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,280
It's supposed to be a couple hundred years ago, right?

999
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
That's how long it's been.

1000
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
I don't remember.

1001
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
I don't think that.

1002
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,480
They don't say in the movie, but I thought like bleeding up trillion years ago, it was

1003
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,720
supposed to be only a couple hundred years ago, which really begs the question to me,

1004
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,440
why even bother tying these two together in the first place?

1005
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,680
It seems like it would have been much easier if this was just a hard break and a new canon.

1006
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
Well, that's what I'm saying.

1007
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,560
I don't think they're really that tied together.

1008
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,320
It's more like these are the figures that her dad carved.

1009
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,760
He pulls in the symbology, you know, from, from the real world, but that doesn't mean

1010
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,480
that those characters were real.

1011
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
I don't know, Tom.

1012
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,440
I really like, I like the idea that, you know, Twilight brought friendship to the land and

1013
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,520
then somewhere along the line, she fucked up and it all got ruined and she fucking died.

1014
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,960
And that's kind of like clearly.

1015
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,120
She would still be alive if she hadn't fucked up and ruined.

1016
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
Yeah.

1017
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,760
And that's why she's dead.

1018
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,840
A minor, like a much less extreme version of like when people complained about like

1019
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Star Wars and stuff.

1020
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,680
It's like, oh, well, by continuing it and showing how everything immediately went back

1021
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,400
to shit, it kind of like rubs the previous series of like it's victory, I guess, you

1022
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,880
know, and this kind of does the same thing, but to a much lesser degree and to a degree

1023
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,360
that bothers me far less as well.

1024
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:57,160
It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't impune the old story too much to be like, well, yeah,

1025
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
that was great.

1026
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,400
You know, eventually, you know, hundreds of thousands of years later, eventually things

1027
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
did go back to shit.

1028
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,480
I don't think it was that long.

1029
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
That was the whole thing.

1030
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,480
I seem to call an artist on Twitter drawing something about this particular conundrum,

1031
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,600
which was very effective.

1032
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
I think his name is Ben St.

1033
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,280
What are you talking about?

1034
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
What did I do?

1035
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
I don't even remember.

1036
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:29,680
The tweet, the Trump tweet with Twilight, with Phantom Horn going to the Trump rally.

1037
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
To the rally.

1038
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Yeah.

1039
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,600
Well, that was in response to this whole thing.

1040
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,800
Of how we were dunking on the fact that Twilight fucked up, which was hilarious.

1041
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,640
And then a bunch of people took it literally.

1042
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,640
How do you not remember this?

1043
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,960
Are you that fucking on over right now?

1044
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,880
I remember drawing that image, but I don't, I feel like you're interpreting like a weird

1045
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
intent behind it.

1046
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,240
That was literally the point.

1047
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,320
We were having a discussion about it on Twitter when you drew it.

1048
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
What?

1049
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
Where?

1050
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,840
How long ago was this?

1051
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
This is like a year ago.

1052
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
No, like a year ago.

1053
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Six months ago.

1054
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Six months ago.

1055
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,960
Because this was, this was after the, the riot, the Capitol riot, and I was like, yeah, Phantom

1056
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
would have been at that.

1057
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,600
No, that is not what this was about at all.

1058
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,280
This was about when we were talking about how in this, like we were talking about how

1059
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,960
the, when the summary of the movie came out and it was like, oh, Twilight fucked up.

1060
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,880
And you drew that fucking drawing because.

1061
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,880
What, what drawing?

1062
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,800
The drawing of Phantom Horn at the, at the, at the Twilight rally.

1063
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
How do you not remember this?

1064
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,200
Like you got dragged on Twitter for it later because like a bunch of people started dogpiling

1065
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
before it.

1066
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,000
It's not, it's not a, wait, it's not a Twilight route.

1067
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
No, it is.

1068
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah it is.

1069
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Okay.

1070
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,360
I think you're reading it because I don't, it didn't have anything to do with the movie.

1071
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
We had a discussion about it on Twitter.

1072
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
It didn't have anything to do with the movie.

1073
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Oh my God.

1074
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Okay, you're wrong.

1075
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,320
It was just a political thing happened and I was like, yeah, Phantom is, is kind of

1076
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,920
like that or he was kind of like that.

1077
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
I'm really wrong.

1078
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
I'm totally wrong.

1079
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
What do you mean, what do you mean, no?

1080
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
I'm telling you what my ethoreal intent was.

1081
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,920
Because you didn't even remember you drew it five minutes ago.

1082
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,200
No, I don't think so.

1083
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,760
No, I don't think that's what you meant.

1084
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Okay.

1085
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,160
We had a discussion on Twitter about this, but okay, sure.

1086
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
All right.

1087
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,560
I don't, I never have a discussion on Twitter.

1088
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
I know.

1089
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
Oh my God.

1090
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
I don't do that.

1091
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,080
When I say discussion, I mean like two tweets back and forth because that's how long a discussion

1092
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,680
on Twitter should last.

1093
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:14,400
I like to think that Twilight was mid-flight and then she fucked something up and the power

1094
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,200
of friendship was gone, so she lost her flight powers in the fall because she was mid-flight

1095
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,760
and the fall was so deadly that it fucking broke her, her, her alicorn immortality and

1096
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
she died anyway.

1097
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,480
And that's why she's not here anymore.

1098
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,680
Like her bones got, all her bones got broken and the magic was not enough.

1099
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,520
Her immortality was not enough to save her.

1100
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,480
Her bones are too fucking broken.

1101
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Damn.

1102
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Yeah.

1103
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:47,120
The, the window, I thought for a second that the window showed Twilight, but no, I think

1104
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,000
it's just a bunch of other purple, purple ponies, just like creating the crystals.

1105
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah, I mean, I think they're keeping it vague because they probably don't even know what

1106
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,280
they're going to do with it long-term anyways, if anything.

1107
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,320
Why are, okay, question.

1108
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:05,160
Why are there three crystals that, if taken apart from each other, make ponies not have

1109
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
magic anymore?

1110
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
Well, that's, I think.

1111
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,160
Well, that's, I think.

1112
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
Because this is a child's movie.

1113
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
Okay.

1114
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
Well, yeah.

1115
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
That's literally it.

1116
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,660
Our job is to go over all of the fine-tune comb.

1117
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,920
Why did the ponies make these three things?

1118
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,640
Why did the ponies make these three crystals that, if separated, would render them all

1119
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
useless?

1120
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
Because it's a child's movie, Ben.

1121
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
Hmm.

1122
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
That's not exactly.

1123
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
Well, well, hold on.

1124
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
So, bringing the crystals.

1125
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
The crystals are always done.

1126
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,640
Yeah.

1127
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
The original show is just like, oh.

1128
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
The elements of.

1129
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,400
The elements of harmony give you superpowers if you have them.

1130
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Yeah.

1131
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,920
These are like, these don't give you anything.

1132
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,280
They just, if you separate them, your entire species loses their whole fucking thing and

1133
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
you have become like a bunch of.

1134
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Well, by the end of the movie.

1135
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,280
I don't know whether it means that.

1136
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,440
I think what, I mean, they're obviously just MacGuffins, but the reason that you put them

1137
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,240
together and nothing happens, but then when you show them that you're truly committed to

1138
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,240
being friends with everyone, then they wake up and they do something.

1139
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,240
I feel like friendship, like, is more important than the crystals.

1140
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,680
I don't think, like, if you put the crystals, you just took them.

1141
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,000
People wouldn't stop being friends suddenly.

1142
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,720
I think the friendship eroded and that's why the crystals are separate, you know, lost

1143
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720
their magic.

1144
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
Yeah.

1145
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,440
They're vague enough with like the lore that they can flesh all that out later if they

1146
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
want to.

1147
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,400
They just don't think they need to even bother because, like, they've established their cast.

1148
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,600
They can go off and have their little half hour adventures going forward.

1149
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,760
That's always been the best part of the last show.

1150
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,120
I'm sure it'll be the best part of this show is just the character interaction.

1151
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,880
Speaking of having your little adventures going forward, what's the deal with Sonny?

1152
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,080
What is Sonny now?

1153
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
She's an alchor.

1154
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
Oh, yeah.

1155
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
Obviously.

1156
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Is she permanent?

1157
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,080
Is she permanently magical?

1158
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,080
They didn't even have the decency to wait three seasons.

1159
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,080
Greedy bastards.

1160
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,080
When that happens, does she permanently just have glowing wings and a horn now?

1161
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
I would assume.

1162
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Yes.

1163
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,080
That only happens when you have toys with it.

1164
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,080
So like they have.

1165
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,080
Okay.

1166
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,080
That's what I was saying.

1167
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,600
When that happened, I looked at her and I was like, I know exactly what the toys going

1168
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,000
to look like and what plastic they're going to make the wings and horn out of like when

1169
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
she appeared.

1170
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,640
They're going to use that clear plastic with the sparkles in it.

1171
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,640
That's what they're going to do.

1172
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Sure.

1173
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
Toys.

1174
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Toys is toys.

1175
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,640
But that's fine.

1176
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,640
Toys is toys.

1177
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
That's fine.

1178
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
I'll give you a toy.

1179
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,640
Give me a toy.

1180
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,560
I feel like they made the design like that in the movie sort of look temporary.

1181
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,960
Like it's glowing and it's magic and it's not really actually a physical thing.

1182
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
It looks like it's going to fade away.

1183
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,120
I was kind of hoping they would flick her back out and this would be like, oh, this is like

1184
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,640
your fucking elements of harmony, MacGuffin mode.

1185
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,640
Yeah.

1186
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,600
Maybe they needed to do that to sell a toy or whatever they say.

1187
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,320
Just don't show it disappearing.

1188
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
You can't do that.

1189
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,960
We need people to want that.

1190
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,960
Yeah.

1191
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
People need to want to buy that.

1192
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,040
They need to have the super form of Sunny.

1193
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,040
It seems like, yeah, this is like a thing that's like when there's a problem and you

1194
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,960
harness the magic of friendship to defeat an enemy.

1195
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,480
We got a call for friendship.

1196
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,520
This is her super form that she gets to do the, it's like summoning the Megazord.

1197
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Sunny went super sane.

1198
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,520
Yes.

1199
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,000
When you get the crystals together and you go friendship-powered, you get the gun and

1200
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,280
you can shoot people and kill them.

1201
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,640
It's like, okay, unicorns get their magic back.

1202
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,240
Pegasi can fly again.

1203
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,440
Earth ponies, they're like, hey, I found a gun.

1204
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,440
Blam, blam, blam.

1205
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,440
And that's what you get.

1206
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,200
I mean, they honestly seem to be like inventors, they can make machines.

1207
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,920
I was hoping that one of the things they would do is like give earth ponies something to

1208
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,920
fucking do.

1209
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,320
They don't get anything.

1210
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,040
They had this whole thing going throughout the entire movie of Hitch having some strange

1211
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,360
connection to nature.

1212
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,840
All the animals just loved him.

1213
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,840
I also didn't notice this.

1214
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,680
Are they trying to set up something with earth pony magic?

1215
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:05,920
They also had little hints of unicorn magic coming back because Izzy kept being able to

1216
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,960
see people's ores and shit.

1217
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,600
I thought those were all just breadcrumbs leading up to all of them getting their own

1218
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,920
kind of magic, but earth ponies just get nothing, as usually.

1219
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,640
Well, we don't know that because the movie ends, but they do show a small thing where

1220
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:28,600
a bunch of ponies are one of each fillies that are like, we're playing and we're running.

1221
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,280
Don't use magic now, we're going to race.

1222
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,720
And then the earth ponies' hoof prints leave behind some sort of weird magic something

1223
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,160
or other that sort of makes the grass glow when I assume that's like, oh, growing power.

1224
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,520
That looked like shit.

1225
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,080
That effect looked so bad.

1226
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,040
It's not the last thing that happens in the movie.

1227
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
It is the last grass.

1228
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,040
Yes.

1229
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,120
Yeah, no, me and Ben sat there and we were like, why does it look like shit?

1230
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,640
We were just both struck by how bad it looked visually.

1231
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,440
Okay, Izzy, she keeps bringing up, she talks about people's sparkles.

1232
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,240
She says, my sparkle is bright or something, and she says, oh, your sparkle is tur- that's

1233
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,600
just a weird Izzy or a reader thing.

1234
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,760
I thought that was leading to something, but I think it was leading to literally nothing.

1235
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:23,360
No, I think it was just trying to intro that the unicorns are like kind of hippy, superstitious,

1236
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
you know.

1237
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,360
I guess.

1238
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
It makes sense.

1239
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,640
They lay it on pretty thick once they get there.

1240
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,520
They didn't need any lead up to it.

1241
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,400
And like, I guess my question, why is Izzy the only one who's not like emotionally destitute?

1242
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,120
Like I get, like she's so far beyond broken that she's just, she's looped back around.

1243
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,120
That's what she's doing.

1244
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,120
I mean, she's like Pinkie Pie on the farm.

1245
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,120
That's what it's like.

1246
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
Yeah, yeah.

1247
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,120
It's the same.

1248
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,120
I guess.

1249
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,120
And she is the Pinkie Pie clone.

1250
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,120
But that never really made much sense to you there.

1251
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,120
We have a clone for all the main six basically, except for Fluttershy, I think.

1252
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Good.

1253
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,120
I mean.

1254
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,120
Well, I guess here is Fluttershy.

1255
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,800
There's like a parallel to each person, to each pony.

1256
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,640
Yeah, it's not exactly the same, but I guess it's good.

1257
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,440
The dynamics aren't identical, which I think is a very similar archetype.

1258
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,000
Like Pip isn't really a rarity.

1259
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,760
She is vain, but I guess it's sort of a little different.

1260
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,920
She's modern vain instead of classically vain.

1261
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,760
Yeah, she's on her phone.

1262
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
An H phone.

1263
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
She's a zoomer.

1264
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,760
She's a zoomer.

1265
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,760
She's got a P phone.

1266
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:29,840
Do you remember when it like, like it cuts back to like Maritai Bay and then when we go

1267
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:35,440
back to like the Pegasus City, it just like shows an ad for perfume on the billboard.

1268
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,440
And then that's it.

1269
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,360
And then it just goes to something completely unrelated.

1270
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,600
And I'm like, what was, are they just, are they just going to actually sell that perfume

1271
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
in real life?

1272
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,120
Like they just show an ad.

1273
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:53,520
That's just to be like, oh, this is a real, this character is a real advertising consumerist

1274
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,600
icon.

1275
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,760
And this is what Pegasus City is like.

1276
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,760
I guess it was just framed here.

1277
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
It's all about those billboards.

1278
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,800
Pegasus City says a lot about our society because the Pegasus I live, they clear, they

1279
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,840
clearly live under late capitalism and also like, and the magic is dead.

1280
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,640
Magic is gone in this, in this consumer society that they're relatable.

1281
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,280
And I just think that that is like me too, you know, me as well.

1282
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,280
We've all been there.

1283
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,320
I mean, yeah, no, the earth ponies are too.

1284
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,960
They have their, they have their stupid like Silicon Valley tech demo.

1285
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,960
They do.

1286
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,960
Yeah.

1287
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,960
They have Steve Jobs.

1288
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
What's, yeah.

1289
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,480
What's her name is like, she's like, she's like Steve Jobs, like Elon Musk or Earth Pony.

1290
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,480
Yes.

1291
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,520
There's, there's something, look at, I made a, I made a stupid, I made a stupid hyperloop

1292
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,960
that will help you like run away from unicorns faster or something.

1293
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,320
There's something kind of related to that, that I wanted to talk about.

1294
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:56,280
And I want to know if any of you guys noticed this, which is that throughout this movie,

1295
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:01,800
like if there's ever, there's a lot of like character talking to crowd scenes.

1296
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:07,080
And whenever that happens, the, the opinion of the crowd will just immediately shift based

1297
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:12,600
on who is talking as in like one character will make their point and the entire crowd

1298
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
will be swayed.

1299
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,920
And then another character will say a thing and once again, the entire crowd will like

1300
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,280
change their mind immediately and then just go back and forth and it happens every time

1301
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,160
reactions though, like in most, in most all ages media, the crowds are pretty easily swayed,

1302
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,160
just like real life.

1303
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,160
Correct.

1304
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,480
I just thought that that was funny and interesting.

1305
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,480
Yeah.

1306
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:39,480
It's, it's, it's, I mean, it's really awkward, the, like the, the, the beginning when, uh,

1307
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,320
when Sunny like, I guess she's doing like a protest thing at like the, the, the, the,

1308
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,640
the tech demo demonstration.

1309
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,120
And it's like, they, it's like.

1310
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:58,600
It was very strange to say, hey, don't do it before I have this plan this time, dad,

1311
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:04,280
I'm going to be a smart, uh, pony and then she's like, walks up on stage and just like,

1312
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,600
hey, stop her to do it, hitch, like, no, she's going to do it.

1313
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,080
And he's like, Hey, don't do that thing that you always do.

1314
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,720
And she's like, I won't, but then she does it.

1315
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,480
But, uh, I think she just walks on stage and every year because he's like, that was

1316
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,480
what he said.

1317
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,600
He was like, Hey, every year I stopped you from doing this.

1318
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,640
So like, just don't even bother this time.

1319
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,600
But this is not even that disruptive.

1320
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,960
She's not even that disruptive.

1321
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,600
Like the, the, the demonstration just goes ahead with her in, in the, the boots or whatever.

1322
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Yeah.

1323
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,080
And it's like, it's so, it's so, it's so, I find it weird that those wings and boots

1324
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,000
didn't come back in any way.

1325
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,880
Well the, the, the balloon, the, the pony, uh, that like get blown away out the window

1326
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,600
and balloons keep showing up.

1327
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,880
Like, yeah, that's, that's, that's a running gag, gag thing.

1328
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,880
But like, um, you know, they got the slime ball throwing things.

1329
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,720
That's just, I mean, that does come, yeah, that comes back in, but the, the, the, the

1330
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,800
like anti-pegasus grab me boots don't do anything.

1331
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,360
And the like metal wings, which I'm not even sure what they're supposed to do.

1332
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,320
Well, I mean, they can't even fly up until the end of the movie.

1333
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,680
So they would have been ineffective anyway, as I suppose, I guess.

1334
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,200
Yeah.

1335
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,320
I just felt like, I mean, I felt like those wings were like an opportunity to

1336
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,440
like get the fuck out of there.

1337
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,600
Oh, we got to run away.

1338
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:20,800
Yeah.

1339
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah.

1340
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,040
But I mean, although these fucking wings, it's supposed to be the future

1341
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,760
technology coming out of care logic.

1342
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,120
So that stuff is not like widely available yet.

1343
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,600
Although the, the little anti-brain read hats apparently somehow got manufactured.

1344
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,880
Well, it took over manufacturing.

1345
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,840
Oh, I really liked, um, the fucking in that scene where they're like, Oh God,

1346
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,760
we got to stop the computer presses the one button repeatedly.

1347
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,320
Yes, I like that.

1348
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:55,160
They had, um, they had a, it was just like in the old, in gen four, um, daring.

1349
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,200
What's, what's the woman who writes the daring do novels?

1350
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,120
A.K.

1351
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,720
Yerling.

1352
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,000
Oh boy.

1353
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,600
Yes.

1354
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,360
Wow.

1355
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:02,880
A.K.

1356
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,080
Yerling.

1357
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:03,240
Yeah.

1358
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,480
She, she has the, the keyboard, but her keyboard is just like two big buttons.

1359
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,640
They have the, they have the same, like just two big buttons as their keyboard.

1360
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,320
I mean, what else are they going to do?

1361
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,360
You have to click it like 14 times for K.

1362
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,400
They do it in Morse code.

1363
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,800
It's Morse code, basically.

1364
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,880
It's like dashes and dots.

1365
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,240
They're running language is just Morse code.

1366
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,360
I mean, we, it's only scribbles, so we never see actual real writing, I guess.

1367
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,560
But we do, so you do see real writing in, in the, in the movie, though.

1368
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,480
We do.

1369
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,760
So, but they didn't, they weren't typing anything.

1370
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,640
They have smart voice dictation.

1371
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,240
They can just be like, Hey, Siri, I just turned on all your phones.

1372
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:41,800
Yeah.

1373
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,040
Wait, why, why do they have a smartphone that looks like that?

1374
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,560
When they have hooves that press the entire screen at once.

1375
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:47,720
Yeah.

1376
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:47,960
Right.

1377
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,720
Well, I mean, their hooves do some magical things throughout the whole movie.

1378
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,560
They're in the future.

1379
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,480
I guess I could use their nose.

1380
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,760
There's no longer like distinct actions that you have to press on the phone.

1381
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,440
You just press the screen to interact.

1382
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,720
Just press screen, interact.

1383
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,320
Ooh, get my interactions.

1384
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,080
Whoo.

1385
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,960
Yeah, it's just, it's just, you could go live or you could buy

1386
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,560
like a new fucking crystals for your, just press the screen.

1387
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,360
A cow clicker.

1388
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,000
I like how they like, they put enough design sense to like have like a little

1389
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,600
like a slot on the back of all the screens, like for like hooves.

1390
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,040
It's like a reverse pop socket kind of thing.

1391
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:22,680
Yeah.

1392
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,040
Well, what is a slot on the back of all the screens?

1393
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,320
Yeah, there's a slight event where all the phones and tablets have a

1394
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,240
little slot on the back that your hoof goes into so it doesn't fall off.

1395
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,000
And I'm just like, it's funny that they do that for like that one object,

1396
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,960
but then like the rest of the objects functionality completely falls apart.

1397
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,920
Well, yeah, because if you rewatch the beginning, you know,

1398
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,920
Sonny is on her roller blades, right?

1399
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,280
Oh, right.

1400
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,920
The roller blade just attaches to the back of the truck, that trolley car or whatever.

1401
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,640
And she's just touching a wheel to it.

1402
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,680
And she's somehow being pulled.

1403
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,960
It was, it was, I think it was so drawing because that was like dead center

1404
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,440
in the frame and it's just like, you can't miss this little like, yep.

1405
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,400
We're not going to explain how this works.

1406
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,280
Don't worry about it.

1407
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,200
No, I prefer that.

1408
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,720
I like when objects just stick to the ponies who?

1409
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,520
Yeah, I think it's hilarious.

1410
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,360
I was like, when, when Izzy puts on her glasses and she like flips the glasses

1411
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,480
on the glass like the edge of the glasses, she's holding like slides up her

1412
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,440
hoof as it goes on to her head.

1413
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,680
And I'm just like, I don't know how that works.

1414
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,480
But yeah, you know, it's awesome.

1415
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,520
Friendship is magic.

1416
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,520
I love it. Yeah.

1417
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,280
Friendship is magic.

1418
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,720
And that's why I can hitch to this.

1419
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,680
Yeah, yeah, you know, was it a truck or something?

1420
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,800
The magic of friendship keeps the magic of friendship and let me hitch a ride.

1421
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,720
Sure. Why not?

1422
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,120
This might be a this might be a CinemaSins ding moment.

1423
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:47,400
And it would be if it didn't go on for so long and bother me so much

1424
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,960
because like just because it went on for like 15 minutes straight,

1425
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,280
which is the scene towards the beginning of the movie where Izzy shows up

1426
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,840
and all of the all of the earth ponies are running away, screaming

1427
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,200
and they do the joke that's like Izzy is clearly just standing there,

1428
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,920
going like hello and like everyone which basically like their their senses go.

1429
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,600
They can no longer see or hear or think.

1430
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,200
Yeah. Thoughts like it's like if you were using your eyes slash ears,

1431
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,120
you would see what's in front of you, which is just someone going hello.

1432
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,680
And they run away screaming.

1433
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,960
And if they did that joke one time, I get it.

1434
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,120
Like I get that joke is like a common trope.

1435
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,400
Yeah, but it goes on for actually 15 minutes happening.

1436
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,720
And so I was like that scene was like the whole start of the movie.

1437
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,920
And yeah, it got a little it got a little obnoxious.

1438
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,800
But like you're supposed to be you're supposed to be a little kid in the theater.

1439
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,520
And you're supposed to see that and be like, wow,

1440
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,920
all these ponies sure are foolish for being racist.

1441
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,560
If it were me, I would just be normal.

1442
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:52,320
I would say I would say I would say I would say I would simply accept the foreigner.

1443
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,400
I would simply accept the harmless foreigner into my side, but whatever, you know,

1444
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,720
do we think that the racism allegory works in this movie?

1445
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,400
I mean, my answer is I don't know.

1446
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,920
I guess like it's like probably probably I'm going to say I could tell

1447
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,680
I could tell what they were going for deep into the into the G four thing,

1448
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,080
as we all were as someone who is deeply racist myself.

1449
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,040
I guess I did not see myself reflected in the in the politics of this movie.

1450
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,000
It's just like a lot of the like questions

1451
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,640
like the fan theorizing or just like speculation, like half for the lulls was

1452
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,560
just like, like, why why are all these people equal when earth ponies are clearly

1453
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,000
like at a disadvantage, you know, like that was kind of like the question

1454
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,080
you'd ask watching G four, like everyone's just friends.

1455
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,560
But like, you know, like, wouldn't there be some like tension of like, man,

1456
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:46,360
you can do magic and I just dig in the dirt and like just ask as a joke, you know.

1457
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,440
But like it was the point of the show was like they kind of transcended those kind of things.

1458
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,800
And so like it almost feels like going back and being like, hey,

1459
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,480
everyone's divided into it.

1460
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,560
It feels like the more obvious take with with this kind of setting.

1461
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,440
So like it felt almost like a step backwards, I guess.

1462
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,760
But the reason the whole point is like we're getting back to that point already.

1463
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,600
Like that's the whole point of this movie is to get us back to status quo.

1464
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,560
So like I was kind of not invested in any of that because like all this world

1465
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,840
building is like going to be irrelevant by the end of the movie anyways.

1466
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:23,200
I mean, I guess the show then will be about them like learning to live together

1467
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,360
and get along as now that they've they've been separated for.

1468
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,400
Will they?

1469
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,440
I'm not sure if I guess I wonder if she's going to go back to status quo.

1470
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,280
I don't know if we know this.

1471
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,760
I would assume so.

1472
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,600
I mean, this this movie is like this is like the setup.

1473
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,160
This is like the pilot for the new show.

1474
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,200
Is the show going to look like that?

1475
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,960
I don't think it'll look good.

1476
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,640
Well, it's not going to be as high effort.

1477
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,480
But is it going to be the same aesthetic?

1478
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,400
In the same way?

1479
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,000
I believe so.

1480
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yeah, I don't I don't know if it's been 100 percent confirmed,

1481
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,560
but I felt like it's a fair assumption thing with the with with the stuff

1482
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,800
with everybody screaming was actually pretty good.

1483
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,280
I didn't feel like anything was like bad with the I felt like it went on.

1484
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,760
I mean, maybe I was like the screaming the screaming was happening.

1485
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,480
But like the stuff.

1486
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,960
I was getting a little annoyed.

1487
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,480
I was getting the stuff was like, you know,

1488
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,640
it's first Izzy is there and then Sonny sees Izzy.

1489
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,120
She realizes that Izzy is not dangerous

1490
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,920
when other people still continue to not realize that then people have to go after them.

1491
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,520
She protects her and then she gets captured.

1492
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,880
Izzy gets captured and then she decides to free her,

1493
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,200
thus becoming a criminal.

1494
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,880
All these different things happen.

1495
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,040
Meanwhile, everyone's doing the screaming thing.

1496
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,400
So I guess it does go on for a while.

1497
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,360
But like the stuff that's happening, I feel like the pacing was quite good.

1498
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,520
No, I agree. I think it was and and you know,

1499
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,960
you imagine this is a society where all these earth ponies have spent

1500
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,320
their entire lives being indoctrinated into the fear of these these terrible

1501
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:01,080
creatures that can fry your brain with with, you know, nary a thought with.

1502
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,800
Oh, yeah. Of course, they're scared.

1503
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,000
You know, that's the idea.

1504
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,080
They're supposed to be senseless.

1505
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,360
And they sort of they tie that in again, right?

1506
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,040
With the angry mob song where it's like, don't use your brain.

1507
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,000
Just follow me brainlessly.

1508
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,480
Right. If you use your brain, the unicorn can fry it.

1509
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,960
Yeah.

1510
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,640
Leave your brain at home so they can't get it.

1511
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,120
It's the only way.

1512
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,480
Yeah, I try to go a little bit.

1513
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,640
I know that's what they were going for.

1514
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,120
I think it was good. Yeah.

1515
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,880
Also, I wanted to mention the reason in in Gen four

1516
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,800
that that question of like who's actually why they friends is was funny

1517
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,680
because of the fact that there were certain animals that they had

1518
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,240
as livestock, but could also talk to cows.

1519
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,400
Yeah.

1520
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,600
But then other animals that they could talk to were not livestock.

1521
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,960
And what do they all think about that?

1522
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,600
What are they?

1523
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,760
And then some livestock they can't talk to is like, OK.

1524
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,720
OK. It's funny.

1525
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,640
It's it was funny in the movie.

1526
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,280
All right. I guess there was a thing where like Hitch is like has animal empathy

1527
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,360
skills and like I just totally missed it and I didn't I didn't even notice.

1528
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,960
No, I thought that was quite clever.

1529
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,360
He just they kept bringing that back because he's got like the two birds

1530
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,480
in the crab at the beginning.

1531
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,960
Yeah, just little critters inexplicably love them.

1532
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,880
That's all. Yeah.

1533
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,440
And he's like kind of an enemy dog becomes the friendly dog.

1534
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,680
It's like, yeah, the enemy, the enemy dog.

1535
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,480
Toby Fox, Toby Fox, I thought Toby Fox, it was Toby Fox.

1536
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,520
I'm not sure if that's like if that's supposed to be an earth pony magic thing.

1537
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,000
But no, I thought it was weird.

1538
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,760
I think it was just a hitch thing.

1539
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,520
Yeah, you can't use the Fluttershy.

1540
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,320
He's what Fluttershy was a cop.

1541
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,320
Yeah.

1542
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,560
The the yellow.

1543
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,800
It's funny how like this, you know, they don't get any magic.

1544
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,480
You know, when magic is restored, it's like Pegasus I can fly unicorn

1545
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,680
skinny magic and it's like it's they say it a couple times at first.

1546
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,960
Sunny is says it.

1547
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,480
It's like, oh, wow, wouldn't it be great to have a friend who was magic

1548
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,920
to have a friend that can fly?

1549
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,240
Yeah, it's like it's like what earth ponies get by restoring that?

1550
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,480
They don't get anything themselves.

1551
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,280
But what they get is the blessing of like they know they can have friends

1552
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,800
who have power. Sunny knew the whole time

1553
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,080
that if she could con the earth ponies and to bring back the magic,

1554
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,680
she would get both.

1555
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,800
That's why she was on board from the beginning.

1556
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,960
I mean, they they they allude to it right away.

1557
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,280
Right. She breaks into a counter logic.

1558
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,840
They throw the the wings and the horn on her.

1559
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,520
Yeah. Oh, my God, they do.

1560
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,560
Oh, my God.

1561
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,360
She was like, yeah, foreshadowing foreshadowing.

1562
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,160
It's not. I noticed that on my second rewatch or my first,

1563
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,920
I guess that's the first kind of interesting, I suppose.

1564
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,480
That's a bit that's a bit of a dramatic irony.

1565
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,000
Dude, it's like they set things up cleverly.

1566
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,000
Oh, my God. And oh, my God, the letter.

1567
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,600
Oh, my God, she found the letter.

1568
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,360
True. You know, I'm pretty good.

1569
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,480
All right, movie, you got me.

1570
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,680
You got you got me. It's a 10 now.

1571
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,160
It is my story.

1572
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,840
My score is steadily rising on my I am I.

1573
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,080
Yeah, it was just it was just good.

1574
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:14,120
I found myself just smiling, smiling just like, you know what?

1575
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,800
This is a fucking this is a good time.

1576
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,800
Oh, the conversation is silly.

1577
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,680
This is dumb. This is fun.

1578
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,480
When she sits down at the bar

1579
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,280
and she's talking to the the unicorn bartender.

1580
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,120
Yes, I just like my favorite design.

1581
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,000
But I remember thinking that it was very funny.

1582
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,960
Their dialogue was pretty. It was good.

1583
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,520
You know, like is when the bartender is like, you know,

1584
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,600
it's big talk for a little pony and she's like,

1585
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,880
I think you'll find I'm average, right?

1586
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,840
Like, that's funny. Yeah.

1587
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,440
That got that got a laugh out of me.

1588
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,800
I like that guy. I like that they do DDR.

1589
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,120
It is very much like they're going to do it.

1590
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,040
And it's going to be like, oh, she's going to get her ass kicked.

1591
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,880
And then she's going to win the third round, maybe.

1592
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,120
OK, OK. And she well, I it's funny that they do DDR.

1593
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,400
But I it sucked a little bit

1594
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,360
because like she doesn't win by any like clever scheme.

1595
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,240
She doesn't. There's no.

1596
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,840
She just kind of gets the hang of it.

1597
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,880
It's like, it's like, why does why does she?

1598
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,760
OK, she she enters into this bet

1599
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,560
that she has like no hope of winning.

1600
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,200
But then she just she just happens to be really good at it.

1601
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,600
To be fair, she enters into the bag under the assumption

1602
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,800
she's going to solve the Rubik's cube.

1603
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,000
And she's like, I know how to solve Rubik's cubes.

1604
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,440
Really good guys. Don't worry.

1605
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,040
I mean, first of all, first of all, it's totally unfair for him to be like,

1606
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,680
no, no, no, no, actually, we're going to do a different.

1607
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,160
It is unfair. And what you challenged me for.

1608
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,880
No, I should have an option to dip out at that point.

1609
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,720
But yeah. And then there's like, and it's like, OK,

1610
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,280
well, actually, we're going to do DDR.

1611
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,880
And actually, you only have to beat me one time out of three

1612
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,000
just because it's I don't know.

1613
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,160
It just felt like no, I don't even have to work, but it's totally arbitrary.

1614
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,720
I thought the guy was characterized beforehand.

1615
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,640
It's pretty poisonous and sure of himself.

1616
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,120
They should have set something up with with with either

1617
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,440
her wanting to be good at dancing, but not being very good.

1618
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,680
Yeah, I can't dance or the earth ponies just have happy feet.

1619
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,920
That would have been cool.

1620
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,960
That's the end scene.

1621
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,920
I mean, I have a happy, glowy feet and that's how she won.

1622
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,480
Well, I thought I thought.

1623
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,560
Yeah, if she just happens, I thought Zip was going to come in and win it

1624
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,200
because like Zip was like seeing was like being characterized in the background

1625
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,920
as like being like competent at that.

1626
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,080
And I thought she was going to jump in and like win.

1627
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,720
I feel like it didn't do anything.

1628
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,720
I feel like it came out of thinking like, what was Zip even here for?

1629
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,040
I mean, Zip was like the info dump about the station, I guess.

1630
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,280
I just have no, I have no impression at all of Zip as a character.

1631
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,200
She's the rainbow dash lookalike with the like, like,

1632
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,320
but like she's studious.

1633
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,120
I guess she's smart.

1634
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:45,720
I'm you, I'm you, but I like she's, but she's not even insane.

1635
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,240
That's the thing.

1636
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,720
She doesn't have like a weird, not.

1637
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,640
Not even insane need to be slightly insane to be funny and cool.

1638
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,800
Twilight was completely insane.

1639
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:02,240
But Zip is like rainbow dash, but without the, you know, the the the radical.

1640
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:08,000
She didn't have this is not real anxiety that she's she's not like she's not like

1641
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,840
athletic, she's not like strong or anything.

1642
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,160
She's just kind of there.

1643
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,400
Well, she could be.

1644
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,800
We just didn't really see any example of that in the film.

1645
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,360
She didn't she didn't do anything.

1646
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,320
She didn't do anything.

1647
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,600
And Pip, all Pip does is be obnoxious and be on her phone.

1648
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,760
I kind of be on your phone.

1649
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,320
I kind of be on your phone.

1650
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,640
The worst I like Sony and I like the Instagram pony.

1651
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:28,680
I don't care.

1652
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,160
Sonny and Izzy are the only important ones.

1653
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,480
Also, they're gay, by the way.

1654
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,360
They're they're gay.

1655
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,320
Sonny and Izzy are gay.

1656
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,240
I would I would say that's probably true.

1657
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,400
All right, print it.

1658
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,440
I would say that that's canon.

1659
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,840
That's it.

1660
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,400
So who's best pony and why is it Izzy?

1661
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,280
Because she's so cute.

1662
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,200
I mean, it's I mean, it's got Izzy's the one who has the most

1663
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,000
because because when she leaves the prison, she chuckles really

1664
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,840
devilishly by replacing an orange with the tennis ball.

1665
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,720
Yes, she thinks it's hilarious, but it's like not that good of a prank,

1666
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,880
but she thinks it's so funny.

1667
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,680
I she just puts it in the box and she's like,

1668
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,640
wouldn't it be funny if I swap them because they're both spheres?

1669
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,720
And then nothing comes of it.

1670
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,000
She just thinks it's funny.

1671
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,200
Just just thinks it's funny.

1672
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,160
And yeah.

1673
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,920
And the tennis ball is a pretty funny visual game.

1674
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,360
Yeah, it is pretty funny.

1675
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,720
And then in that moment, it's extra funny

1676
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,080
because it's clear that she could have taken it off immediately at any time.

1677
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,640
Just chooses not to.

1678
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,760
She just did.

1679
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:32,840
Izzy, like, never, you know, a lot of the jokes in this movie

1680
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,040
did not make me laugh and didn't like land necessarily.

1681
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:41,600
But like whenever Izzy made a joke, I never groaned or anything.

1682
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,160
I was just like, I didn't laugh, but I still love you, Izzy.

1683
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,360
Yeah, like she was never annoying.

1684
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,400
She never annoyed me.

1685
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:55,800
She was always either funny or just like, I can't wait to work three seasons in

1686
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,840
and they just dial Izzy up to twelve like they did with Pinkie Pie

1687
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,800
and just make it obnoxious.

1688
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,960
Yes. Oh, I'm sure they will.

1689
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,320
When will they flander eyes?

1690
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,720
When will they flander eyes, Izzy?

1691
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,320
The countdown begins.

1692
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,560
Dude, did you see how they fucking plagiarized

1693
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,120
Beljap at the end where they're trying to get the jewels,

1694
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,320
but they keep falling off and they're like, oh, I've got to catch the jewel.

1695
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,520
That's right. The end of Beljap.

1696
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,640
Remember that? Yeah, yeah.

1697
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,360
The jewel of Splish falls into the lava.

1698
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,320
They have to go, oh, shit, it's falling.

1699
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,600
Oh, they slippery. Oh, these jewels are so slippery.

1700
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,600
Why can't I hold only we had hands?

1701
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,280
Yeah, fuck.

1702
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,520
Holy spike was here.

1703
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,920
If they if they had hands, I'm so glad there isn't a spike.

1704
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,520
Thank fuck. Me, too.

1705
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,240
I'm also glad there's no spike.

1706
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,200
I guess like hitch it. Hitch is the spike.

1707
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,000
Yeah, you're right.

1708
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,200
I'm not kidding. He is.

1709
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,800
It's like one of Spike and Fluttershy and Big Magnetage

1710
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,360
and a boy character was a cop.

1711
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,720
He's the he's the one guy who sucks.

1712
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,000
And he's he's plays the spike.

1713
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,360
No, I liked him.

1714
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,840
I thought he was all right. I didn't mind hitch.

1715
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,800
I hated Sprout.

1716
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,840
Fuck hitch. The thing I did like about

1717
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,560
is that he's like he's like not for the reasons they want me to hate him.

1718
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,960
ACAB means hitch, too.

1719
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,360
Hmm. ACAB includes that.

1720
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,160
I never liked Spike or like I couldn't find

1721
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:22,880
myself to like Spike is is that he's just he's just the little nagging voice

1722
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,880
that's always next is that he's a sidekick.

1723
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,640
He's like a Robin to a Batman.

1724
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,400
He's like, oh, geez.

1725
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,080
Oh, wow.

1726
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,920
Twilight is like a good line.

1727
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,080
At least is his own character.

1728
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,120
Oh, geez, Sonny, I can't wait to put you in jail when we get home.

1729
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,280
We're all we're all going to jail after this, by the way.

1730
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,280
At least he's an environmentally conscious.

1731
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,600
Yeah, you know, this friendship thing is really cool and all,

1732
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,640
but I really got to get you back and put you in jail, Sonny.

1733
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,240
Hitch, jail is magic.

1734
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,840
The the the the punitive justice system is magic.

1735
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,520
Everyone, everyone brings something to the table in this ragtag band

1736
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,080
of misfits and hitch is that you can do paperwork,

1737
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:15,040
process you through the penal system and to get you and get you get you

1738
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:20,560
sorted out, a special guy removed from society with a minimum of fuss.

1739
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,760
Everybody's got a super special talent.

1740
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,960
If he's going to be like in the show is like one of the the main group

1741
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,160
and he's the sheriff, what what would that like?

1742
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,160
What it's like having the mayor there as one of the main troop.

1743
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,400
Yeah, what is going to even happen?

1744
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,080
They can be like, Hitch, don't tell him.

1745
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,560
He'll be like, OK, you were like you were right last time.

1746
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,120
So what he what he brings to the group is that he can he could get you

1747
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,240
and he can get you out of jail.

1748
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,320
He could just be like, no, I just won't prosecute this crime that you commit.

1749
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,880
What is going to be is going to be like doing that illusion with this position

1750
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,360
of power as he continues to go.

1751
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,720
Or that's true.

1752
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,280
I was just going to be learning.

1753
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,840
Learning that you can't quit.

1754
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,880
Like, yeah. Oh, she's character.

1755
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,600
You can't do that. I'm the sheriff, you know, I get.

1756
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,280
Oh, I don't like this.

1757
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,200
I don't like this gun.

1758
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,520
They probably won't acknowledge it at all.

1759
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,720
It'll probably just like be a thing that's ignored.

1760
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,880
Yeah, he'll just be a guy.

1761
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,840
He'll put Sprout in charge for real.

1762
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,680
I mean, it worked out so well this this time.

1763
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,360
It's true. I like that Sprout was just Josh Scorcher.

1764
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,920
I also.

1765
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,920
He's the best character now.

1766
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,400
The same.

1767
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,720
He acts the same to.

1768
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,520
Yes, correct.

1769
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,680
I want to see Josh Scorcher's review of the movie and see if he goes.

1770
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,080
I can't wait to see the new and improved analysis.

1771
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,160
Anarchy was using 3D models that don't animate.

1772
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:58,720
They just glide around the 3D pony maker.

1773
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,960
Like you rotate it, take a picture.

1774
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,800
I just find it I find it funny because like up and up until the release of this

1775
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:10,120
movie, I'd always been like saying like I even if I don't like this,

1776
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,640
I can't wait for the chaos because like it's going to be like

1777
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:17,200
a Star Trek original series versus Star Trek the next generation.

1778
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,880
The fandom is going to fracture and there's going to be people on each side.

1779
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,080
And just as someone who's been in the shit long enough to understand

1780
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,440
the inevitable arguments, it'll be fun just to watch from the sidelines.

1781
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:30,120
And then they literally called the fucking show a new generation.

1782
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,800
And I'm just like, it's so perfect.

1783
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,560
It's like poetry. They rhyme.

1784
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,080
There's already people bitching about it.

1785
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:35,840
And it's really funny.

1786
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,640
There's some account that has like 200 subscribers or 200 followers on Twitter

1787
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,840
called like Save MLP G4.

1788
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,640
And they're running a change.org position to get this show canceled

1789
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,640
and get the finale of G4 rescinded.

1790
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,240
Bro, it's not that serious.

1791
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,720
Chris Chan was all about that.

1792
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,360
No, see, they lost their figure.

1793
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,560
Chris Chan was trying to promote that before it went to jail for reasons

1794
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,440
that we don't have to get into. As long as Chris is in jail.

1795
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,920
As long as Chris is in jail, it's all over.

1796
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,360
It's as long as as long as Chris is in jail, we're safe.

1797
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,920
By the way, this is unrelated, but did you see the letter

1798
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,560
that she wrote from prison?

1799
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,440
Oh, my God.

1800
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,720
The letter. Why? What?

1801
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,960
The letter wherein?

1802
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,200
The letter is insane.

1803
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,160
The letter is the Jesus Christ.

1804
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,760
Do you believe that's the West Sea?

1805
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,360
Just like I am Jesus Christ reincarnated.

1806
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,280
I am like, please, please draw a fan art of me on the cross, please.

1807
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,560
It reads exactly like I completely identically to like a caliber and rant.

1808
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,440
And this is the person.

1809
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:39,160
This is the biggest proponent of like, bring back G4.

1810
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,080
No, G5.

1811
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,560
Yeah, it's so.

1812
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,760
She's the biggest in here.

1813
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,240
It's so fairly strange.

1814
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,240
Yeah.

1815
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,240
So it's so weird that Chris would say something bizarre.

1816
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,480
It's so weird that it's bizarre.

1817
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,120
Like, obviously it's going to be bizarre.

1818
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,360
She thinks stupid, insane things.

1819
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:00,280
But it's like the way it's written is so dramatic.

1820
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,280
Yeah.

1821
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,880
That it's like how I didn't know they could write like that.

1822
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,000
Like that dramatically.

1823
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It was gripping.

1824
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,880
I was I was totally engaged.

1825
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:16,520
She writes almost as though it's like biblical as like it's like say say unto

1826
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,880
me like like like do unto me that like thy thy duty.

1827
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,600
Also, I need like five hundred dollars transferred to my bank account, please.

1828
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,120
The.

1829
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,360
Oh, OK, sorry to derail the conversation.

1830
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,440
I was just I just forgot about that.

1831
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:43,360
And I just remembered gripping stuff truly, truly a miracle.

1832
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,760
Right. But anyway, we got to bring back G4.

1833
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,680
We got to sign the petition.

1834
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,280
We have to undo the finale.

1835
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,560
Twilight can't be a long legged freak.

1836
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,600
She's got to go back to be in a cute little pony.

1837
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,480
It is.

1838
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,280
Chop our legs off.

1839
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,200
Job. Definitely chop her legs off.

1840
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,680
We got to we got to like cotton.

1841
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,440
We got to like cotton hill her ass.

1842
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,480
If you know what I'm saying, this letter chop chop her shins off at the knee.

1843
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,640
So her hooves to her knees.

1844
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,320
What? That's what that's that's what Hank Hill.

1845
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,120
That's what happened to Hank Hill's dad.

1846
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,880
That's why his dad is short because they shot his shins off and they just

1847
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,480
sewed his feet to his knees.

1848
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,560
That's what you got to do.

1849
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,760
OK, totally unnecessary.

1850
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,680
So we're getting we're getting off time here.

1851
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,880
But thank you. Yeah.

1852
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,040
What are we talking about?

1853
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,880
My little pony, the movie, the new generation.

1854
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:43,360
10 out of 10.

1855
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,360
Do we have anything else to say about the movie?

1856
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,240
I liked the song at the beginning.

1857
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,760
I like the songs in the middle.

1858
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,960
I like the songs of the end.

1859
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,840
I like all the songs.

1860
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,680
Oh, the pacing of the songs is great.

1861
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,160
I thought it was perfect.

1862
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:02,360
I didn't think any of the songs really stuck with me that much.

1863
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,640
I like the mob song because it was so stupid.

1864
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,920
It was funny, but it was like that on purpose.

1865
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,200
None of the other songs really did anything for me.

1866
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,080
I'm being swayed.

1867
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,680
I'll bump my score up to like a six.

1868
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,760
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.

1869
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,760
I have things that I liked.

1870
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,080
I also this movie isn't for me.

1871
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,240
It was much better than I was expecting.

1872
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,640
I haven't seen the 2017 movie since it came out.

1873
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,120
So I don't know if it's better.

1874
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,440
Was that the 2D one?

1875
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,400
Yeah, the actual like My Little Pony movie, the G4 movie.

1876
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,080
Not a question.

1877
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:33,880
Did I watch that?

1878
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,080
The actual one.

1879
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,920
The one that wasn't a fucking dumpster fighter.

1880
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,680
Well, no, no, no.

1881
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,320
I mean, OK, I remember now.

1882
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,960
As compared to the Equestria Girls movies,

1883
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,120
which are all living nightmares.

1884
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,800
That's true.

1885
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,080
I don't know if it's better than that one

1886
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,640
because I haven't watched that one in a million years.

1887
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,600
What, the 2017?

1888
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,160
Yeah, I don't remember anything about it.

1889
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,760
Oh, no, it's Dreadful.

1890
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,120
Is it? Which which movie?

1891
01:17:59,120 --> 01:17:59,960
I don't remember it being the Dreadful.

1892
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,280
Oh, the one where they go on the.

1893
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,800
The one where they go to Aladdin

1894
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,360
and then they go to the Sea Ponies

1895
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,840
and then there's Pirate Parrots and it's like

1896
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,640
there's too many things.

1897
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,960
They don't spend enough time on anything.

1898
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,760
None of the character,

1899
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,160
none of the main six gets enough of screen time

1900
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,440
to like really have anything to do.

1901
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,840
My initial reaction was that this is better,

1902
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,040
but I can't say for sure because I haven't seen it.

1903
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,400
And then there was there was the fucking

1904
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,880
there was the fucking Lion King fart guy.

1905
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,840
The fucking Gremlin like minion,

1906
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,560
blue minion, little rare.

1907
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,160
I'm a fucking asshole, annoying piece of shit

1908
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
from the line. Of course.

1909
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,720
There is there.

1910
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,880
And also, there is when Twilight gets like captured or whatever,

1911
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,760
the like lava place that she's in looks exactly like

1912
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,480
when you fight King Caliente for the second time in Mario Galaxy.

1913
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,560
Look it up, you'll get it.

1914
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,400
And that's why you've all been there.

1915
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,360
Playing Mario Galaxy, everybody.

1916
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:00,240
It's just like it's just like like metal hexagons over lava

1917
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,080
or something.

1918
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,880
That's what made me think of it.

1919
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,560
I need to get a picture of that Gremlin guy

1920
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,360
because he was so annoying.

1921
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,680
I think I know who you're talking about.

1922
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,840
When I say Lion King, there was like that Lion King reboot

1923
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,720
like TV show. Oh, yeah.

1924
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,080
From the Lion Guard.

1925
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,280
The Lion Guard.

1926
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,800
Tom, you made a video about Lion Guard.

1927
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1928
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,200
I still get comments on it to this day

1929
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,320
saying how wrong I am in the show.

1930
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,360
No, that's how you do it.

1931
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,880
That guy and that guy is this like spiritual

1932
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,840
successor to Skunk Freak is in the Milo Pony 2017.

1933
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,520
I would say that.

1934
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,360
And he's a villain.

1935
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,680
I would say that Western animation fans are the lowest of the low

1936
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,760
and just the worst kind of person.

1937
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,480
And you should never listen to them.

1938
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,680
Well, why? Why?

1939
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,880
OK, Phantom Horn.

1940
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,360
You should never listen to me.

1941
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,400
My last mistake was getting into the pony show.

1942
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,840
And it's all just it's all been downhill from there for me.

1943
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,520
So don't don't be like me.

1944
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:05,240
The pony show is taken up like a quarter of my life, at least.

1945
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,080
Easily. And and what a quarter it was.

1946
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,080
I was 12 and 2010.

1947
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,520
Oh, my God.

1948
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,880
Is that one pony started?

1949
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,520
Is that when Gen Four came out?

1950
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,880
Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

1951
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,480
So I was probably like

1952
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,240
here under under the evil doer thing.

1953
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,160
Here he is.

1954
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that guy.

1955
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:32,040
Oh, this. Oh, I forget him.

1956
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:37,760
Yeah, I do love how there's a villain wiki.

1957
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,400
It's really funny to me.

1958
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,920
This is this is this guy.

1959
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,200
Isn't there someone who looks exactly like the quote?

1960
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,400
Oh, that's what you're talking about, right?

1961
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,880
Yeah, he looks exactly like that porcupine or whatever.

1962
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,480
Yeah, I don't even.

1963
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,200
Yeah, I look at the quote.

1964
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,880
Oh, I love pie.

1965
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,680
Lots of rubbers, most famous line.

1966
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,040
Oh, I love you go, brother.

1967
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,800
Oh, I love pie.

1968
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,240
What a great fill.

1969
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,480
God, the wiki community is what a memorable character.

1970
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,880
Whatever. Barry.

1971
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,840
What a Barry Fizzle sparkle twist.

1972
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,200
Was the name of what's her name at the end?

1973
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,840
That's a little whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle,

1974
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:20,160
Bibi Babis, snap, crackle, pop.

1975
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,920
I liked I liked that pony a little bit.

1976
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,800
I thought she was all right.

1977
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,960
Right. Tempest, Shadow, Alias,

1978
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,640
Fizzle, Pop, Barry, Twist, that's a very twist.

1979
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,040
I thought that was a funny little twist at the end.

1980
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,560
Remember when they turn that guy to stone

1981
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,640
and he just falls over and they shatter him into pieces

1982
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,920
and he just fucking dies right on screen?

1983
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,640
Remember when they killed a guy?

1984
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,160
Yeah, that was awesome.

1985
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,280
Then kill anyone in this movie.

1986
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,480
What the fuck? They should have.

1987
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,920
They should have killed him.

1988
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,400
What's his name?

1989
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,880
They should have killed the Josh Scorcher character.

1990
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,200
Skit, Sprout. Sprout.

1991
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,400
You needed. Yeah.

1992
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,040
Was I a good fucking sheriff?

1993
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,000
Mom. They should have killed the mom.

1994
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,280
Die. Mom just pulls out a gun.

1995
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,440
They should have killed the Silicon Valley milf.

1996
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,960
Absolutely.

1997
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,320
They should have. She's a milf, though.

1998
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,240
You can't do that.

1999
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,680
You can't go around killing milfs.

2000
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,480
Oh, we go. You could.

2001
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,480
Oh, you just call me the milf hunter, I guess.

2002
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,520
No one gets redeemed.

2003
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,680
You're good at your body.

2004
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,320
Die, Pony.

2005
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,120
You got to drop off the side of a building like Gaston.

2006
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,160
Yeah, you don't you don't kill him.

2007
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:28,720
You don't kill him.

2008
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,080
Yeah, they fall to their death, death. Yeah.

2009
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,080
Yeah, one presumes that they perished due to nobody's.

2010
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:36,440
No one's fault.

2011
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,040
It's just now they double jump when right at the bottom.

2012
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,200
They roll. They hit roll right before.

2013
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,040
Yeah, they get no full damage.

2014
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:44,600
They continue.

2015
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,920
I'd like a Mufasa death where they fall and then they go down

2016
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,280
and like hang out with the body for a while.

2017
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,280
Like if it were me, I would simply hit roll

2018
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,120
right before hitting the hitting the hitting the ground.

2019
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:00,160
Simba like like sets up like he he he he sets up

2020
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,120
like a scuttle bug just the right place.

2021
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,000
He goes back in time.

2022
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,800
Mufasa bounces off of it.

2023
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,360
He sets up a scuttle bug to bounce off of it.

2024
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,480
Uh, Simba, why didn't you set up the scuttle bug?

2025
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,200
Simba, there's supposed to be a scuttle bug.

2026
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,160
No. Watch for the rolling rocks.

2027
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,840
Oh, he didn't.

2028
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,760
He didn't watch for him.

2029
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,280
And look what happened.

2030
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,280
Watch the Lion King.

2031
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,120
I love the Lion King a whole lot.

2032
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:30,800
You know that.

2033
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,680
Why didn't we watch that?

2034
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,880
Lion King 2019, what a great movie.

2035
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,880
Oh, my God, the Lion King is very important to me.

2036
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,440
And the Lion King 2019 is my least favorite movie.

2037
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Did you see it?

2038
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Of course, I saw it.

2039
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,800
Oh, you mean the live action one?

2040
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,800
I mean the live action one.

2041
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:48,800
Yeah, the live action one.

2042
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,000
The live action full CGI animated again.

2043
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,400
Oh, right.

2044
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,800
But made exponentially worse.

2045
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,800
I only just learned who YMS is

2046
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,000
because Munchie was like, you should watch the Kimba video.

2047
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,000
And I did.

2048
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,680
It was really good.

2049
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,680
And yeah, I never watched YMS before,

2050
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,080
but I've seen like some of his highlight streams of him editing

2051
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:12,280
his Lion King 2019 video.

2052
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,640
And he I was like, I was just overcome

2053
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,400
with this feeling of like, finally, there's someone who gives

2054
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,520
as much of a shit about the Lion King as me.

2055
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:27,240
Like I've never met anyone who could just fucking talk about it.

2056
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,960
He's been making that Lion King video.

2057
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,360
He's been working on that Lion King video for like 10 years now.

2058
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,640
I'm terrified.

2059
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,880
It's so excited how long he's worked on it.

2060
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,920
There was I it's going to be like a day long video.

2061
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,880
It's going to be like a 20 hour video.

2062
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,000
There was there was like a stream highlight where he's discussing,

2063
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,640
like, in depth, like, not just the fact that like the music

2064
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:54,040
in the stampede scene is like synced weird, but like why the why it's bad

2065
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:58,640
because there's specific musical cues that they use in the movie

2066
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,760
in the original movie that they still leave in the remake.

2067
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:06,360
Like, but they're they happen.

2068
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,280
Like nothing is going on.

2069
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:12,200
Yeah, like they they use this instrument to like to basically

2070
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:18,200
like it's just represent that Zazu is flying, but that sound

2071
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:22,000
just appears when Zazu is not even on like on the screen at all.

2072
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,720
So and I was like, this is what I think about every day.

2073
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:29,080
This is the only thing I think about is is the the the sinking

2074
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,760
of the score and the stampede scene.

2075
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,320
Finally, someone's talking about it.

2076
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:39,480
I I see I understand you understand someday.

2077
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,360
Maybe it was it was it was good.

2078
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,960
I watched that as well where he was going over that.

2079
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,840
It's essentially like the cuts and timing

2080
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:54,840
is different, but the music is basically the exactly the same.

2081
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,480
And so bits that are supposed to line up with animation and shots.

2082
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,960
Like you don't notice it when you're watching,

2083
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,200
but when you go over it and be like, oh, that that instrument is going

2084
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,760
as they're falling down.

2085
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,760
And it's like, oh, that's like it makes it pop more.

2086
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,280
Yes, smart.

2087
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,080
And then in the new one, they don't do anything smart with that.

2088
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,400
Yeah, it'll be like they have like the the because, you know,

2089
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,720
when you write a score for a film, you do it intentionally.

2090
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,200
So they have a you feel like, yeah, you'll have a doodaloo

2091
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,240
when they're falling or something or they're making a face or something.

2092
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,840
And then, yeah, it's in the remake.

2093
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,160
You you have the doodaloo, but like nothing

2094
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,000
is what is happening on screen doesn't relate to nothing.

2095
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,240
This doodaloo, doodaloo.

2096
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,600
There's no there's no doodaloo, but they're not falling.

2097
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:44,160
So like you it's not why the doodaloo.

2098
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:48,240
So the purpose of the score is like the doodaloo undermined.

2099
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,040
I see. I see.

2100
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,200
It makes the scene feel really flat and like not.

2101
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:58,360
It's it's so it's so overly in depth, but I can't wait for the big video.

2102
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:00,480
Yeah, where he talks about all of that.

2103
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,000
I know I love that shit.

2104
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,280
I love that shit so much.

2105
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,000
I'm very excited for this video.

2106
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,160
The the Kimble.

2107
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:11,480
He just like made the Kimble one like as like an afterthought.

2108
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,280
Yeah, but it's like three hour long.

2109
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,120
Yeah, yeah, it's I mean, I like that one.

2110
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,920
It's very good, good time.

2111
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,760
I learned a lot.

2112
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,840
I had a lot of fun.

2113
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:21,640
It was fun.

2114
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,240
Good time.

2115
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,040
You all had a good time was had by all.

2116
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,040
There's so many good things in YMS is.

2117
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:28,800
Catalog.

2118
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,680
I mean, all I see of him now is yeah, it's I see stream highlights

2119
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:37,680
and him reacting to Darman, which is a whole a whole genre onto itself.

2120
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,600
I haven't gotten into watching the Darman things.

2121
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,440
I just want the Lion King editing.

2122
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,080
I agree.

2123
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,360
Give me a Lion King editing, please.

2124
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,800
Correct.

2125
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,760
But I have seen some Darman shit.

2126
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,360
I saw I saw a thumbnail yesterday

2127
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:00,440
that was like YMS reacts to the cringiest,

2128
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,920
the cringiest Darman video yet.

2129
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:07,040
And the thumbnail was just YMS just making a face.

2130
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,080
And he's like, wow, he's really cringing.

2131
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,320
Was it the cringiest one?

2132
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,520
Really?

2133
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,000
I don't know.

2134
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:12,800
I didn't watch the video.

2135
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,200
I just saw the thumbnail and I was like, that is a big cringe.

2136
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,120
Report back next week.

2137
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,520
It looks like a real cringe.

2138
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,400
OK, you got to watch it.

2139
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,040
That's what we're all watching reveals.

2140
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,080
No, we didn't talk about peeled Pokemon.

2141
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,400
Oh, God, yeah.

2142
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,200
Yeah, true.

2143
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,280
We were looking at peeled Pokemon and we were getting.

2144
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,400
I was getting mad.

2145
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,080
I don't know what that is.

2146
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,320
Some of the peeled sounds dumb.

2147
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,400
Have you want to explain?

2148
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,960
Have you seen like banana peel?

2149
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,520
Have you seen that the peeled Pokemon Twitter account?

2150
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,880
No, you know, a peeled Pokemoner.

2151
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:44,480
Oh, here we go.

2152
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,400
Cracks got it.

2153
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,640
Yeah, it's disgusting.

2154
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,280
Is it gross?

2155
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:48,760
What is it?

2156
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:49,880
No, just peeled.

2157
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,200
The peels are peeled.

2158
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,760
Oh, OK.

2159
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,360
I get it.

2160
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,760
You've probably seen like peeled dialog.

2161
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,160
Next we think of like a potato peeler and that's

2162
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,880
that feels like like like like a dangerous.

2163
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,640
OK, I'm looking at this.

2164
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,800
I don't like the idea of cutting these ears off.

2165
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,560
You've probably seen the peeled dialog image floating around

2166
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,040
because that one got kind of popular and a few others.

2167
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,720
But yeah, me and Ben just scrolled through the entire account

2168
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,920
and looked at every single Pokemon and I'm sorry.

2169
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:20,400
I'm sorry.

2170
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,880
What the what the fuck is this?

2171
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,240
What the fuck is this?

2172
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,600
It's a potato.

2173
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:31,720
This is this is just like going too far.

2174
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:34,000
This is like you're not when you peel it.

2175
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,680
You when you peel it, you take the extraneous elements off.

2176
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,640
You take like the dude.

2177
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,400
The very balance pretty good.

2178
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,880
You take the doodads off.

2179
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,480
You take the extra bits off.

2180
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,080
You don't take its limbs off.

2181
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,680
You don't remove its arms and legs.

2182
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,720
That's not peeling.

2183
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,720
That's dismemberment.

2184
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,400
That's cruel.

2185
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:49,920
It's an egg.

2186
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,320
See that.

2187
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,280
See that's peel.

2188
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,160
No, that's peeled.

2189
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,000
That's an effective peel.

2190
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,200
That's a peeled Pokemon.

2191
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,680
This this pig egg.

2192
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,440
This pig egg is an abomination.

2193
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,200
This pig egg is against the spirit of the endeavor.

2194
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,720
Is it fair to say that the reason

2195
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,280
that you were so mad when we were scrolling through the Twitter

2196
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,000
is that like the rules about what you take off

2197
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,280
when you peel a Pokemon were very inconsistent.

2198
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,160
Yes, like like when he did or when they did,

2199
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,760
I guess they they've them pronouns and bio.

2200
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:22,080
When they did the the the Pidgey,

2201
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,720
when they did the Pidgey line,

2202
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,640
all they did was they took like the bits off

2203
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,880
and they took the hair off and they took the stuff.

2204
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,880
But it was still recognizably a bird.

2205
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,080
It just had its elements removed.

2206
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,480
But when they did the one from Gen 5,

2207
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,680
I think Pit Pit of and that line.

2208
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,040
Yeah, they removed the beak.

2209
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,160
They took the beak off.

2210
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,040
They took the feet off.

2211
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,360
It just turned it into a lump.

2212
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,520
But it's like OK.

2213
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,640
This is not the you've gone too far.

2214
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,440
This doesn't make any sense.

2215
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,880
How could you peel his mouth away?

2216
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,720
If he does this a lot, they do this a lot.

2217
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,800
Yes, that one rule.

2218
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,720
They will they will just remove the mouth.

2219
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,680
And it's like that's not peeling.

2220
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,400
Yeah, you've filled it in.

2221
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,880
You filled it in with plaster and then like smoothed it over.

2222
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,160
This is the opposite of peeling.

2223
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,320
This is insanity.

2224
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,760
As we were scrolling.

2225
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,000
This is fucking distressing.

2226
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,160
I feel like some of these feel like a troll.

2227
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,440
Some of these feel like they did them deliberately bad

2228
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,400
to make me angry as like a practical joke.

2229
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,000
As we were scrolling, like Ben looked away for a second

2230
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,440
and we came upon or I came upon this.

2231
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,160
Which one is this?

2232
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,600
This is Hapodon.

2233
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,040
And I was like, Ben, I need you to embrace yourself

2234
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,200
because you're going to hate this one the most.

2235
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,440
And he did.

2236
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,640
Oh, oh, wait.

2237
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,480
What's the one Tyranitar?

2238
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,880
Tyranitar, for some inexplicable reason,

2239
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,960
they they remove some bits and they don't fill the mouth in,

2240
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,880
but they just edit the mouth to be closed.

2241
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,680
Like they just closed its mouth.

2242
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,680
Oh, but the line, the outline of where

2243
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,080
they did it, they did it, so it looks like he has a giant

2244
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,400
Adam's apple.

2245
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,800
Yeah, these are awesome.

2246
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,960
I want to find it.

2247
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,360
I mean, they're all unique.

2248
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,720
I'll give them that.

2249
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:03,640
They're all you never know what they're going to do with it.

2250
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,560
I just I do like the account quite a bit.

2251
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,360
It's very funny.

2252
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,640
I'm sitting over here.

2253
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,840
I'm going to find Tyranitar.

2254
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,560
Mouth agape.

2255
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,920
What?

2256
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,400
Someone is doing this.

2257
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,440
I just don't understand the appeal.

2258
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,440
I know pun intended.

2259
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:25,520
Any the appeal of doing this or consuming this content.

2260
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,440
This seems like utterly.

2261
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,200
Oh, no, we scroll through the whole thing.

2262
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,520
I don't like this.

2263
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,160
That's Kyogre, right?

2264
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,400
They just go out of everything.

2265
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,680
Those are the worst ones.

2266
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,720
No, look at Groudon.

2267
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:37,520
Get Groudon.

2268
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,520
Look what they did to Groudon.

2269
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,800
It's inexplicable.

2270
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,800
What they did with Groudon doesn't make any fucking sense at all.

2271
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,160
It's just a line.

2272
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,680
That's not right.

2273
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,760
This person just not right.

2274
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,240
I like to think that this person has no object permanence.

2275
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,640
And whenever they remove something,

2276
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:54,040
they can't fathom that there would be stuff behind it.

2277
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,720
So they just take it.

2278
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:59,960
This person just can't think in 3D.

2279
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,280
They can't think that if I take an element off,

2280
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,840
there could be some body behind it.

2281
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,280
This is like this one.

2282
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:10,840
Groudon looks like a shrimp's hard outer thing

2283
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:14,280
that you peel off before you eat the shrimp.

2284
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:19,440
But this is off the peel, rather than it's been peeled

2285
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,920
and this is what's left.

2286
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,720
This is a picture off the peel.

2287
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:23,840
I kind of like this one.

2288
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,920
I kind of like lunatone.

2289
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,480
I don't want to rag on this person.

2290
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,600
I think that they're doing it on purpose,

2291
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,920
and it's supposed to be stupid.

2292
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:31,600
I think.

2293
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,600
But it's also fun to get mad at it and be like, what is this?

2294
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,760
You broke your rule from earlier that you don't remove the beats.

2295
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:44,160
I think that they are not a good artist,

2296
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,880
and they can't think in 3D very well,

2297
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:49,440
and they are genuinely just kind of like, I said they.

2298
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,920
No, I just said damn, that's scathing.

2299
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,120
Yeah, well, I think they're kind of bad.

2300
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,680
I mean, they're making it work, but I also

2301
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:00,720
think there is an element of like some of them

2302
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:01,640
are just bad on purpose.

2303
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,360
Now this person rules.

2304
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,000
Just because, like, Lamal.

2305
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:04,840
This person rules.

2306
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:05,760
Oh my god.

2307
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,160
What is this?

2308
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,000
What the fuck were they thinking?

2309
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,520
What are they fucking doing to me with this nonsense?

2310
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,960
I have no idea what this black dot is.

2311
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,760
It's a ooze.

2312
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,680
Is it like Kabuto?

2313
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,480
Yes.

2314
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,760
Oh, I have the number.

2315
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,440
So give your guesses.

2316
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,800
I actually don't know.

2317
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,840
Is it something with like a shell,

2318
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,480
and this is like just its face you can see under the shell,

2319
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,000
right?

2320
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,040
Oh, it's fucking cradley.

2321
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:36,800
What?

2322
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,160
Oh my god.

2323
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,200
Yeah.

2324
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,040
The object permanence.

2325
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,360
They didn't just make it like that.

2326
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:45,400
It should obviously have another eye.

2327
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,640
It should obviously have another eye on the other side.

2328
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,440
You don't see it from this angle.

2329
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:49,960
You should be able to see just a little bit.

2330
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,560
You don't see it from this angle.

2331
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,960
It shouldn't be entirely hidden.

2332
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,080
No, I'm proud of them.

2333
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,840
They got the object permanence.

2334
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:01,040
They made it a whole sphere instead of like the bit

2335
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:05,040
that you can see through the fake mouth.

2336
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:05,880
Look at this.

2337
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,200
Look at this.

2338
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,680
Yes.

2339
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:12,560
Like, obviously that's not what their mouth should look like.

2340
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,520
That obviously that's not what their head would look like

2341
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,560
when it's one, why did they close the mouth?

2342
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,360
Two, why is their neck sticking out like that?

2343
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,320
I'm so mad.

2344
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,120
I'm so upset.

2345
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,320
I can't believe they would do this.

2346
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,960
Feel free to start your own version.

2347
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,720
I wish on Pylos' line they removed the fur

2348
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:33,520
and made it some flesh loams.

2349
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,480
All right, I've seen survivor done by someone else before.

2350
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,640
Like, what if survivor, like, what if you improved survivor

2351
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,680
by getting rid of all of it's like too many like things?

2352
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,320
It's just a funny squishy snake.

2353
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:49,560
I mean, I never really liked the way they have like

2354
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,640
something about the designs sort of uneven.

2355
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,520
Is it the way that they're like,

2356
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,160
they're permanently like squinched up?

2357
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,920
Permanently like crunched? No, no, no, no.

2358
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,360
It's about like their, if I get an actual picture.

2359
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:06,600
Okay, I'm gonna show another one that makes me really mad.

2360
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,800
This one is like, this is like,

2361
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,160
this guy doesn't understand how to think in 3D.

2362
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,000
Look at,

2363
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,320
There's survivor, but yeah.

2364
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,280
I think they did a pretty good job.

2365
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,120
Ben, that's a good job.

2366
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,360
I think it's just the purple,

2367
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:25,640
the purple is just sort of like kind of random colors.

2368
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,080
There's too many a little bit.

2369
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,280
I don't know. Oh, yeah.

2370
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,680
I always felt it was a little busy

2371
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,440
and I could never really get into him.

2372
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:35,000
True. What is this fire dog?

2373
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,920
Entei. What is his name? Entei?

2374
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,720
Look at Entei, like. I love him.

2375
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,120
Why is he a Cyclops?

2376
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:43,080
No, that's a completely insane criticism.

2377
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:46,760
Obviously the point is that he's making it look stupid.

2378
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,600
Yeah.

2379
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,840
Right? Like they're making it look stupid on purpose.

2380
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,280
Ben is thinking it too far.

2381
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:56,000
I think that this artist doesn't understand 3D perspective.

2382
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,080
No, no, no, no. I understand, I understand.

2383
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,800
I understand that it's supposed to look silly

2384
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,520
and it does look silly, but it's like,

2385
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,160
well, I feel like you broke your rules here

2386
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,680
because clearly this is not,

2387
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,360
this is not actually what it would look like

2388
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,200
if you feel it.

2389
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,680
I think this account was designed for you.

2390
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:13,200
It was designed to make you in particular.

2391
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,160
Oh my God, look at this fucking.

2392
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,000
That's what I said.

2393
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,160
It's all, it's a joke in my.

2394
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:19,000
Broken rules on totodiles.

2395
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,440
Why didn't you fill totodiles mouth then, huh?

2396
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,880
Why didn't you remove totodiles limbs either?

2397
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:25,880
Inconsistent.

2398
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,280
So inconsistent.

2399
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,440
It's great, I love it.

2400
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,680
If you're listening, I love you.

2401
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,280
I don't know who you are.

2402
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,120
You're great.

2403
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,160
It's just, I look at this, I look at this intake.

2404
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,160
Someone should make like actually properly peeled.

2405
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:40,000
I look at this intake.

2406
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,520
Consistently peeled Pokemon.

2407
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,400
Yeah, yeah, the account is called

2408
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,160
consistently peeled Pokemon.

2409
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,880
It's like unlike some other accounts.

2410
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,400
We obey our own rules.

2411
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,600
We stay true to the spirit of the endeavor.

2412
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,760
I love the idea that something this stupid

2413
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:57,080
could have drama and a candy.

2414
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:00,040
It's like the people that made the alternative

2415
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,680
out of touch Thursdays account that is like

2416
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:03,960
we're out of touch Thursdays,

2417
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,880
but unlike the real out of touch Thursdays account,

2418
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:09,360
we just don't ever retweet like Palestinian aid

2419
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,200
or anything.

2420
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,520
Wait, really?

2421
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,440
Yes, yes, there's one that's like we're out,

2422
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:14,640
we're out of touch Thursdays,

2423
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,720
but we never do anything political.

2424
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,520
Yeah, there are at least two extra

2425
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,800
alt out of touch Thursday accounts.

2426
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,520
Who's writing that account, Nate?

2427
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,960
Probably some dork like him.

2428
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:29,240
Yeah, some stupid motherfucker.

2429
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,920
Got him.

2430
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:32,760
Got him.

2431
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:35,880
Anyway, we should do that.

2432
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,280
What I'm saying is we should do that to this guy.

2433
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:44,160
Wait, okay, the Wailord rules.

2434
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,320
The Gen 3 legendaries were like the worst ones.

2435
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,520
Is that Wailord?

2436
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,520
Wailord and Wailmer, yeah.

2437
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,760
They just closed their mouths.

2438
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,880
Why closed their mouths?

2439
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,360
Eleazar's gonna have to edit all these in, right?

2440
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,160
Oh my God, I mean, he better.

2441
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,680
You gotta, every time.

2442
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,520
He better.

2443
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:00,360
You gotta.

2444
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,520
All right, I'll stop posting them, but yeah.

2445
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,360
Funny account.

2446
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,040
I've seen enough, I've had enough of this nonsense.

2447
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,720
I mean, we looked through the whole thing

2448
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,120
and Ben was getting mad.

2449
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,760
Ben was like screaming.

2450
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,040
I'm still mad, I'm still mad.

2451
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,600
Yeah, I was punching holes in the wall.

2452
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,240
Yeah, you peed on the floor, you shit on the ceiling.

2453
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:24,240
I shit myself, yeah, I shouldn't come.

2454
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,680
You shouldn't come.

2455
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:30,200
Oh, and it was, oh my God, what have they done to Harayama?

2456
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,200
What?

2457
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,280
Let me see, let me see, plus one more, one more.

2458
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,280
One more.

2459
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,080
They just, he has gloves on.

2460
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:41,080
They just, they just like peeled back the gloves

2461
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,320
and they're the same shape, but skin,

2462
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,800
like that doesn't make any sense.

2463
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:46,640
Take his gloves off.

2464
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,480
Oh, oh wait, can I?

2465
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,600
Yeah, other Pokemon, you take the hands off.

2466
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:50,440
Why not take his hands off?

2467
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,920
What do you think this is?

2468
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,760
It's not who you think.

2469
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:55,960
Oh, I know who this is.

2470
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:00,640
It's not who you think this is, but I don't fucking know.

2471
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,640
You don't know.

2472
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,480
No idea.

2473
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,320
Any guesses?

2474
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,520
I mean, it looks like a Kuna, but it is a Kuna.

2475
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,520
I know what it is.

2476
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,840
This is Zapdos.

2477
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:15,000
What have they done to my boy?

2478
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,760
What have they done to my boy?

2479
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,160
Yeah, it looks just like him.

2480
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:24,960
You know those like fetishes that some people have

2481
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,200
where it's like you get encased in like goo

2482
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:28,760
and you basically die?

2483
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:30,240
That's what the Snorlax looks like.

2484
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,240
He looks like he's been encased.

2485
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:38,440
They got him with the My Little Pony movie,

2486
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,280
a goo stroller.

2487
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,440
Yes, he looks peacefully dead in this image.

2488
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,960
He's resting in peace for real.

2489
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,800
He really is, he's resting in peace.

2490
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,480
I don't know what's going on with his chin.

2491
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,320
I don't know.

2492
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,320
His chin line doesn't match up with his headline.

2493
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,880
He's just got double chin.

2494
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:55,920
This doesn't make sense.

2495
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,160
The dark part is supposed to be the fur

2496
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:02,320
and the belly is supposed to be like the unfurred part.

2497
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:05,320
It should be entirely the belly color.

2498
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:05,800
I got more.

2499
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:06,640
If you're peeling it.

2500
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,040
I got more.

2501
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,840
It's Magmar.

2502
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:10,640
It's Magmar.

2503
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:11,560
There he is, this is the boy.

2504
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:13,080
It's Magmar, baby.

2505
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:13,760
He's back.

2506
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:14,640
Hey, get her, leave it.

2507
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:15,840
It's better than ever.

2508
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,320
What are you going to do about it?

2509
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:17,840
Nothing.

2510
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:18,560
I can't.

2511
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,280
It's mutilated Pokemon.

2512
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:21,560
This is terrifying.

2513
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:22,520
I can't, I can't.

2514
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:23,200
It's so good.

2515
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,400
I can't have any more.

2516
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,400
I can't have any more of this.

2517
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:32,560
I'm feeling like maybe it's time to go to voicemails.

2518
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,720
I'm thinking it's time to no more peeling.

2519
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:36,400
This is cruel.

2520
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,360
This is unusual.

2521
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,560
OK.

2522
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,600
I just thought that that was funny and a good way

2523
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,720
to end the show before voicemails.

2524
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:47,480
I'm so upset.

2525
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:49,360
Peeled ponies.

2526
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,200
Make your own peeled pony.

2527
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:57,320
The first voicemail of the day is called A Bit of Trivia.

2528
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,800
Also look up the TV chair.

2529
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,880
And we'll post it right there.

2530
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,200
There it is.

2531
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:02,920
Are we ready?

2532
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,800
Are we ready to go?

2533
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,480
Oh, yeah.

2534
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,440
OK, on the count of three, let's play it.

2535
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,840
One, two, three, go.

2536
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,960
Did you know the term information superhighway

2537
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,880
possibly originates with the artist Namjoon Paik

2538
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,640
with this term electronic superhighway

2539
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:19,040
where he predicted the future of telecommunications

2540
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,320
being all connected by electronic technology?

2541
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,400
He's a good artist, too.

2542
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,960
You should look up some of this stuff.

2543
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,600
Specifically the TV Buddha.

2544
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,120
That one's really cool.

2545
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,240
Thank you.

2546
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,080
Next.

2547
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:30,880
OK.

2548
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:31,800
I did not.

2549
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:32,800
You've learned a lot.

2550
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,800
I did not know that.

2551
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:39,200
So that's pretty, pretty good.

2552
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:43,640
I got my, that came out of my speakers for some reason.

2553
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:44,880
I want everything to set default.

2554
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:45,440
Yeah, I heard it.

2555
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,000
You're going pretty bad.

2556
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:47,920
You're sorry about that.

2557
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,600
You annoyed me, Ben.

2558
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,160
Again, like you always do.

2559
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,160
Classic Ben.

2560
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:54,920
Classic Ben.

2561
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,120
All right.

2562
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:58,520
Ben traumatizes me every day.

2563
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,240
Oh.

2564
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,360
The next one is going to be better.

2565
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,600
The next one is called My Story,

2566
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:08,440
which is a bit different from the normal stories.

2567
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,040
Let me put it here in chat.

2568
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:13,040
Do we wait for Gibb, who's peeing?

2569
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,320
Should we wait for Gibb?

2570
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,360
And just cut it out?

2571
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:17,040
Why?

2572
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,040
Why would we wait?

2573
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,040
I don't know.

2574
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,360
I don't know what's customary to you.

2575
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:23,400
You usually wait for her.

2576
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,480
Well, what are you going to fill the time?

2577
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:26,480
Time waits for no one.

2578
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,640
We can just post another peeled Pokemon.

2579
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:30,120
No.

2580
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,120
No more.

2581
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,840
We can get a good one.

2582
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,360
We have to unpeal.

2583
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:35,520
OK, here's what we got to do.

2584
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,280
I got to start an account that's called Unpeeled Pokemon.

2585
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:38,600
You add things.

2586
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:42,120
And it's just me redrawing the stuff that's

2587
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:45,200
supposed to be there back on the peeled version.

2588
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:46,560
That's honestly a great idea.

2589
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:48,680
Just take their peel and then draw back

2590
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,280
on what it's supposed to be.

2591
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:53,360
But obviously, do it a little different.

2592
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,040
Make it better.

2593
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:57,000
I've got a good one to fill the time.

2594
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,520
Just indulge in this for a moment.

2595
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,360
Just indulge in him.

2596
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,200
Just relax.

2597
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,760
We listened to the second one.

2598
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,280
No, we waited for you in post-it.

2599
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,160
OK.

2600
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,520
I'm glad you're back, so we don't

2601
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,760
have to look at this anymore.

2602
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,560
All right, the next one is called My Story, which

2603
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,160
is a bit different from the normal stories.

2604
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,400
Three, two, one, go.

2605
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:22,280
My story is a bit different from the normal stories.

2606
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,760
It started with me and my friends.

2607
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,720
Our names was starting to get well known in the world we live in.

2608
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,160
So that's when it started.

2609
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:31,040
We had no idea what trolls were, so we didn't see it coming.

2610
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,880
We was invited to a party, a troll party.

2611
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:35,040
All of them up, it showed up.

2612
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,280
And we had a pretty good time with our host.

2613
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,480
They seemed pretty cool, but that was just to draw us in.

2614
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,800
They asked us to come play some games with them.

2615
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,160
At the time, it seemed cool, but that was just to get our trust.

2616
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:48,960
So me and all the rest of them played their games

2617
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,160
and had an awesome time.

2618
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,880
But like I said, it was just to get our trust

2619
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,320
so they could rip us down.

2620
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,760
But none of us understood that, and they started to insult us.

2621
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:59,800
But we had no idea how to react to it,

2622
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,200
so they didn't get the negative response they was looking for.

2623
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,000
What are they talking about?

2624
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,120
We was just confused.

2625
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:05,960
But some of the muppets found it interesting.

2626
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:06,440
Muppets?

2627
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,360
We went along with it, and that's when it started.

2628
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:08,840
Is this Tales of the Trolling?

2629
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:09,920
We decided to do it.

2630
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,080
But we didn't understand what we were doing.

2631
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,240
So we was liking it, but we didn't get a point of it.

2632
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,880
This is a Tales of the Troll.

2633
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,520
It was all fun and games, really.

2634
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,560
Some of them took a liking to it.

2635
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,960
All right, I've had enough.

2636
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,000
Yes, Tales of the Troll is a funny comic

2637
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,360
with funny, weird dialogue.

2638
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,120
It's really amusing.

2639
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:27,840
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2640
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,040
Thanks for wasting a minute of my life.

2641
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:34,720
Next voicemail is called, I Know Nate Will Not Be Here

2642
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,600
to Respond.

2643
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,640
Thank God he isn't.

2644
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,320
Three, two, one, go.

2645
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,680
Nate, you coward.

2646
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:46,560
The gamer zone is just the PCP.

2647
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,040
Yeah.

2648
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,920
It's just the same thing.

2649
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,720
You're just doing the exact same thing.

2650
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,680
Also, not even punctual.

2651
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:57,160
All the topics you covered felt like they were like a month.

2652
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:00,800
So if you're editing these things for like a month,

2653
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:01,680
stop it.

2654
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,080
Release them in a timely fashion.

2655
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:07,040
You're talking about like JoJo Part 6 release.

2656
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,480
That's old news.

2657
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,440
Ancient news.

2658
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,520
Feel with the times, buddy.

2659
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:15,480
Thank you for your criticism.

2660
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:19,320
It is just the PCP again, but with different people.

2661
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:21,880
It's the alternative out of Touch Thursdays,

2662
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,240
if you know what I mean.

2663
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,040
Oh, I know what you mean.

2664
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:25,680
I know what you mean.

2665
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:28,200
Yeah, yeah.

2666
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:32,360
Next one is called Josh Loading.

2667
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,320
That's torture.

2668
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,440
Josh Moon, Joshua Moon.

2669
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,000
I don't know.

2670
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,400
Three, two, one, what?

2671
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:44,040
I know what I saw that name.

2672
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:44,800
I know it's coming.

2673
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,920
That's the that's null.

2674
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,080
That's null.

2675
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,680
I mean, I don't know if that's what this is about.

2676
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:50,720
Whatever. Three, two, one, go.

2677
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:00,920
OK.

2678
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:02,120
Cool.

2679
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:03,800
Get a drink of water, maybe.

2680
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:07,640
Cheers.

2681
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:08,640
You OK, buddy?

2682
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:11,640
You good?

2683
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,640
How you doing?

2684
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:17,880
Are they like trying to wheeze with laughter at the bletter?

2685
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:21,200
They're simply overcome by the world.

2686
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,960
They are.

2687
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,840
Next one is an image link.

2688
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:27,600
I haven't seen it, but I'm going to post it here.

2689
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,040
I don't know.

2690
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,040
Oh.

2691
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,040
Oh.

2692
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,040
Oh.

2693
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
How cute.

2694
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,440
It's a pizza.

2695
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:39,120
Pizza, pizza, pizza, he's like a Pokemon.

2696
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,760
He's saying his name is Pizza P.

2697
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:41,680
He's munchy.

2698
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:43,320
Pizza P, it's munchy.

2699
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:46,080
I'll show this to him when he wakes up.

2700
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:46,920
He's back.

2701
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:47,760
Is he still asleep?

2702
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,600
What a bitch.

2703
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:51,000
Dude, we all went to bed at 5 a.m.

2704
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,040
Of course he's asleep.

2705
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:56,480
I guess I got I got like four and a half hours of sleep.

2706
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,320
Why would why would you be awake?

2707
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:59,200
He is snoozing.

2708
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:00,080
Here's another one.

2709
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:05,440
Oh, I think I think this is just a dupe. Okay, they just they posted it. I think they sent the same one

It's actually really cute drawing. I like it a lot

2711
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:13,200
It's cute. I mean it looks like a small child exactly. That's why I like it

2712
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,400
I want to print it out and put it up in our office

I would estimate about like

2725
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:17,540
30 times better with a laser button. So

2726
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:19,420
Going forward

Who are you? They didn't give him congratulations. Her name is cyber shell fan 2003

2742
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:42,860
Cyber shell fan 2003. Good job. I hope you foster healthy and nice and happy relationships in your life

2743
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:59,340
Next voicemail is called

2744
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:02,580
The tale of Tommy J

2745
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:04,780
and here it is

2746
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:07,120
three two one go

2747
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:13,260
Tommy do you think you are funny?

2748
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:19,260
Yes, I am very funny. My name is Tommy J. And this is a funny bet

2749
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:21,980
Give it a really long voice man

2750
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:24,420
many of them facts

2751
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:33,300
Tommy do you think you are a being look I'm playing the heel. I'm being a bad guy, right?

2752
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:36,740
Voice males on purpose. It's hilarious

2753
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:41,060
Know what they say the more times you do the same thing

2754
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:52,180
It's a great bitch. All right, I'm really annoying. That's the bit

2755
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:01,300
It's just kind of shit

2756
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:06,380
I was gonna ask who Tommy J is, but I think I've really gotten all the context

2757
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:16,980
There was a whole saga there was a whole saga with I think I've heard vaguely about it. I don't yeah

2758
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:20,260
Yeah, what it that was I mean

2759
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:24,780
That was I'm enjoying. I'm enjoying the continual pink Floyd the wall

2760
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:27,140
Very

2761
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:30,000
All about Tommy J or just this one. I can't remember

2762
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:34,780
Oh, no, no, that there was cringus bingus. There was it's just like a

2763
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:41,980
Oh, yeah, PCP things. Yeah, I mean to ten ten thumbs up for that one

2764
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:44,940
Well, we could we could

2765
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:50,020
When that's done the PCP will have a better version of the wall

2766
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:55,720
We should yeah, we should release we should release it on an album. We should release an album

2767
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:59,480
We'll take everyone's fan fan voicemail songs

2768
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:02,880
Steal them steal their value their surplus value

2769
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:10,000
Make it into content. Why waste content? That's true. You gotta package it. Yeah, pack it. You're absolutely right, Ben

2770
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,480
When you're right, I know you're right. I know I know it's true

2771
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:21,000
Next next voicemail is called a death note spoiler warning. Oh shit three two one go

2772
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:27,680
What's your opinion on the first half of death note i.e. before else death it's good

2773
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:32,160
I like it. Yeah, it's good. It's like the first anime that I watched of course it was

2774
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,960
But I've only seen like five anime so that's not saying much

2775
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:42,040
The first half of death note. I mean, it's it's good and it's better than the second half

2776
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:47,560
I don't remember the second half, but I know the first half they get handcuffed together and it's so

2777
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:50,040
sexually tense

2778
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,080
Yeah

2779
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:55,200
It's it's it's it's the it really is a yeah we story

2780
01:53:56,040 --> 01:54:00,400
That nobody likes me said when I was nobody nobody wants to fuck Misa

2781
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:03,760
Go away and let the boys have their fun, please

2782
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:10,280
Yeah, I mean I guess the first part Misa is kind of annoying

2783
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:14,720
She's not a very interesting character, but she gets a lot of screen time the whole like weird

2784
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:19,400
I kind of like the weird convoluted scheme where like light makes himself lose his memory

2785
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:23,840
But it's all in the he gets the note back in the end. It's like that's kind of clever

2786
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:28,840
Yeah, it's it's it's like it takes a long time, but when it works out

2787
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:36,520
It's like yeah, it's like the fucking Sherlock Holmes, but evil, but Japanese, but high school student. Hmm. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're in high school

2788
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:40,560
Yeah, he's like they're like 30

2789
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:48,480
Yeah, he he graduates high school and starts college and I think in the sea in the second season

2790
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:56,080
He's like an adult like he works like it's ten years after L's death and yeah light has become like one of the police guys

2791
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:01,520
Yeah, secretly still killing. You know, I haven't seen death in a long time

2792
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:05,960
But I think my and all of our opinions are probably the same

2793
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:13,440
Consensus is which is like first half is great and it's cool and interesting and the second half

2794
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:18,320
I don't even remember what happens. I I remember near and the other guy

2795
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:24,640
I remember them and I remember being less interested in it was definitely like a very

2796
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:27,200
The story was like this rivalry between L

2797
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,720
Yeah, that was what I'm getting rid of it

2798
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:33,440
Like you deflate a lot of the like intrigue of the story

2799
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:41,040
I mean, I mean sort of a punch it again because like the the of the new L near

2800
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:46,320
Who has white hair and he plays with puzzle games and toys instead of like

2801
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,840
Sweet treats or whatever. Yeah

2802
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,920
he's

2803
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:56,120
He somehow manages to outsmart him

2804
01:55:57,040 --> 01:56:01,880
Alongside his like accomplice the yellow haired something or other from bleach. Yeah

2805
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:10,240
Mellow yeah kind of kind of the point kind of the point of mellow and near is that they aren't as good as as L

2806
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:14,560
Yeah, they can't they can't measure up to him, but somehow together they managed to do it

2807
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,960
I can't I can't remember how he gets outsmarted. I

2808
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:21,320
Figure out whether that was smart or whether that was just like

2809
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:26,740
Yeah, it's a good show. It's kind of long. I don't know if I would watch the entire show again

2810
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:32,920
But the fucking the the highs are really high the good mom the

2811
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:38,480
I guess the mangas not nearly as over at the top. It's very much just like presented in a

2812
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:46,400
Straightforward manner, and I'm kind of curious to see how my opinion of the story would change if like the dramatics were toned down. I

2813
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:52,080
Read the first volume of like the follow-up series about like the

2814
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:57,400
It's it's basically death note, but it's like a thing that can make you fall in love. I think

2815
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:01,120
breast

2816
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:03,480
I

2817
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:09,800
Didn't stick I didn't stick with it

2818
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:16,320
You guys watch the you guys watch the movie right the the live-action movie with Nat Wolfe from naked brothers band

2819
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:23,000
Of course, I I think I only watch the English one and I was like, oh, it's in live-action. No, I watched it

2820
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,640
No, I didn't I didn't watch the American death

2821
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:30,080
You know, I really like the ticotomy the the virgin Nat Wolfe playing

2822
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:34,080
Playing light in the not good at all live-action death

2823
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:42,560
Versus the Chad Alex Wolf playing Peter in hereditary and saying mommy and crying weird, which is cool and awesome

2824
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:47,240
Haven't seen hereditary you're at Terry's cool. We should watch it

2825
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:51,000
You'll be scared though. You you might cry then I

2826
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:57,480
Yeah, I might I'm very pretty easily scared by films. I'm pretty easily unsettled

2827
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:00,040
By images on the screen. It is

2828
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,560
It is a tough watch, but it's great movie dear

2829
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:08,480
Well tough watches are even tougher for me

2830
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:13,040
Nick next voicemail is an image, so I'm just gonna post it right here. I don't know what it is

2831
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:17,960
Let's see what we got. I think I forgot something if you forgot then it wasn't important

2832
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:20,440
Yeah, you're right

2833
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,280
Did I say that I

2834
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:29,780
Don't remember. I'm just I say something alluded to the same effect. I probably say this all the time

2835
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:37,800
This does seem like me. It brings true. I don't remember. Yeah, we probably said something like this on the last episode

2836
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:39,880
I don't know. I don't know

2837
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,440
Next voicemail

2838
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:46,440
Next voicemail. Wait a minute before we move on

2839
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:51,080
I feel like maybe I should say a lol Chris Pratt Mario

2840
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,320
What's his name always

2841
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,320
Charlie is Luigi

2842
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:07,520
Jack black is Bowser is awesome something. I'm literally hyped now that Jack black is Bowser

2843
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:14,560
Jack black is really important. It might be kind of good. I don't know. Jack black Bowser

2844
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:19,000
Yes, I don't think I like I don't think I like Chris Pratt as Mario. I don't think I appreciate that

2845
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,320
I think it is very no, I think it'll it'll be so strange

2846
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:28,760
Cuz like well first of all, I don't know what Chris Pratt sounds like. I can't envision in my head. He just has a face

2847
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:33,920
He sounds normal. So like a just some guy

2848
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:39,160
With like what I presume is like a Mario that is reminiscent of the actual video games

2849
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:44,720
You know short stuckey's cutesy with a just a normal guy's voice coming out of his mouth

2850
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:49,840
It's gonna be so weird. I mean, do you think he's gonna do like a fake Italian accent?

2851
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:54,240
If he does it'll be the

2852
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:59,240
It'll be I'm very I think the universe will collapse in on it itself if he does like a Mario

2853
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:04,760
I can't wait for this movie to come out and it's gonna be like Chris Pratt in the real world as a normal person just like a

2854
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,800
a dumb but like like

2855
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:12,360
Nice hearted father who doesn't understand that his wife son play so many video games

2856
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:16,960
Until he gets he's a kite into his son's Nintendo and then he is no

2857
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:21,320
Has to go through all these. Please. It's gonna be a great. Please. No

2858
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:24,800
I should have just given Charles

2859
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:30,160
Mamma Mia been fucking is a kind they don't even have to have Mario talk in complete

2860
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:36,240
Sentences like they could literally have Charles Marnay. Just do it like Wally worked and the characters don't talk

2861
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:41,720
Just do that. Just do Wally with Mario literally goes up and says yeah, Chris Pratt

2862
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:47,120
He's so cool. Mario's gonna be talking a lot in this movie. So we had to make sure the casting was right or some shit

2863
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:53,040
I'm just like he's Charles Marnay. The funny it is mentioning that Mario's going to talk a lot

2864
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:56,680
Like what do they mean? That sounds like it's like you normally doesn't talk

2865
02:00:56,680 --> 02:01:01,600
I guess is well, he doesn't normally talk, but like it feels like a strange thing to highlight

2866
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:06,500
What we've got an actor and they're gonna work part of what announce all this like star-studded cast and they're like

2867
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:11,080
Oh, Charles Marnay is gonna be in the movie doing cameos like imagine voicing Mario for 30 years

2868
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:16,880
And then having to walk in the booth to do cameos for the Super Mario movie like I know I feel bad

2869
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:20,300
It's like like hire real fucking voice actors, please

2870
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:27,460
Like except Jack Black is a good voice actor like he's done other roles that are good like if you said hey

2871
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:34,220
Do a voice acting role for Mario in a theatrical film like he could do it like he's a voice actor. That's his job

2872
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:37,300
Yeah, he should yeah

2873
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:40,900
Illumination slash

2874
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:44,260
Chris Pratt, oh, yeah, okay

2875
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:51,780
I was basically I I mean no my point is why is Chris Pratt Mario Charles Marnay should be Mario? Everyone thinks this

2876
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:54,340
I think it's Jack Black is

2877
02:01:55,180 --> 02:02:00,660
You know, I gotta assume that they wanted Mario to sound more like normal and you know

2878
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:03,980
Martin a gives him like that very like silly like like

2879
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:05,980
Wahoo, yes

2880
02:02:12,340 --> 02:02:16,860
Bowser and the fucking castle's collapsing Luigi we gotta get out of here

2881
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:22,660
I think I see me sounds like yeah, just imagine like Star Lord, but

2882
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:26,620
Mario, I mean Star Wars already red. So if you squint you can kind of already imagine it

2883
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:31,780
Just watch Guardians of Galaxy and squint the whole time interested to see what they do

2884
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:39,740
But because I'm sure it's gonna be strange, but I just don't feel like Mario is a franchise that you can make a movie out of

2885
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:44,820
I feel like this. Yeah solidified my opinion that like Shigeru Miyamoto is a hack now

2886
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:48,900
Like he's washed up. Do you think it's gonna be like f zero?

2887
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:55,860
I'm not like Mario and Star Fox was already bad enough, but this this solidified me Miyamoto's a hack there. I said it

2888
02:02:56,660 --> 02:03:01,940
Well, they said it was gonna be animated by Illumination Studios, which is like the the Minions movie

2889
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:07,540
Yeah, I'm so excited to see what they do with Goombas. I'm sure it's gonna be great. I assume it's not

2890
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:15,660
It's not gonna be like Half-Life action, but they didn't actually specify anything. They're gonna. I mean like they're gonna make all of the like

2891
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:23,580
Lovable little enemy characters like insufferable like I I'm really not looking forward to watching this movie in theaters

2892
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:25,580
Which I will do by the way

2893
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:28,060
I'm not looking forward to but I'm definitely going to be

2894
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:34,020
It's it's a nice day midnight showing

2895
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:40,500
Yeah, I'm just seeing like characters that I love like little like shy guys on screen and being like I love shy guy

2896
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:44,780
And then going to see Illumination making them be like horrible to listen to you

2897
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:52,620
You have to buy your ticket to see this movie because it will be all that they're talking about around the water cooler on Monday

2898
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:57,860
And if you're not in the conversation, then you might as well be fuck be a left

2899
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:06,940
I don't care about Sonic therefore. I didn't watch the Sonic movie. I I love Mario. I'm gonna watch the Mario movie

2900
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,620
I'm just gonna do it. I

2901
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:15,220
Think you're I'm curious the idea of like being in a cinema and and and seeing

2902
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:19,900
You know before you actually watch the movie for the first time it's the first time you're seeing the movie

2903
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:23,300
You know that there's all these famous people playing these Mario characters

2904
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:29,820
You're like what the fuck are they gonna do with this and whatever it is to be bombarded with it on a giant screen

2905
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:33,420
I feel like you would make you laugh so hard. You would die exactly

2906
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:36,380
That's why I want to go to the theater because I think it's gonna be so

2907
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:40,660
Stupid I'm gonna laugh and I'm gonna be entertained genuinely

2908
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:44,140
Perhaps

2909
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:47,580
Maybe the movie will be great and will move me to tears

2910
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:52,540
Anything just like just like my little pony the next generation

2911

Cuz you do you do yourself?

2962
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:40,760
They weren't 3d glasses. They just had a colorful reflections in them

That's okay, though. I like it be creative you do you

2964

Because Christina superstitious about the number 13, but then she just called the next one number 13

2965
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:54,320
Anyway, so wish you 12 9 is the story of night star and night star is a unicorn from a question

2966
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:57,880
She was born the same day as Christine and also tis just like it's okay. So this is me

It's like a guy talking to a girl who's disinterested I know that well

2972
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:22,600
That's misgendering things and I will send you to jail because that's a hate crime

I mean, I don't know what did possess this person to do this, but they did a good job

2978
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:45,120
I like that slime. I'm getting hungry just looking at it. I want to dip my hand

2979
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:48,760
It's such a strange yeah

Yeah, why why these people why this situation? Why is Munchie there cuz it's cuz I'm there

2981
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:59,920
So Munchie has to be there because we're tethered and we don't do anything apart from each other true

2982
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:03,880
I guess that time Ben came to London to annoy mage

And has he was there?

2984
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:13,160

02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:30,480
believe either

3039
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:32,480
spongebob or

3040
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:40,200
That one Batman series that was really popular and like maybe the late 90s or early

3041
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:42,440
2000s the animated one and

3042
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:48,000
But he doesn't like say hello. It's just like you pull up to the register

3043
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:54,200
And then he just immediately starts going into like quoting these and like I I just usually ignore him

3044
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:58,640
But I don't know I feel like I'm starting to get kind of like a guilty conscious about it like

3045
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:04,120
Should I say hi? Should I interact? It's like he's not interacting in a way

3046
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:06,680
SpongeBob memes

3047
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:11,320
Autism or something it's hard to tell I don't know you should you should memorize the both series

3048
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:16,520
And so like you know like when he says a quote you should know like what the next line is and you should say it back

3049
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:19,520
I think that would make his day. That's the lowest man

3050
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:23,840
Just say some spongebob meme or just refer to like the episode with the gray ghost from Batman

3051
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:29,960
Like you should just laugh. I'm gonna say the same thing. Just just fucking do a spongebob laugh impression at him

3052
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:33,480
Really got to test the waters

3053
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:37,000
I don't learn the language kind of leaning

3054
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:42,880
I'm kind of leaning towards the do not interact like just just just just just avoid just avoid

3055
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:44,880
I mean why you open a can of worms?

3056
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,760
avoid

3057
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:53,840
Yeah, honestly, yeah, that's my advice of no Ben's mean and wrong

3058
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:56,160
I'm

3059
02:16:56,160 --> 02:17:02,240
Just Ben Ben Ben. Hey Ben Ben speaking for Ben. Hey, it's a central interacted with a lot and

3060
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:09,680
Don't make that one person that Kona grill. He screamed at them and they cried

3061
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:17,880
Screamed I was a bit annoyed. I was a bit annoyed because he double-charged me for my meal

3062
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:22,040
And I think that you assumed malice though. That's unassumed malice

3063
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:29,280
Well, you got to be firm you got to be firm and you responded in kind with malice. Yeah. Yes, absolutely

3064
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:33,200
That's the only thing they respond to it's the only thing they understand

3065
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:37,680
They talk about the working class is a lower a lower

3066
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:43,560
You know those people that's kind of people. Let me go sharpen my guillotine

3067
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:45,800

Where were you when Ben saying was the fruit fly creator?

3073
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:06,400

There's no more there have been significantly fewer fruit flies. Did you did you salvage the coffee maker is it?

3077
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:25,760
It's on my it's on my kitchen counter. I cleaned it out

3078
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:31,200
I think I might go and do a more thorough cleaning of it soon. It's just kind of I rinsed it out with it with hot water

3079
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:36,520
I feel like it needs to like get soaked. I think I need to do some kind of

3080
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:39,160
Did you get a new mattress yet?

3081
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:42,640

3087
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:10,040
What's even the point of trying to improve my lot if this is where I'm at

3088
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:13,160
It's never gonna get any better. I'm this is that I'm stuck here

3089
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:15,680
So I might as well just embrace it. Okay, I might as well

3090
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:22,760
Just embrace the filth and the end the decay and this my slow decline into into obscurity. It's gonna be okay, buddy

3091
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:24,440
Don't worry about it

3153
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:21,020
Let's go to the chase

3189
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:34,040
That's so cool. I never thought of it like that before

3190
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:41,360
