1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
I was like, oh cool, these guys seem really dedicated to their story, they're really creative,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:11,180
and they have a whole team, and they do a lot of stuff, and I respect this, I like it a lot.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:19,040
But then, I went and I found their other Patreon, and it was for the porn version.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:26,960
The canonical porn stories that happen with the same characters in the same thing, and I was like, oh, oh dear.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,300
I don't, I guess I just don't respect it as much.

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,180
Hello everybody, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,160
I'm your host, not best guy ever, Tom Oliver!

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,300
Wow!

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,240
Already an improvement.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,500
And we're here today to talk about some shit that we don't like, but we fucking hate,

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,940
but today we also have with us, Mumkey Jones!

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:01:00,220
Hey everybody, it's me, the deep-voiced, leather soothing sounds of Mumkey Jones.

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm scared, the Davoo!

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,320
I got my standing mat ready.

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,980
Ben Saint.

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm here to take a shit on all the pieces of garbage on the internet today.

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,240
I can't wait, and the responsible one keeping us all on track, hopefully, the Hippocrite.

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,240
No, that's not me at all. That's that you got that wrong. That's the wrong description. Okay. What do you want to be then?

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
When you go up, okay?

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,480
You're on the right track, and now you're probably thinking but PCP

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,960
Didn't you already do this topic before?

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Good question, viewers.

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,160
I'm glad you're paying attention, but it's well the answer is welcome to

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,920
creators we hate part two

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
The day of recording this today is

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,880
International podcast day. This is a thing that apparently exists Twitter told me so so and Twitter doesn't lie

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,520
So what better things to do on international podcast day than to revisit a topic?

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
We've already beaten to the ground and just

29
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,600
Accept our nature as human beings to just thrive on hatred and things that make us angry

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,280
So that's what we're doing today more things that we hate

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,680
But before we start another announcement that coincides with

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,720
International podcast day is that we finally did it and by we I mean me because no one else did it, but me I spent five

33
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:38,080
grueling hours getting the PCP up and updated completely on iTunes and Google

34
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,080
For all of you fucking peasants use an Android phone everyone's instead of an iPhone

35
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,280
Everyone who has been requesting that we put it on iTunes go you can now go and there it's there

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,760
We do that right now. It's there right now every single episode correctly formatted with description

37
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,320
It took way too long, but I did it. I bit the bullet for the team as

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,000
There it is as someone who's never used iTunes and legitimately doesn't know

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm what I want to ask this question for the sake of people who are maybe retarded like me

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,120
How do you find the PCP on iTunes? Well, it's a huge pain in the ass

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,520
Basically, what you have to do is first you have to install iTunes

42
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,800
Which is like basically knee-capping your computer for life unless you're a dirty Mac user

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,880
But if you can get past that first step if you install iTunes definitely uncheck the automatic updates

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Otherwise, it'll never leave you alone

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,440
Okay, but you just go to the podcast section and you there's a search field you search for the pro crastinators

46
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,320
And it should pop right up. I've tried it multiple times

47
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,060
It has worked. It's the same thing on Google Play music if you're on Android

48
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,800
You just go to the podcast section you search for procrastinators and pops right up along with some other shitty podcasts that we're gonna kill someday and

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,680
Yeah, that's that's that's how it works. It's pretty simple unless you're retarded, which I mean some of you out there

50
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,280
I'm sorry. They're just gonna have to consider the audience

51
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,760
Consider the audience we're talking to I gotta say I never wink wink nudge nudge

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,040
I never thought I'd see the day. I never thought I'd see this happen. Well, but here we are

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,880
The Urban Dictionary definition of hatred

54
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:23,320
Urban Dictionary defines hatred as the trademark sign of love between two cynics often accompanied by sarcasm and clever insults

55
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,280
What the so true that sounds like me and Ben

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, geez, maybe I've learned something about myself today. It sounds like a home stuck to me. I don't know about that. Yeah

57
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Hussie wrote that um

58
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,880
Who has somebody who they really fucking hate?

59
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,080
It's me it's me. All right, so my

60
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
creator that I hate is

61
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,240
He's a pretty big one. He created the universe. It's God

62
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,160
Where do we go from here did young shells and just walk into the room

63
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,560
and

64
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:10,480
It's probably not what you think but because I see I see God as like the John Tron of deities, you know

65
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,600
Created the universe and he had some pretty good content in like, you know

66
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,640
Yeah back when he was in D is you know just doing all that stuff

67
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,960
But then he sort of fucked off after the Bible and he's he's never been he's really done nothing

68
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,360
He's there's there's been no miracles. There's been no new stories

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,640
He really he's just sort of the face of the earth and I works at Bed Bath and beyond, you know

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,200
He pulled us just say the same thing

71
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,480
He promised this big like second coming of his son and fucking up everything and you just collected all the followers and their

72
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,600
Money hasn't done shit with it. What it doesn't we've all been funding him this whole time

73
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,800
Just not he's not and he's not even transparent about it. It's somehow he's gaining more followers despite not doing shit

74
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,680
Not a single update on Twitter or anything, man. Do you know how many views the Bible has?

75
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,680
The ad revenue must be holy shit

76
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,520
Here's the here's the real question though. The Bible

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,680
Does Google let it be monetized? There's rape. There's murder

78
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,560
There's there's tons of things in there that really shouldn't be advertiser friendly

79
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,880
But seems like it gets a free pass for his like history of like, you know, creating everything. What a nepotism

80
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,600
Yeah, I don't can't say I'm a fan that this that just makes me hate it more, you know

81
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,520
It's nepotism and it's the appeal to authority the divine authority

82
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
We do

83
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,600
That was um, yeah, that's it. That's all I got I couldn't think of you wanted to do this episode

84
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,600
You're like, I got this great got this great yucker for the beginning. They're gonna be chucking and yucking all night

85
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,280
I was just gonna duck out for the rest. I've done his part collecting his check. He's good to go

86
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,400
Well, I've got a YouTube creator that I think yeah, let's bring it back down to the realm of mortal men who we can actually

87
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,840
Really sink our tea to figure it out. Literally. It's a recent event that I think should piss all of us off equally

88
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,560
Maybe maybe not a maybe not the divus in the bends

89
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,400
But I think the rest of us will have a bone to pick now. It's no secret that I hate great a under a

90
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,840
But typically it's just in the past. It was because I didn't respect his content and I thought it was unfunny and lazy

91
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,080
But boy, howdy, he made a new update video and he said one of the dumbest things

92
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,400
I think I've ever heard and it made me go from distaste to actual pure hatred

93
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,800
His excuse for not making videos for months was that he was depressed and at one point in the video

94
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,960
He says it is a literally impossible to be funny

95
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:59,040
When you're depressed and he said that as if it was a statement of fact and that just got my blood boiling so much

96
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Instantly you think of Robin Williams Jim Carrey

97
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
Tom Oliver

98
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,560
Hippocrates did you throw all these funny guys who are cripplingly depressed?

99
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,880
So I'd how can he how can he put that statement out there and not expect massive ridicule and hatred, you know

100
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,920
I guess when you have all that ad revenue

101
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,080
You can you just don't have to dig deep and actually try to be creative under pressure

102
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,880
You just use coast for a while. You see, I don't think the problem was that he was depressed

103
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,040
I think the problem is just that he can't be funny in general. So he needed the excuse

104
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,560
It's literally impossible for to be funny under any circumstances let alone. Yeah

105
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,160
Doesn't matter how he's feeling. I I the first few like the very first few great a under a videos

106
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,520
I stumbled upon before he was like a big drama guy and I thought you know, that's that's kind of funny

107
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,080
It's like sort of observational humor, but

108
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Since he's like he's just I I stopped following his following him since and he's like he's just stopped being funny

109
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,640
He stopped being creative or interesting. I wonder whether those are initial videos were just copied from something

110
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,600
Like sketch or sketch sketches that he's seen. I've heard he's a big douchebag

111
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Yeah, I don't know much about him

112
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:23,200
I mean, I don't know. It's it's I didn't watch a lot of great a under a but it felt like a formula that wasn't gonna last and

113
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,800
I guess

114
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,760
that was correct because here we go and

115
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,200
He's really it was it was what I want to bring this up ended by jumping on the drama train

116
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,640
He's kept it. He's kept the lifeblood pumping

117
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
With that with that development

118
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,200
delicious, yeah, and and the reason why I bring this up is not because you know

119
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Like we don't need to dissect his content because we can all agree like you okay

120
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,000
Maybe it was better back in the day, but it went to shit

121
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,360
But just like this one specific thing about depression is what really put him on my radar of hatred

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And that's that's all I wanted to say about it

123
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,960
I hadn't heard that that he said that I made I think you maybe tweeted it or something. Yeah, I was just like

124
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,880
Because I was thinking about that when you tweeted it and I was like mmm

125
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,040
Cat is like that. There's probably something to that in like there's a certain type of humor that you can't do when you're depressed

126
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,640
I didn't look into it at all. I don't think he did either, but it's not impossible

127
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
It's just like when you're depressed everything's more difficult

128
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,960
So I think most of like all the comedians that I have as my favorites and all the ones I respect are very open about

129
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,120
Being depressed you have like a I mean Greg Gerardo back in the day before he fucking died from overdose

130
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,040
Louie CK George Carlin like all these guys were pretty fucking depressed

131
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,560
And I think it fueled their humor and made them funnier because it gives you a

132
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,880
I think a more unique and more comedic outlook on life when you wish you were dead

133
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:53,680
Yeah, it's weird. It's it's like he I think it's like the impossible part like it was impossible for him to make content because he was sad

134
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,280
doesn't

135
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,000
Work you can't just say that and have it be okay. You're you're just it's just a pity party

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He's trying to throw yeah, and he's trying to write off all comedians as oh, I bet they're all you know mentally fine

137
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,640
And just because I personally could not make content because I was too lazy and depressed

138
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,760
That's that's all I gotta say about great a under a let's move on if somebody right so, you know beginning this podcast

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,440
I'm like, oh geez

140
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,120
I mean the only one I really have to think of immediately is I hate everything but we all talk about him a lot

141
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,000
Really my main problem with I he is that he has obnoxious editing

142
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,360
But in a way that I feel like no one else would agree with me

143
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,040
So I don't know how to make that whole rant coherent

144
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,020
But I was just scrolling around YouTube trending to look for other people and I was reminded of someone so immediately

145
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:47,880
Anyone who does parody songs song parodies, but we're like the the parody is that it's like a review of the song that they're parodying

146
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
so I believe the most prominent example is

147
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,340
The key the key of awesome we're like they do song parodies, but like it's not like its own

148
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,120
Idea, it's not like a weird out parody where like they take the lyrics and turn it into like a different song with different meaning with a different point

149
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,920
It's like it's like it's like a song about the song that it's a parody of and it always makes like some snarky points

150
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,320
I don't think I've ever seen something like that, but I can try to imagine

151
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,920
Is it like that they're just replacing words and saying it in like a slightly snarky sarcastic way

152
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
fucking obnoxious is what they are

153
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,640
Because it's like it's like God they have one that's a parody of bad romance, right?

154
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,160
And it's just they're like a but do it but like they change the melody it's supposed to be bad romance

155
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,440
But I guess for copyright reasons they change the song. I'm like, well, what's the fucking point?

156
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,120
I guess it's supposed to be a stylistic parody of Lady Gaga, but it's obviously trying to be bad romance

157
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,680
And this was you know several years ago when that song was new but then like it's not just Lady Gaga

158
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,040
Lady Gaga is in the song. It's a woman pretending to be Lady Gaga again. It's a parody, but it's the same fucking thing

159
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,520
I know but then there's also a lot of bizarre

160
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,320
I know I know I know but like then there's also I believe it the key of awesome is mostly two people a guy and a girl

161
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,640
So there's also Lord Gaga, right? What the fuck is the point of that?

162
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,560
So she's like I'm Lady Gaga and this guy comes in the I'm Lord Gaga. I'm like, okay

163
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,280
How is that a fucking parody of of Lady Gaga?

164
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,080
The only way I could imagine it would be is if there was a twist that they're both the same person because Lady Gaga has a dick

165
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,200
Because that's a joke from 2009, right? I don't fucking know. It's not played up that way and like also it's film

166
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,120
It's the joke supposed to be that they're saying I'm Lady Gaga something like that, but then like no they play

167
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,480
Look isn't Lady Gaga so much like this. Yeah

168
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:41,240
I think it's not even that I think that the joke is her name is Lady Gaga and the male equivalent of a lady is a Lord

169
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Yeah, not terribly insightful and like also the music video

170
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,280
The music video is like filmed in like some random fuck-off hallway

171
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,040
That's like all white because obviously they want to look like bad romance the music video where it's all white

172
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,160
But like they obviously didn't have to budget to make a studio look all white

173
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,280
So it's some hallway and like some factory or something that they were able to find and get permission to film in so it's

174
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,080
Really fucking awkward because it's all filmed in a goddamn hallway just to get it to look white

175
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,080
And it was constantly distracting on top of the entire entire fucking premise of it

176
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,480
Just being weird and they have lyrics like oh doing weird stuff

177
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,160
You know, I believe there's literally lyric making up this shit as we go along like oh wow

178
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:25,540
You're totally parodying. You're just telling us what Lady Gaga style is okay. I gotcha and like they have like another

179
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,440
parody of like one other one direction songs and like as it goes on

180
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,360
it's like about how certain people react to the song and then uh

181
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:39,880
Then it also talks about how the one direction song is similar to the Backstreet Boys' famous song and so they're like oh, yeah

182
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,000
You didn't think we'd notice that did you but like this is woven into the lyrics of the parody

183
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,360
It's so fucking confusing the key of awesome as a parody of um of E.T. by Katy Perry

184
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,080
And it's like the whole premise of the song is about the fact that Katy Perry is trying to make a song

185
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,000
But then Kanye West is in the song and so like Katy Perry is singing to the melody of E.T.

186
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,840
Con yeah, why are you here? This is my fucking song. Don't intrude on it something like that, right?

187
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,520
Like by the end they talk about how like Katy Perry just made the song for the check or something or something fucking like that

188
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm just like what's the goddamn point of these things. I hate them, you know

189
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,560
I hate I hate it when there's like a parody but like there's not like a strong premise to it

190
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,800
It just makes me cringe. It's what I call hashtag conceptual cringe

191
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,620
You know it sounds like it like Jen they're putting in like generic

192
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,280
Oh, celebrities just do things for the money like that's the joke. Yeah, it's not got anything to do with Katy Perry

193
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,000
Delivering the mail just for the money. What a fucking

194
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,760
Yeah, I find it to be like the worst the worst parody people like you know at least fucking

195
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,320
Rucka Rucka all these got like his own like personality and funny jokes that I like and he talks about 9-11

196
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Yeah, but like

197
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,640
Yeah worst fucking parody people. It's really the um

198
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,920
It's just the natural byproduct of any medium or industry getting saturated with fucking cash

199
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,200
People just jump in with no ideas, but plenty of fucking budget and props. You know what I mean?

200
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,160
There's just I remember one time seeing like um it was fucking what's the one?

201
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,920
What's the one republic song about shooting stars and no more counting money and shit?

202
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,800
What's that one fucking stars a fucking one republic song? You would not believe your eyes

203
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,880
Yeah, something like that right. Yeah, of course. Yeah, fucking obviously. Yeah, definitely. You got it. Monkey, but like, okay

204
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
It's that song. It's that song

205
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,680
Like the lyrics are all the same, but it's performed by Disney villains

206
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,080
But like some of the lyrics have changed so it's like it's like it's like a live-action

207
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,400
Interpretation of some of the Disney villains in a music video and they're singing it and even King Scarra's in there

208
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,820
Just a guy dressed like a fucking King Scarre and I'm like, okay

209
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,360
It's like a cornucopia of terrible ideas. Yeah, and I'm like it's coalescing into cringe

210
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:01,240
Yeah, and it's like super produced probably a few thousand dollars at least probably like a studio that you know is actively producing shit

211
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
But they're like, okay, what are we gonna make this time?

212
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,480
Yeah, just there's just like there's no strong like premise there

213
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,800
So yeah, I hate those people and of course they get like millions of views and are super successful and you want to shoot

214
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,560
Oh God one last thing I'm like fucking there's like I remember my girlfriend playing this this like

215
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,520
Combination a medley of fucking maroon 5 just a maroon 5 medley made by some generic youtubers

216
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,400
But like a full music video and everything, you know

217
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,080
It like is mostly centered around that fucking whistle jingle from moves like Jagger

218
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,560
And I was just disgusted by the thought that people care that much about maroon 5

219
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:42,800
This reminds me of I think his name is Brock Baker. Does that sound familiar to anybody? Not I

220
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,480
So he he does a similar thing

221
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,400
But like he'll he'll sing a popular song but in the voice of like a hundred different characters

222
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,040
And he's a really talented voice actor

223
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,080
And I think it's like the right version of what you're describing because it's just like him standing in front of the microphone

224
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,760
And then each lyric is a different

225
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,400
Performing like a different character. So it's impressive and it's not like overly produced or like it's not trying to be a parody

226
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,560
So I think that's if you're gonna do something dumb like this

227
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,120
That would be the good way to do it, but we're what you're describing sounds horrifying bad. Yeah

228
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,560
All right, I have somebody who just who's a brand new creator

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,880
That's fucking horrible, and I hate it and I'm disgusting that exists

230
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:29,080
Susan wasiske. I don't know how to pronounce her last name. She is the CEO of YouTube

231
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,840
Oh, no, and she started a YouTube channel last week

232
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:40,440
Oh, no, oh my and and and it's probably the most disgusting thing ever because it's like the videos like titled something dumb like

233
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,120
How do I make videos on YouTube or something?

234
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,360
It's like I asked a bunch of my friends and so it's just like her saying like

235
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,940
I'm gonna start making videos and then it's like these are the people who are gonna help me and then it's all these like

236
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,400
It's like the rock and like a bunch of other celebrities talking about like, oh, yeah, we're youtubers

237
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,920
We know how to make you two videos and then there's like Instagram models and vinyls

238
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll giving her advice and it's super just like corporately produced and

239
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,620
disgusting and the most horrific thing of all time and it's just like

240
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,600
Everybody hates you right now, and this is the time you decide to try and like

241
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,040
Reach out public facing like I'm just gonna sit here and have fun guys

242
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,680
It's like no get your shit back in the office and fix all the things that suck balls right now

243
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,440
What is wrong with you Tom this is an interesting scenario because you've seen it none of us have

244
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,920
I think we should all try to guess what advice she got and you can confirm if we get it, right?

245
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,540
Because I'm guessing I'm guessing somebody tells her just be yourself on camera and and the audience will follow through

246
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Absolutely, that is one of the points

247
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,320
Anybody else got to guess?

248
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,640
Get a good microphone probably

249
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,840
I don't think that was mentioned, but you know real advice you'd actually should use

250
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:05,000
So so okay, I know I know what they said they said go to the the use the YouTube creator help tools in YouTube and

251
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,040
And you know they're not shit use them. I don't remember that being there

252
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,560
But oh they probably said upload constantly they probably upload as much as you possibly

253
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,960
Said you got it you got to be consist consistencies the most important thing just vomit out that content every day

254
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,160
Yeah, and here's anything we'll do this is the thing that I'm gonna be really

255
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,120
Really interested to see is cuz I I have ad block

256
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,880
But like is this video monetized and if it is of course fuck you

257
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Because like there's only so many ad

258
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,160
To play on videos and so the CEO is gonna take ad revenue from the people whose site she

259
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,240
Like who just posted the light counter and it's 7,000 thumbs up 33,000 thumbs down

260
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,000
7,000 people are either working for Google or need to be executed immediately or they're 12 years old

261
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,520
I have to like from now on in my in my life when I see something stupid on YouTube either like a high

262
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,920
Like or just like bars are stupid comments. I just always

263
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,880
Assume it's a 12 year old cuz what else could it be? I can't imagine a real

264
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:20,720
Those 12 year olds are the ones who are watching your diary of a wimpy kid video and make yeah, that's where that's where I'm seeing all these likes and comments at

265
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,960
Dude fucking have the top voted comments on that video or is this video demonetized, too?

266
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,120
I mean right it's it's it's it's funny once guys, but don't don't beat a dead horse

267
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,720
That would be that would be fucking hilarious if her video got caught as like not suitable

268
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,680
Oh, man, but she would never admit I hope I hope everyone flags the video and yeah

269
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,680
I wouldn't be fucking surprised if shit loads of people like try to flag the video

270
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,140
But obviously like they're just gonna unflag, you know, the you know, you people like automatically

271
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,920
She has CEO shields and just bounces off like

272
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,720
She's got mod power. Yeah, her channel just gets no no strikes at all. It's whatever

273
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Yeah, so I hate her

274
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,680
Because it's just horrible and terrible and disgusting and I can't believe I'm gonna I'm gonna keep watching and see what other cringy shit

275
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,840
That's there and just watch this site continue to fall apart

276
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,920
It's gonna be great. She have right now. I didn't even look I hope zero

277
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,800
It's got to be at least 40 you never know

278
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
The board of directors is all following

279
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
yep

280
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,400
Um

281
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,320
Well, uh, I'll go am I last am I the last one? Yeah, we could probably go around another time

282
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,520
This is gonna be a very short. Yeah, we keep going until we got a channel more hate than that

283
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,120
I mean, yeah, well, I got a I got a general one. It's not about anyone specific. That's that's fine

284
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,680
We can all jump in then go what what I the

285
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,640
just in general the thing that makes me hate anyone is

286
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,560
Just if they're it's just that they're overappreciated

287
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Even if I like what they do then like if I see that they get more appreciation for it than I feel they deserve

288
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,680
I hate them. So just anybody that violates your your your personal

289
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,160
You know such such such beloved content creators such as Digi, bro

290
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,320
You have to have absolute hacks

291
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,880
And I don't I don't even think did you would disagree

292
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,480
He's said before that he thinks it's weird that he makes more money than like

293
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,720
Animators that make anime so I don't know but but but they're they're small they're small fry

294
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,520
They're small fish in this pond we're talking about someone like like Jim Sterling who I like and like I like his content

295
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,960
But he makes like he makes like 12 with like $12,000 a month on patreon for like he's been stuck at like 11,000 since forever

296
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,960
I think it's like 10,000 thing. I I know I know a pretty decent place to be fucking stuck

297
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,200
Yeah, yeah, I wish I was stuck there

298
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,320
I mean, that's how much I make in a year working full-time. So I I see something like that

299
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:08,680
I see something like that and like the good will that I have because I like the things he has to say just

300
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,040
Drain's away and it's left with nothing but resentment in its place

301
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,600
Just so yeah, take some solace Ben and the fact that he's gonna be dead in like six months

302
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,120
That's going good. Oh, is that true? No, but I mean well could be I mean yeah

303
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,240
Is clearly not

304
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,080
Not designed for longevity. Let's put it that way. He'll he'll be crushed under the weight of his himself

305
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Is he a big fat?

306
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,160
You've never seen a gym story video the gym position. I only follow like five YouTube channels

307
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,320
Everybody keeps saying oh, mom. You are you ripping off age three age? Like I don't fucking watch that

308
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,320
I don't even know what it like I know what it is, but I have never watched the video

309
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,640
So stop fucking saying I rip off all this shit you you're definitely doing the right thing

310
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,480
There's just too much shit and it takes away from time like I'm gonna go watch Fargo season three

311
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,840
I'm not gonna watch fucking age three age three productions, you know

312
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,440
We could we could all learn something from this attitude just so we have to I was going to say

313
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,320
Another another example that that girl on patreon who does the art

314
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,360
Sakee me chan sakee me chan like yeah her art's real nice her arts real nice and everything

315
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,560
Is it worth like fucking $50,000 a month? Of course not fuck fuck right off

316
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,600
It's just like it's she all she does is she does the same like like

317
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,800
busts of popular animation characters and then behind the patreon is them without a shirt on or with tits hanging out

318
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,360
And you have to pay for that and that's how you get $50,000 a month

319
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:46,120
I think I think she offers like you know you get to see the process and you see like the sketches and like you

320
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,200
Maybe you can see like videos of her drawing them and stuff

321
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,840
So it's like it's kind of like disguise. It's kind of like sort of educational like ooh learn how she does it

322
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,080
But like it's also like a cam girl where the tit you're seeing are not hers installed on her body

323
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,840
But drawn by her hand, which is just as hot. Oh

324
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,360
There was that there was that girl there was that girl who who I don't know what her name was

325
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,120
But she was like some not particularly well-known artists, but she like she got in some financial

326
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:22,360
Trouble something in the game grumps like tweeted her around and like fucking like help this girl and they did and now she's got like a

327
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:29,300
Whole bunch of money on patreon and she and she kind of like started doing like some fucking quote like erotic photography on the side

328
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,740
She's like this chubby girl who like post-cropics and yeah

329
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:40,060
Yeah, yeah, so that's the lead of it. That's the monster. That's the kind of monster that's created by situations like this

330
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:46,940
What I'm gonna milk digi bro to get that sweets push that we all need to start making a million dollars

331
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,640
Soon I'm I'm calling the police

332
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,380
I'm waiting for I'm waiting for his next stream and I'm gonna swat him. We're gonna swat

333
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,460
You know come to think about it in general

334
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:07,460
I often find myself being find myself with a lot of distaste for like people on the internet who like do art

335
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,620
But like disconnected drawings. There's not like something big and ambitious. They're doing like a big old webcomic

336
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,020
It's actually good and stuff. You know what I mean? Yeah, like

337
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,260
Something that annoyed related to that

338
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,980
People that yeah people that have like OCs and they'll they'll draw like they'll draw like fan art of their own OCs

339
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,380
And they'll call them OCs and then but there's no story to go with it

340
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,860
And it's like yeah, like what's like in general people who like just do a lot of pictures

341
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,700
Like if I really like your art and like your attitude and I can be a fan of you

342
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,140
You know, there's there's a PCP fans who do great art and I love them

343
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,460
But I just feel like when they start becoming like personalities and like becoming famous and stuff

344
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,700
It's like are you really doing enough to justify that? Are you like weaving an incredible artistic experience?

345
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,340
I can change my life to justify you being someone who is revered. You know what?

346
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:01,420
I mean, I don't know like yeah, you know going wait. Can we switch topics to another person or are you not done yet, Ben?

347
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,980
No, no cool. So talking about art people, right?

348
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,460
I I was looking at the trending tab and I see there's an odd ones out video. Do you know?

349
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,460
Do you guys know the odd ones out?

350
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,220
I'm not from no style of video where it's basically just any other kind of YouTube video

351
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:23,700
We're like you just talk about a fucking thing, right? You just talk about a thing any topic at all, but it's like drawn, right?

352
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,820
So it's basically like desperate technique to justify my art major

353
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,540
Technique number 375, right? It's like well, I gotta make YouTube videos

354
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,500
But obviously animation isn't fucking gonna ever work on YouTube again

355
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:42,500
So instead you just sort of have like a slideshow of like your art to like tell us to like make a point, right?

356
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,380
Or like have a rant but instead of like Google images

357
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,140
It's like you fucking tablet all of your images, right?

358
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:53,500
And instead of just having an OC that stands perfectly still that you cut to you actually kind of sort of

359
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,700
animate the OC, right? So like the I've seen some of those things that that they're so

360
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,820
Like banal and like and then I this is the first crush

361
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:10,580
Yeah, this is me and I look like a cute little cartoon. Yeah, that's why you click

362
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:17,180
But instead of being a vlog they just kind of draw a bunch of stuff here. This is what happened in my life

363
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,220
Yeah, I don't I oh, but it's so relatable. Yeah, so I like that

364
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,100
I just don't understand how it even achieves critical mass like that, right?

365
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:34,240
Yes, like something yeah, and generally related to that is like people like owl turds and like the four panel so relatable comics

366
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,340
Yeah, and how those just blow up everywhere. So like the odd ones out

367
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,740
It's really just because a lot of people who consume that stuff are like

368
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:48,180
Teenagers and they just want somebody to say I know what you're feeling because you know parents don't do that

369
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:55,420
It's just young young people who haven't heard it before the thing that I've always found interesting about people who make content like that

370
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,940
It's like how can that feel satisfying?

371
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,780
You know because right when you think about it the people who like that content they have no they don't care about you

372
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,380
They don't care about your vision. They like their content because they see themselves in it

373
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:12,500
So so when they like your work, they're just it's just an ego trip like it's just like so they just see themselves in the work

374
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
And that's why they oh this this is me

375
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,260
But like you the artist and the content itself is completely

376
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,980
Substitutable with anything else they would find like you're not you're not building anything for yourself the minute you stop doing that

377
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,740
No one's going to care anymore, and it just feels like such a fragile thing to build I

378
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,340
Think like the people who make that sort of content aren't

379
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:39,060
Clever enough to realize that that's true, and they will just see all this praise and think oh they love me and they'll feel fine with

380
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:43,220
That well no that was what I had in mind, but of course I guess it's all true

381
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:49,500
But okay, so the odd ones out specifically I posted a screw I posted an image of like the OC for that channel in the chat

382
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,900
It's like this big tubby white and by white

383
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:57,100
I mean like actual white guy with a big old mouth mouth red pants, and he presents himself

384
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,820
You know the characters all like I'm a cutesy you know you know and I get it

385
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:06,180
You know I've drawn OCs of myself, and I just draw it all like cutesy and simplistic whatever I get that kind of fucking ego thing

386
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:12,900
Right, but like the guy who voices him you know the real guy does not convince me that he's like a lovable tubbable guy

387
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:19,300
Right I heard about him during the fucking cool cat controversy because it wasn't just I hate everything who got his videos

388
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Fucked with this guy also did a cool cat review now like the I hate everything review of cool cat

389
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,660
I have not seen the I hate it the odd ones out review of cool cat

390
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,860
I never bothered to see them, but one thing that was really telling to me during the the daddy Derek

391
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,900
Controversy is that you know he didn't delete every fucking video review of his channel

392
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,180
He didn't ever go after YMS directly as far as I know I mean he did like cut ties with him eventually

393
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,500
But like he didn't want to take down YMS's review

394
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,260
But he did want to take down the other guys's reviews even though YMS's review was pretty cutting

395
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,860
But it was respectful and based on what I could tell it seemed like I hate everything and odd ones out

396
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,820
We're not being very respectful to Derek Savage or whatever this fucking that's not savage

397
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:07,060
I don't know fucking everyone's names are but like I watched odd ones outs review videos talking about the controversy with

398
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,580
Derek that he had and he showed a bunch of fucking emails that

399
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:17,020
He he and Derek had exchanged with one another, but like it felt like a weird sort of like leak

400
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,620
It felt like he shouldn't have been showing this on the internet

401
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:25,220
It felt like a violation of violation of privacy and also like the way he wrote some of the emails just seemed like he was being

402
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:31,340
Addict to Derek and I'm like yeah, like I know legally the laws and you publish emails without permission. That's disgusting

403
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,180
Yeah, it was fucking weird, and I think he had like certain reasons or justifications, but it was fucking weird

404
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,220
He was not convincing me that regardless of his legal us

405
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,980
Justifications did he have like the the etiquette justifications, right?

406
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,900
And so I clicked on another one of his videos where he talked about his time working at Subway, right now immediately

407
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,860
You know every Subway employee I've ever met was addicted. I know where this is going

408
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,460
but like

409
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:02,500
He talked about like, you know, it was a shitty job and he had like shitty customers and just talked about like various things and like

410
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,140
He

411
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,340
Thoroughly failed to convince me that like all these different little stories

412
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,140
He was talking about and complaining about weren't just him being bad at working at Subway

413
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:18,380
Like it's always interesting to me when like someone tells me their story about people who pissed them off people who fucked them over and yet

414
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,540
Even though I only heard it from their perspective just by gathering the information

415
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,380
I disagree with their their own conclusions that they weren't in the wrong

416
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,260
Like he just made himself sound like a really shitty Subway employee, but he never like really indicated as much, right?

417
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,380
Just by based on the information he gave me right?

418
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,020
He did not he did not garner any sympathy for me

419
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:42,900
And yet it was all presented with this big old tubby blobby white Pillsbury Doughboy face and I'm like you're fucking disingenuous

420
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,740
You're just you again. It really comes

421
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,380
Obviously I'm probably wrong, but it comes off to me like oh shit

422
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,140
I have an art major got lots of bills to pay can't make animation for a living

423
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:58,180
You're not wrong because I've been to Subway several times and I've never seen a good Subway employee

424
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,980
Because yeah, I know it's because it's a shitty job, but also like seriously

425
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,820
There's a fucking thing on the menu, right?

426
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,300
It's a fully made sandwich with all these different ingredients all listed all in the picture

427
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,660
I point to it saying I want that and they go okay. What do you want on it, right?

428
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:20,060
And I don't know when the message is gonna get up to fucking Subway corporates fat fucking skull

429
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:25,300
When we point at the image just give us the fucking image and we'll customize it if we choose

430
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,460
Why do we have to come up with how to make the sandwich every time, right?

431
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,900
So yeah, that's the cup that's the best when I tell my mom to make the sandwich. She just fucking does it

432
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,760
I don't got exactly the kitchen and point out every little one on corporate cuckoldry that the odd ones out

433
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,860
participated in so I don't I don't yeah, I don't sympathize with him

434
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,460
But he presents himself a sympathetic, you know, I fucking get it, but yeah annoying

435
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:59,220
Yeah, I have I mean, it's really I was thinking about like who do I hate? I don't really hate like many people I hate like

436
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,300
Practices that people do and it's really always based around like Ben was saying

437
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:13,020
Undeserved stuff like if somebody just sucks and they're and they're getting no views, then I'm like, well, I mean all's right with the world

438
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Market has spoken correctly

439
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:22,820
Wait, so wait wait timeout Tom. So are you do you mean to say that sometimes the market can speak incorrectly?

440
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,500
According to my own subjective interpretation. Yes

441
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,420
But it's the invisible hand. It's like whatever happens

442
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:38,100
Balls I mean you saying you've never seen have you never seen something monkey that's been like real popular and you're like

443
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,100
I can't believe people like this. I hate it. I wish it would go away

444
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,900
I can see why I personally don't like it

445
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,980
But like I said earlier all every youtuber is 12 years old so I can see why it is popular

446
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,060
Well, that's my whole thing like why I wouldn't like like like at the end of the day people are gonna like what they want to like

447
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,780
And I'm just saying in my personal opinion

448
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,540
They're retarded and so when when my personal subjective

449
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,540
Opinion on what the way things should be and life itself syncs up

450
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,660
There's like there's a quaint little moment of Zen where I'm like, yes, things are okay guys

451
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,260
And then I shouldn't say that the market is wrong. You should be like well, I guess I disagree with the market. I

452
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,180
Was talking about my perspective what the market be not the market

453
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,060
Well, it's like let me let me give another example

454
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:31,180
It's like when someone when someone gets popular like by accident or like by random chance

455
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,220
Or just because they happen to be in the right place at the right time and thereafter

456
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,900
They they continue to make content that is just like what anyone else makes but because they struck at the right time

457
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,900
Well, the iron was hot their videos can succeed their art can succeed or whatever

458
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:50,540
Whatever it is where other people's wouldn't even at the same level of quality, you know what I I have I have the guy

459
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:55,700
I hate the guy who changed or created the YouTube algorithm. I

460
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,380
Hate that guy whoever he is. He created that programmer. It's probably Nate fucking

461
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,380
I

462
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,060
He made it so that he made it so that people can just succeed by you know random chance

463
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,720
And then they don't need to be good and everything sucks and a YouTube sucks

464
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:20,160
You can only be popular if you make videos about gals or videos about diary of a wimpy kid. Yeah, that's pretty much

465
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,980
Yeah, fucking spider-man and

466
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,380
Can I say that I hate Nate? He's one of the creators I hate

467
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,620
Already I already called him out as one, but yeah, please go on

468
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,580
Not not do you think he's gonna listen to this episode?

469
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,020
Of course nothing to do nothing even to do this content is contents fine

470
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:43,540
But can I just say the man the man I have a bone to pick with the fact that a couple years ago

471
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,980
We went to a convention and I owed him money and I had to pay him back

472
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,460
He was like I you you're short 80 cents, buddy. I had to pay Palom 80 cents. Oh my god a load of fucking shit

473
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,460
Oh my god

474
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:00,980
Bastard ever and he's not here so I can say it Nate that was fucking gay. I was not cool with that at all

475
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,980
That's a little weird. It was it was it was disgusting

476
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Yeah, but you know, it's only 20%

477
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:15,540
20 cents off and just like almost a whole dollar. That's like I'm that was like, you know like two packs of gum

478
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,540
I could have enjoyed it. I'll never have

479
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,140
Yeah, but I don't like I don't care about him I care about me

480
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:29,500
And then PayPal probably took out 60 cents out of the 80 cents that you sent him probably I do see the gesture

481
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,860
Yeah, I do see you wanting to get back the money you're owed

482
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,420
But when it's such a little amount and it's one of your friends. That's when it sort of gets weird

483
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,780
And the thing was is like this was like like back in like I think it was like 2014

484
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:48,860
So we had only known each other for a little while. So I was just like, oh, oh, huh, how can I make our relationship even stronger?

485
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,740
I know. Oh, bitch about 80 cents

486
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,820
Sounds like him

487
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:02,500
Back so yeah, I just I had to get that off my chest. It's been burning in my soul. You can't say that on an episode when he's here

488
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
No, I couldn't

489
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,300
Beat you up. Yeah, I can take potshots and not have to feel guilty about it until later. Oh, hey guys

490
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,660
I got some good news

491
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,700
Digi bro, you might have heard of this guy. Did you bro?

492
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:21,660
He told us in the chat that he is like 16 episodes behind on the PCP so we can talk shit about him too

493
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,500
And he'll never know. Yeah, but the hammer won't come down for another several week

494
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,420
Yeah

495
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,740
We can avoid punishment his is wrathful vengeance. Yeah, we're in the eye of the storm right now

496
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,740
We can do it

497
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:41,460
Funny though is we could tell the audience like go tweet this thing at Digi and nobody explained

498
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,660
What's going on and then he's not gonna have any idea where it's coming from

499
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,300
We like what should we make everybody tweet at Digi right now something stupid

500
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:55,580
Pictures of like cantaloupe or something shit like everybody just tweet Digi a picture of a cantaloupe and yeah, the hot new meme

501
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,020
Oh, yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, that's something

502
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,620
And no one tell him why we're what you guys

503
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,580
Yeah fucking mean if you if you fucking tell Digi what's going on

504
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,780
I'm gonna come to your house, and I'm gonna give you a

505
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:17,340
I want so much on this on the PCP Twitter. No, no, no second chance. You're done. Yeah

506
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,860
This is serious. Yeah, but I'm in charge of the ship now and there's new rules

507
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:27,320
What I want to see what I want to see is Digi just coming into the chat one day and saying what the hell is up

508
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,220
And for us to just type LOL in caps

509
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Oh

510
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,880
See folks if you let this happen, I will send the screenshot of us all laughing at Digi on the PCP Twitter page

511
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
Looking forward to that what a reward

512
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:51,420
What a good meme. Oh, man. We're so funny on the PCP podcast legendary. We like to have jokes

513
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:58,340
We like to we just don't do it very often. We like that fill that audience involvement, you know building some rapport

514
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,940
Keep your eye out for the for the PCP cantaloupe t-shirt up for sale eventually

515
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,820
And in the corner of the t-shirt Digi's like sitting there with a confused face like

516
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,660
Hey guys hippo is that the end of your your your thing

517
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,580
Well, I was gonna go a bit more into go ahead. I got a good one, but I'm gonna wait for it. Okay

518
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,420
So I was like yeah the people who

519
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,740
Undeservedly get views and stuff

520
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,740
It's it's always annoying when they're just they're not very good and they don't try very hard and they get everything

521
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:35,540
They could have ever possibly need but what I you know what I hate specifically is

522
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,780
I had I had something in my head

523
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:44,700
I'm just trying to just trying to you know trying to figure think of it think of it as I say these words that like mean nothing and I

524
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,380
Really shouldn't have like continued to say one, but I just shoot

525
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Just

526
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,820
Monkey you really hate people who like don't think about what they're gonna say before they say it and then they just start speaking

527
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:03,140
Bullshit, I thought I could remember it. Oh god. Tom is ruthless tonight. They're in everybody. I'm drunk on power now that Nate's not here

528
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:10,700
Now I'll kill you guys. Here's the worst type of content creator on the internet again like what Ben was saying

529
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,700
It's like a broad category

530
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:18,340
People who live stream video games with their girlfriends. Oh god

531
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,940
absolute shame

532
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,340
Disgusting I never watched anything like that, but just the description alone sounds more

533
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,460
That's all I got to say like does anybody want to add to this like DeVoo Ben

534
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,340
Yeah, I got don't do it. I got a thing. I

535
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,140
mean with

536
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,340
With such a practice the only reason a woman should be on a live coming to bring you a sandwich

537
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,420
Not from subway though

538
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,300
They probably made it wrong

539
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,180
She pointed in a picture you didn't understand what was going on I

540
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,420
Will say that like it doesn't matter unless if the person is funny, right?

541
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,140
But here's a thing. I hate the most of all is

542
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:09,980
Mike and Ryan on Cinemastica. Oh my god. Yes. I hate it. It's it's it's it's it's the same

543
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,620
Principle as bringing your girlfriend on because it's like

544
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,500
because

545
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,300
You know not all girlfriends are like perfect for YouTube if you're a youtuber

546
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:24,220
You just you don't look for people who are good on camera if you're a youtuber. That's just not exactly how it works

547
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,940
Really so as you know if you have your girlfriend on it's because you're there

548
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:36,020
They got to be in this spotlight because they fucked someone and basically it's the same thing with Mike and Ryan

549
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,580
This guy I don't say I'm not saying he's fucked. I think Ryan did fuck Mike

550
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:46,220
But um this Ryan guy is so boring and Mike is not as funny as James

551
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,460
Keep doing it over and over again. Why is he there killer?

552
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,020
Cuz Mike Mike starts off as the like sort of unfunny sidekick to James

553
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,420
And then we make him the main guy and then give him an even unfunnier sidekick

554
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,540
It's like it's two degrees of unfunny sidekick. That's been forced upon us. Yeah

555
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,420
Because like you know I haven't I unsubbed

556
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:13,820
Cinemastiker I was like phasing in and out of being subbed to cinemastiker for a couple of years like around 2013 or so

557
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,140
But I've officially unsubbed it and stayed unsubbed

558
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,260
It's just like I'll watch the ABG in episodes when I feel like it

559
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,140
Maybe I'll watch a couple other James centric videos when I feel like it right but because I'm not subbed

560
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:29,340
I don't feel the pressure to get back to it really what it is is the whole cinemastiker wagon just couldn't

561
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:35,420
Keep it's real it just kind of got fucked in the modern YouTube era of constant upload

562
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,580
It's because James just doesn't do

563
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:44,580
Constant uploads and he needed to like get some other like shitty people to attach on to himself to like to like pump out more

564
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:51,220
Content, you know like he sort of treated the the monster madness where he did a one review every day for all of October

565
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:57,580
Which he came up with in 2007 he sort of treated that like a big special thing that he literally said takes all year to work on

566
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,700
So for him doing consistent content, even if it's short videos doesn't work

567
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,140
So that's what has fucked his channel right and it first started around

568
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,100
2012 when he first went off to film the ABGN movie and he sort of gave the channel keys over to

569
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,940
Mike during that time and Mike made some of his own videos

570
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,660
And this was when Mike finally kind of stepped into the spotlight really up to that point

571
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:23,900
All Mike had done was play like special characters in certain ABGN episodes in which he was really funny

572
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,860
And he also drew AVGN title cards

573
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:31,860
So like he was like this guy in the background behind the curtain who helped a lot but in the modern YouTube age

574
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:37,500
It's like get as many faces on as many videos on as many days the calendar with as much runtime as possible

575
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,280
So James has exhausted all of the fucking people he knows

576
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:48,860
And yeah, it sucks. I never I've never watched the Ryan videos because as soon as I look at them

577
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,860
I'm like well this guy's obviously never gonna say anything interesting ever

578
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:58,020
Yeah, but whenever I accidentally click on one like I'm like, oh wait, that's Ryan immediately

579
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,780
You know backspace like I I I've never seen a single second

580
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,900
I mean, I've probably seen one video to see wait

581
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:10,220
This is like where I discovered that I hate this idea right and ever since then right and like

582
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:15,740
And like honestly equivalent of having like game grumps be exclusively Barry and some other

583
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:21,780
Yeah, I'm trying to think of like the least funny game grumps

584
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,380
It was like Susie and Holly only I wouldn't want to watch it

585
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,020
Yeah, the thing right is that is like good

586
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:34,260
I think the worst thing and I I'm gonna talk about out of my ass at least slightly because I'm like

587
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,860
Seven episodes of AVGN behind which is to say like a year or two behind but like I honestly feel as though

588
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:48,420
All that extra content them like dilutes the AVGN series in a number of ways first of all the set right originally

589
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,940
The eight the nerd room felt like an area in a show

590
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:58,420
It felt like this sort of magical property that was put together through the force of storytelling because that's how it was presented

591
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:03,940
Yeah, but once it's used for like everyday vlogs and all sorts of let's plays and other things

592
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:11,020
It just feels like this guy's room. It it breaks down the barrier right it makes it less of a character, right?

593
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah, oh, no, this is pretty much all just really me

594
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:22,120
After all right well, I mean that they don't shoot in that room really that much like they've done okay

595
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,360
Well, they've done a few let's plays and Mike and Ryan is usually just in a white. Okay

596
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,200
Well, I remember originally it wasn't like that maybe in Ryan's house

597
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:36,240
But like also like James like the nerd as a character like the whole fucking character thing does not work anymore

598
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,400
I mean it still works on a yeah, just not as well because

599
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,000
Everyone knows because you see him being himself so right you see yeah like like for example

600
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,800
Imagine if mr.

601
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,380
Betong did shitloads of vlogs and let's plays his whole like persona that he puts on in

602
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,560
His actual videos that he makes every like couple of months or handful of once or twice a year

603
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,040
Wouldn't work as well because you know this guy way too well like like you know the mr.

604
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,480
Plinkett series has to really bend over backwards to keep like a building up the illusion of the character by like being

605
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,720
Really extensively written having a totally different voice from what's the class that actually sounds like and shit

606
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,760
You know what I mean like they have to like really

607
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,720
Do so much to keep justifying the character and it works fine, but with James versus the nerd

608
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,440
There's not that much difference

609
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:29,760
It's more like the nerd is just sort of certain cartoony voices James naturally does just all the time rather than some of the time

610
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,720
And it's just like he's wearing a white shirt instead of any random dark shirt, right?

611
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,280
I think actually James probably goes out of his way to wear dark shirts to make himself not look like the nerd

612
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,960
Otherwise he looks to say exact fucking same and like the whole format is just pointless

613
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:48,600
You know you see people like like Digi and a lot of us who originally just made like regular sized videos before the whole modern YouTube

614
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,800
Eric I kind of got like a fish it officiated

615
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,080
And they would just do regular videos and the occasional podcast

616
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,320
But once Digi started doing vlogs and let's plays constantly

617
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:03,000
He changed the nature of his main channel content to reflect the fact that like the way that you absorb his

618
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:09,120
Narrative is different now and like the AVG and format's just kind of dated for that reason and like I you know

619
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:14,960
There's a part of me that wants to say well James would be able to keep his head above water and make plenty of money without

620
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,600
Falling in line with the modern YouTube format just by doing a patreon

621
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:26,160
But he's got a wife and kid and probably still debt to deal with after that movie. So, you know, I get it but fuck I

622
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,520
Think AVG and should start wearing a hat because seeing the nerd

623
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,560
Balding is this discerning to me. Oh, I want to see that happen. He heard he's he's project

624
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:45,560
I mean like for example that there have been little tiny hints or like jokes rather of the idea of that the nerd shows gonna

625
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,320
Be around for a long fucking time and James is gonna get really old like like one time

626
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,840
He pulls off some games already happens right. Yeah. Yeah

627
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,040
Like there's one time where he's pulling games off a shelf to talk about a certain company and they're like now

628
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,040
This company also made this game called raid

629
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,400
2020 maybe I'll review that game in the year 2020 at the time I laughed right now

630
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,080
I'm like, oh, he's really gonna do that. You know, his fans aren't gonna let him forget that shit

631
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,080
He actually who who would have ever thought he'd still be going right back

632
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:17,920
Right, this was back when we didn't realize that youtubers just never fucking died and never stopped like on rare occasions

633
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,480
They'll stop this isn't like a show forever right doesn't end right just because it's just a guy because it's just a guy in his

634
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,600
Basement, yeah, we can see we can see through the veil right James actually said years ago that he's like

635
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,000
I'm never gonna stop doing AVG and even if it's only one a year because it's so it means so much to me

636
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,480
And I'm like I like that because I want to show to continue forever

637
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:42,520
But like he even has like a Christmas special episode from 2007 where he like he goes through the fucking Christmas Carol

638
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,240
So he sees his future self and it's like him was like a white wig and a big white beard reviewing the Wii

639
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,480
He's like remember the Nintendo Wii. Yeah, that's what they called it

640
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,840
And so he like plays boogie and like us like

641
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,120
Monkey ball and I'm like dude if if James gets to be like his fucking 60s

642
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,640
And he decides like you know what I'm gonna actually be that version of the character

643
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,280
I'm gonna grow a beard and be like a really fucking old nerd, you know

644
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,640
Yeah, I think he'll I'd still watch he will look I don't think it's and like look the show is still good

645
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,620
The show is not a wash. He actually does update the character like he updates the way the character like

646
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:27,840
Feels like the the style of anger that he portrays in the videos has evolved tons of times

647
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,760
So the show is gonna last forever. It's never gonna get shit

648
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,280
I am a Joe. It's just the modern format that he has to fit himself through. It's just kind of unfortunate

649
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,480
That's that's the real worst thing ever is is YouTube as a platform

650
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:52,720
Just becoming more sterile and cookie cutter and allowing flexibility for anything. I've I've fucking I've fucking got it

651
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,840
I've got something that I hate

652
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,080
It's another broad category and this is way fucking broad

653
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,840
This is like literally everyone is guilty of this in some way. Oh, no, and it's

654
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:08,040
Creators whose art is basically just about themselves or about their art. Yeah, everyone

655
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:15,520
Yeah, yeah, like people eat that shit up like like when a like when a story gets gets like when a piece of work gets

656
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:21,800
Real cheeky and like breaks the fourth wall and ooh references this song this thing or says something that only the fan base

657
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,080
Would get his little nod people eat that shit up

658
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:30,480
But like over you go to go overboard on that shit even a little bit and it's like what the fuck am I watching like this

659
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,560
This thing that I'm consuming is just jerking itself off about how important it is and why do I even bother, you know?

660
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,080
And when someone like yeah, like like drama channels like great a under a or like

661
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:47,560
I don't know the fucking so many people like like they're they make YouTube videos like vloggers

662
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,280
They're making YouTube videos about the fact that they make YouTube videos

663
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,180
That's the story that I'm watching and it's like oh my fucking God

664
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:03,400
Fuck do we need Ben you have no fucking idea? I have that I have that like a pevney like weekly if not daily of like

665
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
One so you just need to have it once

666
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,920
I don't know what the word doesn't go anywhere that that that moment of morbid

667
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,800
Nihilism I guess because it's like I often am triggered by it by something like something

668
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,560
It's very obvious like a lot of rap which is just like I'm a rapper and I'm rapping and people think about this about my rap

669
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,400
And this is what their reaction to my rap is and this is my response to that reaction

670
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,240
It's like damn like the whole point of rap

671
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,960
Hey, that song is really good. Yeah, I know right. I don't know there's there's a place

672
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,160
There's a place. Oh, yeah, like meta commentary in art

673
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:43,360
But like when when I feel like what someone does is just comment on themselves. It's like yeah, fuck this guy

674
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,120
Yeah, yeah, so like so fucking so I think about that

675
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,640
But then I think well ultimately everything you tell even if it's a fictional story

676
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,160
It's just things you're thinking about yourself. It's just it's just all you and your ideas

677
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,000
That's just represents you but then like deceptively

678
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:03,600
Woven into a narrative and ultimately everything's like that and then I think well literally everything not just art

679
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:09,000
But like you know people selling hot dogs like they're just there to perpetuate the selling of hot dogs walking down the street

680
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,720
You're just there to get somewhere everything everything doesn't have a point like everything is like

681
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,640
Sort of goes into my general philosophy of no matter what life you're living

682
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,400
You're always thinking you're not really living the life of living, you know, like you're not really really living a real life

683
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,840
It's like if you decide to live your life one way

684
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,800
then all you can think about is how you're not living all these other ways that you could be living and

685
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,800
Representing all these other things that you could be representing and ultimately there is no point and ultimately everything is basically life

686
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,560
Is a game of hot potato where you go from one vice to another vice to another thing you have to do and

687
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,440
Until you're dead right and that's like the whole point of life

688
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,280
So the whole point of a YouTube video is just like it's just justify itself

689
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,040
And then you're watching the video and then that's the point and then you go to buy a burger and like the whole point of the

690
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,200
Burger is just to get a burger the burger doesn't enhance your life in any way

691
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,600
But then like you can get money and the money doesn't enhance your life because you buy things that don't enhance your nothing

692
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,120
Nothing, but nothing matters. There you go

693
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:07,240
So basically you can go from complaining about meta commentary going it immediately escalated to absolute nihilism pretty quickly

694
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,960
So that's kind of why I try to avoid thinking that way, but it's kind of hard, you know

695
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,000
But my but my do I do I do agree that money does not improve your life

696
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,200
And I'll take that burden off your hands if you want to just well

697
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,840
So you don't worry about it anymore

698
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,680
But but I my two points are related because when when I see someone like a vlogger

699
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:33,640
Who whose whole deal is they just talk about themselves and their life is them making vlogs and it's a big incestuous circle jerk

700
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:40,080
I see someone like that and then I see someone getting super popular for doing that and getting tons of money on patreon

701
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,640
And I'm like what are these people seeing in this? What are they paying for?

702
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,720
What is that would make Casey Neistat was there was that something else?

703
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,320
I didn't more or less. I don't really know anything about him

704
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,600
But I can like the back when Pokemon go is a thing hippo, you know, but the trainer tips guy

705
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,040
I started watching this vlogger who's the trainer tips guy because he would talk about the game

706
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:05,440
And I was interested in the game at the time and the dude blew up and he just fucking vlogs now

707
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,000
It makes daily videos about his life playing Pokemon go and people fucking eat it up

708
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,800
And I'm like geez like just like Jim Sterling like I like this guy like I like what he's saying

709
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:22,800
I don't understand how it fucking can blow up like this. I don't think he deserves this much success from something

710
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,400
So, you know fucking fucking not fucking basic

711
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,520
God damn, it's I mean with trainer tips. It was really just he was the

712
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,160
When it when it came to actually explaining the mechanics of the game and what's you know the updates and everything

713
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,760
He was like the best YouTube channel for that

714
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,280
But then he did like like there were less updates

715
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:53,040
There was less stuff going on and he just sort of started vlogging and then vlogs became so much of like the part of the video

716
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:58,000
But it makes me know people got invested in his life because he's I don't know. He's got loads of charizards

717
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,640
He's just I mean he's he plays the game a lot, but he's just regurgitating stuff that like people are posting on the on the on the

718
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,020
Subreddits, he's just regurgitating info that people on the subreddits are posting. I know what the

719
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,520
What is the point? I know the reasoning I think I well

720
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:18,640
I think what it is is is that like people who watch YouTube generally when it's like a vlog or a let's play

721
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,700
They want to feel the company of another yeah, exactly. I was a friend. Yeah, I want to pretend

722
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,940
I understand like like I'm saying all this I'm saying all this with with the nut

723
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,940
Like I do understand the appeal because like I was watching the video

724
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:37,020
So I get liking it, but then the fact that like when it then it gets really popular and I'm like, oh fuck this

725
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,260
You know, this is this is what I'm this is the phenomenon. I'm describing in action

726
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,980
You're seeing it right now someone whose content I like then I see it successful and like no

727
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,980
I don't like it anymore. Fuck you buddy. Well, then let me ask you just called being a hipster

728
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,680
Yeah, let me ask you a question just to gauge which which vlogs are okay to which ones aren't

729
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:56,780
Okay, sure a vlog about going to a water park. Yeah, your name

730
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:04,820
Depend if it only if it makes less money then the trip costs well if it turns out

731
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:11,460
Definitely did so okay, if it doesn't turn a profit, then I'm okay. I think I put him in debt

732
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:20,860
Good that's true. I only like water park vlogs when the person at the water park eats a whole bar of chocolate before

733
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:26,080
Did he do that in the video? I think you did. Oh, yeah, that was his breakfast. You're right

734
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,020
This mystery person

735
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,660
Is them with their shirt off making like a weird gesture towards a water slide

736
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:41,740
But we'll never know that that episode of PCP has way less views than any other one

737
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:51,300
You're talking about like it's we're entering a we're entering the fucking Wally society where you know

738
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,260
Everyone is just sort of in shares just doing nothing like that's but that's the world

739
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,020
We're going to where people just plug themselves into YouTube forever

740
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:05,220
And all we need now is just 3d printers to make food and and it'll be done. This is why this is why I think Isis

741
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:12,720
Isn't yeah, I think the constant threat killed and beheaded for no reason really makes you appreciate

742
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,740
That we really need yeah, yeah

743
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:19,020
We really need some some strife in our lives if we're gonna do it's just a big difference

744
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,980
I think fundamental difference between the way that I

745
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:28,540
Especially when YouTube was branded new was like getting engaging with YouTube the way it was originally engaged with the way it is

746
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:33,300
Versus the way it is now and especially by like just you know kids who are discovering it

747
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:39,640
You know as it's already in this this modern era of like YouTube is this thing you throw on and just endlessly

748
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,340
Swimming forever, you know and

749
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:47,260
For me, you know for people when it back when YouTube was new and limited didn't have that many videos

750
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:53,340
None of the videos were that good. It was like going to like a weird store to like a trinket shop to think

751
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,260
Whoa, what am I gonna?

752
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,420
What am I gonna pick out?

753
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,100
It was sort of like going to the movies and like what movie am I gonna see like what YouTube video?

754
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:03,780
I'm gonna watch going to blockbuster. Yeah, it's like on a blockbuster and picking out videos based on the code

755
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:08,580
Right, but now it's like just you just throw something on you know and that's literally how you get popular

756
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:15,420
You got to get popular by like engaging the I'll throw something on audience and not the ooh what video am I gonna watch audience?

757
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:21,020
You know and I think it's shit and it didn't have to be that way cuz you know like my fucking you know

758
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:28,300
The invisible hand of the market logic goes well YouTube optimize itself or what would you know make you know?

759
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,140
Get the most eyes glued to the most screens and wreck in the most cash

760
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:37,160
And I think that eventually once social media has hit like a fucking

761
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:43,060
Event horizon where everything just spills over and it hits this like the bubble bursts

762
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:50,500
You're gonna see the the rise of like rebellious social medias that really focused on like culling down the quantity and really ramping up

763
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:58,100
The quality and like they'll finally be real competition for YouTube assuming that this fucking adpocalypse reaches critical mass

764
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:04,540
right and like people will will pursue these other places these other YouTube alternatives as like a fucking

765
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:08,180
Identity statement and like the algorithms of those websites will be all about

766
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:15,380
About quality over quantity and and yeah that that I feel is the only thing that's gonna stop the critical mass of longer

767
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:20,420
longer longer pointless or pointless or pointless or vlogs about everyone everything all the time is

768
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:26,420
Outright rebellion outright like the human nature's desire to say fuck you to the establishment

769
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:30,360
So we just got to wait for this whole vlog to get established. I believe in that I

770
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,360
I

771
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:37,320
Think oh that I hope you're right. That sounds like a miracle waiting to happen

772
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:43,840
It does it I mean that does yeah, it's a miracle because I feel like cuz I've seen a talk by a guy. It wasn't a Ted talk

773
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,080
Fears right now this was no Ted talk viewer

774
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:56,280
Yeah, he was explaining that the possibility is there that in the future

775
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,080
Privacy is not going to be a thing that people grow up knowing what it is

776
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,300
Technology technology is going to to turn all this sort of YouTubey

777
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:13,000
Just mindless entertainment into you know technology like phones and chips you put in your head that

778
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,640
Stream your whole life and experiences

779
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:22,400
Across the internet for everyone to see and everybody else is also doing that and it's just a big sea of everybody knows

780
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:29,180
Yeah, we're already in we're already entering this era with say, you know elected officials where they're constantly having scandals about things that

781
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:33,540
Politicians have always done in every administration every country ever

782
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:38,920
It's just that they never got caught because they we didn't have camera phones back then we didn't have gorilla investigators and like

783
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:45,820
Half the time I think like half the shit that people got that that that put Trump into the hottest of waters was like some random thing

784
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:50,900
He said one time at some point 20 years ago that there was a mic in front of and someone uploaded it

785
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:58,060
Right and eventually, you know cut to 40 years from now or even 30 years from now when like millennials start running for office

786
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:01,840
We're gonna have a place where like everyone who wants to be there like a fuck

787
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:07,020
Everyone's so fucked like it's gonna be like you tweeted this one thing when you were 15 right?

788
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:11,500
Well, I think it's gonna end word and you you're fucked. Well, you guys are fucked

789
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:16,220
No, no what it's gonna be at the end where it's gonna be a goddamn critical mass of like well now

790
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:21,300
Everyone is exposed on the internet. Everyone is bad. We now know everyone's dirty laundry

791
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,580
So now you have to select your vote based on entirely different parameters

792
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:31,900
And then people will just stop giving a shit about all those things because everyone will know who I don't know if I have enough faith in

793
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:39,000
Humanity to believe it'll become a question not of who's got the least dirty laundry, but who's dirty laundry's smell is the least

794
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:45,520
Cuz the example you used was Trump and that was some dirty-ass laundry and then he won

795
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,640
For saying the n-word all the time but hit by the way

796
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,320
My my biggest creator that I hate is Donald Trump

797
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,960
United States of America

798
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:04,440
Creating because he's creating plans to destroy Isis and we all know we need

799
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
Yeah to appreciate life

800
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,000
We need Isis to stop walley from happy ready for questions

801
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,080
Donald Trump wants to fix all our problems and I hear to say no we need our problem

802
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,680
I feel like we've been going for an hour. Is anybody else have any like last minute?

803
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:23,840
I think so I have a couple of ones a little quick like tiny one couple just one just one just fucking one

804
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,960
Can we do a third episode? I have only have one

805
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,440
Which is innocent obviously right and I have fuck yeah

806
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,240
My opinion goes without saying worse worse and has always been like well obviously they just slap these videos together

807
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:43,320
What the fuck ever it's mildly amusing sometimes if I care about the movie whatever but then no, but it's fucking nonsense

808
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,840
Yeah, well then a friend of mine recommended me these videos called like cinema sins sins

809
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,840
I don't remember what they're called, but there's this guy who like rebuts cinema sins with like just yeah

810
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,760
I mean one of the he's not like only five of them

811
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,520
Which is all you really need to be convinced most of them are of the Marvel movies reviews like yeah

812
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,360
I watched the Civil War one right right where this guy rebutted their

813
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,560
videos

814
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,760
Yeah, he made really good. Yeah, so like at first

815
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,680
I was kind of naysaying this guy because the way he made his case especially in his first one against them

816
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:20,960
Sounded just like a stupid fucking comment of like oh cinema sins is misleading the audience misinforming them about to the movies

817
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:26,520
It's just so inaccurate the videos are inaccurate and it's just blue and like he had a really respectful tone

818
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,480
I was like under tailoring him up there for comedic effect

819
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,520
But it was just I was imagining the transcript of this guy's video pissing me off

820
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:40,240
Especially if I liked cinema sins or if it was like a video that I made right, but I have to admit

821
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:47,280
This is an instance where the amount of actually being factually wrong reaches a critical mass of okay

822
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,320
Yeah, your videos suck right cuz like commenters love to do that. Oh you got this point wrong

823
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,800
You got that point wrong there for you're invalid and it's like fuck you

824
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:00,880
But like this like he this guy over the course of several videos, especially the one on the Marvel movies

825
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:08,000
Convinced to me that cinema sins are shitty not just that like making videos or analyzing them

826
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,440
But even watching movies and paying adequate attention

827
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,800
I am convinced that cinema sins are not just doing cynical YouTube clickbait

828
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:22,640
You know shit to like get the views but are also just outright lazy in general right because I remember at least last time

829
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:28,560
I checked cinema sins uploads once every three days right that and but and yet I think he does two movies a week

830
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,920
Yeah, something like that right

831
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,240
Let's just say once every three days right and like this guy convinced me that they only watch the movies once maybe twice

832
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:43,080
And are probably taking down notes as they're going through without pausing by the sheer level of like fucking up that their points have

833
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,400
But when I explained to my friend yeah three days is a lot

834
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,000
But three days is enough time to watch the movie raw not taking down any notes

835
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,280
Take down some notes after watching it watch the movie again

836
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:59,520
Taking down notes while you watch it and then watch the movie a third time to make sure you didn't fuck anything up

837
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,720
Right you can do all that in one day if it's a full-time job second day

838
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,200
Edit the video make the whole fucking video and then have your lunch break because it should only take like three hours tops

839
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:14,240
Right then you could take the rest of the day and the whole third day just doing whatever right so clearly shit channel

840
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,680
And it's like it's just one channel that has been objectively proven as shit by another channel

841
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:24,440
Extensively analyzing them. So uh, yeah, fuck cinema sins. I have a video game where you beat them up. It's it

842
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,600
It's it's really it's really like

843
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:33,840
Telling when you when you realize, you know, most people don't have a very good work ethic and

844
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:41,800
They still manage to get videos out so quickly because they're they're just not that they're not using their brain that much

845
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,680
Yeah, it's just

846
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:50,840
When I when I when I feel like I have to work a lot harder than other people to get things out faster

847
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,840
And I realized that they're not working hard themselves

848
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,160
Yeah, so guys if you want a visible hand at work if you guys want to beat the shit out of cinema sins

849
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,280
I have a flash game for it. Just Google footwear man beats up cinema sins

850
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,280
I made a long time ago. Just add Jesse's request. So there you go

851
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:14,040
The other thing I hate about cinema sins is that they've spawned so many imitators. Oh god. Oh, no if you want a

852
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:18,360
Oh, do you remember the bro? There's multiple brony ones early, sir. Oh, right?

853
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,400
Cinema

854
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,920
No, if you want objective fucking proof that your video style is easy

855
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:31,720
There is one channel I saw that's like literally an 11 year old girl doing it for every episode of sonic boom

856
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,160
It's great

857
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,320
Yeah, I actually like the idea

858
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:45,120
The point stands though, it's it's a very easy formula to ape

859
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,120
But yeah, that's the only I mean that was kind of long for a lightning round thing

860
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,560
We think I was just gonna say two things off the bat that I always hated that I don't even pay attention to much anymore

861
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,960
The channels where it's just like a girl with big tits

862
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,920
They're like being pushed up with a broad just staring at the camera and that's it

863
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:05,880
They get a million views and get tons of money. I hate them. Oh, yeah, like Ben and Jackie's College fund

864
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,680
Yeah, that's pretty much

865
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,080
Hate that hate Ben clearly

866
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,480
Haven't watched it yet, but if that's what it is then

867
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:29,320
Then the other thing is just reaction channels in general, they're all terrible like Ben and Jackie's College Fund. Yeah, we're pretty

868
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,240
We're pretty much guilty of everything

869
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,640
Yeah, that's all I got anybody else have any closing remarks quickly before we go to questions because

870
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:48,120
Where we're we're pushing an hour here. I don't like people who do twitch and

871
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,680
Are really in board and they get hundreds hundreds of billions of

872
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,680
Currency

873
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,840
Every five seconds is like oh

874
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:05,080
Some guy gave you a hundred bucks. Well, yeah, thanks. I'm just gonna keep

875
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,840
Which is a platform I don't like like there's nothing on twitch. I enjoy it's all bad

876
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,320
Especially I don't make tons of money. I don't understand the drive

877
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:19,360
To watch to watch someone play like Hearthstone or League of Legends or something and be like, yeah

878
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,120
I just I just don't get the idea of watching video games. I've tried

879
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,800
I've really tried to get into it and like if you do good on you, but I just I don't get it

880
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:33,520
I'm just when I watch because I only want to watch people playing games that I I like or I want to play and the whole time

881
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,360
Just like I kind of want to just play the game now and then I just turn it off and I'll go play the game

882
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,720
So, yeah, I don't I don't really get it. I mean

883
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,960
Everything has its audience at market blah blah blah, but yeah, not my thing

884
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,640
Okay, we're going to questions. All right. Good. Yeah, let's go

885
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,120
question from the

886
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:56,000
PCP patron lounge if you want to get to this exclusive lounge while where we all hang out and chat with you fucking sheeple

887
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,080
Go over to the PCP patreon and throw in a buck. You'll get access. You can ask us these questions

888
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,680
You can I think I think did you posted pictures of his pfimosis cock in here the other day?

889
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,680
So if you want to get on that go ahead

890
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:13,200
Does that count as false advertising if I just like give out a blatant lie and then say give us money?

891
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,200
No, it's because it's true because it's I can see them right now

892
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,480
Okay, here's a question from

893
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:33,120
Cucked by the laws of aerodynamics who wants to know if you could get any movie sequel made. What would it be? Oh

894
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,960
God

895
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,720
The brave little toaster for oh shit I

896
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:47,880
Love brave little toaster even though the two and three were made by Disney and they weren't as good as the first one

897
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:52,920
I want them. I want more toaster. No, I I actually have a great answer to this

898
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,440
Okay, um, I don't know if anyone's ever heard of

899
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,580
Fucking Rhapsody Street kids believe in Santa is a

900
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,400
Abominable Christmas special. Yeah, we reviewed it on the college fund

901
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:11,240
Yeah, and it it was supposed to have a sequel like the end of it ends with like will be back for Easter

902
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,360
But it was so bad and and was received so terribly that it never got made and there's nothing

903
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:22,360
I would rather see in this world than Rhapsody Street kids to Easter Easter Feaster or whatever

904
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,680
Oh

905
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:29,560
Yeah, so that's my pig. I'm gonna cheat because it's what I do and instead of a sequel

906
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,840
I want a prequel because I want to see more movies in the inception universe

907
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,920
But I don't want to see a sequel because that'll ruin the ambiguous ending of the first one

908
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,920
But I want to see more adventures of you know, Leo and friends going into people's dreams and fucking around

909
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,920
I think that'd be a lot of fun. I

910
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,120
Know Leo young Leo meets young. Yeah

911
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,840
Incept young Sheldon to convince him to be an atheist

912
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,880
It's where he learned his it's inception. We you find out that young

913
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,280
To his brain young young Sheldon events of the dream the dream die of technology. Oh my god

914
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,880
By accident well, we did it we we came up with the perfect movie

915
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,880
Honey, honey, I incepted

916
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,000
The time what movie do you want to see the suicide diaries to?

917
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:36,000
Yeah, totally that's I'm gonna make it myself. Just you wait one of these days

918
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,160
Oh

919
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,760
God

920
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,600
Nothing nothing's really spring to mind to be totally honest

921
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:51,840
Yeah, I'm there's no nine eleven two. Oh, oh that's coming to at the rate. We're going. Let's be real

922
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,600
What the Trump Tower?

923
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,680
Maybe

924
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,360
Man imagine just imagine not saying I want it to happen

925
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Maybe

926
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,880
I

927
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,760
Was making the veil threat the Trump

928
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,720
We're gonna blow up Trump Tower good on you ISIS the heroes we deserve they did it

929
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:38,640
Okay, well great question monkey. Let's move on to the next one I guess unless the view had an answer

930
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,400
Yeah, I was thinking about it because I was thinking thinking of every movie

931
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,280
I like and like I don't want sequels to any of them

932
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:48,520
You know I'm it's down on the whole sequels remakes reboots read everything is that anyone is your name too

933
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,000
What was their name?

934
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,200
Well, but no, um, so I was thinking well, you know, I don't like the idea in general

935
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,000
So how can I turn it? How can I spin it into a win?

936
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Right and I had the idea a while ago that like Hollywood should just read everything all at once in one giant thing

937
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,760
And then like kill everyone so I had like how can you do that?

938
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,760
Well, I'd also being the ultimate showdown

939
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:17,520
Revengeance and just make it like all the actual fucking people not just flat shitty flash animations full score by lemon demon

940
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:23,320
Of course who has lately gotten really good at combining fucking music together deal Cesariga that guy

941
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,040
So like just yeah, he just come good at that for yeah

942
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,880
He fucking he fucking like smashes every fucking movie soundtrack into one

943
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:37,000
We're using his incredible skills and like all the actors are brought back for a final movie and they all get slaughtered and

944
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,000
There we go

945
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,960
We can finally have new IPs because I'm as big on we need new IPs as anybody because IP every day

946
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,800
Fantastic um

947
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,120
All right, anybody else have a question

948
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,440
I'm looking through the chat most of them. Well, here's what here's what I don't know

949
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,940
There's one from me at you underscore flame

950
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:05,520
Why does digi insist on shaking his gross phymosis cock even people with regular foreskin have to wipe their dig?

951
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:13,000
Find out on the PCP patreon where did you posted several photos and this is not false advertising? I

952
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,440
Think it's just because

953
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:23,440
There's another question in there about like how has having girlfriends improved our hygiene and I have to imagine digi's toilet is no

954
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:29,240
Longer a giant piss-stained mess, but I don't know. I have not seen images of that. Can anybody confirm I?

955
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:35,440
Have not been there. No, I have not I can answer the question on the procrastinators fan chat

956
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,680
Yes, but not directly so so like I actually do take showers almost every day now

957
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:48,880
But like I mean my girlfriend does not but like what it is is that just like you know having a fucking relationship and sex just

958
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,440
Sort of balances out my fucking brain and I can make better decisions for myself like oh

959
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,280
Hey, if I take a shower

960
01:16:54,280 --> 01:17:00,360
I will immediately like get that 15 minutes of time back by like how much faster I'm gonna work for the next couple hours

961
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:06,000
Cuz I'm gonna feel so fucking clean. I'm gonna feel awesome. So yes indirectly, but it's I

962
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,940
Still do and have always had better hygiene than my partner in question

963
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,640
Well, there you go all right whose girlfriend it I guess is disgusting

964
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,600
Every other day it's normal. Oh, yeah, that's fine

965
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,360
What about you Ben?

966
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,760
marginally

967
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,720
marginally

968
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,720
Just not as beard. I

969
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:40,040
Probably brush my teeth a little more often nowadays, you know to be polite

970
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,940
So that's pretty good, but everything else is pretty much the same

971
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,360
Yep

972
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:52,840
That's my answer. Do we have any other Twitter questions today? I want my questions Leo J. Larkin ask

973
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:59,240
Is there a literary device that makes you immediately stop caring about a story personally chosen one slash prophecy?

974
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,240
Oh question

975
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,680
That that's my big one for sure

976
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,440
I feel it's just so tired and played out that I

977
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,480
Almost like I almost want someone to put a spin on it that makes it interesting again

978
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,040
Because I feel like everyone who does it does it exactly the same

979
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:20,400
Hmm. I I did I did mention earlier the bit about like like breaking the fourth wall

980
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,880
If you break the fourth wall too much it makes me stop caring if you break the fourth wall so much that it's like

981
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,400
This isn't even a real story anymore, but Ben Deadpool likes Jimmy Changus, dude

982
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,520
That's that's that's in can okay

983
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,440
Well to answer the question

984
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,840
I mean the first thing that springs to mind it mind is like

985
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:42,320
When the narrative device of that like lets me know immediately that there's gonna be a big dramatic people getting mad at each other

986
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,320
Seen over a misunderstanding or the liar

987
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,560
But I thought that I was really unique with that whole point about the liar revealed until

988
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:54,040
Nostalgia Critic coined to the term and started talking about it a lot and so that's that that whole crusade

989
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,120
I guess is basically covered like we're learning our lesson from that fucking one hopefully

990
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:03,960
But to go really really broad like the biggest connecting fiber between my disengagement with most stories

991
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:11,200
But mostly most movies is when the goal isn't clear when like the point or like the objective or like how the characters gonna go about their

992
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:16,280
Objective isn't clear regardless of whether or not it's an action movie like I got to save the president or a romance movie

993
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,400
Like I got to get that girl to like me, you know, it's just whenever the

994
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,800
It's just the movie is not telling me exactly what the point or what the goal is

995
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:28,080
I just get so fucking confused and it's such a common thing with like Hollywood movies

996
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,760
Like I remember Star Wars episode 7 having this where it's like, okay

997
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,800
We kind of have to go here, but we kind of have to go there

998
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,360
But we're kind of gonna do this, but we're they were kind of not I die

999
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,600
I remember the Hobbit movies having the same problem

1000
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,760
I couldn't quite like get like why everyone is doing the thing that you're doing. I'm done

1001
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:48,440
You need you need to establish your stakes like very clearly because that's like the linchpin of getting people to actually give a fuck

1002
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:53,800
Right, you don't do that the whole everything else just doesn't feel like it has any context

1003
01:19:53,800 --> 01:20:00,840
I also agree that like I think you basically just to this one. We're gonna reiterate it is that any any fake character like

1004
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:06,400
Protagonist versus protagonist conflict that you know is going to be solved. It just feels like I'm I

1005
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,480
Instantly get like really stressed out because I'm like this whole conflict is completely pointless

1006
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,000
It's not gonna affect anything like they're not gonna keep fighting forever

1007
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:20,520
Like so just can we just I have like that. I'll just flip through the pages and skim it until it gets over with

1008
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,360
Yeah, I have a VH. I have a VHS tape. That's like pause

1009
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:28,240
That's like stuck right before that scene happens the rocketeer, right?

1010
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:33,720
I watched the handful of years ago or I almost did but then like I knew that basically I could tell based on like everything

1011
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:39,720
Red flags were were blaring out of the screen up my ass like there's gonna be a scene where the guy

1012
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:43,920
Can like meets the girlfriend and she's mad at him and she's probably gonna slap him and a little bit

1013
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,720
Like rocketeer juice is gonna come out of his rocket ass or something

1014
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:51,400
I just know it right and like like based on what how the scene was being framed. He was like he got off his rocket

1015
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,000
He's walking into a building where the girlfriend is and I know all the plot beats that are happening

1016
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,480
So I'm like, yeah, there's gonna be a scene where she's mad at him and he's at his lowest point

1017
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,080
And I was so mad preemptively I was so preemptively mad

1018
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:07,240
Knowing it was gonna happen and bring down my entire opinion of the otherwise perfectly okay movie that I was watching

1019
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:12,800
So I I paused the movie stopped it took took out the tape and I have not gotten back to it for years until this day

1020
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,840
It stays exactly at that point and I'm just ready ready with a fucking shotgun

1021
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,800
Everybody likes to suck the dick of the new it movie

1022
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,480
But even that like for no reason the kids all

1023
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,560
Stopping in friends and then like not even two minutes later. It's resolved like

1024
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,400
Hornet into every fucking movie. It's so

1025
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,160
Much I'd much rather they do it that way where it's like something it's just done

1026
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,600
Just don't do it at all. I agree. But if you're going to do it quickly

1027
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,640
What does it fucking add? I don't I don't know it's very I mean for me

1028
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,000
It's not even the for me

1029
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,480
I don't even get as mad about like the forciveness of it as the I can't believe the characters would act

1030
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,080
I guess it's related to the forciveness

1031
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:59,920
But it's always stupidity on the part of the main character right like I remember hearing that there's like

1032
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:05,240
What's that one movie about the fucking lizard iguana guy who can camouflage and therefore he lies and like that has a liar revealed

1033
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,600
Seen in it. I haven't seen it

1034
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,760
But Nostalgia Critics said that it's an example of a movie that works because that Rango Rango

1035
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:16,840
Um, I won't say like Django Unchained, but that's not the right movie. So anyway, he was saying like that movie it works

1036
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,200
Because the movie is fucking about that

1037
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:25,400
It's like a movie about a character who's like thing is that he's deceptive and he has to learn his lesson about it

1038
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,000
And I'm like, there you go, right?

1039
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,760
I hate it when it's like a character who I'm supposed to like relate to or has any sort of arrangement of personality

1040
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:39,320
Things or things going on with them and they always somehow find themselves in a place where they're incentivized to lie about themselves

1041
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:44,840
And they always go about lying about themselves in the same fucking way or they fail to communicate in a certain way for me

1042
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:48,600
I never fucking put up with people misunderstanding me. I'm gonna push

1043
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:53,160
I'm gonna put them down in the seat get out the fucking whiteboard if I have to and visualize like a fucking

1044
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:59,400
Chalkboard youtube video why they're wrong and misunderstanding something to the point that they're exhausted and don't give a shit anymore

1045
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:05,400
That's how all of my liar revealed scenes go all of my misunderstanding scenes go it goes with them saying I don't care anymore

1046
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:12,360
Fine shut the fuck up. I just I'm so taken out of it by the fact that like when the character gets the misunderstanding happening

1047
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:16,680
They just sort of sit there and like sigh and let the girl character slap them in the face

1048
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,480
You know, I'm just like why don't they like why can't there just be one character just beat that one?

1049
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:25,240
Yeah, just one character who's like shut up. No, I remember there's like one movie

1050
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:29,480
That's like a fucking child above who gets framed for being a terrorist and he literally says

1051
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,240
I would be the stupidest terrorist in the world if I did this that and the other this doesn't make any sense

1052
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,840
He actually stands up for himself and I'm like that eagle eye eagle eye. He stands up for himself

1053
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:42,440
And I was so fucking good at this baby. You are yeah, I was so fucking relieved that he finally like said something for himself

1054
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:48,120
That's the for me. It's not the forciveness the obligation is as much as the character sitting there and taking it up the ass

1055
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,960
It I can't relate to that at all and uh, yeah, I hate it

1056
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,400
It's every episode of friends. Oh really

1057
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:01,240
You know what? I want I want to maybe I also ties into like oh, we don't believe you like if there's like a

1058
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,800
Supernatural thing happening and like the main character does a terrible job explaining it, you know

1059
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,240
And so therefore no one believes it

1060
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,400
I want to have a thing that has the misunderstanding and the no one believes you thing

1061
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,800
And like it causes his life to be ruined

1062
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:18,760
But then like people finally find out, you know through the plot that it actually was real all the time and they like

1063
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:23,880
Have a little cell and they all killed themselves. No, no, he kills them. So they have a celebration about it

1064
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,520
Right. Yes. Yeah, they have a cell. I want that. No, no, no, literally. It's like this

1065
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,120
It's like it's going to be like, okay

1066
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:35,000
You know like from dusk till dawn which has like a horror movie twist halfway through this is going to be a like

1067
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,440
Does that this is going to be like a horror a horror movie twist that happens in the last scene, right?

1068
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,360
It's otherwise a normal family movie or some shit with a mysterious r-rating

1069
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:45,880
I guess where like, you know, he like just sort of takes it, you know

1070
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,400
There's a couple of signs early on and throughout the movie that he might be psychotic

1071
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,280
But otherwise he acts like a perfectly normal fucking 80s protagonist

1072
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,760
Just sort of taking this fucking bullshit from all these people who don't like understand him for no fault of his own

1073
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,320
And then at the end they have a little party or a little festival

1074
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,240
They're like, yeah, we're really sorry about that

1075
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:05,240
You know once the plot revealed to us that you were right all and then he just like he gets up to make his speech

1076
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:10,440
But he pulls out a fucking uzi and just fucking slaughters them and you like see individual characters

1077
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:16,040
Like the older mom character from some other family who like set a particularly nasty line to him

1078
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,480
You see him stab her with a fork until her neck borderline comes off

1079
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:23,000
But he gives up and moves on to someone else, you know, that's what I fucking want as a movie

1080
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:28,680
Well, you know, your life's work is ahead. You know what you have to do

1081
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,200
It's time to get to the real life story

1082
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,600
Be the change be the change

1083
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,920
I remember I remember like happens in like Home Alone 3 and I'm like yelling at the characters like don't be nice to him

1084
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,960
Now you remember the fucking I want you dead. They you should die you y'all should die and my dad was like what?

1085
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,360
Jesus calm down

1086
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,360
Like I want them dead

1087
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:53,000
Wait, you were saying that stuff out loud. What was in front of your family? I wasn't saying fuck

1088
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,800
I was just saying like casually like I hate those characters. They should die. I was just casually saying

1089
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,880
I want them to die

1090
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:04,040
My dad was so offended on behalf of my threatening of the murder of these fictional characters

1091
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:11,160
Well, Home Alone 3 is a lively event at the Davoo household. Yeah, this was like 15 years ago

1092
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:16,600
It's a family tradition. Oh, I remember I remember at rad con 2 you were telling us all about Home Alone 3

1093
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,360
I was

1094
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:22,680
Yeah, it was in the car. I recorded a vlog of him telling us the details of every

1095
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,280
Oh, yeah, I remember that. Oh my god. Did I just confuse a youtube video with real life?

1096
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:32,680
Well, no, because you were there you were in the passenger side. Oh, okay. I just got the time mixed up. Well, never mind. Nope. Listen to me

1097
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:37,640
I'm gonna kill myself. Oh, no, just like Davoo wants

1098
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,720
well, uh

1099
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,720
The thing I don't like

1100
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:47,240
When stuff happens is when a thing tries to be funny and they don't do it right

1101
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:52,280
And uh, it's not even funny bad. And that's all I have to say. Are you talking about my videos hippo?

1102
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,280
I

1103
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,440
God damn it

01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:05,160

01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:19,640
Yeah, I didn't look at them, but they're probably gay if you're gay question didn't get answered
