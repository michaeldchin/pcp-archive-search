00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone, welcome to another rowdy fuckers cop killers, where we're here and we're queer.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're doing the same old shit, we're never gonna evolve past our primitive state and we'll just fucking die here, die among the fleas and the ticks.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I think we should, I think me and Munchy, I'm Ben Saint and I'm here with Munchy by the way, me and Munchy have decided that creative stagnation is the way to go.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're gonna do the same thing forever.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But we're gonna play Pokemon. We're gonna play some fucking Pokemon and fight each other.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Pokemon is all you need in life. It's like that NPC said, Pokemon encompasses all of my life and I'm okay with that.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, that fucking guy.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I truly empathize with him more than anyone else in my life.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He was, I was like, oh my god, I feel you bro.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah man, no, I'm Munchy, I'm so fucking into Pokemon recently.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Dude, don't I know it.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, I'm way more into Pokemon now as an adult than I was as a kid, honestly.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's because you were stunnows and you were just fucking gay but now you've evolved past primitive thoughts such as sex and now you can truly see what Pokemon offers.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And that's the ideal asexual world only operated through animal loving.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So I'm gonna accept your fucking battle and we're gonna have a fucking battle.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We're gonna have one heck of a good time destroying each other's valuable partners.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I should really stop clicking on OBS because every time I do it records itself and does that like crazy infinite tunnel thing.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, you just ruined the entire video so.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, I broke kayfabe, now everyone's gonna know that this isn't real.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's all just pixels on a screen, it's not even real.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They're gonna know that they aren't been saying looking at the screen. They're gonna step out of their illusion.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, it's gonna be like being John Malkovich but in reverse.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But even more deadly.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As if we didn't think it was possible.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Anyway, I have this one in the bag immediately.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, I have gay ones on my team. It doesn't even matter.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't even look at my teammates. They're decent though.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mega evolving right out the gate. You gotta save that for when the chips are down.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I didn't even realize that was clicked. It's been so long since I played this.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh my fucking god, actually now I'm scared. Now that you're double calm minded.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You know what? I believe in myself though.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sturdy. I'm invincible. I'll never die.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's what they said about gay people in the 1930s and guess what happened to them? They're all extinct now.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You know why? Because of me.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh yeah. Don't worry about it though.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh come on! Motherfuck!

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I need to cool down. I need to simmer down.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That was real shitty dude. I really thought I was gonna get you with a fucking sucker punch.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I really thought I was gonna get you.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You really thought you were cool but little did he know that he was in fact the worst person ever to come out.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You know, I didn't, I think never mind. I was so confident.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When my Scarmory came out with Stealth Rock I was so confident. I was like, well this is this game's over.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The spiritual successor to whoever. What's his name?

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know. Oh Jacob. It was Jacob.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And now he's dead. Oh my fucking god.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That should be our first topic. You should go into how you've been feeling, how you've been dealing with the post-traumatic stress of being real life.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh yeah, since I've come out of the game.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You see since you've come out of the closet.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, I really expected to die in there. And you know, if you die in the game you die for real.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I really did not expect to be here living among the living right now.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You know, in that last fight against Getzis he killed all my favorite Pokemon.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I was really banking on Jacob. Jacob was like my guy. I was like this guy is gonna carry me through the whole fucking thing.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I mean, I was sad to lose 12 but he wasn't as strategically important like I wasn't positive.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah, he was a piece of shit that didn't matter.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, I mean I just given him low kick and low kick was really good.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, and it's not like he was a fighting type because it's a dark person that wouldn't have been helpful.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think there was also a steel person.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, there wasn't a steel person.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay, whatever.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I mean yeah, he would have been good against the black guy. I mean the dark guy.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, but I really wanted Jake. Oh, and Barry. So bummed to lose Barry.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The Electro, I don't know, whatever. But anyway, I fucking got all my crappy ass B team together when we won the day and it was amazing.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They were a fucking B team.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, thanks for that.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That crucial catch of Voltix.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, thank God.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That crucial catch of Voltix.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, thank God.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Once you the Voltix was there in the box, you know, it had to be someone.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was maintaining the fort.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, we wouldn't have had the confidence to go out there without you.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
God fucking...

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You just accept that you will never be cool.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't...

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm the one who wears the sunglasses here.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're gonna fucking sweep my old team with your first dude, dude.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, well, I don't know. We'll see.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Uh-oh.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, this is bad for you. You're gonna die, dude.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's what they fucking said in my dreams.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Aw, come on. Man.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mew's the best Pokemon. You can't beat her.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're one of those fucking people.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh god, wait, it doesn't even have a gender?

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's interesting. Okay, sure.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I want to have sex with it, too. Don't worry.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, don't worry, man. I'm not worried, man.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm not worried at all.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, fucking god, dude.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can't...

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is so terrible.

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was just...

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I was just so fucking fixated on getting those stealth rocks and spikes out there that I was blind to what was happening right in front of me.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I was playing before and I had such a great win. I had like the coolest win.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're walking through life with your fucking blinders on.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It started when they sent out their fucking Shedinja and I was like, oh shit.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't have anything that can hurt a Shedinja.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But I fucking swapped in for Taranitar with Sandstorm and the Sandstorm killed it.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, holy shit.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Amazing.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah, but then of course...

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Holy shit, you're so fucked.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're so bad at this game.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I can't believe it.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No, it's okay. I have knockoff. You're done.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, shit.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Fuck, my last hope.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, okay.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're fucked, dude. You're so fucked.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What do you mean, man? I still have a chance, man. I still have a chance.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Rematch.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Really, the moment you just completely obliterated the psychic type person,

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I knew that you were going to just get through it with no problem.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You completely just fucking destroyed her and her family.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, I meticulously planned out my strategy for the Elite Four.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I knew exactly what that Musharna was going to do.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And I was like, okay, I'll send him out.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Toxic Spikes, two turns. He'll go to sleep for yawn, et cetera, et cetera.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But then, yeah, against the champion, I didn't have a real solid plan or anything,

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
so I was just like, well, I'll just do whatever.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And that's why I actually...

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ah, fuck's sake.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's why people actually died against her.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Come on, man. Come on.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have like a bin saint team with me, which is to say horrible.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, the bee team.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Uh...

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I knew you were going to switch. I knew you were going to switch, dude.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, man, yeah. Ah, shit.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, I have like five Pokémon at the same time.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, I'll kill each and every one of them.

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They're all done.

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They're all done, dude.

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Nothing can kill me, you know why?

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What? Why am I trapped?

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Because I'm the drill. Are you stupid?

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you stupid?

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, okay, I guess I'm fucked.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's okay, I'm going easy on you.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, alright. I'm going to wake up this turn.

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's not how sleep works.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes, it is.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It might as well be.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Nice stealth rock, you fuck.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Thanks, dude. I learned it in school.

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, that's good.

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, boy! Ah, come on!

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You are the worst human.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
90% accuracy.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You are the worst human.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And I'm in fact the best human.

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You see, for I was once an ape, and then when I was an ape,

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I touched a magic fruit, and then it gave me superpowers.

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I love how Ben is actually stupid. I love that part.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I forgot I'm slower than that.

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I love that part.

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I looked at Gallead's speed, and I was like,

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
oh, he's so fast, cool! Jesus Christ, alright.

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's my favorite part of this game, is that when Ben is terrible.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I felt so confident of going into this.

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Alright, don't worry about it, though. It's all good.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I have no idea what to do right now.

174
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There's nothing you can do.

175
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Look at this man. Look what you're up against.

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's a fucking ice cube. I mean, Ice Snowflake.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Aw, god damn it!

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
LOL.

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Guys, everyone type in chat right now,

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
like, now you're going to wait for the beat to be over.

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There's no chat.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Type now, one.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I mean, if you want to stream this, go right ahead.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm like, we should do all GrannyFuckersCoptlers live sometime.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, we should. Yeah, why not?

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Alright.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But actually no, because I don't want anyone to see me lose.

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In real time.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So they can berate you in the present as opposed to in the future.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was so confident.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Alright.

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Now we're going to say who's the real champion of Yanova.

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You fucking piece of shit.

195
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think so. I think...

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Wait, what?

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, no.

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It was all a farce. The nose lock was staged.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We saw that Max revived you, you piece of shit.

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, okay. Did you see my fucking comment about the Max?

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, no, no.

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Nate was all like, Ben, did you lie to us?

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Was it all faked?

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I was like, Nate, look.

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I explained it in the comments.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He's like, yeah, but how do we know?

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He was like pretending that he didn't believe it.

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Well, explain what happened right now for video proof.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay.

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This is going to be like Edward Snowden revealing NSA leak documents.

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Can you just imagine Ben's face right up against the camera

213
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
in a not very well-willed room in Hong Kong?

214
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay, okay, fine.

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
God, I gotta fucking strategize and whatever.

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So, yes, it was during EV training,

218
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and I had to do...

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, God.

220
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So bad.

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm just, yeah.

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you were thinking about this, could this person really have not used a Max revive?

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Could this person have one fair and square?

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No, just don't lie to yourselves.

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Alright. Yeah, dude, you fucking idiot.

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Nice. Oh, God.

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This means nothing.

228
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This does mean nothing.

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, I got you, though. Oh, I fucking got you.

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Alright.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Are you going to go for another sick sell?

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No, of course not.

233
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't be ridiculous.

234
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Live on stream.

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is a deep round.

236
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't even think to fucking defend my honor with this shit going on.

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
God fucking dammit!

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I should have known you were going to do that.

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It was the obvious move, and I...

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And he's just dropping the bomb every way.

241
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He can't even explain how he totally cheated, but he's not going to admit it.

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I know. Oh, God, that's not even good. Why are you doing it?

243
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's not even good. Why are you doing it?

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's not even cool. It's not even good.

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's not even good. It's not cool. It's so stupid.

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to freeze you, dude.

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Nah.

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm going to freeze you.

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's not fact-based.

250
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's not fact-based at all.

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And you're going to have to switch.

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's not fact-based.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Fuck.

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Anyway, so during EV training, I had to reduce my speed EVs,

255
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and I didn't have tomato berries because the lady that sells berries,

256
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
she sells all the different kinds of EV reducing berries,

257
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
except for the fucking the good kind, the tomato berries.

258
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And she was...

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So I was like, I needed to reduce Christ.

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I needed to reduce friendship somehow.

261
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, God. Here we go.

262
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Hey, there we go.

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, I got one.

264
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You got one.

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, I did. You're fucked now.

266
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, except that you have a life orb on and you're going to die from next hit no matter what.

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It doesn't matter. I'm going to take someone out with me.

268
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah.

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Maybe I'll switch right out onto these fucking stealth rocks.

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, right.

271
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What do you think about that?

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's not a fact-based.

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Maybe I'll just switch it up.

274
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Regice? Not real.

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Not real.

276
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Not a real Pokemon.

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Aw, I almost fucking got him.

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What are you going to do? You're going to like substitute or something?

279
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Nah, I would never do something so foolish.

280
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Nah, I have more faith in you than that.

281
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't know who's taller. I mean, faster.

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, it's me, of course.

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, I won't.

284
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Aw, God.

285
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Nah, well, I'm going to fucking get you, though.

286
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Whatever.

287
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Okay, I'm improving. I'm steadily improving.

288
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Steadily improving.

289
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Steadily improving. I'm getting better.

290
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So, the only way to reduce speed EVs at that time was that I had to go to Join Avenue and give my Pokemon haircuts and shit that raised friendship and reduced EVs.

291
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But they wouldn't let me do it because all my Pokemon were at max friendship.

292
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So off-camera, I went and got deliberately KO'd so that I could reduce friendship by one so that they would give me a fucking haircut.

293
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And then I was like, that turned out to be really difficult and untenable and annoying, so I was like, fuck it, I will spend the five hours grinding.

294
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah, and I used max revives because I had all these revives lying around.

295
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I didn't, I don't know, I just used the max one because whatever.

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And then I decided to say fuck it and not do that and grind Join Avenue to get a good berry store and buy some sweet berries instead.

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And that is the story of why I used a max revive.

298
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And if you think it's cheating, then please crucify me.

299
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Please come to my house and please kill me.

300
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Please kill me. I don't want to live anymore.

301
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If the people don't accept that I am the greatest Pokemon master of all time.

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Well, after this, how could they?

303
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
No. No.

304
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I didn't even kill all the Pokemon.

305
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What are you, what? What is it?

306
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Wow, this is a fair matchup. A furfrow.

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Furfrow is good, dude.

308
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No, but I have a Mewtwo.

309
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Mewtwo is nothing. Mewtwo is garbage.

310
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Mewtwo doesn't even have a single superpower.

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He is not even good. Oh my team is crazy. Holy shit.

312
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm going to win this time. Dammit, never mind, I lose.

313
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Never mind, I lose.

314
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's it. That was my last chance and I blew it.

315
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Do you have any closing statements? Where are you going to go from now?

316
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Where am I going to go from now? Oh, I'm going to go to fucking Alola.

317
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You know, my things didn't really work out with the whole Pokemon Genocide thing.

318
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Turns out it's more complicated, so I've got to formulate a plan.

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm going to go to Yunova and this time things are going to be different.

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
See, that's the perfect place because in Alola they don't have an elite force.

321
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You can become the champion and Yunova, they had laws in place and shit,

322
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
but Hawaii is like a vast jungle with only ethnicities there.

323
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So you can just assert yourself fully. Only ethnicities.

324
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, I get what you're saying. Yeah, god fuck.

325
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's a jungle like no other.

326
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, I think guerrilla warfare will be the thing to do.

327
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What can I even fucking do against this?

328
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know why you did that.

329
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What, but brought out survivor? Yeah.

330
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Bad options.

331
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, okay. I wasn't convinced by Mewtwo, but if you've got pherothorn, I'm done.

332
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, whoa. What?

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
God, Christ. God, Christ.

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah, boy!

335
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's shit.

336
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Ah, but I'm still, ah, fuck, whatever. That was only my opening move.

337
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That was only my opening move. They don't even know anything.

338
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No, no, nobody does.

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

340
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Mewtwo is so crazy. Why is it even in the fucking game?

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh man, makes me mad.

342
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He didn't have a single stat under fucking 150. What the hell?

343
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And he's got, don't forget his two mega evolutions.

344
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah.

345
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Now those are some, now those are some Pokemon.

346
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Those are in fact Pokemon.

347
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes, it is true.

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Anyway, you're done. You're fucking done, unless, unless you've got, oh, okay.

349
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, you're a fool, man.

350
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, yeah.

351
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, yeah, dude, yeah, bro.

352
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No, call Corona. He's taking over.

353
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah, bro.

354
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Get fucked, dude.

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now he's done. He's going to hurt himself because he's gay. Ah, shit. Okay, whatever.

356
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, that was a tear. I don't know why I did that. I don't know why.

357
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That was a good idea.

358
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That was a weird decision that you made.

359
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh, it's okay. I've got you on the ropes now.

360
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't think this affects you, but I'm going to die anyway.

361
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah, whatever.

362
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You are a ding-dong.

363
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, I, I was going to die anyway. There's nothing I can do.

364
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Sure, yeah.

365
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Sure, yeah.

366
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wow.

367
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Wow.

368
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh, dear.

369
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Check out this play. Check out this play.

370
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No.

371
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh, come on, dude.

372
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, it doesn't, it's still fucking great. It's still the right move.

373
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Dynamic punch is always the right thing to do.

374
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Whatever. You don't even know how to fucking do anything.

375
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So why should I even do anything?

376
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah, that's fair.

377
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

378
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There's one thing I think of when I look at Ben St.

379
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What's that?

380
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's gullible and terrible.

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Gullible and terrible.

382
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm going to put those two words.

383
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, really?

384
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I...

385
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm going to put those two words on your tombstone.

386
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Cool, dude.

387
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I love it.

388
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I love my official death.

389
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, no.

390
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I hate that.

391
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So, Munchy.

392
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Wait, was there something else I said I wanted to say?

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You want to talk about Sun and Moon generally.

394
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And also, you've only said like three things actually about the Nuzlocke.

395
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And you've just been getting distracted by fucking Pokemon playing.

396
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It takes all my fucking concentration to play Pokemon.

397
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What can I say?

398
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, god. What's he going to do?

399
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What's he going to do?

400
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What's he going to do?

401
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
He takes a breath.

402
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Like, oh, okay, here.

403
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm going to finally buckle down.

404
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh, no. What's he going to do?

405
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You know what?

406
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I think I made the wrong move.

407
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But we'll see.

408
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Oh, no.

409
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Return's never a wrong move.

410
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Well, I won't say why I thought it was a bad move for a second there.

411
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Of course not.

412
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I might lose this, in fact.

413
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think so, yeah.

414
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I feel good.

415
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I feel like I've gotten the upper hand all of a sudden.

416
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
First, I was quite fast.

417
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Faster than I would have imagined.

418
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
First row's good, man.

419
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
First row's good.

420
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's like a, it's like a, it's like a, I don't know, it's like halfway between a,

421
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
it's like halfway between a lie part and a, and a, oh, what's the other one?

422
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Uh, I don't know, a Chansey?

423
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Or a, or a Stoutland?

424
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Stoutland, yeah.

425
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Man.

426
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
See, that's why I thought, that's why I thought it was a bad move because I thought you were

427
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
going to switch into pherothorn immediately.

428
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

429
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah, that's what a smart person would do.

430
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah.

431
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Which is what I am.

432
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I vastly overestimated you, though.

433
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Whatever.

434
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And it's not even real.

435
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Whatever you know me.

436
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Clowns have to make their living somehow, and I make my living through murder.

437
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So, you know.

438
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah, man.

439
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's how it is.

440
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I mean, I feel that dog.

441
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I feel that real, real hard.

442
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You know what I'm saying?

443
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Bro.

444
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh, believe me, white person.

445
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I know exactly what you're saying.

446
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, white person.

447
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah, bro.

448
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Um, hmm.

449
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
God.

450
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm going to let you know that nothing you do will ever matter.

451
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Well, this turned specifically, but in general, as well, just to let you know.

452
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Anyway.

453
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Just to clue you in.

454
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, no.

455
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh, yeah, I did the right thing.

456
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh, wow.

457
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh, I did the right thing.

458
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's not like that never happens.

459
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I always do the right thing, dude.

460
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Every, every time.

461
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Anyway, I released fucking Nuzlocke, and I was so happy because I fucking saw the whole

462
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
thing through to the end, and it was all great.

463
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I think it was weaker at the beginning.

464
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Like, I think it gets better as it goes on.

465
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I think the ending is a masterpiece, and I'm really proud of it.

466
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's just a shame that I marred it with this Max Revive scandal that I'll never shake off

467
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and that no one will ever, no one will ever let go.

468
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The whole thing is ruined.

469
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's all, it's all trash.

470
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Truly, I think, I think the problem was.

471
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah.

472
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I mean, even watching the videos in the first place was the problem.

473
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Watching them at all?

474
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yeah.

475
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That we all suffered together.

476
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Because due to the fact that we were watching them, you continued to make them, and thus

477
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
you let the greed and corporate interest go in your head.

478
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah, all the viewers hurt me by giving me false reasons to continue, and I mean, look

479
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
what's become of me.

480
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Look what's become.

481
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Look at me.

482
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm, I'm an unfeasance, and it's depressing.

483
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
God.

484
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Peer dove is such a cute Pokemon, but it's, evolutions are disgusting.

485
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't, I don't get, is unfeasance supposed to be like gross, because it just looks like

486
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
a bird?

487
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I mean, it's, it's pink head thing is weird.

488
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah.

489
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But it's not like gross.

490
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Well, I mean, that's fine.

491
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, that gross thing about that is that what you just said, that it's gross.

492
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah, yes.

493
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I don't know.

494
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I guess I just don't find it that bad.

495
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I think, I don't, I don't know if it's the male one, but there's another one that looks

496
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
weirder.

497
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, yeah, the male one.

498
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's got a weird pink, like weird rooster tentacle head.

499
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Hey man.

500
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I think most of the gen ones, er, not the gen ones, see he gen paws weird.

501
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh god, wait.

502
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's my, oh it's me.

503
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I forgot that it was me.

504
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Um.

505
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Ben sainte, haul it up to production yet again.

506
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, I know.

507
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Oh god.

508
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Oh no.

509
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Oh no.

510
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh god.

511
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh no.

512
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh god.

513
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh god.

514
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
No.

515
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Why?

516
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't know man.

517
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Get ready for the coolest Pokemon.

518
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh my fucking god.

519
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah man.

520
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Um.

521
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Disgusting.

522
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
God, fucking paralysis.

523
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah.

524
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Is the worst.

525
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's so bad.

526
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's so good dude.

527
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's so bad.

528
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Like the power glove.

529
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
No I'm saying dude.

530
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh I know.

531
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Believe me.

532
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
No one could know more than I do right now.

533
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I've researched every book on the power glove and I have concluded that I do know what you're

534
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
saying.

535
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Shit.

536
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I have concluded that I am indeed in the know of what you are speaking and or selling

537
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
to me.

538
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Well that's just terrific.

539
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's just Stu.

540
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Pendis.

541
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh my god.

542
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
What am I going to do?

543
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Bam.

544
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yes I got him.

545
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Look how much I got him.

546
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh fuck he had iron.

547
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Ah nerd.

548
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Ah you idiot.

549
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Ah you stupid jerk.

550
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Fucking real life isn't even real.

551
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
No.

552
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I should have done that last turn.

553
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh.

554
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Oh I didn't even know I had that.

555
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah.

556
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well obviously.

557
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You tell me.

558
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah.

559
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You tell me.

560
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I was thinking that too.

561
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Whoever sleeps in your team on the nose lock.

562
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
What's the name?

563
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The sleepy guy.

564
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The sleep kid.

565
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Who rests.

566
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Fuck.

567
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Wait what?

568
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You were wondering who had it?

569
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Like you knew someone had it?

570
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah.

571
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh well.

572
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't know.

573
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Some idiot.

574
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Oh well.

575
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Nice use of protect.

576
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah.

577
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't know.

578
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I don't know.

579
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I don't know.

580
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I don't know.

581
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I don't know.

582
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't know.

583
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I don't know.

584
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't know.

585
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I don't know.

586
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Nice use of protect.

587
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
16%.

588
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Nice second punch of dummy.

589
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's over.

590
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It's so fucking over.

591
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
If FurFrow couldn't win.

592
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Then nobody can.

593
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Nothing can.

594
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's all over.

595
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It is all over.

596
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And now it's done.

597
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Your fate is sealed.

598
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I know.

599
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah.

600
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Nice try.

601
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Jesus Christ.

602
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Oh I got you though.

603
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Didn't I get you?

604
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What the fuck?

605
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I thought I turned one.

606
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What the shit?

607
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I thought I turned one.

608
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Come on.

609
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Bullshit.

610
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
10% chance to freeze.

611
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That's crazy.

612
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
100% chance to thaw immediately.

613
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That's crazy.

614
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That's the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone I'm convinced.

615
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
There's collusion at play.

616
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I guarantee it.

617
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah I think so.

618
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
There's mad collusion.

619
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I mean I was colluding for sure.

620
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
For sure.

621
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
There's no question about that.

622
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Ben, Max Revives Saint over here trying to act like other people are pulling something.

623
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
That is what they call me.

624
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
What up in?

625
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's like calling me on the streets.

626
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Hey Max Revives come over here.

627
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
There's nothing I can fucking do against Farathorn with Thunderwave.

628
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
He's an invincible demon.

629
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And that's it.

630
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
He's an invincible demon.

631
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah wow.

632
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That was cheating what you just did.

633
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That was cheating.

634
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Well you see in the Arctic it's okay.

635
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm probably Arctic.

636
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Did you see my fucking toxic stall strats?

637
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah I did.

638
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I was very proud of them.

639
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah man I was like this is it.

640
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I gotta be as cheap as possible fighting this champ and it worked.

641
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
When you're fighting for Pokemon World Domination you gotta do what you gotta do.

642
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah you gotta do what you gotta do.

643
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Someone in the comments was like you and Getsus aren't that similar.

644
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You both think humans are valued humans over Pokemon and you both use bullshit you know

645
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
asshole strategies like toxic stall.

646
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And I was like what come on.

647
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I never asked for this.

648
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That's what you get.

649
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I know.

650
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You're a tyrant Ben you have to realize this.

651
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You are a tyrant over your YouTube channel.

652
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Like at first I was mad like I didn't realize what I was doing was using the strategy of a villain.

653
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But then I was like you know what I'm okay with that.

654
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I like that.

655
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm glad.

656
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Fuck.

657
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I think anyone who didn't realize that you are a villain right from the start needs to reevaluate things.

658
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah.

659
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I got through paralysis but I just fucking missed.

660
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah well that's the reason death comes.

661
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Oh no.

662
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Why did I use so far?

663
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I don't know I just picked it because I didn't care.

664
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Why didn't I fucking rest?

665
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Why didn't I rest last turn?

666
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I had rest and I didn't use it.

667
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What a crazy person you are.

668
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I want to just end.

669
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know I could.

670
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I could just forfeit.

671
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh my god.

672
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I should.

673
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
This is stupid.

674
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
No.

675
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You don't know.

676
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You don't know.

677
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Dazzling gleam.

678
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You don't know a thing.

679
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You're a bitch.

680
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You don't know a single thing.

681
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm going to win the next one.

682
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
No.

683
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
No that's not possible.

684
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It is possible.

685
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Anything's possible.

686
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
No.

687
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Even such a thing as that.

688
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Christ.

689
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
No.

690
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
No.

691
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
No.

692
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Terrible.

693
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Well this should do the trick.

694
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Come on furfrow.

695
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Come on man.

696
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Just give me this.

697
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
What?

698
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I was using sucker punch.

699
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That's just the faster one go first.

700
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah.

701
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh gay.

702
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
See it's the one that straight goes first.

703
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Oh yeah.

704
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Pokemon calculates how cool you are.

705
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah.

706
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Straightness being the major factor.

707
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah.

708
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Major factor.

709
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Major factor in that.

710
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah.

711
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's your secret trainer ID.

712
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It's straight or gay.

713
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It's your secret trainer ID.

714
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's your secret trainer ID.

715
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's your secret trainer ID.

716
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's your secret trainer ID.

717
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's your secret trainer ID.

718
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The Pokemon showdown fanbase really did not like it when they added the feature that asks

719
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,020
you whether you're gay when you sign in.

720
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,000
Which immediately redirects you to a different website.

721
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Oh shit I closed the thing.

722
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I was supposed to rematch.

723
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh don't worry.

724
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Send me a thing.

725
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah here we go.

726
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I got you fam.

727
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
All right munchie.

728
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah.

729
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So this battle it's time for me to distract you.

730
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Oh no.

731
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And yeah tell me what you've been doing.

732
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I have.

733
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Because you, there's been talk, there's been talk that you might be at Radcon too.

734
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
There's the talk of the town, the word on the street on the grapevine,

735
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
that you might be at Radcon too this year.

736
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Ben St. was walking down the street in his Brooklyn neighborhood

737
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and he heard a faint whisper, a faint black ethnicity whisper

738
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
stating that much he may in fact be here soon.

739
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Through sensual, through large but sensual lips, African American lips,

740
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
it was spoken, it was said on the street.

741
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Well, that is true and somewhat closely related to the topic of I am making something.

742
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yeah, you're making a thing.

743
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I know very little about it, you've told me one or two things.

744
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah, which I will not go into in mass detail.

745
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
All you need to know is that alligators are cool and that's it.

746
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Alligators are cool.

747
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I don't think anyone would disagree with you about that.

748
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Really, is that...

749
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I know, I already know more than that.

750
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Okay, okay, okay, I'll go into more detail.

751
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Come on, what the f**king balloon, man!

752
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You're so bad, it's crazy, it's crazy.

753
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah, but I got you though.

754
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh, Patreon fame is bad.

755
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I shot you.

756
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He shot me.

757
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I shot you, dude, you're dead.

758
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay, well, it's hard to figure out what I should say and what I shouldn't say.

759
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Not to the fact that, oh, f**k, I'm gay.

760
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You gay, dude.

761
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's proof, okay, okay.

762
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Undeniable proof that I do, in fact, love penis.

763
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah, true, yeah, it's true, dude.

764
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
F**k me.

765
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I don't even know how to say that.

766
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Okay, it's set in Miami, Florida.

767
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The most villainous scum of the earth live there.

768
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah, totally.

769
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
No place on earth could possibly be as villainous and degenerate as Miami,

770
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
in my opinion.

771
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I agree.

772
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
A close second did for Colorado.

773
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Have you ever seen the Miami connection?

774
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Yes, I have.

775
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You have?

776
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Okay, good.

777
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Wait, that's the one with the guy he does that.

778
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's like one particular martial art?

779
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, that's one thing.

780
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It might not be called...

781
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I know what you're talking about.

782
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, I think it's the Miami connection.

783
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
My friend used to have this giant, beautiful poster.

784
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
He had this pride and joy.

785
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It was this gorgeously painted, big, fully-framed image of the Miami connection.

786
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Oh, you nerd, dude.

787
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh, my God.

788
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh, my God.

789
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Oh, yeah, dude.

790
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I can't believe this.

791
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What a crazy person.

792
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I tricked you.

793
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I tricked you.

794
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Do you think I was gonna ice beam or some gay sh**?

795
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Maybe.

796
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Yeah, well, shows what you know.

797
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Anyway, you're f**king gay.

798
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
This is a story plain and simple about evolution.

799
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yes, it is.

800
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Not to spell you on battle, but that as well.

801
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Sh**.

802
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I don't care if...

803
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Okay, wow, it didn't raise to be cool.

804
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Thanks.

805
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I tried to trick you, but I didn't trick you.

806
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What the f**k's up with that?

807
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
What the f**k's up with that?

808
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, my God.

809
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Oh, sh**.

810
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh, it's incredible.

811
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It's unbelievable.

812
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's never been done.

813
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's beautiful when a plan comes into action.

814
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That's not the line.

815
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I love it when a plan comes together, you know.

816
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The A team.

817
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Don't even talk.

818
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Ding dong.

819
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Don't even talk, man.

820
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Just don't even talk.

821
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You little ding dong.

822
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Okay, and by what I mean, it's about evolution.

823
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Everyone knows that I'm an extremely pious man.

824
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I know.

825
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Believe me, I know, said Ben, rolling his eyes.

826
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm a pious man, and as such, I...

827
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Oh, you f**king nerd, dude.

828
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm just so gay.

829
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You're so gay.

830
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm so gay.

831
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm so gay.

832
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You're just getting gayer every time.

833
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Every single second goes by.

834
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Every last one.

835
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm auto-clicking on a giant cookie, but instead of a cookie, it's a giant dildo, and that makes me gayer.

836
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Every single second.

837
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah, yeah, plus one, plus one, plus one.

838
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Plus one, plus one.

839
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
One, one, one, one.

840
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Everyone hit plus one gay in the comments.

841
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Oh, that wasn't fair.

842
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That wasn't fair?

843
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Dude, it's f**king one.

844
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Everything's fair.

845
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Wait, is fighting ineffective against poison?

846
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Maybe.

847
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I forgot.

848
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah, I think it is.

849
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Otherwise, that focus blast would have been super effective.

850
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah.

851
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
All right.

852
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Oh, but no, I know.

853
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's resist fighting, but I'm also dark.

854
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Just weak, so it...

855
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah, I know.

856
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yeah, yeah, I thought it was going to be super because you're dark, but it was, I guess,

857
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
bleh, poison, whatever.

858
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Just read, dude.

859
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Just read.

860
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I know.

861
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Well, if only I had a max revive to revive one of my Pokemon.

862
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Wouldn't that be nice?

863
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That would be nice.

864
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That's what we all want.

865
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
That's what we all want in this life.

866
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
By the way, no one ever let that meme die.

867
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Well, I mean, you can if you want to.

868
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
What the f**k, man?

869
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
For f**k's sake.

870
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Whatever.

871
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm f**king making progress here.

872
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah.

873
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Worked out just...

874
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Zoroarxoro...

875
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Ah, come on, man.

876
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That would have been hilarious.

877
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Real funny, real f**k.

879
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm f**ked.

880
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I know you're f**ked.

881
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yep, yep.

882
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
God damn it.

883
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Let's end this.

884
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

885
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
No, but it is like this.

886
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And it always will be.

887
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Whoa, what the f**k?

888
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Oh, shit, man.

889
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Okay, well, good game, idiot.

890
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah, wow.

891
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's not like, hey, you started like you cheated.

892
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Haha.

893
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I know.

894
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
No, I would never.

895
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I would never cheat.

896
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Anyway, you know what?

897
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay, okay.

898
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Like, yeah, the thing about the Max Survive, like,

899
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
yeah, you know, maybe...

900
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Cheating.

901
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You could call it...

902
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Maybe some people would think that's cheating.

903
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And those people are cordially invited

904
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
to please forgive me and I love you.

905
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Don't be mad at it, friends.

906
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But the...

907
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But Nate.

908
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Okay, Nate being the dick bag.

909
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The dick bag that he is.

910
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
We all never trust Nate.

911
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We have him from day one.

912
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
He's a sneak.

913
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
He's a creep.

914
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
He's a demon.

915
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Jeez.

916
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So, you know,

917
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
because nobody trusts him,

918
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
because of his proven status as scoundrel.

919
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
His corporate greed

920
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and basically just everything horrible about him.

921
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That's right.

922
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Has been uncovered through data mining.

923
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
That's correct.

924
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
He wasn't just about like,

925
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
oh, the Max Survive, you know,

926
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
use it off camera.

927
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Oh, cheating or whatever.

928
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
He was like...

929
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
He was like, dude, did you...

930
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Does this mean, like,

931
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
you didn't beat the Elite Four?

932
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Like, were you just faking the whole Elite Four?

933
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Were you reviving your Pokemon between...

934
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Like, first of all, it wouldn't even make sense

935
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
that I would use a Max Survive in between battles, right?

936
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Like, if I was...

937
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
If I had cheated the Elite Four,

938
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
the way I would have cheated it,

939
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
was that I would have, like, you know,

940
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
scummed the battles and done them over and over again

941
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
until I won and then saved.

942
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And I was like...

943
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And he, like, pretended not to believe me

944
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
for a second or whatever.

945
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But I was like...

946
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Shit. I shouldn't have done that.

947
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Shit.

948
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And I finally, I was like, all right, fine.

949
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I have the full uncut video.

950
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I have the uncut footage of me fighting the Elite Four,

951
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
you know, legit.

952
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I will upload it just for you.

953
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
But then he was like, no, I believe you.

954
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But then I was like, why don't I upload?

955
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So I think, actually, I already did.

956
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I already uploaded it, but it's not available.

957
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I want to, like, cut...

958
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Because it's not just that there's a bunch of, like, stuff at the beginning

959
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
that's not interesting. I want to, like, snip that off

960
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
so it's just the Elite Four.

961
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And I'll put, like, a little link in the description,

962
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
who wants to know how cool I am.

963
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Anyone who wants to watch this obviously

964
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
doctored footage that I cut out...

965
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Obviously doctored footage.

966
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
That I cut out when I revived my Pokemon.

967
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Watch me, like, fuck around with berries

968
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and, like, you know, switch around

969
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
move sets and stuff

970
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
for, you know, 15 minutes in between every battle.

971
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You know, you're all welcome to it.

972
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Mm-hmm.

973
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You will never retain any credibility.

974
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You'll never survive.

975
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
No matter what you do.

976
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Ooh, that was bad.

977
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That was bad.

978
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Ooh, that hurt, though.

979
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Dang.

980
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Durant's fucking cool.

981
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah, I know. He deserves more praise in life

982
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
than he does. He receives.

983
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah, I have to agree.

984
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Um, he's gay, though.

985
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't like that.

986
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I don't agree with that.

987
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Kevin? Yeah.

988
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I wish you could name all of your Pokemon

989
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
before going into Glorious Battle.

990
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Even in a random...

991
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
in a random thing.

992
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Uh, ooh, I got a lot of...

993
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I got a lot of shit options here.

994
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah.

995
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Well, it's fitting.

996
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Because you're gay.

997
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Yeah, I agree.

998
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Check this out, Faggot. Oh, no.

999
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Oh, but I won't have to.

1000
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But I won't have to.

1001
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Because you're a nerd.

1002
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
All right, whatever.

1003
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'm not even gonna...

1004
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I should've just done that right at the gate.

1005
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm gonna be a problem, isn't he?

1006
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Why did I waste all my good luck

1007
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
on that successful sleep powder?

1008
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Ah, fuck.

1009
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Ah, dang.

1010
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Ah, darn.

1011
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yes.

1012
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Just what I wanted.

1013
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah, whatever.

1014
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
My chest o' berry didn't mean anything.

1015
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Can't sleep, bitch.

1016
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It didn't mean anything to me.

1017
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Uh...

1018
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah, we'll get...

1019
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
get fucked here.

1020
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Ah, I knew you were gonna switch. I tricked ya.

1021
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I tricked ya!

1022
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah!

1023
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Look at that.

1024
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Crazy. Look what I've done.

1025
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Uh...

1026
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Hmm...

1027
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Oh,

1028
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
you're gonna be doing some nasty shit, aren't you?

1029
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Nah, I would never do that.

1030
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah, I think you're gonna do some real nasty shit.

1031
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
As I said before, I'm a very pious man,

1032
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and I would never use underhanded tactics.

1033
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
You would never...

1034
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You would never do a toxic stall like me.

1035
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah.

1036
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah, like, no!

1037
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
You would never be such a villain as this guy.

1038
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
God fucking...

1039
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I can't believe this.

1040
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Throughout the nuzlocke,

1041
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
he's been transformed more and more into snagly whiplash.

1042
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Wait.

1043
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Why did you go first?

1044
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
You know.

1045
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
No, I don't know.

1046
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I mean, you don't...

1047
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You don't have swift swim.

1048
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You're keogre.

1049
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Well...

1050
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
How the fuck did you go first?

1051
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm just a fast guy.

1052
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
No!

1053
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I'm a fast guy, Ben.

1054
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
How...

1055
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Hmm...

1056
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm not sure about this one.

1057
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm unconvinced.

1058
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Well, you know what they say.

1059
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Come on, jump bluff.

1060
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Come on, do this for me.

1061
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Oh, you fucking nerd.

1062
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Oh, jump bluff.

1063
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Jump bluff.

1064
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So bad.

1065
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Why?

1066
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Oh, he's good.

1067
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Wait, what were you...

1068
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Oh, I think you were...

1069
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
What were you gonna do?

1070
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So bad.

1071
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I was gonna do a single thing.

1072
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I think you were gonna do something.

1073
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I realized his head was like a xenomorph.

1074
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Um...

1075
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Dialga.

1076
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Dialga's so much cooler than Polkia.

1077
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah, Polkia's gay.

1078
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Polkia looks so terrible.

1079
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Garrachina is where it's at, though.

1080
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Tell me more.

1081
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Oh, right, I was completely sidetracked.

1082
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
About your gay thing.

1083
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

1084
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:18,000
The high sci-fi setting of Miami, Florida.

1085
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Right.

1086
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
In the distant future of the present day.

1087
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah.

1088
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah.

1089
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
What's it fucking called?

1090
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The herptophon of the world,

1091
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
meaning reptiles and amphibians.

1092
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Herptophon?

1093
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah, no, herptophon.

1094
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Herptophon.

1095
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Herptophon, okay.

1096
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yes.

1097
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That's the real term used by real people.

1098
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I believe it.

1099
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
In their everyday life.

1100
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yeah?

1101
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Is that a fact?

1102
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah, that is a fact.

1103
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I learned it from www.com.com.

1104
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I learned it from

1105
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
the wwe.

1106
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
wwe.

1107
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
wwe.

1108
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
e

1109
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Blossom is so bad.

1110
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I hate it so much,

1111
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
even though I love its design.

1112
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It's just so bad.

1113
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Um...

1114
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And they

1115
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
evolve, not through conventional

1116
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
means, but they hyper-evolve

1117
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
using virtues.

1118
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Virtues.

1119
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Tell me

1120
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
more about virtues.

1121
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Of course, of course.

1122
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Once a dirty,

1123
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
disgusting to generate,

1124
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
disgusting herptophon,

1125
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
a member of that family

1126
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
becomes aware of

1127
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
through humans teaching it

1128
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
or through finding out of their own

1129
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
accords, the concept

1130
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
of virtues, such as

1131
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
chastity

1132
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and humility and justice.

1133
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Okay, yeah.

1134
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Once they learn

1135
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
of these concepts,

1136
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
they

1137
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
evolve past their primitive

1138
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
uh, their primitive

1139
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
like the lowest rung on the

1140
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
echeladder of

1141
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
echeladder.

1142
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
They're just shit, and they become

1143
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
not shit by becoming cool,

1144
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and to become cool, you have to learn about virtues.

1145
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Virtues.

1146
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Okay, that's pretty much exactly

1147
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
what you told me.

1148
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Wait...

1149
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I didn't tell you that at all.

1150
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh, I know what... Gigadrain did twice

1151
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
because I lost flying type.

1152
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Oh, I forgot Roosted that.

1153
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Yeah, I mean, okay.

1154
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You told me about the main character,

1155
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
but all you told me

1156
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
about the main character

1157
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
is basically exactly what you just described.

1158
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Like, so

1159
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
like, before, I was like,

1160
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
you were like, ah, yes, he is a reptile

1161
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
of some description.

1162
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I won't spoil. What did what?

1163
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Who, you know,

1164
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
who became

1165
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
this new thing when he

1166
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
discovered these particular virtues?

1167
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And I was like, haha, that's funny.

1168
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And then you just described, like, yeah, my story

1169
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
is about a world where herptophon

1170
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
have become cool things by discovering virtues.

1171
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I'm like, oh,

1172
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
well, well, shit.

1173
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I should have known.

1174
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You should have known that. I'm too

1175
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
slippery.

1176
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You're pretty slippery, dude. You're being pretty slippery right now.

1177
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm not gonna lie.

1178
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Not gonna lie.

1179
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Anyway.

1180
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
We can say

1181
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
he is an alligator.

1182
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yes, yes.

1183
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The alligator.

1184
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The alligator.

1185
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
The alligator to end all alligators.

1186
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I'm

1187
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm really

1188
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm really curious.

1189
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I'm really curious to see more

1190
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
of these virtues, honestly.

1191
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That concept really tickles something within me.

1192
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
What? It's because

1193
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
you don't believe it, because it's true.

1194
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I don't know what I believe

1195
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
anymore. That's terrible, by the way.

1196
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah, I really wish I didn't die,

1197
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
but it was a pretty good

1198
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
it's pretty good trade, TBH.

1199
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
TBH.

1200
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
GBH.

1201
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
GBA.

1202
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Game Boy Advanced.

1203
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
To continue,

1204
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
this alligator has learned specifically

1205
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
of the virtues

1206
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
of justice so far.

1207
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And he seeks to

1208
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
better. Wait, wasn't there another one?

1209
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Was it

1210
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
courage? I thought you said it was

1211
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
courage and justice.

1212
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Courage and

1213
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
justice, but mainly justice.

1214
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Mainly justice.

1215
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And he seeks to fully

1216
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
shut the fuck up, dude. It's not funny at all.

1217
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
This isn't a comedy. I know.

1218
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm sorry.

1219
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It's nothing about this.

1220
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm head over heels in

1221
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
serious mode right now.

1222
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm head over heels serious.

1223
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Oh

1224
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
God, please. Yes. Yes, I did the right

1225
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
thing.

1226
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It's not even cool.

1227
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So good.

1228
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It's ridiculous.

1229
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So good it's not real.

1230
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So good it's stupid as fuck.

1231
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
What was I saying?

1232
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. He

1233
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
seeks to better, to first of all

1234
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
to better himself and to

1235
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
then in turn

1236
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
spread these virtues

1237
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
to fellow herptophon and

1238
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
to humans too.

1239
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Because humans like

1240
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
those fucking... Does he want to spread all

1241
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
virtues or just the virtues that he has become

1242
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
aware of? No, well

1243
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
you can't really spread virtues. You have

1244
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
a master yourself. Yeah, okay.

1245
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So he wants to conquer them all

1246
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
and then spread them.

1247
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Like the patron saint

1248
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
he is

1249
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the beautiful man.

1250
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So he's like a walking talking, he's like a

1251
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
missionary of justice.

1252
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1253
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Incredible. Alright, I'm gonna lose.

1254
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It's over. You're definitely gonna lose.

1255
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
There's nothing I could possibly do right now.

1256
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Anyway

1257
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah, I might as well just fucking in my

1258
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
fucking life right now. Yeah,

1259
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
bro.

1260
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Kill yourself, bro.

1261
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
No.

1262
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Humans are like...

1263
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
they are privileged pieces of shit

1264
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and due to the fact that they are human

1265
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and that their ancestors have worked

1266
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
to evolve in the past

1267
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
some of them may give up the virtues

1268
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and stagnate

1269
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
evolutionarily

1270
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and you can't go backwards.

1271
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You can only just be a piece of shit

1272
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and not help the human race

1273
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
if you cast my drift.

1274
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I do.

1275
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So you don't like

1276
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
turn back into a

1277
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
whatever the shit form

1278
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
of a human is.

1279
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
A neanderthal.

1280
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So

1281
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
he wants to again just

1282
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
elevate everyone to a higher plane

1283
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
and spread the

1284
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
wonderful things that are

1285
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
either these virtues.

1286
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Shit.

1287
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And to do so

1288
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
he has dedicated his life to solving crime

1289
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
and

1290
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
helping those in need

1291
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and that's how he will spread his

1292
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
message by corrupting

1293
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
or bringing justice to this corrupt

1294
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
world that is Miami.

1295
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
This

1296
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
disgusting wasteland

1297
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
this filth

1298
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
this fucking filth

1299
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
that is Florida.

1300
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
He will purify it.

1301
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Purify Florida.

1302
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Purify Florida.

1303
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Okay man.

1304
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I understand the premise

1305
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
and the plot a little bit now.

1306
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
What is it though?

1307
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
What's happening?

1308
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
That's the setting.

1309
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
That's the setting and that's the premise.

1310
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You want to know what's going on

1311
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
specifically in this

1312
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
case.

1313
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Anything you feel like sharing.

1314
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Sure.

1315
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
All I'm willing to

1316
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
let out

1317
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
is that there's a lot of

1318
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
wine to see. There's mother going

1319
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
along. There's fucking bitches doing

1320
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
gay shit.

1321
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
There's the giant web

1322
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Nate from

1323
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
PCP owns a casino.

1324
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Right.

1325
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I think I remember

1326
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
that detail or something like it.

1327
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Wait, so Nate

1328
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
personally is in the store.

1329
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Okay.

1330
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That's interesting.

1331
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Well

1332
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
he goes by another name to keep low.

1333
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Also fuck you.

1334
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Yeah!

1335
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
That's a two in a row. Am I a genius?

1336
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
That was my three in a row bitch.

1337
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Was that only three? Oh it's pitiful.

1338
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It's pitiful.

1339
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's pitiful compared to the ten in a row streak

1340
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I'm about to embark on.

1341
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah.

1342
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
There's a lot of

1343
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
people

1344
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
are very apprehensive to learn of the virtues

1345
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
as they believe

1346
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
them to be old fashioned when in fact

1347
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
they are new fashioned

1348
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
and they are

1349
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
they are fashion

1350
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
weekly. They are incredible

1351
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and the main character wants

1352
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
to spread that around like wildfire

1353
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and this

1354
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
specific case starts out

1355
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
as a kid mapping

1356
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
eventually it evolves into something much greater.

1357
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Does a leggy dame

1358
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
is he approached by a leggy dame?

1359
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Oh, of course.

1360
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
One of

1361
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
intense hysterics in fact.

1362
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Fan.

1363
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I like to hear that.

1364
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yes, of course.

1365
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah.

1366
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
If you're picking up what I'm throwing down.

1367
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I totally am bro.

1368
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Of course.

1369
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I'm feeling it.

1370
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You know.

1371
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Okay.

1372
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I get the

1373
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I know what it is

1374
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
story wise but it's a comic, right?

1375
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yes.

1376
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It's a comic.

1377
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Okay, sweet.

1378
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
What's

1379
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
how

1380
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
how long is it going to be?

1381
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Where will it

1382
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
happen?

1383
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It will be released around

1384
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
20 pages.

1385
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's not going to be all done.

1386
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
The entire thing I estimate

1387
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
to be around 60 maybe?

1388
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
60 pages, okay.

1389
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Maybe longer.

1390
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Probably not shorter.

1391
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Can I ask

1392
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
how done is it?

1393
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
All the pages

1394
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
are

1395
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
sketched out and now I'm doing the finals.

1396
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Shit.

1397
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Shit.

1398
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
That's all I can say. Shit.

1399
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm so bad.

1400
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
You're so fucked.

1401
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I'm going for 10.

1402
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
10 in a row.

1403
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Well.

1404
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Now I know you're paying to me.

1405
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm just clicking oh.

1406
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
That's a purple color.

1407
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It feels bad, right?

1408
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It feels horrible.

1409
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
You did this to me.

1410
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
You made this happen, dude.

1411
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
That was wrong of me.

1412
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Whatever.

1413
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Come on.

1414
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
All right.

1415
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
How long did it take you to rough

1416
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
the 60?

1417
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It took me...

1418
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
No.

1419
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I know you've been working on this

1420
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
while you've had school and shit.

1421
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I know you've got stuff.

1422
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Not everything is sketched.

1423
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
The first block

1424
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I'm coming out with

1425
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
so I have that much done.

1426
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
To be honest with you,

1427
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I have only

1428
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
really started like a month ago.

1429
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I've just been like, yeah, that's the thing

1430
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
that's going to fucking happen, but I've only gone down

1431
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
to brass 10.

1432
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I know you mentioned it a while ago,

1433
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
but I only heard that

1434
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
you'd actually started working on it

1435
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
pretty recently.

1436
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Recently-ish.

1437
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Of course.

1438
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yeah.

1439
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Really, all I had to do,

1440
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
the drawing is easy

1441
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and writing is easy.

1442
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
It only took

1443
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
this shit.

1444
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It only took three days

1445
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
to sketch all of it out.

1446
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Holy shit.

1447
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
You...

1448
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I'm fucked.

1449
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's incredible.

1450
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I'm jealous

1451
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
that you could

1452
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
just come up with all that shit

1453
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
in so little time.

1454
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah.

1455
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Most of it was writing

1456
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
and I just had to...

1457
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Once I had all the speech bubbles in my head,

1458
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
it was easy to just

1459
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
make it interesting on paper.

1460
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm doing the Andrew Hussie

1461
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
the Andrew Hussie way I

1462
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
format my sketches.

1463
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
All of them are on little boxes on one piece of paper.

1464
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh.

1465
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
So they're like...

1466
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
basically? Yeah.

1467
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Okay.

1468
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I don't know.

1469
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That still sounds pretty good.

1470
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I still think you're doing it faster than I would have.

1471
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Well, you know, I'm young blood.

1472
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah, you are.

1473
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm basically old hat at this point.

1474
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Basically, just should die.

1475
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Absolute.

1476
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Absolute. Are you familiar with the broken mat saga?

1477
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
What the fuck?

1478
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
No.

1479
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I don't watch...

1480
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I don't watch the PCP.

1481
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
You're not familiar with our work.

1482
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
You don't keep up with us?

1483
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
No, I'm not.

1484
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I just have to do with MatPat.

1485
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Did you get MatPat on a PCP episode?

1486
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
No.

1487
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
God damn it.

1488
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
No, broken mat, the wrestler.

1489
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
His brother, he went crazy

1490
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
because his brother did something, I don't know.

1491
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Did something?

1492
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
He did something or whatever.

1493
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Oh, how could you not know about this?

1494
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Yes, okay.

1495
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
That's right.

1496
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I don't know who to switch into though.

1497
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Probably...

1498
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Wait, I know.

1499
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Damn it.

1500
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
This is a great decision.

1501
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Nerd.

1502
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Damn it.

1503
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Whatever.

1504
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
You don't even fucking have shit.

1505
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Yeah.

1506
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Nice choice scarf.

1507
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Brill.

1508
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Does fur evolve? It doesn't, does it?

1509
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
No, it doesn't.

1510
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So that EVO light is useless?

1511
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yes.

1512
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Alright, well, fine.

1513
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
But yeah, it took me about three days

1514
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
to get through that.

1515
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And I would say about the sessions I was doing it

1516
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
is like seven hours.

1517
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Shit.

1518
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And then I would play Minecraft

1519
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
for another seven hours, and then

1520
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
that's it.

1521
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Good.

1522
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I actually do

1523
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
want to go into specific detail

1524
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
about Minecraft, because

1525
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
be as multiple people

1526
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
in watching this

1527
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
right now. No, exactly what I'm talking about.

1528
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Something devilish. I have been

1529
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
collectively performing

1530
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
sacred rituals

1531
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
in Minecraft.

1532
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Alright. Go on.

1533
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Go on. Finish it.

1534
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Finish it.

1535
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Finish it.

1536
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm so bad.

1537
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Yeah, dude.

1538
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You thought a burn would fucking stop me, bro.

1539
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I'm gonna fucking die.

1540
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You're gonna fucking die, dude.

1541
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You're a lost cause.

1542
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I'm a lost cause.

1543
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
No.

1544
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Yeah, bro.

1545
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
What the fuck are you thinking, dude?

1546
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I have a chance to laugh.

1547
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
You think Keogre can do shit?

1548
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Keogre.

1549
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Ben Steele here can't pronounce words.

1550
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
What is it? Keogre?

1551
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Keogre? Stupid.

1552
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I think Keogre sounds cooler.

1553
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Well, it's also not real.

1554
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Anyway.

1555
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Anything's real.

1556
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
That's it. Everything's real.

1557
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
What is important is Minecraft.

1558
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm about to explain why Minecraft is extremely

1559
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
important to my current

1560
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
mental state.

1561
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Sure.

1562
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
It's time to say hello to my ultimate weapon.

1563
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Oh, okay. Oh, well, it doesn't even matter.

1564
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Okay, wait, shit, it matters.

1565
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Because I miscalculated.

1566
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
In my brain, I got my calculator out

1567
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
and in fact, it gave me a wrong one.

1568
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It was from 100 years ago.

1569
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Calculators didn't exist, so I didn't even

1570
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
have anything in my hand.

1571
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Shit, I knew I should have Dragon Dance.

1572
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Oh, good, but it didn't matter.

1573
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Even Chancey was no match.

1574
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Even Chancey, wow.

1575
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Even the unstoppable Chancey.

1576
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
The powerhouse that it is.

1577
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
No.

1578
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah, bro, was that four?

1579
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
No, that was three.

1580
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Okay, okay, I've matched your streak.

1581
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Shit, no.

1582
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yeah, all right, this one's for all the beans.

1583
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
No.

1584
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
This is where it gets real.

1585
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Anyway, I have...

1586
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Oh, wait, what the shit?

1587
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Did we just start two battles at once?

1588
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Yeah, we did.

1589
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Well, let's do them both at the same time.

1590
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Oh, shit.

1591
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
All right, I'm down.

1592
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I'm completely down.

1593
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Yeah.

1594
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
More down than you could ever know.

1595
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Oh, wait.

1596
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Oh, shit, shit.

1597
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I have to fucking...

1598
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
That wasn't good enough.

1599
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
That wasn't good enough at all, oh dear.

1600
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I have nothing.

1601
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Okay.

1602
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I didn't tell the story about Minecraft.

1603
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Oh, shit.

1604
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
You've been hinting at something.

1605
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Yeah.

1606
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I have recently started playing Not Discovered.

1607
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Well, I have gone back into

1608
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
a server that

1609
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
has been

1610
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
on the same map for six years

1611
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
and

1612
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
it has no rules

1613
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
and it's completely vanilla.

1614
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Wow, wow, wow.

1615
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
That may not seem like much to an outsider.

1616
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Those on the...

1617
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Those in the

1618
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
vast and special Minecraft community

1619
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
will note that most people

1620
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
are extremely autistic and like to have

1621
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
non-vanilla, non-PVP

1622
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
shalom.

1623
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Some of these are gay and they like to build things.

1624
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah.

1625
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
But partisans and amazing people

1626
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
such as myself like to kill people

1627
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
for sport.

1628
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And as such,

1629
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I greatly

1630
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
like things that

1631
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
that server do the fact that spawn

1632
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
is like a fucking wasteland.

1633
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Imagine if you set a bomb off on Tokyo.

1634
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
That's what...

1635
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And Tokyo is...

1636
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I think about setting a bomb off in Tokyo

1637
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
every day that I remember that

1638
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Fully Coolie 2 is still coming out.

1639
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Oh, oh, god.

1640
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
No, I forgot about that.

1641
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Yeah, right. I forget about it sometimes too.

1642
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But then I remember and that's the worst day in my life.

1643
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Anyway,

1644
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
it's deeply rewarding.

1645
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And the fact that has been up

1646
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
for six years and extremely important

1647
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
because of the fact that

1648
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
so much history has been

1649
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
enacted in these

1650
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
hallowed halls of Minecraft.

1651
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It's a

1652
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
digital...

1653
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It basically is more important than the United States

1654
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
is what I'm saying.

1655
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I can believe that.

1656
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I'm sure it's better than

1657
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Trump's America.

1658
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
No!

1659
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I told you not to talk about this.

1660
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Yeah, bro. We're doing it.

1661
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Aw, come on.

1662
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
That was gay.

1663
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Nah, I should do that.

1664
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I'm talking about the bannet thing.

1665
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Why'd you have to do that?

1666
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
It's stupid.

1667
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
It's okay. I have an answer for everything.

1668
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Oh, nice stone edge, you fucking nerd.

1669
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Your Durant's done.

1670
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Fire Punch is unstoppable.

1671
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
The bannet is unstoppable.

1672
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I'm winning both of these at the same time.

1673
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm just so on the ball.

1674
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I'm talking about Minecraft.

1675
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I know, right?

1676
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I fucking trapped you by making me talk about shit.

1677
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Shit, damn it.

1678
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Shit, god damn it.

1679
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
This can't be happening.

1680
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm in charge here.

1681
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It's happening, bro.

1682
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Damn.

1683
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Wait.

1684
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Oh shit, you used wish.

1685
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
No.

1686
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Nooo.

1687
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Boo.

1688
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Wait.

1689
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
That's no problem.

1690
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Why didn't your wish come true?

1691
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Because I used it before, dummy.

1692
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Shouldn't it have come true this turn?

1693
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
No.

1694
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I used it two turns ago.

1695
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
No, you...

1696
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
When did it come true?

1697
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Wait, is it going to happen now?

1698
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I don't think so.

1699
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I think it already came true.

1700
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
No, no, opposed.

1701
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It doesn't say so.

1702
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I'm really confused.

1703
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Maybe you're just stupid.

1704
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Was it the taunt?

1705
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Did the taunt stop it?

1706
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
No, no, of course not.

1707
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Of course not.

1708
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
It's cheap.

1709
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It's cheap.

1710
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It says Max Revive Ben Sato right here.

1711
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
That's not okay, dude.

1712
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Oh, come on.

1713
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Gay.

1714
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Gay, dude.

1715
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Look at this kid over here

1716
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
trying to act like he didn't cheat.

1717
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Wow.

1718
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I never...

1719
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
It's okay.

1720
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
You know what?

1721
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I have to ignore

1722
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
all of Munchie's hurtful rhetoric

1723
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
and just concentrate.

1724
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
His hateful propaganda.

1725
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Concentrate on crushing him where it counts

1726
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
in Pokemon Town.

1727
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
With Pokemon,

1728
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I mean with Minecraft,

1729
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I have been partaking

1730
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
in recent activities with

1731
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
most, like six people

1732
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
from the piece...

1733
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
From the

1734
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers

1735
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
fan base.

1736
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
There is no fan base

1737
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
for the Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers.

1738
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
It doesn't exist.

1739
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I am surprised

1740
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
and alarmed if you're telling me

1741
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
that that's not true.

1742
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Who are these

1743
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Minecraft fuckholes?

1744
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
These Minecraft scoundrels.

1745
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Who are these Minecraft wizards?

1746
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
You've been

1747
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
you've been conjuring with.

1748
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Conjuring.

1749
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
One of them is named.

1750
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Really close to the mic so he can

1751
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
sample this exact...

1752
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
This like three seconds I'm saying his name.

1753
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So he can sample this in his next

1754
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
rap.

1755
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
That one kid.

1756
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And Steel Viper

1757
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
77.

1758
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Oh, I know Steel Viper. He posts

1759
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
shit on the subreddit all the time.

1760
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I don't follow the subreddit because it's gay.

1761
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I mean

1762
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
unfortunately the subreddit

1763
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
is just our shit

1764
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
being posted by people.

1765
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
We haven't managed to elevate

1766
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
to anything other than that yet.

1767
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It's a useful repository

1768
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
if nothing else.

1769
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Yes, but I've seen Steel Viper

1770
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
on there once in a while.

1771
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And we are

1772
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
amassing arms to do

1773
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
a great deed

1774
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
and destroy everyone on the server.

1775
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And that's been occupying most

1776
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
of my time as I value Minecraft life

1777
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
over my real life. Like all

1778
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
millennials.

1779
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah.

1780
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Yeah, I mean probably.

1781
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Wait. Oh, air balloon.

1782
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Fuck, air balloon was popped. Why did I knock off?

1783
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I must be a

1784
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
A true

1785
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
idiot of unrivaled proportions.

1786
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I must just be a person

1787
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
who is

1788
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
going to be dead soon.

1789
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I'm

1790
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
being so stupid right now.

1791
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I'm being so fucking foolish, dude.

1792
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Oh, no.

1793
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
LOL.

1794
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I was ready.

1795
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I was ready to die.

1796
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
You know what? I still

1797
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
fucking am. Come on.

1798
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Whatever.

1799
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah, okay.

1800
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Yeah, okay.

1801
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
You win this round slow, bro.

1802
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Not even good, dude.

1803
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Not even fucking good.

1804
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
And so Minecraft

1805
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
has been

1806
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
thoroughly trampling all my

1807
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
attempts at

1808
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
well, not trampling, but it's been cleaning

1809
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
in my drawing time, which I'm 100% okay

1810
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
with. As that MPC said

1811
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
all my life is Pokemon, but for me

1812
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
it's Minecraft. Which is

1813
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
even more autistic.

1814
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Yeah, vastly

1815
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
more so.

1816
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
You don't even make shit in Minecraft.

1817
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
You just say, you just disparage people

1818
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
that make shit in Minecraft.

1819
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So wait, I'm sorry. We've been talking about this

1820
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
this whole time and I'm confused.

1821
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
What is it? What is it?

1822
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
What's happening in Minecraft?

1823
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Is it nothing?

1824
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
No, no.

1825
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
With my lesions of fans that I have

1826
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
we are constructing

1827
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
a base

1828
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
and once we

1829
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
are all decked out

1830
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
with the most least swaggiest of armor

1831
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
we will enact our

1832
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
global genocide of all new

1833
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
fags. Well, I'm looking forward to that.

1834
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Yeah. Naturally.

1835
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Naturally.

1836
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Shit.

1837
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Yeah, dude.

1838
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Nice fucking

1839
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
cheap-ass crit, stupid.

1840
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Yeah.

1841
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
But it's too late.

1842
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm invincible. I can't be beat.

1843
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Oh, yeah.

1844
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Look at this kid over here thinking he's hot.

1845
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
You know what they call me?

1846
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
They call me that hunk of meat

1847
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
that's tough to beat.

1848
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That's what the ladies say.

1849
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
That's how that works?

1850
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
What?

1851
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
How what works?

1852
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I didn't know. I was all wrong.

1853
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah, bro.

1854
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I was all wrong.

1855
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Look at this piece of shit I have.

1856
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
A fucking shatot.

1857
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Ugh.

1858
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Uh, well,

1859
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I mean,

1860
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
it's a good switch out, I guess.

1861
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Uh, actually,

1862
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
no, he's gay. Yeah.

1863
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
It's horrible.

1864
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yeah, he's really dumb. He's really dumb and bad.

1865
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Uh, he's pitiful.

1866
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Blin-pop bitch.

1867
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I know. I know.

1868
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I'm fucked now.

1869
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Um, guess what?

1870
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Oh, no!

1871
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Hidden power. Oh, come on.

1872
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
What was that? Ice? Oh, shit!

1873
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'm not even good at this game, dude.

1874
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
God, why do moves miss?

1875
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It's not fair. It's not right.

1876
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It's not fair.

1877
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It's not fair when things happen.

1878
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I'm bad at video games.

1879
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Yeah.

1880
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Right.

1881
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Was it probably hidden power fire?

1882
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
No, it was...

1883
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It could have been hidden power fighting.

1884
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Was it hidden power fighting?

1885
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
You know it, dude.

1886
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
No, no.

1887
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
You know it. That's exactly what it was.

1888
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Maybe it was hidden power normal.

1889
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Yeah, it's probably that.

1890
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Oh, of course it was. It was that as well.

1891
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I mean, what else would it have been, really,

1892
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
when you get right down to it?

1893
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
All right. All right, jelly man.

1894
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
You're the greatest.

1895
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Yeah, there's nothing you can do

1896
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
against all this jelly.

1897
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You know what I'm saying, dude?

1898
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You know what I'm saying, bro?

1899
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Maybe you've heard the...

1900
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
No, hip-no!

1901
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Oh, god. He's at exactly 50.

1902
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
What a piece of absolute shit.

1903
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Oh, no.

1904
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Yeah, bro.

1905
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Dude, you're paralyzed. You can't do anything.

1906
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
You can't do anything.

1907
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
You're weak.

1908
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
You're weak, dude. Quiver dance?

1909
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Pathetic.

1910
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
No, check this out.

1911
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Check this out, dude. Check this out, dude.

1912
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Yeah, dude.

1913
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Shit.

1914
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Yeah, bro.

1915
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Oh, I really...

1916
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I really came out ahead. You really screwed the pooch on that one.

1917
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
You really screwed the pooch.

1918
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You definitely screwed the pooch.

1919
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Yeah, right.

1920
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Oh, chat-hot. Oh, nothing.

1921
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Nothing. Not a single thing.

1922
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Yeah, I have no...

1923
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Shit, that was your first guy.

1924
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I thought we were further along.

1925
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
No.

1926
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
No, not at all.

1927
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Uh, fuck.

1928
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
This Jensen is gonna sweep me.

1929
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Maybe.

1930
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Probably.

1931
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
What do I have here?

1932
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Not...

1933
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I'm God.

1934
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I just realized I'm God.

1935
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I hope the camera was on that what I just did,

1936
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
because I'm fucking God.

1937
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
What, that you just did that psycho shift?

1938
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yeah.

1939
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
That's just what you do with a sigilif.

1940
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Dude, you're just bad.

1941
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I really wish I should have taunted the turn before.

1942
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
But you know what?

1943
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I didn't have a choice.

1944
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
It's all good.

1945
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And now you're gonna die.

1946
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Fuck. God!

1947
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Christ, why didn't I see that coming?

1948
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Yeah.

1949
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Yeah, you fucking punk.

1950
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I really fucked that up.

1951
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
You punk.

1952
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
What am I doing here?

1953
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Oh no.

1954
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Oh dear.

1955
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

1956
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I think I'm worried about this meowstick.

1957
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I hope I don't have another...

1958
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
fucking...

1959
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Who is the one?

1960
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Who did you fucking call mine

1961
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
sweep me with the first time?

1962
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Alakazam.

1963
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah, I hope you don't have another Alakazam

1964
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
situation on our hands.

1965
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Why are you so stupid?

1966
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I don't know, man.

1967
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Why did you think that was a good idea?

1968
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Because I have many

1969
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
abilities.

1970
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
You should give me more credit.

1971
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
You know...

1972
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Yeah, you're right.

1973
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Nah, dude.

1974
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But ironically, it was you

1975
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
who was paralyzed.

1976
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
It was in fact me.

1977
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It was me who was gay.

1978
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Yes, that is the great irony.

1979
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Come on, dude!

1980
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
What the fuck? You didn't even know I had that!

1981
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
The power predict

1982
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
is real.

1983
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
What the fuck?

1984
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
The power predict is in fact realer than it has ever been.

1985
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Did you just use that

1986
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
that I was going to switch to

1987
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
and you were just like...

1988
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
No, I knew.

1989
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I knew, dude.

1990
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I knew because

1991
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
you thought it would be some good.

1992
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
You know because I'm good.

1993
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You're not good, bro!

1994
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You're just

1995
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
not okay!

1996
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
You don't even

1997
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
fucking know who's real

1998
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
and who's not real.

1999
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
That's true.

2000
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But...

2001
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Oh, no. Why did I do that?

2002
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Oh, no!

2003
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You're not even good, dude.

2004
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
This collusion of play.

2005
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
This collusion of play.

2006
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I can tell.

2007
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Yeah, the two U's are definitely colluding with each other

2008
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
in both of these simultaneous

2009
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
battles we got going on here.

2010
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
They have mass info

2011
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
that they will use.

2012
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
What a fucking disaster this is.

2013
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
That's what you get when you have

2014
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
someone like Ben St.

2015
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
aka Max Survive

2016
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Ben St. here.

2017
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Okay.

2018
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
You're gonna be sorry

2019
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
when I beat you up.

2020
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
In real life.

2021
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
That's right.

2022
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
In real life, I'm going to do it.

2023
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Damn it!

2024
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Not even fucking good.

2025
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Not even good.

2026
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I think you may not be

2027
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
as good

2028
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
as you once believed.

2029
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You don't know that shit.

2030
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
God, did we have anything else?

2031
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Was there any other talking points?

2032
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
You were really gung-ho

2033
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
about Sun and Moon.

2034
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
You were like...

2035
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I want to hear about General

2036
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Pokemon Info.

2037
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
You know what?

2038
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I'm not super hyped about the Pokemon

2039
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
designs that have been leaked.

2040
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Really?

2041
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
They're not terrible.

2042
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
But, wait, wait.

2043
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
There was one that I really liked.

2044
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
God,

2045
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
the bug that's called

2046
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Wimp-Out.

2047
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Yeah, Wimp-Out.

2048
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Yeah, that guy's really good.

2049
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Let's see.

2050
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I guess the Ghost Sandcastle

2051
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
is kind of okay?

2052
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
He's alright.

2053
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
There's already an Earth Ghost,

2054
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
so whatever.

2055
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Let's see.

2056
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
What else stood out to me?

2057
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Well,

2058
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Incineroar is the worst Pokemon ever.

2059
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
There's never been...

2060
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
and there never will be anything as terrible.

2061
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I don't think I...

2062
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Okay, yeah, that was fine.

2063
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I feel that way about Alolan Persian.

2064
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I hate...

2065
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Alolan Persian might be as bad

2066
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
as fucking the other thing.

2067
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
It's so terrible.

2068
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It's amazing how terrible it is.

2069
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I honestly can't believe...

2070
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
It was green lit.

2071
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
You know what?

2072
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I actually think...

2073
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I think if I hadn't seen original Persian,

2074
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I wouldn't mind it.

2075
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Fucking no.

2076
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
It looks goofy, but a lot of Pokemon look goofy.

2077
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It's just the fact that it looks so...

2078
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
It's...

2079
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
They just took regular Persian

2080
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
and made it look stupid.

2081
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And I don't get it.

2082
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I don't get what they were going for.

2083
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I feel like they were trying to make it cuter,

2084
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
but they just failed.

2085
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
There's an in-depth Pokedex

2086
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
on Pokemon.com

2087
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
that states that it is a beautiful Pokemon in Alola.

2088
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And that is

2089
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
worship towards beauty.

2090
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
There's no fucking way that's true.

2091
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
That's more true

2092
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
than anyone could ever even imagine.

2093
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Oh, you have Wonder Guard?

2094
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Is that why you didn't take damage from that burn?

2095
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
That's exactly why.

2096
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Wait...

2097
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I know it's not going to help me,

2098
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
but...

2099
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Oh my god, are you stupid?

2100
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Well, you know...

2101
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Come on.

2102
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
There we go.

2103
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I called because I figured you were going to switch.

2104
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
No.

2105
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I would never do something like that.

2106
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I would never switch.

2107
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
That's my policy, is never switch.

2108
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Yeah.

2109
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And it's got me this far.

2110
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And it's pretty cool.

2111
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
No.

2112
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Don't do that.

2113
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
No, there's nothing I can do.

2114
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Don't worry.

2115
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I know.

2116
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That's not pathetic.

2117
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
What were you thinking?

2118
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
What were you thinking?

2119
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
What do you mean I healed myself?

2120
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Oh god, oh god.

2121
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
What were you thinking?

2122
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
God, dude, oh shit, bro.

2123
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Wow, Vincent's not even good at this game.

2124
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Wow.

2125
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I might not be good at this game,

2126
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
but at least I'm the coolest guy in the world.

2127
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
You know what I'm saying, dude?

2128
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Yeah, woo!

2129
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Alright.

2130
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
How much fucking poison damage is Jellison going to take?

2131
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Holy shit.

2132
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Well, that's impressive.

2133
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Oh, I think I might lose this one, yeah.

2134
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Why'd you do that, dude?

2135
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Because that's the only thing I can do.

2136
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Nothing else could possibly have done anything.

2137
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Dude, you were faster than me.

2138
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
But I only have things that are weak against you.

2139
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
You don't have a fire move on Infernape?

2140
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
No.

2141
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Weird.

2142
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
That's wacky.

2143
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
That's unfortunate.

2144
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's unfortunate.

2145
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Truly unfortunate.

2146
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
She said it doesn't even matter.

2147
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
It's not even unfortunate.

2148
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I know. Nothing matters.

2149
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Nothing matters, dude.

2150
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Not even cool.

2151
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
There's nothing.

2152
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
There's nothing.

2153
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I know, dude.

2154
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
There's nothing.

2155
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
That one's a lost cause.

2156
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Oh, come on.

2157
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Let's see this shit.

2158
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
That one's done.

2159
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
That one's done.

2160
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
A million times Bensane.

2161
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
You're so gay.

2162
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It's over.

2163
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's over with how gay you are right now.

2164
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It's so over.

2165
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Oh, you think so, do you?

2166
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Is that a fact, bro?

2167
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Ah, fuck.

2168
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I don't care about him.

2169
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
It doesn't matter.

2170
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Dude, I've got this momentum.

2171
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Is that the momentum going?

2172
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I'm like using roll out.

2173
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
But in a meta sort of way.

2174
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Oh, wait, fuck.

2175
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I forgot I'm paralyzed.

2176
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It doesn't matter though.

2177
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I know you've got...

2178
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Oh, come on.

2179
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Oh, I'm so gay.

2180
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
That actually doesn't matter.

2181
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Yeah, actually, it's not enough.

2182
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Uh, hmm.

2183
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Shit.

2184
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Um...

2185
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yeah, a little Impersion is the worst.

2186
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah.

2187
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
What do you think about Incineroar?

2188
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I'm not too upset these days.

2189
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I didn't want to pick Liden anyway.

2190
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
What I'm...

2191
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I mean, aside from whether you're going to use it,

2192
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
do you think it's good because I think it's horrible.

2193
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I think it's the worst Pokemon ever designed.

2194
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
No, no.

2195
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I think it's fine.

2196
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
It's not fine, dude.

2197
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
It's not right.

2198
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
It's not natural.

2199
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It goes against the ways of real life.

2200
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
It does.

2201
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
It goes against everything we were taught in school.

2202
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Boys kiss girls and girls kiss boys.

2203
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Not any of this.

2204
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Not whatever the other...

2205
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Not whatever the reverse of that is.

2206
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Yeah, exactly.

2207
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Why did I do that?

2208
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
That was stupid.

2209
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Oh, fuck.

2210
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Oh, come on.

2211
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It doesn't matter. You're a special attacker, but it's still that damage.

2212
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Yeah, that damage...

2213
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
That damage is going to get me. I really fucked up.

2214
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I really fucked up.

2215
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Oh, no, it's okay.

2216
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Yeah.

2217
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I think you could have got me if you'd scalded.

2218
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yeah, but I thought you were going to switch.

2219
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Yeah.

2220
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Everything's fucking paralyzed.

2221
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Why are you constantly going in and out of...

2222
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
like your CWC impression?

2223
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
That wasn't a CWC.

2224
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
It sounds like it.

2225
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Munchie, are you familiar with baby cakes?

2226
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Yes, of course.

2227
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Okay.

2228
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I think I've sent you a video of theirs before.

2229
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I forget what it was.

2230
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Wait a minute.

2231
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Who do you mean there? Are we thinking of the same baby cakes?

2232
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Are we thinking of...

2233
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I'm baby cakes.

2234
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You are baby cakes.

2235
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Yes, yes, yes.

2236
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I'm aware, but I say they as in...

2237
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I don't know. I'm gender neutral.

2238
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Yeah, you're the gender neutral pronoun.

2239
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Good. That's what I like to hear.

2240
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Fuck.

2241
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
So...

2242
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I can't remember what the specific video was about.

2243
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Fuck me, dude.

2244
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
But I remember that I quite enjoyed it

2245
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
and I sent you and you were like,

2246
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
oh, LOL, you like them too?

2247
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And I was like, okay.

2248
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Me and Digi have been...

2249
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
We watched all of it recently

2250
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
and we've just been quoting it all the time.

2251
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And...

2252
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I mean,

2253
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
DeVoo has started to say that

2254
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
all my voices

2255
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
sound like the baby cakes.

2256
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
All my fake voices sound like...

2257
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
There's a meme or something where

2258
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
all Jesse's voices sound the same.

2259
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
A meme as in not just fact.

2260
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Right.

2261
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Right. But with my case

2262
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
it actually is a meme because it's not true

2263
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
that all my fake voices sound like baby cakes.

2264
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
They don't. They're all unique and special.

2265
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Unique and special.

2266
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Yes.

2267
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
God fucking Christ.

2268
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Christ.

2269
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Ah, God.

2270
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
So bad.

2271
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
So bad.

2272
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Doesn't matter.

2273
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Nothing matters.

2274
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
This is...

2275
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I don't know what to do about this slow, bro.

2276
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I really don't.

2277
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
You're just bad, dude. That's all there is to it.

2278
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I think I might just be bad.

2279
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
You're so bad!

2280
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
You need to do that.

2281
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Why don't you just fucking...

2282
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Oh no. Yes!

2283
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Yeah!

2284
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Just crit and then...

2285
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Oh, weak.

2286
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Kiram, just fucking get a crit, dude.

2287
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Just fucking get a crit right now

2288
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
where I'll kill you.

2289
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Come on, dude. You've got one in 16 chance

2290
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
and you can't do it.

2291
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Oh, no.

2292
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I'm out of PP.

2293
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Yeah, I'm bad.

2294
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
It's an 8-PP move!

2295
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
That's what I was waiting for. This is my opportunity.

2296
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
That sucks so much.

2297
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
What do I even do now?

2298
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Um...

2299
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Oh, now you've got a fucking crit!

2300
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
You bastard!

2301
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Oh, shit.

2302
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Ah, you fucked up, dude.

2303
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
You fucked up, man.

2304
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I fucked up by not factoring in the

2305
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
random number generation.

2306
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
You did.

2307
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Ah!

2308
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
No!

2309
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So bad.

2310
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Damn it.

2311
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Yes! Oh, no! Oh, well, okay.

2312
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
All right, all right.

2313
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Um...

2314
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Yeah.

2315
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Yeah, I got it.

2316
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I got it.

2317
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Damn it.

2318
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
He does have this.

2319
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Yes.

2320
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Damn it, it's over!

2321
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Yeah, that's it.

2322
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I can't believe this.

2323
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I can't believe this.

2324
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Okay, this is good.

2325
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
This is going good so far.

2326
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I hate you.

2327
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I've really managed to turn it all around

2328
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
on myself.

2329
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And prove that I am the greatest

2330
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
all the time.

2331
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
It's not even fucking...

2332
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
It's not even real.

2333
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Okay, okay.

2334
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
God, I don't know.

2335
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
You want to do one more?

2336
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Yeah, yeah, we'll do one more.

2337
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Okay.

2338
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
God, that news post

2339
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
that says, oh, Election Days,

2340
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
you're like so aggravating.

2341
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
It's a Pokemon battling simulator.

2342
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
We don't care.

2343
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Or whether you think Trump will make America great again.

2344
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Come and have a fucking chat

2345
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
in our stupid chat room.

2346
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Fuck.

2347
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I don't, if that's the attitude

2348
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
you're going to bring to it, sir.

2349
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Sir, good sir.

2350
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I'm sorry, but you're done this time.

2351
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
No.

2352
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I can see.

2353
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I can see my future and it looks bright.

2354
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
It's bright.

2355
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I can see your future.

2356
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
It's reflected in your eyes' mind.

2357
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Who's faster?

2358
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Probably...

2359
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Oh, dear.

2360
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Okay.

2361
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Oh, dear.

2362
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

2363
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Oh, no. Oh, boy.

2364
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Fuck.

2365
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Uh...

2366
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Um...

2367
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Um...

2368
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Um...

2369
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Um...

2370
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Um...

2371
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Um...

2372
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
You know...

2373
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
What? Yeah, what do I mean?

2374
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
You know what I mean, dude?

2375
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I can't...

2376
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Yeah, you know what I'm fucking talking about.

2377
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I can't penetrate that thick skull of yours

2378
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
and get the juicy information

2379
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
on what you were putting down.

2380
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Uh...

2381
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Um...

2382
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I can't even imagine

2383
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
what disgusting, filthy place

2384
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
is you are operating in.

2385
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Munchie, can you see what item

2386
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
my Nitto Queen has?

2387
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Uh, no.

2388
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Not yet.

2389
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Huh. Okay.

2390
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Weird.

2391
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Uh...

2392
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I don't know.

2393
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I don't know.

2394
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

2395
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Oh, boo.

2396
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Boo!

2397
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Cheating.

2398
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Collusion.

2399
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I don't... I don't care if it goes...

2400
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Oh, boo!

2401
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Oh, you idiot.

2402
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Oh, you fucked it up, bro.

2403
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Oh, you fucked it up, bro.

2404
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Oh, you fucked it up, bro.

2405
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
That...

2406
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
That feel when toxic misses.

2407
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
That feel when toxic misses.

2408
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
That feel when toxic misses.

2409
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Oh, there's nothing.

2410
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
There's nothing that could have

2411
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
feel me with more and more

2412
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
fucking rage than what just

2413
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
right now.

2414
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Agreed. Agreed.

2415
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Hmm...

2416
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Well, this guy's...

2417
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I'm not gonna knock off on this guy

2418
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
because he's definitely got

2419
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
what you call it...

2420
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
He's definitely a mega, mega

2421
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Evolver.

2422
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
No, you don't know that.

2423
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I'm sure about it, dude. No.

2424
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I'm so sure.

2425
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Uh...

2426
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Oh, man. This guy doesn't have...

2427
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
This guy's weak to flying ghost

2428
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
and fairy.

2429
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
That's not very much.

2430
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Yeah. You know why it's not very much?

2431
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Because he's trained in the Tiberian

2432
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
mountains, and he's made sure

2433
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
that everyone is lower than him.

2434
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Wow.

2435
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Because he's researched various virtues

2436
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
that allows him to evolve past.

2437
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Which virtues is it that lets

2438
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
a Gallade mega-evolve?

2439
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Uh, probably

2440
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Justice and Chastity.

2441
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Justice and Chastity?

2442
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Yeah, he looks pretty chased over there.

2443
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
He looks like an anime protagonist.

2444
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
He does.

2445
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Uh...

2446
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I should let me check with my list of virtues

2447
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
that I have.

2448
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Can you read some of them off for us?

2449
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Yes, yes. Of course, of course.

2450
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Thank God. Okay.

2451
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Ah, man.

2452
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I don't know, man.

2453
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I don't know.

2454
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Alright.

2455
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
That's probably a terrible idea.

2456
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
These are the virtues.

2457
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Chastity, temperance,

2458
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
charity, diligence, patience,

2459
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
kindness, and humility.

2460
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
So, I forgot.

2461
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I merged Courage and Justice

2462
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
into one.

2463
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Hmm.

2464
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
So...

2465
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Okay. Say you had two Alligators.

2466
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Fuck, man!

2467
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Did you see that shit? Yeah, I saw it.

2468
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Sleep powder fails yet again?

2469
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I saw it.

2470
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Don't worry.

2471
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
There's nothing I don't see.

2472
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

2473
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
You're so bad.

2474
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I honestly can't believe

2475
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
how bad you are.

2476
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
That's wrong.

2477
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
And it's a sin, frankly.

2478
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Honestly, it's disgusting.

2479
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I think it's the devil's work.

2480
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Here's what I want to know.

2481
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Say you have two...

2482
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Oh, God.

2483
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
What's a good... What was the word you used

2484
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
for reptiles and...

2485
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Herptophonus.

2486
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Okay, say you've got two Herptophonus.

2487
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Say you've got a...

2488
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Oh, God.

2489
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Two annals, right?

2490
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
You've got two beautiful annals.

2491
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
And they're just like...

2492
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And one of them learns

2493
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
temperance.

2494
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
And the other learns...

2495
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Wait. Patience.

2496
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Yeah, patience, sure.

2497
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
One of them learns temperance.

2498
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I mean, those are very similar virtues, but whatever.

2499
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
One of them learns temperance and one of them learns patience.

2500
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Like, do they become

2501
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
different things? Yes.

2502
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Okay, okay.

2503
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
But if two different annals each learned,

2504
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
what kind of courage would they become

2505
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
the same thing, basically? No, no, no.

2506
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
It depends on both your virtue

2507
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
and your species.

2508
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I know, but I'm saying, like, if two things

2509
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
of the same species learned the same virtue,

2510
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
would they become a similar thing?

2511
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Well, it's also...

2512
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
It's like your God tier, so they can't be

2513
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
two of the same.

2514
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
They'll be similar, but not completely

2515
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
different things. Okay, yes.

2516
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
So there's individual variation there, okay.

2517
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Yes.

2518
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Yeah, gotcha.

2519
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
What, is Technoblast

2520
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
normal type?

2521
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Yeah.

2522
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
No, no, no, it's bug, it's bug.

2523
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Wait, really? Are you

2524
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
futzing with me? I'm not futzing with you.

2525
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Are you trickering me?

2526
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Are you trying

2527
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
to trick me yet again, Goofy?

2528
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Or Donald?

2529
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Is that

2530
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
a line? Yes.

2531
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
That is, in fact, a line. Shit.

2532
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

2533
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
See, now I've got you on the ropes, I think.

2534
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Oh, come on! Oh, yeah!

2535
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Yeah! I didn't even realize

2536
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I had that! How the fuck

2537
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
is that a thing you can learn? I don't know.

2538
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
It must be a hidden ability or something.

2539
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
That's so fucked up, how? It's a fish.

2540
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Wait, but he's got a horn, he's got a

2541
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
lightning rod. That means nothing.

2542
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And you know when you attract lightning,

2543
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
then it's good for you.

2544
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I can't

2545
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
fucking believe that just happened.

2546
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
That's the worst thing that any...

2547
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
That's the

2548
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
real tragedy that happened today.

2549
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Well, there's definitely been

2550
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
some tragedy, I don't know what.

2551
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Something

2552
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
we won't speak of.

2553
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Yeah.

2554
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
You're talking about

2555
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
how Bernie Sanders assassinated

2556
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
President Obama. For reasons

2557
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
that he refuses to

2558
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
divulge.

2559
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
To acknowledge and or

2560
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
even slightly

2561
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
collaborate upon.

2562
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
You know what, dude?

2563
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
You're so stupid. No, you're so...

2564
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Oh, what the f...

2565
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
God!

2566
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
God fuck!

2567
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
No!

2568
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Let me explain everything that I fucked up.

2569
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

2570
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
BeenSaintOfFiction.com has died today.

2571
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I fucked up so deeply

2572
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
this battle.

2573
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Like, I was so sure

2574
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
that Gallade was the mega-evolver, right?

2575
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And I...

2576
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I looked at... Yeah, I looked...

2577
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Cause I was like, oh...

2578
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Oh man, I thought because

2579
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Absol had been out before and didn't mega-evolve,

2580
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
then it must not be it.

2581
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
And then I compared speeds

2582
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
and I'm like, oh,

2583
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Seeking's one speed faster than Absol.

2584
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
That means I can mega-horn it before

2585
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
it's 1.5 times attack

2586
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
from justified has a chance to fuck me up.

2587
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Yeah, okay.

2588
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Absolutely wrong.

2589
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Doesn't matter.

2590
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Doesn't matter.

2591
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
We're just gonna

2592
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
carry on.

2593
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
We're gonna continue.

2594
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
We're gonna push...

2595
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
We're gonna push for

2596
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
broad social change.

2597
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Yeah!

2598
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Come on, man.

2599
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
He's so bad, ladies and gentlemen.

2600
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
He can't do anything right.

2601
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I was...

2602
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
There's just nothing he can do that will

2603
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
make anyone like him. There's just nothing.

2604
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I mean...

2605
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I thought you were gonna sucker punch

2606
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
so I bulked up.

2607
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
It didn't work.

2608
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
You know what?

2609
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I'm not that far behind.

2610
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Oh, yeah, sure.

2611
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Oh, how foolish.

2612
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I'm gonna do this.

2613
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Oh, how foolish.

2614
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
It's so aesthetic.

2615
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Okay.

2616
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Oh, how foolish.

2617
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Okay, that wasn't great.

2618
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Oh, how terrible.

2619
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
What?

2620
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Oh, come on!

2621
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Oh, no!

2622
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
No!

2623
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
God, if I...

2624
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I didn't...

2625
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I would've killed you with a body slam

2626
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
but I thought you were gonna...

2627
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I thought you were gonna sucker punch

2628
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I can't...

2629
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I can't overstate

2630
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
how filthy

2631
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
he is in every way.

2632
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
That was the worst thing I've ever done.

2633
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Okay, no, whatever, though.

2634
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I'm hard depressed to think of a time

2635
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
that Ben has ever showered before in his life.

2636
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Has ever what?

2637
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Showered before.

2638
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
That's true. That's true.

2639
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
No, man.

2640
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Let me tell you about hygiene.

2641
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I engage in it.

2642
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
More than you could ever know.

2643
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
More than you could...

2644
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
more than you could imagine.

2645
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Carnivine's going...

2646
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Okay, honestly, I don't think I've ever had

2647
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
a carnivine on my team and not been disappointed

2648
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
in its performance.

2649
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Yeah, carnivine sucks.

2650
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Carnivine, in my experience, carnivine has sucked

2651
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
really hard.

2652
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
But not this time.

2653
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Oh, shit.

2654
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
This time, things are gonna be different.

2655
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Uh, yes.

2656
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Good.

2657
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Good.

2658
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Yeah.

2659
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Yeah, bro.

2660
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
What the fuck?

2661
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
You're so bad.

2662
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Wait.

2663
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Oh, no.

2664
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Oh, no.

2665
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Was that quadruped?

2666
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Was that doubly ineffective?

2667
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
No, it was just singly ineffective.

2668
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Mm-hmm.

2669
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Okay, well, that's terrible.

2670
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Terrible.

2671
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
That's just awful.

2672
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
If I don't wake up, you might have a chance.

2673
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
No, okay.

2674
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Yeah.

2675
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Yeah.

2676
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I have made

2677
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
every possible mistake.

2678
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Oh, my God.

2679
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
It's a good guy.

2680
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

2681
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
It's over now, stupid.

2682
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
It's over now, stupid.

2683
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
That's over now.

2684
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Oh, no.

2685
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Oh, let's see.

2686
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I got it now.

2687
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
You aren't really demonstrating

2688
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
the virtue of kindness there, Ben.

2689
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
You might...

2690
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I'll make a specific exception for stupid people

2691
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
to de-grass on the evolutionary chart.

2692
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Just for you.

2693
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Thank you.

2694
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Thanks, sir.

2695
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Oh, good.

2696
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Oh, good, I did it.

2697
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
What am I going to de-grass into?

2698
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
A zekrom?

2699
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
A tadpole.

2700
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
A tadpole.

2701
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Uh, well, you know...

2702
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I don't think you've...

2703
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I don't think you even...

2704
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I don't think you've got anything.

2705
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Oh, wait, you got Shadow Sneak.

2706
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Oh, shit.

2707
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
I have more options

2708
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
that you could ever even imagine.

2709
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Oh, this is...

2710
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Yeah, okay.

2711
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Oh, dear.

2712
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Okay.

2713
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
That's fine.

2714
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
That's good, in fact.

2715
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Boo!

2716
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Boo!

2717
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
That's good, in fact, is it?

2718
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
And that's good, in fact.

2719
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
That's actually good.

2720
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
That's actually what I wanted.

2721
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I wanted you to win.

2722
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
This has all been a trap.

2723
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
It's all been one trap.

2724
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
You've taken me home.

2725
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
You've...

2726
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
You've wooed me at the bar.

2727
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
You've successfully seduced me.

2728
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
You've taken me back to...

2729
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Now, sex home.

2730
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
And now you've realized

2731
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
the unfortunate truth.

2732
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
The truly, the truly

2733
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
savage truth.

2734
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
That you are, in fact, stupid and terrible.

2735
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Munchy?

2736
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Munchy, I invited you here to play Pokemon Stay

2737
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
for a very specific reason.

2738
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
I want you to look around and realize

2739
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
that your house is now on fire.

2740
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Oh, no!

2741
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I knew it.

2742
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Okay, I didn't get so blind.

2743
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I knew it would work.

2744
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I knew there was no way to stop.

2745
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I can't believe this!

2746
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
You want to do one more?

2747
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Yeah, well, yeah, sure, sure.

2748
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
If you want to be completely humiliated again, sure.

2749
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I feel like I didn't put my best foot forward that time.

2750
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I feel like you have no feet.

2751
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And you were a wheelchair-bound,

2752
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
disgusting Chinese man.

2753
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Sure, sure.

2754
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
But, um...

2755
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I mean, what of it?

2756
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Oh, you're foolish.

2757
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Oh, but actually not that foolish.

2758
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Aw, damn.

2759
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Okay.

2760
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Uh, hmm.

2761
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Options.

2762
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Options, options, options.

2763
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Uh, no.

2764
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Oh, he's going to call in his

2765
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
dirty corporate friends

2766
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
to collude and destroy

2767
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
the server so I can't

2768
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
participate in a fair state.

2769
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Yeah, dude, we're going to collude, man.

2770
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
We're really going to collude really hard.

2771
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
He's going to call up his

2772
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
gang, affectionately called the Max Survives.

2773
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
And, uh...

2774
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Yeah, that's right.

2775
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Yeah, that's about it.

2776
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
That's about the size of it, I think.

2777
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
I'm waiting for

2778
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Vincent.

2779
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Vincent.

2780
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Vincent. Hey!

2781
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Hey!

2782
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Did you ever see

2783
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
that one drawing I made on stream

2784
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
of you where you were beating a woman

2785
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
and you had an MRA card and Vincent was

2786
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
puppeteering you?

2787
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
I had what?

2788
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
An MRA card? Yeah.

2789
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
No, I don't think...

2790
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Yeah! Aw, critical hit!

2791
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Just when I needed it.

2792
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
What the hell are you talking about?

2793
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
No, I did not see that

2794
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
drawing. Are you in a game right now?

2795
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
No.

2796
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
What? Am I not fighting you?

2797
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I'm fighting some Brando.

2798
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Yes, you are!

2799
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Oh, God.

2800
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
What a buffoon.

2801
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
What an absolute buffoon.

2802
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I can't believe it.

2803
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I just had the most incredible critical hit.

2804
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
My

2805
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
whiskash.

2806
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
My whiskash just pulled off an incredible underdog

2807
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
victory against a Rotom F

2808
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
or the wind one.

2809
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Oh, the wind one sucks.

2810
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Yeah, well...

2811
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
So what?

2812
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
So what? What does that mean

2813
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
in the grand scheme of things?

2814
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
But I was very proud of that image

2815
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
for the fact that there was political commentary

2816
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
on sometimes the

2817
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
lie between Ben and Vincent is so blared

2818
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
that it's not even...

2819
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
you can't even feasibly

2820
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
recognize who's who.

2821
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
That's true, man.

2822
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
That's true.

2823
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
That's truer than you even know.

2824
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Do I know

2825
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
if I send you another invite

2826
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
or no? Hang on.

2827
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I want to beat Internet

2828
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
9.9.

2829
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I think I can do it.

2830
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Fucking Internet

2831
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
9.99. We're ruining the

2832
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
ratty fucking stuff.

2833
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Say

2834
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
you're on YouTube. Say hello

2835
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
in chat.

2836
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Oh, God. Okay, I will.

2837
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
You're on YouTube.

2838
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Say hello.

2839
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Oh, God.

2840
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I feel dirty. I feel dirty

2841
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
for what I've just done here today.

2842
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Well, we'll do as you know that.

2843
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
He's gonna be Internet famous.

2844
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
I want fan art of Internet of whatever his name is.

2845
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Oh, but I just fucking wrecked

2846
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
his vanillax because he's a little bitch.

2847
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Oh, shit.

2848
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Oh, I feel so awful

2849
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
for what I've said to him.

2850
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
That seems...

2851
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
That just seems like a bad wrong thing

2852
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
to do. That doesn't seem like

2853
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
the right way to behave in modern society.

2854
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
It seems

2855
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
so cruel.

2856
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
It's so gauche.

2857
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
How can you be so

2858
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
without fucking compassion

2859
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
for your fellow human beings

2860
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
as to say that someone is on YouTube

2861
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
and also to prompt them to say hello?

2862
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
It's difficult. It's difficult to be as bad

2863
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
as I am. It requires

2864
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
an active...

2865
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
It requires actively pushing down

2866
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
my instincts towards

2867
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
human decency and all the virtues

2868
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
that I hold so dear.

2869
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Yes.

2870
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Kindness, generosity,

2871
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
laughter, honesty.

2872
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
What are some other ones maybe?

2873
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Generosity, loyalty.

2874
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Loyalty. That's the one.

2875
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
And magic.

2876
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And magic, of course.

2877
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
And magic, of course.

2878
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Like, naturally.

2879
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Show us how to see when AST is in

2880
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
8 right now, right?

2881
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
7? I want to say 7.

2882
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Whatever. Did you watch the last season?

2883
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Oh, god! He just...

2884
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Internet999 just responded in fucking Russian.

2885
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
No!

2886
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
What a hero!

2887
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
He says...

2888
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
He says...

2889
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Backwards are...

2890
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
...

2891
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
...

2892
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
...

2893
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
You gotta Google translate right fucking now

2894
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
and find out what he said.

2895
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
You know what? That's the best idea I've ever heard.

2896
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
laughter

2897
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Oh, he killed my jinx with his patcherisu.

2898
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Ben Strate has traveled across the world

2899
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
through many, many, many

2900
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
flights and travels and he has

2901
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
mastered all of the

2902
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
the virtues.

2903
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
The languages? Oh, yeah.

2904
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
That as well. But he has mastered all the virtues

2905
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
and it's worth listening to it to a higher plane.

2906
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
It's worth listening to it to a higher plane.

2907
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
We un-evolved

2908
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
cannot even comprehend.

2909
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
No. And I mean, why would you even want to?

2910
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Even if you could comprehend it,

2911
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
it's not like you could do anything with it, you fucking asshole.

2912
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
laughter

2913
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Hey, guess what he said?

2914
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
What?

2915
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I am Russian. Hi.

2916
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
laughter

2917
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
laughter

2918
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
laughter

2919
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Oh.

2920
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Oh, he said something else, but I gotta

2921
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
fucking...

2922
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I gotta do something about this.

2923
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
I've got to do something about this.

2924
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I have to do something.

2925
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I'm gonna kill his cell with my bannet.

2926
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Better.

2927
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Easiest win.

2928
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Actually, I'm gonna taunt because that seems like the right thing to do.

2929
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Okay. I am Russian.

2930
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Okay. And then he follows up with...

2931
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Send a link.

2932
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
laughter

2933
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
As in a...

2934
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
As in a link to the YouTube.

2935
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Yeah.

2936
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Do it.

2937
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
But it doesn't exist yet.

2938
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
No, you have to.

2939
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I'll just, I'll just, I'll link him to the procrastinators.

2940
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2941
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2942
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
That's gonna be so fucking weird.

2943
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Dude, that's gonna be so fucking weird.

2944
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Dude, if you're, if you're, what's his name?

2945
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Internetfan?

2946
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
His name is...

2947
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Internet99.1.

2948
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Internet99.1.

2949
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
If you are watching this right now,

01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I want you to comment, press...

2951
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
No, no, I want you to comment.

2952
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Just press one in your keyboard a lot of times.

2953
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2954
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Internet99.1.

2955
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
If you're watching this, please, please let us know.

2956
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Yeah.

2957
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I need to feel, I need to feel that I'm, that I matter.

2958
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
This is the only way to do that.

2959
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
This is it. This is it.

2960
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
It's the, it's the only possible way.

2961
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I'm, I'm just gonna link him to the fucking

2962
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
channel and, uh,

2963
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
you know,

2964
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
whatever.

2965
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I wonder if he even, like, speaks English,

2966
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
because, because he just, I mean...

2967
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Well, he probably, I think he Google trans,

2968
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I think he probably Google translated my message

2969
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
because it took him a while to respond.

2970
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Yeah.

2971
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
He's gonna learn English.

2972
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Just to watch the podcast.

2973
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Oh, jeez Louise.

2974
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
He watch, he watches the podcast and it changes

2975
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
his fucking life.

2976
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Ah, shit.

2977
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I let him kill my bannet because I'm stupid.

2978
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Just by happenstance,

2979
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
what do you think would be the worst podcast

2980
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
to, to enter on?

2981
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
He, he, he opens up the memes

2982
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
that needs to die podcast

2983
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
and his life is forever changed.

2984
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I don't, I don't know.

2985
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I mean, my least favorite one

2986
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
is everyone else's favorite one,

2987
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
which is, um, uh, things we can't get into.

2988
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
That's the yellow one, right?

2989
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I think so.

2990
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Yeah, I hate that one.

2991
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Yeah, that one sucks.

2992
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
It's the, it's so bad.

2993
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
It makes me so angry just thinking about it.

2994
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
This guy is so fucked.

2995
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I've got,

2996
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I've got a goddamn

2997
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
mega Kangaskhan.

2998
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
It's all over the world.

2999
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
That, that, that shit's broken.

3000
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Oh shit, but I used sucker punch.

3001
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
And then he used toxic.

3002
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Ben, Ben, even when he has

3003
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
an unbelievable advantage,

3004
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
he just can't seem to close out.

3005
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I fucked it up.

3006
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And I, uh,

3007
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
God, I'm so bad.

3008
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I've really screwed the pooch.

3009
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
I couldn't beat his patcherisi with my mega Kangaskhan.

3010
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Oh my fucking god.

3011
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

3012
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
My second sucker punch worked.

3013
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Um, yes.

3014
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
All right, let's see. He's on his last,

3015
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
he's on his last poke and I've got three.

3016
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
He's a druddigon. Uh, yeah, whatever.

3017
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Stupid.

3018
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Stupid.

3019
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
What do I want to do? What do I want to do?

3020
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Uh, probably return, double return.

3021
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Oh, but he's sucker punched me.

3022
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Oh, you suck that.

3023
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
How ironic.

3024
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
So ironic.

3025
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
It's, it's, it's more ironic

3026
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
than I could ever even imagine.

3027
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
True. True.

3028
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Uh...

3029
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Oh God.

3030
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I, I, I, I, I, I, all I've been doing

3031
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
has, I've just been in the,

3032
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
in these late hours of the night,

3033
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
uh, I've, I've been checking

3034
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
the, the MSP and Ventures

3035
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Snapchat to see

3036
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
what, what beautiful post,

3037
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
post-canon content Andrew Hussie

3038
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
has sprinkled out for us.

3039
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Uh, that hasn't been any today, but I, but I check

3040
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
back every night because there's been one for Halloween.

3041
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
So there's, it's not just for important dates now.

3042
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
It's just, it's just going to be

3043
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
a slice of life

3044
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
comic, Homestuck version 2.0

3045
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
based entirely in Snapchat

3046
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
and I'm ready for it.

3047
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Um, wait, has he actually been

3048
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
posting anything? Yes.

3049
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
There? Yes. Oh, shit. I mean, I don't use

3050
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Snapchat, so I wouldn't know. Well, neither do I

3051
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
other than for this. Yeah, yeah.

3052
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
But the, um, I mean, I have

3053
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Snapchat, so maybe I should fucking look.

3054
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Uh, okay, dude.

3055
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I'm in a fucking pickle right now.

3056
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
He's on his last Pokémon,

3057
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
but he just killed my second lesson.

3058
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Now it's his druddigon, who's in the middle.

3059
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
He just used an outrage. He used an outrage

3060
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
to kill my Latios.

3061
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
So now he's got his outrage and druddigon, but all

3062
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I've got is my fucking credilly.

3063
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
What the fuck is it?

3064
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Oh, oh, that's an amazing installer.

3065
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
He's, he's not,

3066
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
he's not.

3067
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
I mean, I've got Gigadrain.

3068
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Alright, I guess I'm just going to recover

3069
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
and hope that I don't die this turn.

3070
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
And then once he's... What are your moves?

3071
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Rockslide, Stealth Rock, Gigadrain,

3072
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Recover. Oh, that shit.

3073
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Yeah, it's not good.

3074
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I mean, I could try to Rockslide him.

3075
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Um...

3076
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Eh.

3077
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I'm, I'm going to recover.

3078
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
No, I'm going to, I'm going to Rockslide.

3079
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Oh fuck, oh god.

3080
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Oh, yeah, it does 51.

3081
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Oh, but he's confused.

3082
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Okay, he lost 30.

3083
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Okay, if he, if he hurts himself and

3084
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
if he hurts himself and confusion this turn,

3085
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I win. If he doesn't, I lose. It's simple as that.

3086
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Let's see, place your bets, folks.

3087
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Press one for Munchie, 1-1-1-1-1.

3088
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Come on, Dreadigon, you piece of shit.

3089
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
You're the worst Pokemon, you look like a Digimon

3090
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
and nobody likes you.

3091
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
I like him, he's just...

3092
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I don't mind him too, but everyone, like everyone

3093
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
that I've, I don't know, like,

3094
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Digi and one other person have lately

3095
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
have told me that they hate Dreadigon and I'm like,

3096
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
he's not that bad.

3097
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
The fact that you take Digi's opinion

3098
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
seriously on any matter

3099
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
just proves your...

3100
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I know, but like, I've been surprised.

3101
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
I've just been hearing a lot of... Oh, he's...

3102
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
What the fuck, he sucker punched me. What a fucking idiot.

3103
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
He, he sucker punched me.

3104
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I thought he was gonna outrage again.

3105
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I don't know why he didn't. It was his only hope.

3106
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Okay, well, now I think I win.

3107
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Oh no, he did, no, he outraged again

3108
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
and it killed me.

3109
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
So bad.

3110
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
So bad.

3111
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I'm gonna say to him, well,

3112
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
well played.

3113
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
He said Gigi, I say Gigi.

3114
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Everyone's, everyone's good.

3115
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
All right, fuck you internet, 999.

3116
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I gotta get back to my real, my real best friend, Munchy.

3117
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
You were in fact a fake best friend.

3118
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Yeah, you're just a fucking B-barrel.

3119
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Good job, idiot.

3120
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I'm really sorry.

3121
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I'm really, I'm really sorry to disrespect you like this.

3122
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
By bringing a, you never,

3123
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
never bring a B-barrel to a Yan mega fight,

3124
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
know what I'm saying?

3125
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Whatever I hear the words been saying,

3126
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I automatically think of a B-barrel in my head, so.

3127
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Yeah, it's, it's disgusting.

3128
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
It's, it's pathetic.

3129
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I don't know what to do here.

3130
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
All right, let's have, no,

3131
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
that was wrong.

3132
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I did the wrong thing.

3133
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Okay.

3134
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Wait, what the fuck?

3135
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
What, I cursed.

3136
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
But times two, does it always do that?

3137
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
I don't think it's, it's cause I'm simple.

3138
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I have, I have simple, that's why.

3139
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Right, that's what, that's what simple does.

3140
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
It doubles the status.

3141
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Yeah, okay.

3142
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
But it doesn't matter.

3143
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Literally doesn't matter.

3144
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Or doesn't it?

3145
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
No, it doesn't, okay.

3146
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Well, good.

3147
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
That was great.

3148
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
You went on a blaze of glory.

3149
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Just like a certain, just like a certain other normal type.

3150
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
A certain other, yeah,

3151
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
certain other, just pitiful,

3152
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
disgusting, worthless, normal type.

3153
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I could mention, but I won't.

3154
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Because he's not worth the price.

3155
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
He's not worth it.

3156
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Oh god.

3157
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
What, what a fucking,

3158
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
what a joke.

3159
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
What a fucking, yeah.

3160
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
What a fucking gem of a joke, you know.

3161
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Unlike the MPV of the series,

3162
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Munchy the Volpix.

3163
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Munchy the Volpix is a true hero

3164
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
to all of us.

3165
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Nobody will, nobody can deny that.

3166
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Yeah, no one.

3167
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Not one of us.

3168
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Okay, okay.

3169
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Why the fuck?

3170
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Nice Uber.

3171
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Yeah, you're welcome.

3172
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Why the fuck does, um,

3173
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
uh, you know, the red one

3174
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
get a new type when it goes Uber

3175
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
and Kyo-Gre doesn't?

3176
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Um, cause people like Red on Barry

3177
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
cause he's better.

3178
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Um,

3179
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
so,

3180
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
it's just weird. Why doesn't he become

3181
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
water-flying, or

3182
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
something?

3183
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Uh, I think you'll have to

3184
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
ask God for that.

3185
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I don't want to talk to him.

3186
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
We're not cool right now.

3187
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
We're not cool right now.

3188
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
We got into a fight.

3189
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Oh shit.

3190
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Not a nice crit, dude.

3191
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Thanks. It was great.

3192
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Actually, I really enjoyed it.

3193
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Looking forward to the next one.

3194
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Yo, check this out. You're fucked.

3195
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Oh, what the fuck are you thinking?

3196
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Yeah, not even cool.

3197
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool though.

3198
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Frankly.

3199
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
What are you gonna do?

3200
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
You're probably gonna do stone.

3201
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
No, I would never do such a thing.

3202
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
You're probably gonna do stone.

3203
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I would never do such a thing.

3204
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I would never soup to your level, Ben.

3205
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
My-

3206
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
My gut tells me

3207
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
that a stone edge

3208
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
or a rock slide is coming.

3209
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
This is imminent.

3210
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Well, if there's

3211
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
one thing I have to say to you,

3212
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
it's get fucked.

3213
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Wait, no, I'm not even weak to rock.

3214
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
What the fuck are you gonna do then?

3215
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Uh...

3216
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I'm gonna do something,

3217
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
and then I'm gonna switch out to something else.

3218
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
God damn it.

3219
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Yeah, bro.

3220
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
No.

3221
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Yes.

3222
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Yes.

3223
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Um...

3224
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
His horsey mouth

3225
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
is too much.

3226
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
You know what? I'll just let you do it.

3227
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I don't fucking care.

3228
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
What a crazy man to do such a thing.

3229
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Yeah.

3230
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I don't know what he's in for at this point in his life.

3231
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I don't think he knows.

3232
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
I don't think he realizes the magnitude.

3233
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Oh,

3234
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
stupid.

3235
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Fucking worthless.

3236
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Fucking worthless.

3237
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
I don't think he understands

3238
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
what a pickle, Ben, say, truly is in.

3239
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
I don't yet.

3240
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I don't yet understand the magnitude.

3241
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Oh, no.

3242
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Yes. Oh, dear.

3243
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Oh, no, it's okay. It's okay. It's good.

3244
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
In fact, it's good. In fact, I'm glad.

3245
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
In fact,

3246
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
it is truly great.

3247
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Oh,

3248
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
interesting choice, faggot.

3249
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Oh, no!

3250
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
What the fuck? Oh, cool. I didn't think it

3251
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
would be that good.

3252
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
What the fuck are you thinking?

3253
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I know what you're thinking.

3254
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
You're thinking

3255
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Ben St.

3256
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Maybe he's a cool guy who doesn't

3257
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
cheat after all.

3258
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Well, I would be so wrong.

3259
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3260
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
I'm about to

3261
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
witness

3262
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
the most cheating of it all.

3263
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Yeah, I think you're about

3264
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I think you're about to.

3265
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Oh, I was playing it street because I thought

3266
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
you, god damn it.

3267
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
What did you think I was going to do?

3268
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
I thought you were going to try and be

3269
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
sneaky and

3270
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
switch out. I was.

3271
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I did have a sneaky plan, but I was like

3272
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
that's stupid. God damn it.

3273
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Okay, okay.

3274
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow.

3275
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Oh, yeah, I'll do it now.

3276
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
I picked the best team.

3277
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I picked the best team. You just pick the strongest

3278
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Pokemon and then you win. You just pick all the mega

3279
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
evolutions and then you win, dude.

3280
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
It's not even fucking. It doesn't even matter.

3281
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
I've got 10 mega evolutions on my team.

3282
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
I got mega kill great.

3283
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I got mega grout on.

3284
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Whatever.

3285
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
What fucking ever, bro.

3286
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
I got mega, wait, mega Wormadan.

3287
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
He's the best. He's my favorite.

3288
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Whatever, bro. It's not even fucking impressive.

3289
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool though.

3290
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
No, god damn it.

3291
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Yeah, bro.

3292
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
I use ice beam, bro.

3293
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Ah, shit.

3294
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
It's so gay.

3295
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Okay, you want to do one more?

3296
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Yeah, one more, one more.

3297
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
This will never stop.

3298
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
No.

3299
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Pokemon is the greatest game of all time.

3300
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Oh shit, I did a random.

3301
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
I'm not fighting another rando.

3302
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Oh wait, why are you sure?

3303
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
I did both. Okay.

3304
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
No, I'm in here. You got your Yan mega.

3305
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Why do you have another Yan mega?

3306
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I don't know.

3307
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
That's gay.

3308
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
In a way.

3309
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Nobody can beat pherothorn.

3310
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Nobody.

3311
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Not a single.

3312
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I'm serious, pherothorn is completely overpowered.

3313
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
He's not even fair.

3314
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I know exactly what I'm doing.

3315
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Oh wow, okay.

3316
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Well, I'm surprised by that.

3317
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Oh dear.

3318
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Ah shit.

3319
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Oh dear.

3320
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Oh no.

3321
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Oh no.

3322
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Okay, okay.

3323
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Oh.

3324
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Well.

3325
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
You're gay, by the way.

3326
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Before this utter destruction

3327
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
just absolutely ravages you.

3328
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I wanted to let you know that I know

3329
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
more than you could ever know.

3330
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
No, that can't be true.

3331
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
It's impossible.

3332
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
What are you going to do?

3333
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I think you bullshit it.

3334
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Are you going to try and pull on me?

3335
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I'm mass producing weapons in the east

3336
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
and I'm going to retake the country.

3337
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Oh fuck that dude.

3338
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
So bad.

3339
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
I don't even know why you even bother.

3340
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
God fucking damn it.

3341
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Alright.

3342
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Okay, what do I got here?

3343
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
What do, oh I see.

3344
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Yes, I see. I have the ultimate strategy.

3345
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
The ultimate strategy is just use Volcanion

3346
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
because he's the best Pokemon.

3347
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Yeah, it's totally not fair that my team

3348
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
has pherothorn and Volcanion.

3349
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Yeah, well we're in doubt

3350
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
fucking kill each other.

3351
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
They're the best Pokemon.

3352
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Oh, bullshit.

3353
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Guess who it is.

3354
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
It's the game.

3355
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
It's the game.

3356
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Back in the fucking dead.

3357
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And I know what he's going to do too.

3358
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
I know exactly what he's going to do.

3359
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
God damn you knew!

3360
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I knew! I knew!

3361
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I remember it.

3362
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Oh, he might still...

3363
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
This might still fuck me though.

3364
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
I can't believe it.

3365
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
He used his memory against me.

3366
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
That's just what you do with an alomololo.

3367
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
He used his memory

3368
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
to create.

3369
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
The ghost of fucking the game

3370
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
came and whispered in my ear.

3371
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
I don't have that great of options here.

3372
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I can't believe it.

3373
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Yeah, iron barbs.

3374
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
You knocked my rocky helmet off.

3375
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Oh man.

3376
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Well...

3377
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
That was good.

3378
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Good while it lasted.

3379
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Does it matter?

3380
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Shit.

3381
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Damn it.

3382
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
I'm gonna get ya.

3383
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Yeah, I got ya.

3384
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Does it matter?

3385
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Doesn't even matter.

3386
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Okay.

3387
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Okay.

3388
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Please God, please, please.

3389
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Well, you're gonna sleep powder.

3390
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
No, I'm not.

3391
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I would never do that.

3392
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Wait.

3393
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
But now that you know that I know you're gonna sleep powder,

3394
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
now you're gonna not sleep powder.

3395
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I would never do that.

3396
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
In the first place, I never was going to.

3397
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Yes, you fucking were.

3398
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Well, I mean, I haven't really

3399
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
gained anything, but I guess...

3400
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Um...

3401
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Shit.

3402
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
You really foiled me, babe.

3403
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Yeah, I got ya.

3404
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Um...

3405
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Oh God.

3406
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Yeah, okay.

3407
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Enjoy that one HP you just absorbed from me.

3408
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Thanks.

3409
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I will.

3410
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Fag it.

3411
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Come on!

3412
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
No!

3413
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
That's not true.

3414
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Little did Ben know that

3415
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
once you looked through his diary beforehand.

3416
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
No!

3417
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Digi gave me the key for a return

3418
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
for some Mike's Heart Eliminator.

3419
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
That son of a bitch.

3420
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Okay, dude.

3421
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Okay, dude.

3422
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Oh, yeah.

3423
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Oh, yeah.

3424
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Yeah, bro.

3425
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Now you're fucked, dude.

3426
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Shit.

3427
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
What to do?

3428
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
I got it.

3429
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Okay.

3430
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
What is Munchy

3431
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
gonna do against these

3432
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
pro strats?

3433
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Okay.

3434
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Okay, that's something.

3435
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Uh...

3436
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Hmm. What does Excelsior

3437
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
even do?

3438
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
He does this.

3439
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
He probably just looks gay.

3440
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
He looks awesome. You're fucking gay.

3441
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
You were, in fact,

3442
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
the one who fully revealed the decision

3443
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
on top of gay men.

3444
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
No, he does look awesome.

3445
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
He's edgy.

3446
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
He's really edgy.

3447
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I wish I had a team of Excelsior,

3448
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Absol,

3449
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Bisharp,

3450
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Skarmory.

3451
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Who else is edgy?

3452
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Oh, Zangus, yeah.

3453
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
The edgiest Pokemon.

3454
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
The edgiest team.

3455
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
The best Pokemon, in fact.

3456
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Yes.

3457
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Oh, you think you're good,

3458
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
but in fact, you're bad.

3459
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
I'm so good.

3460
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
This man will be

3461
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
my father.

3462
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
He'll be my father.

3463
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
I shall save him

3464
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
for a later date.

3465
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Oh.

3466
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Gotcha.

3467
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I tricked you.

3468
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Did you trick me, or is I the one who tricked you?

3469
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I don't know.

3470
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
That trick that you placed upon me

3471
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
was, in fact, a trick of great proportions.

3472
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
A trick so good, in fact,

3473
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
that I tricked even yourself.

3474
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Oh.

3475
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
That was bad.

3476
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Well, that was well tall.

3477
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Dude, you're going to die, dude.

3478
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
You're going to die.

3479
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I got damage on you.

3480
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
You got a little damage, I guess.

3481
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
I'd do half your health, dude.

3482
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Yeah, sure.

3483
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Sure.

3484
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
But you know what they say,

3485
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
half your health is only worth

3486
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
a quarter of a Pokemon.

3487
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
That's not what they say.

3488
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
That's true.

3489
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
That's not what they say at all.

3490
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
That's all true.

3491
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
That could not be farther, in fact,

3492
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
from what they say.

3493
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I hear that all the time.

3494
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I hear your lies all the time.

3495
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
What? No, boo.

3496
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Gay.

3497
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Okay, I didn't expect that.

3498
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I don't know why I didn't expect that.

3499
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
That was the obvious thing you were going to do

3500
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
against you, Vel'Thal.

3501
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Shit, that's really stupid.

3502
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
So stupid.

3503
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
That's really stupid.

3504
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
What the fuck do you think

3505
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I'm not going to do it still?

3506
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
I don't know.

3507
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
At least I didn't lose anyone

3508
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
yet.

3509
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Damn it.

3510
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Yeah.

3511
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Yeah, bro.

3512
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Yeah, bro. Yeah, you know it, dog.

3513
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Oh, that's

3514
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
that stealth rock, though.

3515
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
It doesn't matter.

3516
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Yeah, it matters.

3517
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
It matters to me.

3518
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
It doesn't matter a single.

3519
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Oh, dear.

3520
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
What's even the point of that?

3521
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
That's what it is.

3522
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Oh, shit.

3523
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
I don't think you can kill me, though.

3524
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I don't think you can kill me.

3525
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Yeah.

3526
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Yeah.

3527
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Damn it, if it wasn't for that crit,

3528
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
I might have lived.

3529
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Which, what, did I just crit on you?

3530
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Yeah.

3531
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I think I was going to kill you.

3532
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Well, I don't know, maybe.

3533
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
It went down somewhat slowly.

3534
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Oh, he's so fucking fast.

3535
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I'm so good.

3536
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
He's so fast.

3537
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
He's literally the fastest.

3538
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Deoxys is literally the fastest

3539
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
human being on the planet.

3540
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
What?

3541
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
He is?

3542
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Yeah, I know.

3543
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Shit.

3544
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
He's way too fast.

3545
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
No, I'm not fast at all.

3546
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Actually, so is...

3547
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
so is Excelsior.

3548
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Uh...

3549
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Jeez.

3550
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Okay.

3551
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Well, when I went down,

3552
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I guess I wanted to refresh my beautiful voice.

3553
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Yeah.

3554
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
While I talk, I noticed that

3555
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
there was a

3556
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
rally's fast food bag

3557
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
specifically marked for me, and it said

3558
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
for a munchie, God bless.

3559
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
And so I hurriedly

3560
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
grabbed it and ran it up into my room

3561
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
to stuff my face with spicy chicken wings.

3562
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Yeah.

3563
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Did I tell you that I fried chicken before

3564
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
and I fucked it up?

3565
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Yes, you did.

3566
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
You were so happy

3567
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
to be able to say it, I'm dead.

3568
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
I'm fucked, by the way.

3569
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Yeah, that was it.

3570
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Whatever.

3571
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
You were so happy, dude, to say it again

3572
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
you were in the middle of explaining the fried chicken story.

3573
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
And then you hushed yourself and said

3574
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
no, I need to say this on camera.

3575
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Oh, yeah.

3576
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
No, that wasn't the story.

3577
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
No, there were other...

3578
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
No, no, it's not true.

3579
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
It's not true. My fried chicken story is gay.

3580
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Oh shit, I forgot to hit rematch.

3581
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Oh shit.

3582
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
How long have we been going?

3583
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Two hours?

3584
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
A little more than two hours.

3585
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
God, but I just can't stop playing Pokemon.

3586
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
No, no, it's impossible.

3587
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
It's literally the greatest game of all time.

3588
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Oh look, I have Steve Vani on my team.

3589
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Haha, that's a Twitter joke.

3590
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Steve Vani.

3591
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Yeah, basically.

3592
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
I mean, I get it.

3593
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
It's because Lucario's gay, right? Like Steve Vani.

3594
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Yeah, exactly.

3595
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
That's fine.

3596
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
That's all good.

3597
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
I like everything.

3598
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
And it's cool.

3599
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Um, fuck.

3600
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
No, no, no, no.

3601
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
No, no, no, no, no.

3602
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Meltank is such a good Pokemon.

3603
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Meltank is good.

3604
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I'm so proud of it.

3605
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Meltank is a great poke, man.

3606
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Oh man, this is just like my battle against

3607
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Internet99.1.

3608
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Started with the Whiskash.

3609
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Started with the Whiskash, now we hear.

3610
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I don't get paid to blow up like the World Trade.

3611
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Started with the Whiskash, now we

3612
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
fighting

3613
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Steve Vani

3614
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
on the Internet.

3615
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
I mean, the heated

3616
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Internet debate with Steve Vani.

3617
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Oh, Steven Universe descent.

3618
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Descent.

3619
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Nerd, oh you fool.

3620
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Oh, that was the naive thing to do.

3621
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Hey, yes.

3622
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Here, I'm about to show you how stupid you are.

3623
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
No!

3624
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
No!

3625
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
You were

3626
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Fuck you, man.

3627
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Not a scratch. Look, 100%

3628
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
not even a scratch.

3629
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Yeah, I see that. Yeah, it's good.

3630
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I'm so mad that

3631
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Mega Evolution are still in

3632
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Southern Moon.

3633
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
It's so bad.

3634
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Um, I don't care.

3635
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
I'm fine with it. I think Z-moves seem really

3636
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
stupid, but I don't know.

3637
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Maybe they'll be fine.

3638
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Maybe they'll just be like

3639
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I don't know, just the way that

3640
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
just the fact that they have these big long

3641
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
ass animations makes me hate them.

3642
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I mean, if they were just

3643
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
a move like any other

3644
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I don't know. I mean, I guess

3645
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
they could be balanced.

3646
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
They're just the same as in

3647
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Gen 5, like the type of

3648
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
gems.

3649
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
The type gems?

3650
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Yeah, oh my fucking god.

3651
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Dude.

3652
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
It's type advantage.

3653
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Let me, well, Munchy, you see

3654
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
when a Pokemon uses an ability

3655
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
that has an advantage over one

3656
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
or more of the enemy's types.

3657
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
I forgot what Lucario is saying.

3658
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Shit, fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit.

3659
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Shit, shit, shit.

3660
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Um...

3661
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Hmm...

3662
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
What is Furret gonna do? Something idiotic,

3663
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
I'm sure. Something idiotic.

3664
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Something just so fucking foolish.

3665
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Something that's too

3666
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
embarrassed himself.

3667
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Hahaha.

3668
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Hahaha.

3669
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Hahaha.

3670
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Okay, okay.

3671
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Oh, you mother fucker, you'll pay.

3672
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Yeah, I know.

3673
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
You will pay in time.

3674
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I know, dude.

3675
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Oh, my focus sash.

3676
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Come on.

3677
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Bitch.

3678
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
What the fuck are you thinking?

3679
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
What the fuck are you thinking?

3680
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
What are you thinking, bro?

3681
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
You can't beat Miletank.

3682
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Miletank's just gonna drink that milk.

3683
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Like, I mean, that rain.

3684
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Like, it drinks its own milk every day.

3685
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
All day, every day.

3686
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Mother fucker.

3687
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
You're done. You're done.

3688
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
No, don't be stupid, man.

3689
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Don't say that stupid shit

3690
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
at me.

3691
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Um...

3692
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Hmm...

3693
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
I'm gonna kill you.

3694
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I'm gonna kill you right fucking now.

3695
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
No, dude.

3696
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
No, bro.

3697
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
There's only one way.

3698
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Idiot, you're stupid.

3699
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
You're so stupid.

3700
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
You're so stupid.

3701
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Everything about you, I hate.

3702
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Everything about you, I hate.

3703
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Oh, dear.

3704
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
What a shame.

3705
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
It's okay, man.

3706
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
It's good in fact.

3707
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
It's good in fact.

3708
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
It's better this way.

3709
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Wait, um...

3710
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Ugh, I'm so gay.

3711
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I mean...

3712
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Hmm...

3713
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Oh!

3714
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Interesting.

3715
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Interesting texture.

3716
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Wait, why would you do that?

3717
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Unless you've got something with Arena Trap

3718
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
that you're gonna switch into.

3719
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Shadow Tag or something.

3720
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
You don't know that.

3721
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
That's the only way this would be a reasonable strategy.

3722
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
You don't know that.

3723
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Tee-hee.

3724
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Ah, fuck.

3725
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
You don't know that at all.

3726
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
You don't fucking know a thing.

3727
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Ah, damn it.

3728
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Oh, god.

3729
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Pfft.

3730
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
You're gonna perish, dude.

3731
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
No, I'm not gonna perish at all.

3732
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
I think you might perish.

3733
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I'm gonna do, in fact, the opposite of perish, in fact.

3734
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
No, you're gonna get perish right now.

3735
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Oh, damn.

3736
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
It would have been really good if I'd woken up.

3737
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
It would have been real cool.

3738
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
What the fuck, Currim?

3739
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
He's a little bitch today.

3740
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
So bad.

3741
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I know. No, but this is gonna do it. You're done.

3742
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
No, well, no, well.

3743
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Yeah, focus glass, yeah, yeah.

3744
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
No.

3745
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
You know what they say, early bird gets the worm.

3746
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Yo, hey, what's the name of your...

3747
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
What's the title of your comic?

3748
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Investigator.

3749
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Oh, god.

3750
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
It's so obvious in retrospect.

3751
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Yeah.

3752
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Why did I even ask?

3753
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
When's it coming out?

3754
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
I don't fucking know.

3755
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Tell me, idiot.

3756
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
You bastard.

3757
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
When you pray.

3758
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
When you go to church and you pray.

3759
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
I don't pray.

3760
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
My righteous prayers will reach you.

3761
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Dude, I really want to read it.

3762
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I mean, it sounds fucking

3763
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
weird and bizarre.

3764
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
I'm done.

3765
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Yeah, you're done.

3766
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I don't even have this one.

3767
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
I don't know, man. It sounds really weird and like...

3768
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
I don't know.

3769
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
I don't know what to expect from like...

3770
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Oh, come on!

3771
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Oh, but it's

3772
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
all for nothing.

3773
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
But it's all for fucking

3774
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
not.

3775
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Unless you've got...

3776
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Yeah, okay.

3777
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
There's in fact nothing.

3778
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Oh,

3779
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
the drizzle bed.

3780
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Whatever, you stupid bastard.

3781
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
No.

3782
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Wait, I don't understand why you did

3783
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
parish song.

3784
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Because I thought you were going to switch out

3785
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
and then I didn't want you to have

3786
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
the upper hand and have access

3787
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
to what you wanted to switch into.

3788
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Okay, I was reading way too much into it.

3789
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Damn it.

3790
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Damn it.

3791
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Oh, that choice scarf.

3792
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
That was a great, that was a great

3793
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
kirim.

3794
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
It was in fact correct.

3795
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
It might have been the greatest kirim of all time.

3796
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Whatever.

3797
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
What's this fucking piece of shit?

3798
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
I don't know.

3799
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Some gay shit, you know.

3800
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
You know. God,

3801
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
you idiot.

3802
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
I can't believe you would do something so stupid.

3803
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
What's that about?

3804
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
I can't believe you would do something so stupid.

3805
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
That was embarrassing.

3806
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
I admit.

3807
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
I admit it.

3808
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I am gay.

3809
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I admit that nothing I do will ever matter.

3810
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
I'm just going to have to

3811
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
debuff you

3812
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
to oblivion.

3813
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
This special defense will be through the floor

3814
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
by the time I'm done with you.

3815
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Oh, God.

3816
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Not this shit again.

3817
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Doesn't matter.

3818
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
No, I'm going to lose you.

3819
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I'm fucking Nate's over.

3820
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Damn, it's not even cool.

3821
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
It's not even fair.

3822
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
It's not even right. There's no reason to fight.

3823
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
And yet this is our daily life.

3824
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Shit, I close it again.

3825
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Oh, my fucking God.

3826
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
I can't...

3827
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
You will...

3828
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I will see you in hell then.

3829
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I can't wait, dude.

3830
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I can't wait...

3831
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
I can't wait to Pokemon battle you

3832
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
in hell forever.

3833
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
That will be my punishment.

3834
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Forever until you

3835
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
fucking collapse from exhaustion.

3836
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
You will Pokemon battle.

3837
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
But it was to no avail.

3838
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
It was worthless.

3839
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
No, it was worthless.

3840
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Why? No!

3841
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Oh, you've crippled me.

3842
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
LOL.

3843
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
What do I have? Wait, wait, wait.

3844
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Hmm.

3845
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Yes.

3846
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
That was a weird... That's shitty.

3847
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
I made the right... I made the wrong choice.

3848
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
It's so bad.

3849
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Yeah, it's poor. It was poor form on my part

3850
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
and I apologize.

3851
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Seeking...

3852
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Seeking's got mega horn.

3853
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Look how fast I'm moving.

3854
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Look how fast I'm swimming in place.

3855
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Yeah, there's not even any water there, idiot.

3856
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I think we're in the desert or something.

3857
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
So just, you know, calm down.

3858
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
From the look of our terrain,

3859
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
it looks like we're in like a back alley.

3860
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Like you're gonna shank me once we're done with this.

3861
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Well, that's true.

3862
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Unrelated to the terrain.

3863
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Seeking's got...

3864
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
He's probably got mega horn.

3865
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
And that makes me so mad.

3866
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I have an irrational hate

3867
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
of seeking and gullting.

3868
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I think they're the worst Pokemon ever made.

3869
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
They're not great.

3870
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
I don't know. I don't hate them.

3871
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I mean, a lot of Pokemon

3872
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
and especially

3873
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
first gen are just

3874
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
animals.

3875
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Like they're just animals.

3876
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
And it's bizarre.

3877
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Um...

3878
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
And that really...

3879
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Did you get the two?

3880
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
What?

3881
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Yeah, yeah, it says you left.

3882
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Hold on. Reconnect.

3883
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
That was quite odd.

3884
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
My Internet

3885
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
did not go out.

3886
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
It was in fact

3887
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
it was a Pokemon showdown

3888
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
like eviction notice.

3889
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

3890
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Said you left, but...

3891
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Apart

3892
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
from my investigator,

3893
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
I'm also working on a decently

3894
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
sized novel.

3895
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Are you? Is that true?

3896
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
That's more true than you could ever know.

3897
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Okay.

3898
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
With my...

3899
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
I've talked about this before on the PCP

3900
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
in my interview.

3901
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
He got mad at me

3902
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
for talking about it before.

3903
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Who did?

3904
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
I'm working on it with

3905
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
a good old friend of mine.

3906
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
My co-host on almost all of my streams.

3907
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
And we are working on a...

3908
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Shit. Fucking crit. Okay.

3909
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
I would describe it as a

3910
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
political novel

3911
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
about every group,

3912
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
every demographic of people that we hate.

3913
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Um...

3914
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Is it about me?

3915
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Well, you will be in it

3916
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
as a side character and you will be.

3917
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
You will be...

3918
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Your plot ends with you being introduced

3919
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
to buying ice cream and then being shot up

3920
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
in a dry by shooting by a game.

3921
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Okay. Okay, good.

3922
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Great.

3923
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
In fact...

3924
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
This novel...

3925
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

3926
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
It follows a...

3927
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
A...

3928
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
A normal weed-spoking

3929
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
gamer who gets transported...

3930
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Oh, dude. Yes. Yes.

3931
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I do know this, but go on.

3932
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Who gets transported

3933
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
about...

3934
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Wait. Was this...

3935
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
I feel like I've read this, but it wasn't a

3936
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
novel. Did I read like a...

3937
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Did I read like the first chapter or something?

3938
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

3939
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Who gets transported to the future

3940
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
via Obama's request

3941
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
to...

3942
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
He had a...

3943
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
He had sacred prowess and knew that

3944
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
in the future, the Islamic state

3945
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
would vow to destroy video games forever.

3946
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
And thus...

3947
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
That's right. That's what they do.

3948
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Plunging into a...

3949
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
An era of distress like no other.

3950
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
An era of distress.

3951
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Oh, no. Yes.

3952
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
And therefore, it is John.

3953
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
John Majors is the way

3954
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
word weed-smoking gamer

3955
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
who vows to destroy Islam

3956
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
forever and bring peace to

3957
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
the world. God, what a view.

3958
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Via video games.

3959
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Uh, how...

3960
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Well, when can... When's the release date on that?

3961
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
I mean, I want... The release date on that...

3962
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Uh...

3963
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
I would say

3964
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
mid-2017

3965
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
for that.

3966
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
As it is...

3967
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
It is quite the endeavor.

3968
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
I did not expect there to actually be a release date.

3969
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I gotta say it.

3970
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I'm very impressed already with this book.

3971
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Just for the fact that

3972
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
it presumes to

3973
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
ever come out at all.

3974
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
The...

3975
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
That's the large plot, but

3976
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
the way John hopes

3977
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
to destroy

3978
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Islam forever

3979
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
is by

3980
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
winning Evo, which in the future

3981
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Evo is in the fine-games tournament.

3982
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
It's basically... Sports are extinct in video games

3983
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
or sports now. And sports is like...

3984
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
They basically don't exist.

3985
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
And Evo is like a Super Bowl.

3986
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
But the Super Bowl isn't just about football.

3987
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
It's about every sport ever.

3988
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Good.

3989
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
So basically, winning...

3990
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Yeah, yeah, you like that Custab Berry?

3991
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Yeah, you like that explosion, bro?

3992
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
It didn't affect me.

3993
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
I know, but I just wanted to do it.

3994
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Anyway, he has to go around

3995
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
the United States

3996
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
in various video game

3997
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Arcadiums and beat the shit out of people.

3998
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Various video game Arcadiums?

3999
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Okay.

4000
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
That sentence made sense.

4001
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
And defeat all

4002
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Islamic presence in the United States

4003
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
and he shipped off to Mecca.

4004
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Does he do it in video games?

4005
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Is how he defeats them?

4006
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Or does he do it out of video games, too?

4007
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
No, no.

4008
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
He utterly defeats them

4009
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
by destroying them in video games.

4010
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
So much that they want to commit suicide

4011
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
and do it instantaneously.

4012
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
That's the superpower?

4013
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Yeah.

4014
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
No!

4015
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
No!

4016
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
What a bunch of fucking bullshit.

4017
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I know what you're saying.

4018
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Yeah, you feel me on this, bro?

4019
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Yeah, you idiot.

4020
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Yeah, you dummy.

4021
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
You're the fucking worst.

4022
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
It doesn't matter.

4023
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
No, but guess what?

4024
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Yeah, you think that's cool?

4025
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
You think that's cool?

4026
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
It's nothing.

4027
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
It's literally nothing.

4028
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
You're literally going to die right now.

4029
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Yeah, bro!

4030
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Heel bell, bro!

4031
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
That's...

4032
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
That's crazy.

4033
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
That's cruel.

4034
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
It's cruel on unusual, I know.

4035
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
But I did it anyway.

4036
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
This guy's probably going to mega-evolve.

4037
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
But, you know...

4038
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
One of the characters

4039
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
in John Major, American Gamer.

4040
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
That's the title.

4041
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
American Gamer?

4042
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Yeah, okay.

4043
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Is a man by the name of...

4044
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Did he get even slower when he mega-evolved?

4045
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Yes.

4046
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Wow, okay.

4047
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
It is a man by the name of Tweet Burglar,

4048
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
who a fan of my Twitter

4049
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
will know is a character

4050
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I like to attribute to Nate,

4051
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
as he often steals tweets.

4052
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Oh, yeah!

4053
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Last time she did good, I'll see you in hell.

4054
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
And he is the CEO of a tweeting empire,

4055
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
and he steals tweets from people.

4056
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Wait, wait, wait.

4057
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
This is Nate?

4058
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Well, I often attributed this to Nate,

4059
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
but he's his own character now,

4060
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
since I liked him so much.

4061
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Okay, so actual Nate is an investigator.

4062
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Yeah.

4063
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
And this is just like a sort of spiritual

4064
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
we-nate.

4065
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Anyway, his name is Tweet Burglar.

4066
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Yes.

4067
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Good, okay.

4068
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
He steals tweets from

4069
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
not as popular Twitter's,

4070
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
and uses them on his own super Twitter,

4071
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
and he gets all the love and attention

4072
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
for it.

4073
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Not only does he steal tweets,

4074
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
but he steals the memories of tweets ever happening.

4075
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Oh my god.

4076
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
If you make a tweet and he steals it,

4077
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
you won't even remember making that tweet.

4078
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
And through this, he can control information

4079
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
since people tweet about natural disasters

4080
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
and terrorist attacks.

4081
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
He can make sure people can't even remember it.

4082
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Because he can just like

4083
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
remove the tweets from existence

4084
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
by stealing them?

4085
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Interesting.

4086
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
You know, you control the flow of information.

4087
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
You control everything.

4088
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Yeah, exactly.

4089
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Another one of the elite gaming

4090
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
administrators

4091
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
is named Daryl Pluto.

4092
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
He's sponsored by Arby's.

4093
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
He's black and he's really fat.

4094
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
He doesn't have any arms,

4095
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
because they were blown off in the war.

4096
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
And instead of arms, he has USB 3 ports.

4097
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Okay.

4098
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Sure.

4099
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Sure, alright.

4100
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
And he wears a gold chain

4101
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
that says Arby's on it as a necklace.

4102
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
And I just don't have his shirt on, ever.

4103
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
God fucking damn it, Lilligan.

4104
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
You're so bad.

4105
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
You fail me every time.

4106
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Just fucking kill yourself, my man.

4107
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I want to.

4108
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
We're also going to have a lot of real people in it,

4109
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
such as Obama.

4110
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Obama's going to be a major character,

4111
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
as well as

4112
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
of Quake Arena

4113
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
esports theme, Fatality,

4114
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
aka Jonathan Wendell.

4115
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I have no idea

4116
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
what you're talking about right now.

4117
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
Who is in fact the greatest

4118
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Quake 3 Arena player of all time

4119
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
for a short while.

4120
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Really? He's not even still

4121
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
the greatest Quake 3 Arena player.

4122
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Even that

4123
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
small thing has been

4124
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
stripped away from it.

4125
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Holy shit.

4126
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
There's also going to

4127
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
be a character by the name

4128
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
of Cobra Kisser, who is John's worst nightmare.

4129
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
He's French

4130
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
and he's a serial rapist

4131
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
and he...

4132
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
That's his character. And he likes snakes.

4133
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
He's magic.

4134
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Cobra Kisser.

4135
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Did you say he's gay

4136
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
and he's a serial rapist?

4137
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Yeah, and he's French.

4138
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
And he's French, sure. That's fine.

4139
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
That's fine.

4140
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
That's okay.

4141
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
With me.

4142
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Let me get the entire list,

4143
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
because even just talking about the carries themselves

4144
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
is rewarding and innovative

4145
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
of himself.

4146
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
One of the

4147
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
elite 4 game administrators

4148
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
is the name of Sandy Hook

4149
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
and she's a pirate.

4150
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Sure. That's all we know about her yet

4151
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
for now.

4152
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
Is that our new Sandy Hook?

4153
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Come on, Blissey.

4154
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Just sweet, sweet dreams.

4155
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
The CEO of Sony

4156
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
is a major character and his name is Rick Blast

4157
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
and he's just a floating head

4158
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
in a jar. He's in the future,

4159
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
and he's bought out by a torturer's

4160
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
guild.

4161
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
And the PS5

4162
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
is an Iron Maiden.

4163
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
That's just it?

4164
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
It's just an Iron Maiden

4165
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
is the PlayStation 5?

4166
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
And also

4167
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
it's like 50,000

4168
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
years in the future, but they're still

4169
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
making...

4170
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
They only just recently came out the PS5

4171
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
because the PS4 is such a pro for its gaming system

4172
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
with so many games on it that it lasted

4173
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
for eons.

4174
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Eons?

4175
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Dammit.

4176
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
The gravy train had to end sometime.

4177
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Balls, dude.

4178
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Oh, my god.

4179
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
That's all a critical hit did?

4180
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Oh, my god.

4181
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
So bad.

4182
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
I know.

4183
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
And by the way,

4184
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
this was made like

4185
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
maybe like a year and a half ago.

4186
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
We started a project on this.

4187
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Yeah, I read that a long time ago.

4188
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
It feels like.

4189
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
But we're

4190
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
actually

4191
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
we're actually

4192
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
but we're

4193
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
we're we are an intensely dedicated

4194
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
to it at this point.

4195
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Good.

4196
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Fuck, I'm not going to make it.

4197
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
This toxic skin, this toxic skin

4198
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
to fucking get me. No!

4199
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
So bad.

4200
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
So bad.

4201
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
I really thought I could

4202
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
turn it around a little bit.

4203
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
No, of course not.

4204
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
During our

4205
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
game, I became deeply infatuated

4206
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
with the story of the Zodiac Killer.

4207
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Yeah, sure.

4208
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
And I turned him

4209
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
into a character named the Wii U

4210
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Torturer.

4211
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Okay.

4212
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
He's basically the Zodiac Killer,

4213
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
but instead of people, he kills Wii U's.

4214
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Okay.

4215
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I'm going to read the description for him right now.

4216
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
I have a giant Wiki dedicated

4217
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
to cataloging these various characters.

4218
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
And I'm going to read the description for him

4219
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
right now as we play Pokemon.

4220
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Please do.

4221
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
His gaming prowess,

4222
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
which is their special ability,

4223
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
that's what they call it, gaming prowess,

4224
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
is breaking and breakable.

4225
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
And his personality is the most violent person

4226
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
you will ever meet.

4227
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
But only when Wii U's are involved.

4228
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Anyone who is unfortunate enough to be in the same room

4229
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
with Arthur and Wii U together

4230
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
will witness the most graphic display of onscreen violence

4231
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
they will ever see.

4232
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
He has almost a fetishistic impulse

4233
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
like an old bean.

4234
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Hides his deadly Wii U

4235
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
obsession at all costs.

4236
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
The reason he's like this

4237
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
is because he got a PS4 for his

4238
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
birthday when he was 10.

4239
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
And he wanted a Wii U.

4240
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
So, so now like

4241
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
since he couldn't have one.

4242
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Wait, how old is he now?

4243
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
He's like 38.

4244
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Wait.

4245
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Wait, so this is the future.

4246
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
Wait, so the Wii U is like a completely

4247
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
empty console, but this boy

4248
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
is totally irrelevant.

4249
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Oh, oh, oh.

4250
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Here's one you're going to really like.

4251
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
You're going to really love this one.

4252
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Oh, for sakes, dude.

4253
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Why did it have to be Flygon?

4254
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
You're so bad, anyway.

4255
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
His name is IndieIndiaIndiana

4256
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
and he's the CEO of Undertale Incorporated.

4257
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Wait, so

4258
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
okay, I remember IndieIndiaIndiana

4259
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
but I forget, wait,

4260
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
I forgot that it was

4261
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Undertale Incorporated.

4262
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
And he has single-handedly

4263
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
he through

4264
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
marriages

4265
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
and backstabbing, he has become the sole

4266
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
proprietor of

4267
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Toby Fox's legacy, his Undertale

4268
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
fortune. And he has used that

4269
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
money to buy

4270
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
every indie game ever made

4271
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
sure that

4272
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
no quality titles can be released under them.

4273
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Why would he do such a thing?

4274
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Why is he so evil?

4275
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
No quality

4276
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
titles

4277
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
ever.

4278
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
And every indie game

4279
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
now is just like a

4280
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
based off like Cookie Clicker, Tetris

4281
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
or Candy Crush.

4282
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Sure.

4283
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
I mean, why wouldn't it be?

4284
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Aw, come on!

4285
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
And a fun fact, he used to be

4286
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
a McDonald's manager

4287
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
before he became CEO

4288
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
before he got his scheme in his head

4289
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
to destroy indie games.

4290
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
A what manager?

4291
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
A McDonald's manager.

4292
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Oh, okay, makes sense. Why is he

4293
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
so cruel?

4294
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
He had to be explored.

4295
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Okay, okay.

4296
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
All we know at this point is that

4297
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
he deeply does.

4298
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Okay, dude, your zygarde's dead.

4299
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
No, it's not. Yeah, it's Ice Punch, Nigger.

4300
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Yeah.

4301
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Ice Punch, come on, Nigger.

4302
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Ice Punch, Nigger.

4303
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
The fact that I have warm damn on my team

4304
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
means that there's nothing I can

4305
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
fucking do.

4306
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
I know.

4307
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
It's pitiful, really.

4308
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
My team was like made to just lose

4309
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
to Toxicrypt. Like, I have no switch into it.

4310
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Yeah, am I gonna completely

4311
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
sweep your team with Toxicrypt?

4312
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
I think you very well might.

4313
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
I think, well, I don't know

4314
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
if I can do it with this guy.

4315
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Probably no.

4316
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Yeah, I don't have the moves.

4317
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Oh, shit.

4318
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Damn it.

4319
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
I was gonna Ice Punch you.

4320
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
I was gonna Ice Punch you.

4321
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
But it just didn't happen.

4322
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
It just didn't happen that way.

4323
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
You know what I'm saying?

4324
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Yeah, you know what I'm fucking saying, dude.

4325
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
I'll check this out, motherfucker.

4326
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
No, that's bad.

4327
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
I don't like that.

4328
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Oh, dear.

4329
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
I see.

4330
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Oh, I see.

4331
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
Oh, I see.

4332
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Do you?

4333
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
Shit!

4334
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Okay.

4335
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Whatever.

4336
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Idiot.

4337
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Bitch.

4338
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Uh...

4339
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
By the way,

4340
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
I keep alluding to this novel

4341
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
just because I'm so proud of it.

4342
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
It's not even close to being done.

4343
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
There's no specific reason

4344
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
for me to even say it.

4345
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
As I feel in the audiences

4346
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
for Investigator,

4347
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
which is like a normal story,

4348
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
and well...

4349
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
I wouldn't say normal,

4350
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
but it is in fact

4351
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
a project of love

4352
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
and not of hate.

4353
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
And John Major

4354
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
are so intensely different

4355
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
that, uh...

4356
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Really?

4357
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Again, just to reiterate, the only reason I'm talking about John Major

4358
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
is because I'm so deeply enthralled

4359
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
by everything about it

4360
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
that I'm so proud of it

4361
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
that I will talk about it from now until the end of time.

4362
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Wait.

4363
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
What the fuck, dude?

4364
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
What the fuck, man?

4365
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
This is some bullshit, man.

4366
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
It's so bad.

4367
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
I got you, though.

4368
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Yeah, whatever.

4369
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Wait, you were saying that about

4370
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Investigator or about John Major?

4371
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
Yeah, about John Major.

4372
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Well, I'm also very

4373
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
concerned about

4374
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
Investigator,

4375
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
but it's much more

4376
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
of a story

4377
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
that could feasibly

4378
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
mean anything to other people.

4379
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
So I want to treat it

4380
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
with a little bit more dignity

4381
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
than

4382
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
the John Major.

4383
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Wait, dignity?

4384
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
No, the last time we talked about Investigator,

4385
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
it was courage and dignity.

4386
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Oh, I see.

4387
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
You said that, and I thought

4388
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
the idea

4389
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
of something discovering dignity

4390
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
was really incredible.

4391
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Hmm.

4392
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
How am I going to crush you this time?

4393
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
I have so many ways.

4394
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Give up, because I just click something

4395
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
that will make you run for the hills.

4396
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Okay, I might as well just fucking

4397
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
get out and shoot my fucking brains out.

4398
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Yeah, I think you might want to consider

4399
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
that.

4400
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
What the fuck are you typing?

4401
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
I'm searching the type

4402
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
of ship chart.

4403
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Yeah, you idiot.

4404
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
I'm weak to

4405
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
fighting ground.

4406
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Is that it?

4407
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Fire,

4408
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
fighting ground and fire.

4409
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
You're dead.

4410
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Am I? I'm gay.

4411
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Yeah, you're very gay.

4412
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
You're very gay,

4413
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
and I would appreciate it

4414
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
if you never did

4415
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
ever again. Maybe.

4416
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Could you perhaps be less gay next time?

4417
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Please and thank you.

4418
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Please and thank you, sir.

4419
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
You're dead.

4420
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
There's nothing you can switch into, though.

4421
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
You might as well

4422
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
fucking kill yourself, my man.

4423
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Oh, no.

4424
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
I might as well.

4425
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Oh, come on. Crit, really?

4426
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
Had to be, huh?

4427
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Had to be.

4428
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Alright, well, whatever.

4429
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Registeel,

4430
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
you've done your duty.

4431
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
God, I love...

4432
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
I get such a rush.

4433
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Going for that second protect.

4434
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
It never pays off.

4435
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
I mean,

4436
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
if you find yourself going for that second protect,

4437
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
you're just...

4438
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
It's just over.

4439
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
You've gone astray.

4440
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
You're good as dead.

4441
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Yeah, it's over.

4442
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
It's all over, dude.

4443
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Um...

4444
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Oh, shit.

4445
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Don't even try. Just don't even try.

4446
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I'm gonna do it.

4447
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Don't even try.

4448
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I'm gonna do it.

4449
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
As a friend, Ben, don't try.

4450
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Listen, man.

4451
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Don't embarrass yourself any further.

4452
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
No, no, listen.

4453
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
No, listen, no.

4454
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Yes!

4455
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
What?

4456
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
What?

4457
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Oh, my God.

4458
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
I'm just fucking...

4459
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
It's...

4460
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
Yeah, bro.

4461
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Yeah, bro.

4462
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
This is the ultimate fucking cheater.

4463
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

4464
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
You're just mad

4465
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
because of how gay you are.

4466
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
I'm so frustrated

4467
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
with my sexuality.

4468
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
I have to take it out on you.

4469
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Yeah, bro.

4470
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Yeah, I got something you can take it out on, bro.

4471
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.

4472
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
Well...

4473
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Time to do exactly what I did

4474
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
in the Elite Four

4475
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
and just fucking toxic stall my way

4476
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
into an early grave.

4477
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
This is...

4478
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
This is unjust.

4479
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
No!

4480
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
The second protect never does it.

4481
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
That doesn't even matter.

4482
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Yeah, no, it doesn't.

4483
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
No, it doesn't.

4484
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
But, uh,

4485
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
fuck you.

4486
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Oh, this is just sad.

4487
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Don't pity me.

4488
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
This is where my dam is just...

4489
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Oh, dang.

4490
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Even that time, the second protect

4491
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
didn't work.

4492
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Don't fucking pity me.

4493
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
You piece of shit.

4494
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
It's... come on.

4495
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Dude.

4496
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Return.

4497
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
No.

4498
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Yeah, there's no escape.

4499
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
God damn it.

4500
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
You think I'm going to give you a quick death?

4501
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
You think again.

4502
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
I can't believe this.

4503
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Yes!

4504
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Double protect, it never fails.

4505
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
It never fails.

4506
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
I should have seen it coming.

4507
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
The infinite strat

4508
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
that never fails to work.

4509
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Double protect.

4510
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Infinite power.

4511
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Ah, you're done.

4512
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
This is fucking barbaric.

4513
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Yeah, this is inhumane.

4514
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
This is against the Geneva Convention.

4515
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Well, how do you like this?

4516
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
There's...

4517
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
It's good.

4518
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
There's a great...

4519
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
gay...

4520
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
That fucking sucked, dude.

4521
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
That sucked real bad.

4522
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Yeah, not as bad as you, though.

4523
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
No, not quite.

4524
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
There's a great...

4525
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Okay, there's a great, like,

4526
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
fan commentary of

4527
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
Half-Life

4528
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
by this guy named Goose Goose.

4529
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
And then, at one point, he's talking about

4530
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
the, um...

4531
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
He's talking about the Combine.

4532
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
And he's like, you know, this seems like a...

4533
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
This seems like a...

4534
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
This seems like, you know, like a...

4535
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Like a...

4536
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Like a real human rights violation.

4537
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
Although, I sincerely doubt

4538
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
that the Combine even read

4539
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
the Geneva Convention.

4540
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Let alone ratified it.

4541
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
It's got great delivery.

4542
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Oh, jeez, yeah.

4543
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Those fucking backward pieces of shit.

4544
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Didn't even ratified the

4545
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Geneva Convention.

4546
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
They didn't read it. Let'll even read it.

4547
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
Let alone ratified it.

4548
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Okay, okay.

4549
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
That's enough. Okay, that's a fucking...

4550
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Okay, alright.

4551
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
Okay.

4552
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
Where's the blood into fucking end it all?

4553
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
I think we've reached...

4554
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
I'm just gonna do this.

4555
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Oh, yeah, okay.

4556
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Just let me have this one.

4557
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
Yeah, you're gonna let me win this one.

4558
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Yeah, you'll give me this one.

4559
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Yeah, because I...

4560
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
I guess I felt so bad for you, because I knew

4561
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
that you wouldn't win any other way.

4562
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Yeah, true.

4563
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
That I thought you, you know, might as well

4564
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
just fucking give it to him out of goodness

4565
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
of my heart.

4566
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Alright, you know...

4567
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Okay, should we call it quits?

4568
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

4569
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
It's nine in the morning.

4570
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
I haven't slept.

4571
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
Yeah, that's fine.

4572
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
That's way reasonable

4573
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
that you're up till six in the morning.

4574
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Don't you have, like, school or something?

4575
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
Don't...

4576
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
I'll make good.

4577
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
What day of the week is it? It's Wednesday.

4578
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Okay, yeah, I knew it.

4579
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
I'll do what I need to.

4580
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
You'll do what you have to do. You'll do what must be done.

4581
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
I'll do what must be done.

4582
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
You'll do what must be done.

4583
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
You've got your own agenda.

4584
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
That's not for me.

4585
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
I'm paying out for number one.

4586
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
That's a freeze pop song.

4587
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
It's a really bad freeze pop song, actually.

4588
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Sorry, sorry.

4589
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
I don't go to gay bars with you

4590
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
and I don't listen to the...

4591
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Well, maybe you should sometime.

4592
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
Have some gay sex with someone.

4593
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
I mean, think of...

4594
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Open up your eyes.

4595
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
I mean, think about it.

4596
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
Okay, I'm thinking about it.

4597
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
What do you hope to send

4598
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
to my brain with me thinking about it?

4599
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Well, I'm just some gay shit.

4600
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Well, then we'll work.

4601
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Because I'm talking to you.

4602
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Thank you all for coming out

4603
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
and listening.

4604
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
Oh, God, I forgot there was people

4605
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
watching.

4606
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
You didn't end it.

4607
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Oh.

4608
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Everyone,

4609
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
I forgot you were watching.

4610
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Thanks for joining us for another

4611
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
R.F.G.

4612
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Wait, another...

4613
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
R.F.

4614
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
Rook.

4615
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Roof.

4616
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Going out on such a strong note.

4617
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Maybe next time we'll play

4618
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
a different game. Probably not, though.

4619
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Maybe.

4620
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
Maybe.

4621
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Wait, yes.

4622
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Yeah.

4623
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Next time we'll beat

4624
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
fucking Crazy Throne.

4625
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Yeah.

4626
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
We'll beat Crazy Throne.

4627
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
We'll beat Crazy Taxi.

4628
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
It'll be all of us.

4629
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Yeah, okay.

4630
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Good night, everyone.

4631
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Stay safe out there, America.

4632
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Donald Trump's America.

4633
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Stay safe in Donald Trump's

4634
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
new nightmare dystopian America.

4635
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
Where the fucking combine

4636
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
come and beat you in the streets

4637
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
with their stun sticks.

4638
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Where big brothers constantly spying

4639
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
on each other.

4640
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
They're gonna do things to you.

4641
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Yeah, they're gonna do something.

4642
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
They're gonna do things to your brain.

4643
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
You probably won't like it.

4644
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
Things that you won't like.

4645
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Well, things that you won't like,

4646
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
but in retrospect, you'll look back

4647
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
and think, actually, I really did like that

4648
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
because they fucking brainwashed you.

4649
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
That's what Trump's America is now.

4650
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
I know. I'm living here.

4651
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Welcome to City 17.

4652
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Yes. Okay.
