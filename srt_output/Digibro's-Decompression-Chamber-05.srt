The Pro Crastinators Podcast

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So when Rick and Morty season 2 was first starting, episodes 1 and 2 had been leaked months beforehand.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And the night that episode 1 actually debuted on Adult Swim, the staff had this big party, which I guess is probably a pretty normal thing to do on the debut of your video, but what was unique about this one was that they live streamed it.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They did a whole thing where they had the two creators, Dan Harmon and Justin Boyland, up on a stage, drunk as shit with this interviewer guy, and they were bringing up different people who worked on the show and talking to them for a little bit.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I mean everyone, it's clear that this was primarily just a party that was happening anyways, and they just decided to impromptu do this live stream thing. They just kind of dragged people up for a couple minutes, talked to them, and they'd go back to the party.

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
With the exception of Dan and Justin who were just up there fucking wasted talking about stuff.

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And this was one of the most eye-opening things I've ever watched as a fan. It was deeply fascinating because of the things they were saying about their staff members.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You see, they had completed making the season before it ever went to air, because that's how American cartoons are made, very different from anime which is down to the wire with each episode.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But they were talking about how a lot of their best guys had been poached by Disney, and there's nothing they could really do to stop them.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
They brought up their guy who was one of the main showrunners for the season, or assistant directors, or something like that.

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And they were both like, yeah, this guy is great. He's been bought up by Disney because Rick and Morty is such a good show that everybody on it is being eyeballed by other people in the industry.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But Rick and Morty itself is a relatively low budget show on Adult Swim. They can't pay these people what they could be getting paid on higher level productions.

13
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And they were like, yeah, he's got a family, and of course he's going to take the job at Disney. They're going to pay him twice what we are, and Dan and Justin are doing this show because they want the creative freedom of being able to work on whatever they get afforded by Adult Swim, which means working for less money.

14
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So of course this guy is going to go to Disney, but they were like, yeah, if season 3 sucks, it's because we lost him.

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I was just like, whoa.

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And they were explaining that the reason that season 2 of Rick and Morty took so long to come out, because it was like a year and a half between when season 1 had come out and there was a huge gap.

17
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They had announced season 2 like way ahead of time, and it took forever, and it's taken forever now for season 3.

18
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I mean, we're a year and a half from season 2, and there's still no season 3 yet, even though it was announced after like episode 1 of season 2.

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They'd already been greenlit for the next season, which was kind of a shame because by the time episode 1 of season 2 came out, they'd already had a bunch of their guys bought up because there was no guarantee that they were getting a season 3 of Rick and Morty.

20
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And then by the time they had that guarantee, some of their best staff were already gone.

21
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is the inner workings of the industry.

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But they said the reason it took so long to get season 2 is that Justin Roiland is just so talented and so integral to the show that they can't duplicate him.

23
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They can't find someone who's able to bring as much as he is to the show, so it's just that it takes so long to...

24
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Because he voice acts half the fucking characters, he plays the two main characters, he plays a bunch of the other minor characters.

25
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He writes most of the show, he directs most of the show, he's deeply involved at every stage of production.

26
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He does the character designs, I believe.

27
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He fucking basically does everything on the show, and there's just nobody who can fill in the gaps in his workload, and that's why it takes so long for Rick and Morty season 2.

28
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And that blew my mind, and they were saying this guy who was getting bought up was the closest thing they had to someone who could fill in the gaps in Justin Roiland, and now he's gone and they're fucked.

29
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is basically the way they were putting it.

30
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I was like, whoa.

31
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And now, I totally relate to that.

32
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Because, and I know this is going to sound conceited, like I'm saying I'm some kind of massive talent or something.

33
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But like, there's a lot of times where I'm like, man, my life would be so much easier if there was just another me to cover some of this ground.

34
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because a lot of what I make, it's not about me making it, it's about me wanting it to exist.

35
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
A lot of the anime videos I do, I would be fine if someone else made them.

36
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If someone else, you know, made a video where they watched every Akiyuki Shinbo show and talked about every technique he used.

37
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I would never have had to do that video.

38
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I would just be like, oh, you did it, cool.

39
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And, you know, I've said this about a number of YouTube videos where I've said, like, now that that guy did it, I don't have to.

40
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You know, people will ask my opinions on shows sometimes and I'll be like, this dude already did it.

41
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, like recently, someone said, are you ever going to do a video on Berserk?

42
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And I'm like, super eyepatch wolves video on Berserk said everything I would have said about Berserk.

43
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, maybe I could do a video about, like, just the scene where Guts kills 100 guys and just flaunt over how much I like that scene.

44
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But even that, I couldn't fill a whole video, probably.

45
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So, yeah, it's like, it's already out there.

46
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But the problem is that there's so many things that I want to exist and that, like, I can't rely on anyone else to make because nobody else has the time.

47
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Like, who else has time to watch every Shinbo show and write about it, you know?

48
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Who else?

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because no one else is making money doing this, like the way I am.

50
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You know, I feel like I'm the only person doing, like, super in-depth anime analysis and getting paid to do it.

51
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Most of the people doing YouTube videos are not putting out videos frequently enough to make any money.

52
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like, you know, best guy ever, he has a Patreon and it could become a career one day,

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
but he puts out videos so infrequently that he doesn't get paid enough for his videos, you know?

54
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And he's not even doing, like, really research driven stuff.

55
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's more just, like, here's why this thing is amazing.

56
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But, like, yeah, nobody else, I mean, maybe Yuyukau.

57
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know how much money he makes or anything, but, like, yeah, like, there's not a lot of people who could, who would have the time and resources to do what I do.

58
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And there's just so many ideas I have and, like, it can be painful sometimes to, like, realize the sheer enormity of how much stuff falls on me

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
because there's no one else to do it.

60
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And that really is what I connect to with the whole Justin Roiland thing.

61
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, there's no way to say it without sounding conceited, but, again, it's not about the quality of what I'm doing.

62
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's just about wanting those, like, I'm not saying that the world needs a shinbo video, but, like, it's something I want to exist.

63
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And there's too many things I want to do.

64
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's really the point that I'm getting at.

65
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So Casey Neistat just happened to end his vlog mere days after I, uh, had released the previous, um, decompression chamber in which I talked about how his videos had kind of gotten stale

66
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and how he was probably going to end the vlog soon, and then sure enough, it happened.

67
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I mean, I got a bunch of messages about it, people like, it's your fault, what did you do?

68
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But honestly, it was pretty obvious it was going to happen.

69
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Um, he joked about it.

70
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I mean, he'd said he was going to do it a number of times.

71
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The vlog was not going to live forever.

72
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He had a video jokingly, like, clickbaiting saying that, like, called the end of the vlog, where he was really, like, talking about the end of that vlog, that that was something special.

73
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Um, or something like that, or maybe it was the end of the vlog for a day or some shit.

74
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But I mean, he'd been taking more breaks from it, he'd been saying that he was trying to get more challenges, and honestly, what said to me that the vlog was going to end soon

75
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
was this whole thing where he was going to make this, um, he was going to edit this video he shot in Vietnam with his son.

76
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And he kept saying, like, you know, I might put the vlog on hold for a couple of days or something, or like, I might do this and that, I have to edit this video.

77
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And then, like, for the next few vlogs, he kept saying, like, you know, well, um, I'm still working on the video, you know, it's just, uh, it's just taking a little longer.

78
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I was like, to me, this is a sign that the vlogs are in the way, you know, that he couldn't finish this video because

79
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
what little time he has to work on video is going towards the vlog.

80
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So, I had a feeling it was ending soon, and that's why I kind of talked about it that way.

81
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Um, and cause nice stat works the same way I do.

82
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He's all about challenging himself and finding new ways to do things.

83
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Um, for me, it's more a matter of getting bored and having too many ideas and wanting to do something different all the time, as well as being afraid of getting stale.

84
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Um, whereas for him, it's more about the personal growth of, like, doing something that's harder than what you're currently doing.

85
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Anyways, all of that aside, just wanted to address that since it was funny.

86
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Back when I started this podcast, a few people had said that they accidentally misread the title as Digi Bro's Depression Chamber.

87
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, that's what today's episode's gonna be.

88
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm not depressed right now, but, um, I'm going to go ahead and tell the whole story of when I was depressed.

89
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Like, just everything that happened at the time, for a few reasons.

90
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Um, mostly because I haven't told the story extensively before, and I'm always wanting to tell stories.

91
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's just that this one is maybe somewhat uncomfortable, you know, if not for me, then for the audience.

92
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Uh, and also because, but I mean, that's all the more reason to do it.

93
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And, um, on, like, the last, it must have been the last Decompression Podcast, or maybe some other video before it,

94
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was, like, talking about, um, like, part of my experience of being depressed,

95
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and DeVu said, like, when I was talking about it there, it sounded much scarier than it had ever sounded before.

96
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Like, he'd heard me talk about having been depressed, but never really, like, in-depth or anything.

97
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And I was like, huh, that's interesting that that's, you know, because he's listened to everything I've done,

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
so if he hasn't really heard how scary it could be, then it means I haven't talked about it enough.

99
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And I'm also, I'm 25 years old now, and, you know, every year that goes on, this, these stories of my teenage years become harder and harder to tell.

100
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And it's funny because for me, I regard all of this as, like, really uninteresting.

101
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Even though if someone else was telling the same story, I'd find it interesting,

102
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,000
but for me, there's, like, this weird disconnect where, like, I think of myself as the guy who's, who's been making videos for the last three years, you know?

103
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And, like, anything before that feels like a different person to me.

104
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But that's not at all the case, like, so much of how I act now, and so much of all of this was informed by, you know, how I was in my teenage years.

105
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And so I think, I feel like this story has to be told before it's too late, you know, before I can't remember it in enough detail.

106
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And maybe the fact that I have forgotten details will help to streamline this story to be consumable in podcast form.

107
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I thought about making this its own podcast on After Dark, but, like, because I don't want to do this in video form, it would be too weird.

108
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I have an easier time talking about things I'm less comfortable with if there's no video, because I don't want to have to see myself saying it, or, like, you know, worry about where I'm going to cut audio and stuff like that.

109
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Not as in cut for content, but, like, just edit out silences, because I have to think about what I'm going to say, because I can, like, remember everything.

110
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And I don't really have anything else to talk about this week. I've been playing Pokemon nonstop for two days.

111
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I will probably continue to play Pokemon nonstop for more days until the end of the period where this podcast would be slated to come out.

112
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So anyways, this is just going to be a depression story.

113
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And if that sounds like it'll make you sad, then don't listen to it.

114
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Like, for me personally, when other people talk about depressing shit, it usually, like, doesn't...

115
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I guess back when I was a teenager I did find that kind of stuff comforting.

116
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Like, I did enjoy listening to other people talk about, like, their problems and their depression, because it made me feel like, you know, like I could relate to it.

117
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Nowadays, I just get sad, because I'm not sad normally.

118
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But anyways, yeah.

119
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So, we'll start from when I was a little kid.

120
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And I think as a kid, I don't think I could have been, like, what you would consider, because to me, depression is, like, a long-term feeling of unease and displeasure with your life.

121
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's where, like, for a huge amount of time, you feel like things aren't going your way and you just want to fucking die.

122
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's how I think of depression.

123
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And some people have, like, in and out of it. They'll be like, you know, oh, I felt really depressed for, like, a week, and then I was back to normal.

124
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I guess I still have times like that where I can get depressed for, like, a day or two.

125
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I guess you'd still call that being depressed in a more general sense.

126
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But I'm talking about depression more in, like, a clinical sense.

127
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Like, seven straight years of feeling like dog shit and wanting to die.

128
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You know, like, that's my experience with depression.

129
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And so, as a kid, like, it's hard to think of it as depression, because when you're a kid, you kind of just flip emotions constantly.

130
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Like, you know, it's just however you feel in that moment is how you feel.

131
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There's less of this, like, broader personal context, I feel like.

132
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Like, when I think back to me being a little kid, there would be days where I felt absolutely terrible.

133
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But then I'd wake up the next day and I wouldn't even remember the fact that I felt bad the day before.

134
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You know, I'd just wake up the next day and whatever happens happens.

135
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There was no sense of continuity between emotions.

136
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So there was a lot of stuff that would make me upset as a kid, because growing up, my family moved constantly.

137
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And I looked weird.

138
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You know, I had big ol' glasses and I looked like a girl.

139
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I had long hair and I was extremely effeminate.

140
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Anybody who's seen that video on After Dark where I said proof that I was a lolly shota.

141
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, I look like a fucking girl.

142
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like, there's no two ways about it.

143
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I didn't understand that at the time.

144
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Like, I was just mad that other people thought that.

145
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But I didn't, like, actually think of myself as looking like a girl until, like, later.

146
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So, you know, when I was young, I never made any friends.

147
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Like, it wasn't so much that I got picked on until, like, a bit later.

148
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Like, when I was, like, a little kid, it's just nobody would talk to me.

149
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And I didn't understand how to talk to people because I never talked to anybody.

150
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We'd moved fucking constantly.

151
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I never made any friends, you know?

152
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Like, I remember, I'm sure I went to more than one kindergarten.

153
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm sure I went to more than one first grade.

154
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I did stay in the same second grade the whole year I was there.

155
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The first time my parents ever, like, settled down for more than a year in a place was in this cul-de-sac.

156
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We moved into when I was in the first grade.

157
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And me and my friends were sort of the outcasts among the cul-de-sac.

158
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You know, Ed, Ed, and Nettie, we were Ed, Ed, and Nettie.

159
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And everyone else fit the archetypes the same way that the characters in that show do.

160
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Like, that show was like the story of my life when I was a kid.

161
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It was super relatable to me.

162
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
With the only exception being that in Ed and Nettie, particularly for Eddie,

163
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
you feel like he kind of deserves what's coming to him and the other two wouldn't really be as hated

164
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
if not for the fact that they hang out with Eddie.

165
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I kind of saw as it's just victims, you know, when I was a kid.

166
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Like, I just didn't understand why anybody, like, it was so hard to communicate with people, you know?

167
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And I mean, we knew all the kids in the cul-de-sac.

168
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We hung out with them, you know, I hung out with all these people,

169
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
but I never felt like they liked me or understood me or, like, wanted to be friends with me with a couple of exceptions.

170
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Just a couple of kids who were my friends.

171
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And so I made a couple of close friends in second grade.

172
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But then what really started me, like, feeling depression, like, understanding it, to some extent,

173
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
was when I was in third grade because I got put into this advanced placement school.

174
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's like a whole, it's called School for Gifted Children, ODC, no, that's the university, ODC.

175
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And it was a, it was just like a separate school for smarter kids.

176
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But it was this huge long bus ride away.

177
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And, like, so at this point, even though, you know, my family up to this point is we move all the time.

178
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I lose contact with everybody I ever knew every time we moved.

179
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This time, I just changed schools, but that still means I'm not seeing any of my friends.

180
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Like, the friends who live around me who I went to school with are suddenly not around me, you know?

181
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And so, uh, so yeah, I went to this, this gifted school.

182
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And first of all, I shouldn't have, because even though I was, like, really excelling,

183
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
like, in the second grade, I was making, like, straight A's, you know?

184
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So they all thought, well, this kid's like a genius, you know?

185
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But then at this other school, it was, like, constant pressure to do, like, mountains of work.

186
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You know, it was, it's not that you necessarily have to be smarter to do the work,

187
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
it's that they give you more work.

188
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And I was not up for more work.

189
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And so, my grades started falling a little bit.

190
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And this is the kind of school where, like, if you're making C's or below, you're going back to normal school.

191
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You know, like, it's not, it's not about just passing.

192
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's like you have to be excelling, because that's the point of this, of this school.

193
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And I was not excelling.

194
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And, you know, my mom was pretty harsh about grades.

195
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Like, she was always, like, guilt-tripping me and stuff about the fact that I wasn't, you know, making good enough grades.

196
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
She'd sit, sometimes she'd be like, you know, sit in the kitchen and don't leave until you do your homework.

197
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And I just would, like, sit there and just, like, stare at it and not do it.

198
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I'd just sit there for, like, hours and just stare at my homework.

199
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And, um...

200
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah, so I felt bad about the fact that I wasn't doing great in school.

201
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And then I was also getting more picked on, because this was at a time when Pokémon had come and gone as a big fad.

202
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's, like, 98 or so...

203
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No, 90? Hmm.

204
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If I'm in third grade, then it's either 99 or 2000.

205
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Pokémon is kind of waned as a fad.

206
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And I'm still wearing Pokémon shirts and stuff to school, because I care about it.

207
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You know, I've always been someone who cares very deeply about whatever I'm into.

208
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And people would make fun of me for wearing Pokémon shirts.

209
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
They'd make fun of me for having long hair. They'd make fun of me for wearing glasses.

210
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You know, it never, like, escalated into full-on bullying.

211
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Like, the worst that would ever happen to me is that, like, someone might take my jacket and, like, pass it back and forth amongst a couple of kids, you know,

212
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and I'd be, like, trying to get it back. And that only happened once or twice.

213
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So, like, there wasn't a lot of physical bullying.

214
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It was mostly just people making fun of me, mostly for looking like a girl and liking Pokémon and, you know, all that good stuff.

215
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And I didn't know any of these kids. I didn't know how to talk to them.

216
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I didn't know how to clear up the issue.

217
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So I didn't make a lot of friends.

218
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And I remember that there was one day...

219
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I probably had gotten, like, a report card with a C on it or something.

220
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Or it was either that or I'd been made fun of that day in class, but I was just so fed up.

221
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And I went up, and this story is hilarious and depressing at the same time.

222
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If you listen to a lot of my stuff, you've heard me tell it before, that I went up to my brother's shades room,

223
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and there was this line, like, basically a string of clothespins that went all the way up the wall that had beanie babies.

224
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Like, it's like a type of clothespin that's, like, made to hold beanie babies.

225
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And there's, like, this huge display of beanie babies my mom had set up in my brother's shades room.

226
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Shade was, like, probably three, no, two or three at the time.

227
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So I go into shades room and I'm, like, crying.

228
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Then I sit down and I'm, like, I'm gonna kill myself.

229
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So I take a clothespin and I put one clothespin over my nose and one clothespin over my lips

230
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
with the hope that I can suffocate myself.

231
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This obviously will not work.

232
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Not even so much because I started gasping for air,

233
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
but because the clothespins hurt to have on my face.

234
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And I've never been able to tolerate pain,

235
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
which is good, because that's what's kept me from self-harm over all these years,

236
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
is my incredibly low threshold for pain.

237
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Someone there?

238
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Thought I heard somebody.

239
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Thought I heard somebody.

240
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So, but, you know, even if that was

241
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
a hilariously unsuccessful attempt,

242
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I would still catalog that as a suicide attempt.

243
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Because people who

244
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
have a history of attempting to commit suicide are far more likely

245
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
to commit suicide. Like, if you've thought about it, if you've tried to do it,

246
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
there's a chance that you're gonna keep trying to do it, or keep thinking

247
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
about it, you know?

248
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And so that was kind of, I mean, I didn't know that at the time, but that's always been kind of a specter

249
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
hanging over me when I've been suicidal. It's like, you know, I kind of fit the

250
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
profile of someone who would do it.

251
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But again, I can't really think of that as depression, because

252
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm sure the next day after that, I woke up

253
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and went about my day, and it was probably not that bad,

254
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
you know? Like, I think me being upset and sad back then

255
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
was more reactive. It's like I had a bad day, and therefore I

256
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
felt depressed. There was less of that hanging bloom.

257
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And then when I started fourth grade at that school, that was just utterly miserable

258
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
because our teacher was like a way overblown hard ass.

259
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
From what I understand, she was fired shortly after the

260
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
year, because I left. Like halfway through fourth grade, I left that gifted

261
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
school because I just couldn't keep up. It was too much. And I was

262
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
like the third person in the class to leave, and there were like three more people who left

263
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
after me. And then that teacher, I heard she got

264
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
a hand. Just from like sheer amount of complaints

265
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
she was getting about what she does. Don't know how

266
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
that works. I don't know why she didn't have tenure or something, but I don't know.

267
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So I go back to normal

268
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
school. And now again, I'm in fourth grade, but I don't know anybody.

269
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm back to the school I was at before, but I don't know anybody. Everything's

270
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
progressed past me. I don't know all these people and what they're up to. I'm still getting

271
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
fun of, because now there's like the skater culture

272
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
thing, like Tony Hawk's pro skater, Bam Margera era starting to come

273
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
in, and there's all these skater kids who are like the cool kids, and I'm

274
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
still sitting here with fucking Pokemon. And everyone's like

275
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
what the fuck is, what's up with you? Because I never understood trends.

276
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I never understood, I never

277
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
observe people. I'm not someone who understands what other

278
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
people are thinking easily or like tries to

279
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
look out for what everyone else is doing. I was always just doing what I

280
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
wanted to do, and I didn't understand why that was a

281
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
bad thing. I never understood what I was supposed to be doing.

282
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And then finally, so

283
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
fifth grade rolls around, I was in a class with some of my friends again.

284
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Eventually we finally move. We moved to Florida. That fucking

285
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
blue ass. But I don't think I was depressed.

286
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And that's where I started doing creative things more.

287
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Moved a few more times. I went through middle school.

288
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But it wasn't really until I was 14, and it was sort of

289
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
in between middle school and high school that the depression

290
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
really began. And it was because

291
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
not only at school did I not really have any friends

292
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and I wasn't really doing anything. But I was starting to become a teenager.

293
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So I was starting to become more hormonal and starting to

294
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
understand the world around me a little bit more in a bad way.

295
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Suddenly it's come into full focus that I'm the

296
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
weirdo. I think growing up

297
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
up until that point I had always thought everyone else is weird for thinking

298
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
that I look like a girl or that I act this or that way. Then

299
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
suddenly I realized, no, I'm the weirdo. I'm the one nobody understands.

300
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm the one who's the freak here.

301
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That suddenly became very apparent to me in the 8th grade.

302
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It was like, oh, I'm the odd man out. I'm the one who doesn't know

303
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
what's going on. And that

304
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
kind of hit me hard. And I just like

305
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I never made real friends. I would just kind of

306
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
hang out with kids who I could joke around with and

307
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
at the lunch table. But none of them really liked me. There was a couple kids I would hang out with

308
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
at my house. But even then I never felt like we were close.

309
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's just like someone to do things with. That's kind of what friends were to me.

310
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Someone who had enough of the same interests that you could sit in the same place

311
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and do the same thing together. But then you don't really care about them outside

312
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
of that. The only person I ever had who was a real close friend

313
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
was my cousin Boyd. He was four years older than me.

314
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And me and him got into anime together. And we like really

315
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
hung out all the time when I was in like the 6th and 7th grade.

316
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But then he moved away to Pennsylvania and I didn't see him for like

317
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
a few years. So during the period where I then got depressed.

318
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So like, yeah, I didn't have any real good connections. And

319
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
my parents started fighting. And there was like a...

320
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Not so much like violent fighting as just, there was like a lot of

321
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
it looked like they were going to split up. Like it looked like my parents were going

322
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
to divorce. You know, things were getting

323
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
like, heck, there was a point where like a brief period where

324
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
my dad just like stayed in a hotel for a few days.

325
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You know, like to not be in the same house kind of thing.

326
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So that was like really traumatic. Cause me and my brothers

327
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
all thought like, this is it. It's going to, they're going to fucking split up.

328
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You know, and my parents up through this point, you know, they used

329
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
to, they used to, my parents don't fight anymore. Like these days they're just

330
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
like a fucking docile old couple essentially.

331
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
They used to fight. And we'd always be like

332
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
this is it. It's finally happening, you know.

333
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So yeah, I was 14. I was the weird kid

334
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
in school. My parents seemed like they were going to split up. And this is really where

335
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
it just, this is where I would begin like chapter depression,

336
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
you know. And I got really,

337
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I was really into online communities at the time. And I spent a lot of time

338
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
on these message boards. And I know there was, there was

339
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
some poster who will say it was female

340
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
for the sake of the story. I have no idea for real.

341
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But I was like in love with this person. So

342
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I was always on these message boards and like, you know, trying to seek out

343
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
relationships online. Like I was starting to become aware of the idea of

344
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
relationships online and friendships online. But even online I was a fucking

345
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
weirdo. Like no one understood me. And I always, I had a very

346
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
crass sense of humor, a very confrontational attitude. I

347
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
cared way too much about the things that I like and was like ready to fucking

348
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
write tooth and nail about anything I liked. You know, you're wrong

349
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
for disagreeing with me kind of attitude. I mean, if you think I come

350
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
off that way in my videos now, you have no fucking idea how toned down it is.

351
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Like I was a, I was a fucking brat in my teens online.

352
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And you know, most of the people on internet message boards are older.

353
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
They're in their later teens or their early 20s. That's like the main age range of people

354
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
on message boards. And those people were not having it, you know,

355
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
because I was a fucking bratty kid and I don't blame anyone for that.

356
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But you know, that's why I was even online. I felt like an outcast

357
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and I was depressed. So where

358
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
it all really spiraled down was my dad

359
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
who had been working in the car business for a long time. And he was

360
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
my dad's an amazingly hard worker. He had, I mean,

361
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
my parents both came from really like pretty much nothing.

362
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You know, my dad in high school had to like steal to

363
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
eat and stuff. Like he was deathly skinny. He joined the Navy

364
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
when he was 18, dropped out of high school, joined the Navy and like just so he could

365
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
eat essentially. He said like, you know, they would give me free food if I joined. So that's why I joined.

366
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And my mom had run away from home at like 16.

367
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So they're both from, you know, like really low class

368
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
sort of environment. And my, like they had worked just normal

369
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
kind of jobs, but they're both really hard workers and they both would always, you know,

370
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
get to management positions quick and stuff like that. And

371
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
my dad joined the car business and

372
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
was immediately the best salesman like every month. He would always win

373
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
salesman of the month. You know, he'd always move up the ranks through the car industry.

374
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So he'd been fairly successful at that. So we've been living, you know, the

375
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
middle class suburban life for a long time. Well

376
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
my dad was going through all this like spiritual shit. He was becoming like

377
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
a Christian and constantly reading spiritual texts

378
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and stuff and just generally felt that the car business

379
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
was not in line with his like current, you know, state of mind and

380
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
lifestyle. And my parents were trying to make up after all this fighting

381
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
they've been doing and we were like, let's move again. And we moved into downtown

382
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Richmond and we moved into this old ass house. It was like a

383
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
house built in like the early

384
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
1900s or something like that. And it was

385
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
huge and it was really cool, but it was like kind of, you know,

386
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
falling apart. But because it was so old and so falling apart,

387
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
it was really dirt cheap. So we got to get a huge house for dirt cheap. And my dad

388
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
became an apprentice electrician. So his wage,

389
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
you know, plummeted from what it used to be.

390
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And we lived in this house from like September

391
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
through February, I want to say. 2004 to

392
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
2005.

393
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
No, 2005 to 2006. From September to February.

394
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Something like that. It was six months that we lived there.

395
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And those six months were grueling.

396
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That was by far the worst period of my life. And I've often

397
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
said of that period that I think I might have legitimately gone insane.

398
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Like I was losing my fucking mind. Because we moved into this

399
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
big old house and we were in the middle of

400
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
like the ghetto. We were in the ghetto

401
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
in like downtown Richmond. Me, Victor and Shade, we all,

402
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I was in high school. Victor was in middle school. Shade was in elementary school. We went to

403
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
like all black schools. Like there was no white

404
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
kids there at all. Like maybe, I would see like five or six white kids in the whole

405
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
school. Mostly black and Latino and stuff.

406
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And it was really hard to make any friends that way.

407
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Because I mean, I've been an outsider among white people. You know, the school

408
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I was going to before that was all white people. And I still felt like an outsider.

409
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Now I'm the only fucking white kid and

410
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm a fucking weird white kid. You know, so I was not able to

411
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
make any friends at this school. No one would talk to me. No one

412
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
wanted anything to do with me. I totally just looked like an outsider to their culture

413
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and everything. It was like this kid knows nothing about what's going on

414
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
here, you know. So I felt totally

415
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
alone at this school. And

416
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I had, you know, at this point I had

417
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
super long hair and I was growing in like this shitty ragged facial hair.

418
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Kids would always call me Joe Dirt and

419
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I started wearing sweatpants all the time. No fashion

420
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
sense. I looked like total shit, you know, and nobody wanted to talk to me.

421
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
This is at the period where I'm starting to like, you know, really like

422
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
want a girlfriend and stuff like that. That's not happening,

423
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
obviously. And at home

424
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I just felt like I couldn't talk to anybody. Like no one else

425
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
understood what I was going through, you know. My parents have always been hard to

426
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
talk to about anything emotional because they just don't seem to get it

427
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
or they don't get where you're coming from. Like their mindset is kind of like

428
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
how could you possibly not be happy when you've got so much,

429
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
you know. Not that that would have been the case at this time, but like

430
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I didn't see a lot. Jesus Christ, the fucking wind is like

431
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
rattling my house. I didn't see my family as much

432
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
as I had before, you know. And Victor just

433
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
kind of holed up in his room and played a lot of GameCube and

434
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
part of it was that like in the previous

435
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
house I'd been really into video games. Like I'd gotten

436
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
huge into gaming and like particularly

437
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
RPGs. And I'd buy tons and tons of RPGs with all the allowance money

438
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I could get. So like probably 20 to 25 dollars a week I'd get. And I'd

439
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
go out and buy all these used games at GameStop.

440
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So I had a decently sizable collection of PS2 RPGs that I had recently

441
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
accrued. Then my PS2 broke. Like right when we moved.

442
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So gaming out the window. Cause all the new

443
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
games I had or was excited about were all PS2 games. Now I don't have a

444
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
PS2 and we can't afford to buy a new one. You know, the GameCube was still there

445
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
which we had had all these games from like 2001 till then.

446
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But Victor had that and so I just wasn't playing a lot of games

447
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and I didn't have any money to buy anything. There was no passion which I could

448
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
support here. Now I remember that it took a month

449
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
for the internet to get hooked up in this house. Like we moved

450
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
in and it was a whole month without internet so I couldn't go onto these message boards

451
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
where I'd been like living. I couldn't

452
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
do anything really. I had my

453
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
own computer but it didn't have internet access. So all I used it for was like

454
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
writing poems and listening to whatever music I had on there.

455
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And that month just kind of broke me. It's like I had no one to

456
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
talk to. No one online. No one at school. Like

457
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
if I hadn't had Victor and Shade around I probably would have just utterly

458
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
lost it. Like if there had been literally no one to ever talk to I don't

459
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I think I would have fucking gone completely insane. But I would just like lay around

460
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and cry essentially. I would just lay on my bed

461
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
despondent for days.

462
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
This is where I started keeping a knife under my mattress

463
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
just in case the day finally came that I could kill myself.

464
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'd be ready.

465
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And again I was super guarded about all of it. I wouldn't talk to anybody about the

466
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
idea that I was feeling bad. Anyone I was in front of they didn't get to know about

467
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
this. The internet finally did

468
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
get hooked up in this house. So I was on the message boards again. But the internet

469
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
was like the most painfully slow. Like you click

470
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
on something and it takes like up to five minutes to load a page.

471
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So I'm on message boards like

472
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
refreshing the page and then like waiting five minutes for it to refresh and then

473
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
refreshing again until someone says something and then I immediately reply

474
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
you know and then wait all day to see if the response will come.

475
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That was my life. Sitting on a message board waiting for people to

476
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
say something so that I can respond and then waiting more.

477
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And then loading the page and loading the page and

478
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
if I remember correctly

479
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I guess I had taken the speakers from my mom's

480
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
computer because she wasn't really using them and I had those in my room because my computer had a bunch of music

481
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
on it. Obviously music streaming was not a thing yet but I had

482
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
a bunch of music downloaded to my computer from my cousin having put it there

483
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
or ripped CDs I'd put on there. So

484
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
the only internet, the only computer that had internet was in my mom's office and so I would sit

485
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
in her office in silence all day reloading this fucking page

486
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
waiting for anything. I started

487
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
questioning my sexuality a lot. I definitely

488
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
thought I was bisexual for a while. For a little while I thought I might be gay.

489
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I had like a very brief internet relationship

490
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
with a guy which turned out super weird and I bailed on.

491
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And anytime I was always trying to seek out you know internet relationships. Basically

492
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
anyone who would pay enough attention to me to talk to me I would try to

493
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
establish a relationship with. And there was a couple people who did who in retrospect

494
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I realized were like utterly broken people.

495
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
People with way way way worse you know stuff

496
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
going on than I have. So

497
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
you know I mean I guess I was pretty broken at the time too. So like it was me

498
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
like trying to enter like little relationships with other horribly

499
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
broken people. And then it would always get weird for me at some point

500
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
like when it started to feel real that's when it would feel weird to me

501
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and I would break it off in the most like ass whole way

502
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
possible. Like I'd always say something like you know

503
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
you know I just I was just using you

504
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
for my own fucking gain or something and like you know I actually

505
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
don't care about you or anyone and I'm just I hate the world. You know like that's the kind

506
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
of I would just totally break off communication with people

507
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and do it in the most dick hole way that I could think of.

508
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So

509
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I lived in that house for six months and I think everybody was pretty fucking depressed and upset.

510
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I don't think anybody liked being there. My dad finally

511
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
took back up he got back into the car business

512
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
because I mean this had been the second time that he had left the car business only for

513
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
everything to go to shit because when we moved to Florida a few years prior that was the same

514
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
story. He'd left the car business we went to live with my aunt

515
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
for like three months. Then like it was such a nightmare that

516
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
they like fully paid our trip back home to rehire my dad

517
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
at a higher position because they wanted him so badly

518
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and it just was like utter misery but again I wasn't really depressed yet at the time.

519
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
This is more like outright depression. So finally

520
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
we moved back to Virginia Beach which is the city I live in now. I've lived here a lot

521
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
like a lot of those houses were in Virginia Beach

522
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
so we moved to Virginia Beach and like a little house

523
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I started going to this high school in the ninth grade where I ended up going

524
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
for the rest of high school.

525
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But at this point again

526
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
like you know I'm a new kid again

527
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
still not making any friends still kind of like just a weird

528
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
guy. Now I'm depressed now I don't know what the fuck to do

529
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
with myself. So

530
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I started collecting music but no one

531
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
to talk to about it. No one understood my fucking

532
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
taste in music. No one understood what I was going through and it just

533
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
fucking sucked and I was miserable all the time and I hated living

534
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
the end.

535
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Eventually as high school went on

536
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I started making friends slowly but surely

537
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I started accruing a little stable of friends who would come over

538
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
all the time and hang out and you know that made things a little better.

539
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And then really like for a little while what had kind of saved me

540
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
was getting back into anime because you know I'd been really into anime

541
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
in 2003 and then I kind of you know got into other stuff

542
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
video games and music and then in 07 at like the very beginning of the year

543
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I got into anime in a much bigger way thanks to the megatocchio forums

544
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and that's when I started my blog and like

545
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
watching anime and blogging made me really happy like that was the one

546
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
thing I had going on that made me super duper happy and

547
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
made it like way easier to deal with life. But I was still

548
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
constantly bouncing between like utter terror

549
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
especially because this was now at the time where you know I'm in high school and everyone's talking about

550
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
what are you gonna do in your future and like for me it was

551
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
always the debate of am I going to take school seriously and go all out

552
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
or am I going to leave because I sort of looked at it as an all

553
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
or nothing it's like either you're going to stick around in school and really

554
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
excel and make great grades and you know and go to a good college

555
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
or because if you don't if you don't go to a good college is no point

556
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
so you might as well just drop out and go do whatever the fuck you want.

557
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And this was like you know I was a God

558
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
finishing up 10th grade and I was about to go into 11th when all

559
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
this is happening when I'm getting into anime and all that again

560
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
still kind of depressed and then like

561
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I was just like constantly bouncing between like being paranoid

562
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
or just stressed out or not wanting to talk to people or just not feeling

563
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
comfortable in my own body you know.

564
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I got really interested in like all kinds of like

565
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
BTQ stuff like I was super obsessed with that in my late teens like

566
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
just I guess I identified with that sense of like

567
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
not being sure if you are who you're supposed to be

568
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
you know like for a while

569
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I thought that like maybe I'm

570
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
supposed to be a woman you know but I never like took it very far

571
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
in the way that people do now I think because the culture embraces it so much

572
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
that there's places like Tumblr where people are like you know you can

573
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
easily meet people who are doing stuff like that that it's so much more of like a thing

574
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
people like jump headlong into in their teens whereas for me

575
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
it was kind of like an interesting question that like every once

576
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
in a blue moon I'd hear something about

577
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
you know about like gender fluidity or something like that

578
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and well I guess that term probably didn't even exist yet just people changing

579
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
genders and stuff and I was like whoa and I'd be like super fascinated with it

580
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
became super obsessed with Yuri

581
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and lesbians and like that was all I cared about for a long time

582
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
was Yuri and

583
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
then like

584
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
so I remember over that summer I watched Minabi

585
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Straight and utterly broke down because at the end of that show

586
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
it's about like the main characters graduate high school and they all sort of go their separate ways

587
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and you see them all like one girl goes to America to continue her studies

588
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
one like goes into sports they go into

589
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
all this different stuff and Minabi herself she just

590
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
becomes a freeder as they call it where she just goes

591
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
between different part-time jobs and like doesn't stay to one place and everyone was kind of like shocked

592
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
by it but she was like yeah you know like she's free-spirited she'll be happy

593
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
wherever she goes and that just like totally broke me

594
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
because I was like fuck you know and I was trying to like

595
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
do the academic route like I was setting myself up that I was gonna do like advanced placement

596
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
English and I was gonna go to like our school had this program called ATC

597
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
where you go to like a technical school and like a

598
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
they bust you back and forth to learn more technical stuff and I was gonna try to do that

599
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
you know I was like ready to try to do this fast track thing and then I watch Minabi

600
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and I see her like yeah you know I can be happy wherever I go and I was just like

601
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
like utterly mind broken like trying to

602
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
decide you know am I going to become a school guy or

603
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
am I gonna like like look at Minabi she could have fucking done anything

604
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
and been happy about it why can't I just go do anything

605
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
you know I became really obsessed with the idea of becoming a film director

606
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
and so 11th grade started

607
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and I sort of got fucked

608
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
in regard because basically there was a miscommunication between

609
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
me and my guidance counselor and I ended up not being able to go to

610
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
ATC I did get the advanced placement English class but that's the only

611
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
advanced thing I had so I was no longer on this like you know like

612
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
excellent track to success and the technical courses that would have given

613
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
me the kind of knowledge that would have like allowed me to fucking do

614
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
things you know totally out the window

615
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
advanced placement English fucking sucked I hated my teacher I hated the whole style of

616
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
the class you know I love literary analysis

617
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
obviously it's what I do you know and at the time

618
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I was like I was always happy to write analytically it's that the teacher

619
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
wanted you to read everything a certain way you know she was she

620
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
she had her idea of what the story means and you had to kind of bring

621
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
that out it was fucking horrible

622
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I hated it and it was way too much work and so I became

623
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
the most depressed ever and you know I'd met my

624
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
friend Don Son and like we bonded over mutual

625
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
love of welcome to the NHK because that for me was the most relatable thing in the world

626
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and I remember I would just sit in my room like paranoid

627
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
and not leave and I just talked to him about how

628
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
paranoid I was you know and he was also he was a hikikomori like a full blown one

629
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
like not even leaving his room for like years

630
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
because he had a he had a condition that kept him out of school so he would just like be

631
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
in his room all day every day and not leave and we kind of bonded over that

632
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
but you know that's that's where I was going and there was like

633
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
times where I would get so paranoid about my grades because my grades were slipping

634
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and I didn't want my parents to know so like I'd get like a report card or a

635
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
progress report and I'd just like lock myself in my room all day

636
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and like I would be I was I never actually did

637
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
reach this point because I'm squeamish about doing so

638
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
but like I would take bottles and be like I'm gonna piss in this bottle instead of going downstairs

639
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
to use the bathroom because I don't want my parents to see me you know

640
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
never ended up doing that I just hold it all day I'd like I would hold in peeing

641
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
for hours like waiting till I thought everyone might be

642
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
asleep or that no one would hear me come down the stairs and ask about my progress report

643
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
you know like I was so fucking paranoid

644
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and just yeah I didn't want to see anybody I didn't want to talk to anybody

645
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I just wanted to hold up in my room and watch anime and write my blog and post about

646
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
shit you know and I mean you can read a lot of a lot of my writing from this

647
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
era is on my blog and a lot of it's just like well there's a lot of posts

648
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I set to private because they were just like a like nonsense of nothing to do

649
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
with the blog but like a lot of it would just be me telling stories about

650
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
how fucking sad I am you know I wrote about Manabi

651
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
straight in my reaction to it years back and I wrote about

652
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Evangelion and how that was like a huge connector for me

653
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
when I was 14 when I first got depressed

654
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
like someone had loaned me the show and I watched all of it like just before my

655
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
15th birthday that blew my fucking mind because I related to Shinji so perfectly

656
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
everything about him was exactly how I felt

657
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
but so yeah

658
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
you know I'm just wandering through this life of being depressed and fucking

659
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
like it was never worse than 11th grade like that early part of 11th grade

660
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
when I was in advanced English and stuff and like just being overwhelmed by work and stress

661
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I just I wanted to kill myself

662
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
badly and like I would have these

663
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
nights where I just lay in bed thinking about

664
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
like how I'm either going to run away the next day like I'd extensively plan out

665
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
how am I gonna run away where am I gonna go how am I gonna live off the land

666
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
you know and just like escape from life

667
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
or how am I gonna kill myself how can I do it

668
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
where it won't hurt or where like how can I get the materials how can I

669
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
you know but then I worry about like what are my parents you know how's it gonna affect them

670
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
like I don't want to devastate my mom you know like my mom

671
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
would fucking not be able to handle one of her kids killing themselves she would have

672
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
completely broke like she would have she would have lost

673
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
her mind if one of us killed ourselves because she cares way too much

674
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
about us you know um so yeah like

675
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
that that was a huge like factor preventing me

676
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
but then I would just think well what if I just hurt myself like if I hurt myself

677
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
sadly enough people have to notice because that's the thing I wanted someone

678
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
to notice I wanted someone to notice that I was freaking out that I was

679
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
depressed and stressed out but I wouldn't tell anybody

680
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
you know I didn't have the courage to talk about it

681
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
but I just wanted someone to figure it out and like in my mind I thought

682
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
don't I look horrible don't I look depressed like I'm scowling

683
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
all the time aren't I don't I look sad but then any time I look at myself in the

684
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
mirror I'd realize I didn't look that way I just look normal like I don't

685
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
have an emotive face I don't really show what I'm thinking

686
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I have an amazing poker face if you will

687
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
you know I would literally think that I looked depressed and then see

688
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
myself in the mirror and realize I looked normal and I'm like this is why nobody's noticing

689
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
this is why nobody's noticing the cry for help that's only on the inside

690
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
you know the few times I had to deal with anything with my parents

691
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I would write them notes because I was you know I was confident in my writing

692
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
so I would just like write out these like multi-page notes and leave them on the table

693
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
before school like where I was like way more honest about what I was

694
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
thinking or what I was trying to do um there was one where I was like

695
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I want to drop out of school here's my plan you know I wrote out this whole thing

696
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
and my parents were just like what the fuck are you talking about you know uh no

697
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
so you know throughout 11th grade

698
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I determined I was going to drop out I was going to drop out and become a film director

699
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I was just going to start making movies um

700
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
yeah and I was really that was like where my head was at

701
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
and at this time I reconnected with my cousin Boyd and eventually

702
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
like around the time I was finishing up 11th grade and going into 12th

703
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
he moved in with me like into my room um

704
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
so I would say that that that gave me less like I had less

705
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
sit around and be paranoid and like fucking you know losing my mind

706
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and going crazy so uh I guess that helped

707
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
though I still was you know largely depressed and we never got

708
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
anything off the ground with regards to film um you know

709
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I was trying to I was trying to make movies that never worked I tried to write stories

710
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I have like just the other day I was going through all my notebooks of all the story concepts

711
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I had there's fucking like dozens and dozens of them

712
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
there's so many story ideas I tried to get off the ground that never amounted to anything

713
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
you know because for 10 years I thought I was going to be writing fiction

714
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
or uh or you know producing some kind of some kind of fictional

715
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
stories so I have tons and tons of stories that just never came to be anything

716
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
um I you know I was working on the

717
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
blog all along just because it made me happy I never thought there'd be a future in it

718
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I never thought that was something that would take off and like

719
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
there was a period where I thought well maybe I can do this professionally by writing for

720
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
a website um there was one time I submitted a review

721
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
to anime news network and they tore me to shreds

722
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
uh because of the fact that I like spoke in first person and that it was

723
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
like it was more personal than objective which I guess they tried to go for

724
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
so-called objective reviews um so I got rejected hard

725
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
uh not that I think that review was actually good but

726
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
you know um so for a long time I was kind of under the impression

727
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
like I'll never be able to get work for a website

728
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
because the way I write is too out there like I write about myself

729
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I write gonzo style posts and that's like I don't want to change

730
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
that like it wouldn't be fun anymore if I just wrote like articles

731
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
you know that that's not my style then it would just be a job

732
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
um

733
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I was 16 where I had this like sort of

734
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
phrase I came up with because I've never believed in any

735
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
kind of higher power I've never believed that there's really meaning to human life in the

736
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
universe I've always had that sort of nihilistic outlook

737
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I've never believed that there's anything more

738
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
to life than personal

739
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
personal happiness you know making your own life good

740
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
is world good but it's always going to be in small parts and like really part of

741
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
making the world good is making your own life good you know

742
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
um global happiness comes when everybody's happy and if you're not happy then

743
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
you're dragging down the global happiness you know

744
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
so to me making myself happy was the most important thing

745
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and I had determined when I was 16 that like if I'm not

746
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
happy there's no reason to be alive like what could possibly

747
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
make it worth it like like if there's no greater

748
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
cosmic purpose to my existence then why even be alive

749
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
if I'm not happy I just that was like the the great question

750
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
at the heart of it and so to me every second that I wasn't happy with

751
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
my life was just a countdown to suicide like you know

752
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
uh if the but the the thing that kept me going is that I've always been very

753
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
optimistic and very uh like yeah in spite of all

754
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
the depression and cynicism I've always been a hardcore optimist I always

755
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
think things are gonna go okay you know and like so

756
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
what kept me going is that like I always believed that I was gonna get

757
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
out of it I always believed like eventually this will all

758
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
end and I'll become like rich and famous you know because that's always been

759
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
my goal be rich and famous particularly rich uh

760
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
you know I want I want to have enough money that I can kind of do whatever

761
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I want with it and I want to be doing what I love I want to

762
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
be rich and famous from doing what I love and I always believed that was

763
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
gonna happen I always thought eventually I'm gonna write the story that

764
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
that breaks I'm gonna make a movie that breaks you know

765
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
something's gonna give something's gonna happen and I'm gonna succeed

766
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and I never stopped believing that which is why I wouldn't kill myself like

767
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
even when I desperately wanted to it was like but if I do then these ideas never

768
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
come out you know the success never comes if you if you give up

769
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
so just keep fucking bashing your head against the wall

770
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
until it breaks you know it's sort of always been my mentality

771
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
just why shows like girl in the gun resonate with me so much like it's about overcoming

772
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
what appears to be impossible no matter how long it takes

773
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
and how much effort so that's sort of what kept me

774
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
going and uh but yeah

775
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
again the cries for help like the worst

776
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
one I remember the scariest thing I did was

777
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
that like I wanted to somehow hurt or

778
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
or kill myself I didn't I just you know again I'm terrified of pain

779
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
and I just put my hand on my shoulder

780
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
like just like you know like grabbing like the back of my shoulder and I just

781
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
started scratching like just up and down scratching my back

782
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
and I probably had pretty long nails

783
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
and I just kept doing it for like 25 minutes

784
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
like just like thinking about how badly I hoped that eventually

785
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'd you know either bleed

786
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
or something or like it would cause something just anything anything that

787
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
would make this noticeable you know and I'm just scratching this back part of my shoulder

788
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
for like 20 minutes and then finally

789
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
look at my fingers and I see that there's all this

790
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
blood caked in under my nails and I freaked out

791
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
because that's the thing I want like even though

792
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
one part of me wants there to be pain the second I register that it's

793
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
there it's suddenly terrifying you know so I go running down

794
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
to the bathroom I look and I have all these fucking you know these four trails

795
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
of blood from where I've just scratched fucking all the skin off my shoulder

796
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
and I just freaked out and I didn't tell anybody I covered it you know it was

797
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
it was all within shirt range none of it was something that would show on my body

798
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
so you know my shoulder hurt for a day or so and then

799
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
it was gone but like it was fucking terrifying to think like

800
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
to realize like I've actually done something to myself I've actually

801
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
hurt myself you know

802
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
so yeah so that's kind of the general state of mind

803
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
for most of high school just

804
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
sitting around in my room hoping to die waiting for the day I get to die

805
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
you know or that something succeeds or that I break through

806
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
it had to be one or the other it's an all or nothing scenario either I

807
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
make something so good that the world loves me or

808
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I fucking end it all in squalor

809
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and

810
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
the decisions I made from then on from like high school

811
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
onwards were all about sort of prolonging the inevitable

812
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
because I really thought that if I got a normal

813
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
9-5 job and eventually gave up on

814
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
creativity that's when I'd die that's when it would finally kill me

815
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
if I was unable to live doing what made me happy then

816
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
that's what's finally gonna do me in so as high

817
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
school is ending my dad's like you have to either get a job or go to college

818
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
pick one and I pick college obviously and this is when I moved

819
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
like we moved into the house I live in now right when I was right after

820
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I graduated high school and I've lived here for 7 years so

821
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
going on 8 so long time

822
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
this is the house I've lived in by far the longest finally stopped moving around

823
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
like when I was in you know when I was in high school we moved once but it was

824
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
the same high school zone as was this house

825
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
but I was out of high school by then so

826
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
so I start college I start going to community college and I was for whatever

827
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
reason for years I was terrified of driving my mom wanted to start

828
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
college too so me and my mom went together we both went to an art college

829
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and you know she would drive me and we would go out

830
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
and you know spend most of the day there and come back and so yeah I went to college

831
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
with my mom hilariously enough

832
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and you know it didn't make it nothing was any

833
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
better there like I felt more okay I like college way

834
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
more than school like high school fucking blows high school is the worst experience of my life

835
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
college is fine it's just like

836
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I didn't want to do it you know that's the worst thing about it I don't think there's

837
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
anything wrong with it like I mean there's a lot wrong with it as an institution in

838
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
terms of the fact that it costs way too much fucking money and

839
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
it's way too inconsistent with how useful it actually is you know some professors

840
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
are worthless some are okay some classes will teach

841
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
you something and some classes will teach you absolutely nothing

842
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and there's no difference in how much those cost you know so like

843
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I don't advise college but in terms of like a place to go

844
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and do a thing it's not so bad it's not like high school

845
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
it's just a miserable draining fucking nightmare of an experience

846
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
it's fine I just didn't care

847
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I didn't want to do it and I had middling grades in all

848
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
my classes and I wasn't doing all that well now

849
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
as it went on like we did one semester

850
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
with me and my mom and then my dad

851
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
convinced me and my cousin boy who was still living in my room he convinced

852
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
us like that we should try to start studying business because my dad

853
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
has always kind of had this dream of opening a family business

854
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
but he only wanted to do it if we were all going to take it seriously

855
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
and he didn't think we would he was like you know you guys have not proven that you can actually work on

856
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
anything so he said if you guys could study business and learn

857
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
how to do it and like prove to me that you understand it then we could open up a

858
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
family business and we were like well that sounds promising business classes

859
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
you can take all of them online don't ever do this

860
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
never take all online classes unless you're really confident that you can

861
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
do all the work because I signed up for like

862
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
three or four business classes all online

863
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
um this is where everything broke down

864
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
this is where it finally broke me

865
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
because I have a guilt complex about not doing

866
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
well you know like I want my parents to think that all the money they've

867
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
poured into me and all the livelihood that I've stolen from them has not gone to waste

868
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
you know I want them to be proud of me and to think I'm doing well

869
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
but I didn't like school and I was not going to do it you know and

870
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
most of my days would consist of me sitting

871
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
around thinking about how badly I need to do this schoolwork

872
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
and I wouldn't do anything else because you know

873
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
there's something else and that's distracting you from the schoolwork

874
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
but I didn't want to do the schoolwork so I would just sit around depressed

875
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
and hate myself and hate my life and hate everything I'd gotten myself into

876
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
and um there was a brief period where I tried to

877
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
turn my business studying into anime blogging

878
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
if you go through my blog you can find posts I wrote about both

879
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Gorilla Gonnett's Serial Experiments Lane where I took chapters of the textbook

880
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
and like applied them to anime in order to

881
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
make it interesting for myself because I had realized while reading the textbook

882
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
that anime blogging and textbooks were actually fairly similar like you're

883
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
basically just describing facts about a thing

884
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
so like yeah I tried to do that didn't keep it up for very long

885
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I probably wrote like two posts and then

886
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
there's like a deadline for when you can cancel

887
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
classes and I knew well ahead of this deadline

888
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
that I should cancel but I was too afraid to admit it

889
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I didn't want to admit to my parents that

890
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
you know that I was going to drop out that I couldn't do it

891
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
that there was a waste of time and you know my parents kept asking me like every day

892
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
they'd ask like are you doing the work are you doing the online coursework and I'd always go

893
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
yeah like we'd be at dinner and just like mm-hmm yeah sure

894
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I'm in the eye and say it I think they knew I was fucking lying

895
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
because why else would they ask all the time you know

896
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I was just lying about it and then the day fucking passed

897
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
like the time passed and then I just felt

898
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
even worse because it's like well now I fucked them out of all the money

899
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
they could have got their money back before this date and because I'm too much of a fucking

900
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
coward to admit that I'm not doing the work now all that money's gone probably over

901
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
a thousand dollars is community college you know it's not it's not like I'm wasting

902
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
university dollars but which would have been absolutely

903
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
devastating but yeah I mean it was a waste of a huge

904
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
amount of money and I just I just wasn't doing it wasn't

905
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
doing the work and eventually I mean my mom

906
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
like your grades in these classes are on this online thing called

907
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
blackboard my mom has the password to my blackboard she can look at my grades

908
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
anytime she wants you know but I think my parents knew that I was

909
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
failing and they were trying to like get me to say it so it's one day

910
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
my mom starts asking me about my grades I'm like downstairs hanging out and she starts

911
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
asking and I'm just like avoiding the question she's like you know I

912
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
have your blackboard password and I just like retreat I just like ran I just

913
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
ran up to my room I closed the door I had a fucking panic

914
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
attack now if you've never had a panic attack it's

915
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
where your heart starts racing you start breathing heavily like

916
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
you're like you feel like you're like everything there's like lots of adrenaline

917
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and feeling like you're gonna pass out at the same time like you it's just like your

918
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
heart and body are out of rhythm with one another I was just freaking the

919
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
fuck out you know and I'm just like it's over

920
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
she knows she knows she's definitely seen my grades I don't know what the fuck I'm thinking

921
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I don't know what I'm trying to hide this was when I was like

922
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I need help because

923
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
like I've there's this line and welcome to the NHK

924
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
that resonates with me so strongly it's in the anime

925
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
when Satou there's like this other guy who's a Hikikomori

926
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
who they meet later into the show and the guy says at one point like

927
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
you know all those shelves are lined they're in his room he's got all these bookshelves

928
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
all those shelves are lined with self-help books I've read them all I could probably

929
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
write one myself and none of it's helped and that

930
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
was that was how I felt at the time I'd read everything about

931
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
how to get yourself out of depression how to how to be a positive thinker

932
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
how to you know stop worrying and love the world

933
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
kind of thing like I'd read all this shit and I too felt I could write one

934
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
you know but it wasn't helping none of it was helping

935
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
none of it was actually getting me out of this situation none of my

936
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
personal effort none of the effort I'd put in over the last six years

937
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
because I'm 20 at this point you know six years

938
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
maybe I'm maybe I'm 19 I'm 19 at this point

939
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
so five years of trying to get out of

940
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
it and it just wasn't happening nothing was getting me out of it

941
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
nothing was working and I was like

942
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
this has got to be clinical like there's just no way there's no way I'm getting

943
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
out of this I've tried everything I could I've looked up you know my dad

944
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
has always been had the kind of attitude that like you can just get through things

945
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
you know that's that's why it was impossible for me to talk about this with my dad because he saw

946
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
it as a personal strike you know well you just got to work

947
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
hard and you know you just got to pick yourself up

948
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
and I'm like yeah I've tried that you know I can't work hard because I'm

949
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
fucking depressed because I don't want to work I don't want to do anything you know

950
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
there's no making myself want to do these things

951
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I don't understand what you think I can do but that's not a thing I can do

952
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
so that's when I was like this must be fucking clinical

953
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
there's nothing I can do about this I've tried all that I can

954
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
and it's none of its work so let's seek help

955
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
so uh you know

956
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm like I've looked into a lot of this shit online

957
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I've been researching suicide this whole time and I'm constantly looking up stuff about suicide

958
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
stuff about depression you know I'm always trying to figure out what the fuck

959
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
is the issue or what I can do about it

960
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
so I found out that if you were to go to a hospital

961
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
and tell them I think I'm gonna kill myself then they'll like

962
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
they'll you know they'll put you in like a room and fucking look at you or whatever

963
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
uh and hold on to you until someone shows up to

964
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
and claim you or whatever so I was like alright

965
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
here's what I'm gonna do and this is what I did

966
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I wrote out a letter to my parents because again I can only really communicate through writing

967
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
at like 2 in the morning because my dad wakes up

968
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
at 4.30 am 2 in the morning I uh

969
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
write this letter extensively explaining like I'm depressed I've failed

970
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
those classes you're not getting that money back you know I'm

971
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life I'm never getting any better

972
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I've tried everything I know this stuff inside and out and nothing's

973
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
gonna happen unless I fucking get help uh you know

974
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I'm going to the hospital I've ridden my bike to the hospital

975
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
uh you know you can come find me and so

976
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I caught on my bike in the like frigid fucking

977
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
February air I was wearing a t-shirt so I didn't

978
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
want to grab a jacket and then once I was out the door I didn't want to go back inside

979
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
so I'm fucking freezing uh writing my bike

980
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
down the fucking like like you know miles up the road

981
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
to the hospital and I show up

982
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
and I sit in the waiting room and it just so happens that the way the waiting

983
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
room is laid out and because it was so late no one could see me

984
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
no one ever noticed I was in the hospital I sat in there for probably

985
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
an hour and a half to two hours uh with

986
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
like CSI playing and I was just holding and I

987
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I didn't have my own cell phone so I'd taken my mom's phone like I'd written the letter like

988
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
you know if you need to call me I have mom's phone um

989
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
so I had my mom's phone on me and I was just holding onto it sitting in the lobby

990
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
of this hospital for like hours no one noticed I was there

991
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
finally I get a call from my dad like are you still at the hospital and like

992
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm you know shaky voice like yeah he's like you know have they

993
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
seen you yet I'm like no he's like just stay there we're gonna come get you so they

994
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
show up huge teary eyed fucking dramatic

995
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
spectacle we go back home they finally set me up with an appointment

996
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
with a psychologist so all the psychologists for a

997
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
while honestly like it's funny

998
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
because for me the value of a psychologist

999
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
was simply that I could talk to someone who actually understood what the

1000
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
fuck I was talking about like I don't think I learned anything from him

1001
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I don't I don't think it was a process of like there was something I didn't know

1002
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
about myself that had to be unearthed you know there was no

1003
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
there was none of that and I also think he was you know

1004
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
he was milking me this this dude everything everything about the place I was

1005
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
at was kind of shady I think this dude kept me coming back for longer

1006
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
than necessary because it was paying you know

1007
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and but like just the fact that I could talk to somebody

1008
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
who actually knew where I was coming from who understood what depression is

1009
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
who understood these hangups I had and where my anxiety was coming from

1010
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
and why I felt that way that was enough to make it worth it to me

1011
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
you know that nobody else I could talk to would understand any of that shit

1012
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
and uh so I saw him for a while and then

1013
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
he got me to go to the psychiatrist and the psychiatrist prescribed me

1014
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
a medication called Wellbutrin now I do not recommend this

1015
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
medicine to anybody because even though it did work for me lots

1016
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
of people who've taken it have had utterly devastating effects

1017
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
my brother Victor who turned out was also depressed

1018
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
and he sort of came out about it around a year year and a half later

1019
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
um he kind of went through the same thing he was depressed for a super long

1020
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
time decided there was nothing he could do about it finally reached out

1021
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
for help you know partly inspired because I had done it starts taking medications

1022
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Victor went through like four medications and every single one of them made him worse

1023
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
and Wellbutrin was the one where he was the most

1024
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
suicidal he'd ever been cried all day he he said

1025
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
like the the the most heavy moment of his life is like he was sitting there

1026
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
crying and listening to the song sleep forever by Portugal the man

1027
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
and just thinking about suicide and my dad came in and saw him

1028
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
crying and just came over and just like you know held him as he

1029
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
wet that he was like that was the worst thing that's ever happened to me

1030
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
um the worst I've ever felt in any case

1031
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
and I yeah but for me I got

1032
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
prescribed this medication uh by a guy who was like

1033
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
obviously just pushing it like that dude the guy who actually prescribed me

1034
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
didn't know shit about me didn't know the first fucking thing about me

1035
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
and every time I'd walk in like for another appointment he would just write me up the

1036
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
fucking thing and send me on my way you know he'd like ask how's it going

1037
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
like how how's the medication treating you and I had a lot of concerns like

1038
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
for instance that it had this horrifying side effect that made me fucking blink

1039
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
constantly uh you know he'd just brush him off

1040
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
he'd be like oh well you know you'll get used to it

1041
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and stuff you know eventually it'll all start making sense

1042
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
that's the kind of attitude he had

1043
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
so yeah I started taking this medication

1044
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
and I went back to school I did

1045
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
one English class and then I did another semester

1046
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
of like um like general studies and shit

1047
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
and maybe another semester after that but eventually

1048
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I was like at some point

1049
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I got I got a D in psychology which I had thought of as a passing

1050
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
grade but then I found out that a D is too low for it to be a transferable credit

1051
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and I actually liked the class I liked psychology and that's when

1052
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I was like I can't do college there's no way I can do this if

1053
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I'm failing a class I like then this is not this is not for me

1054
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
you know but what about butron did

1055
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
um to me it was mostly an anxiety cure

1056
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
not so much that it cured depression that it cured anxiety because my

1057
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
biggest problem really was anxiety that I would get so hung up on like

1058
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
you know not doing my homework or that something bad was going to happen

1059
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
if I didn't do this or this or that I wasn't getting my life together like all those things made me anxious

1060
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
but well butron allowed me was to stop giving a fuck

1061
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
it was not that it allowed like made me work better you know it didn't

1062
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
make me actually do my schoolwork it made me stop being anxious

1063
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
about the fact that I wasn't doing my schoolwork so it didn't make me

1064
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
any more successful or better of a person it just made me someone

1065
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
who wasn't fucking anxious all the time you know who

1066
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
like instead of going oh my god I'm not doing my homework

1067
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I can't watch anime but if but I also don't want to do my homework so I'm not going to do anything

1068
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I would like I would just go watch anime instead of doing my homework

1069
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
so that's what it offered me

1070
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
so I dropped out of college and then I spent like a straight year and a half doing

1071
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
nothing you know

1072
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I got through the summer that summer I went out to

1073
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I went for a month to the Philippines and

1074
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
to see my friend ghost lightning anime blogger extraordinaire

1075
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and hung out with him for a month and like the hope was that was going to instill something

1076
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
that was going to become more worldly you know and I mean I feel like I did

1077
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
but the results were not what my dad was hoping for you know I did not

1078
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
come home and immediately get a job I came home and immediately

1079
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
like interviewed for a job working for one of

1080
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
the dealerships that for the BMW dealership that was under

1081
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
my dad's company and they said they would hire me and I never

1082
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
went back I just didn't want to do it I didn't want to work

1083
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and I spent a straight like then my mom that fall my mom got

1084
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
cancer and so I spent a lot of time like being the guy who would

1085
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
drive her to and from appointments and I kind of made that my excuse for not working

1086
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and then time just kept going on and I just kept not doing

1087
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
anything you know I mean my parents were bugging me about it they were stressed about it

1088
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
but you know they had their own shit to worry about I was just like

1089
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
not doing anything then finally

1090
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
it was when I found out about Egoraptor and John Tron

1091
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
and when Game Grumps started and they talked about how it was actually their job

1092
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
to make YouTube videos that like everything clicked and I was like I can do this

1093
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I can make YouTube videos like I have a clear well spoken voice

1094
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I understand like I write in this style already

1095
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I can make people care about this

1096
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and then I started the YouTube series Adventure Action

1097
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
RPG on Modal Soul Productions which is video games analysis

1098
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
that's what I thought I was going to be doing but the audio

1099
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
was garbage and so I thought well I need a microphone so I went and got

1100
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
a normal job at Target worked there for like four months

1101
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
bought a bunch of equipment left the job became

1102
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
my little pony analyst and achieved YouTube success

1103
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
and I haven't really been depressed since then I would say I stopped like

1104
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
again the well butrin really did cure my anxieties

1105
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
which were the main source of my depression and so even though I was

1106
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
still like upset with myself for the fact that I wasn't really doing anything and I was just living stagnantly

1107
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I was I never became that level of anxious and paranoid

1108
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
again and I eventually stopped taking the medication like

1109
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I hated the side effects and

1110
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
and I felt like well I'm already fucking I'm you know I'm not depressed anymore so fuck it

1111
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I stopped taking them and nothing you know I did not regress

1112
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I just stayed the same forever so I think whatever it

1113
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
was I think I think there was just a point when I was 14

1114
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
when we when when my parents were gonna split up and when

1115
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
you know we were moving into the ghetto and I was going through hormonal changes

1116
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I think that I just like had I think

1117
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
at some point there became a deficit in the amount

1118
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
of like whatever you know chemical keeps you happy

1119
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
there was a deficit in that and it never recovered

1120
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
like like you know let's say it's producing at a constant rate and therefore

1121
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
let's say it's like five right let's say you always have five

1122
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
of this this item in your head and you know

1123
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
every day you expend one and a new one comes up and then it feels like

1124
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I expended three all at once and so even though a new one kept

1125
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
coming up it was never bringing me back up to five

1126
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
and when I took the well butrin it brought me back up to

1127
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
five and and I've stayed that way that's how it feels to me

1128
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
like it was just a sudden dip and then a sudden

1129
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,000
rise and I've been fine since you know again

1130
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
not that I was like happy or anything I just wasn't depressed

1131
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
and and then once I started my job and

1132
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
became successful on YouTube now I've just been happy you know and I do have

1133
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
times where I get depressed but it's much more in that conventional typical

1134
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
every man yeah I felt depressed for a few days because

1135
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I wasn't happy with how things were going you know I haven't had a

1136
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
major catastrophic I want to fucking kill myself every day

1137
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
depression since then

1138
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
and you know right now part of the reason I wanted to talk about this

1139
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
is that my fucking friends are depressed

1140
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Ben's depressed because I don't know I don't want to get into his personal

1141
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
stuff but he's depressed right now

1142
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Hippocrates seems pretty depressed Jesse's depressed because he's like

1143
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
in heartache just everyone I know is depressed

1144
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and it sucks

1145
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
because I hate when my friends are depressed because I want everyone to

1146
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
be happy and I there's nothing I can do to change

1147
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
that like there's nothing I can do to help them because they already know why

1148
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,000
they're depressed and I can't make it not that way

1149
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and like you know the things that make me happy don't make everybody else happy

1150
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
because for me it's all about like the feelings

1151
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
of security and doing what I want to do

1152
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
those are the two things that make me happy feeling secure and doing whatever I want

1153
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
and both of those are facilitated by money like those are both basically

1154
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
just straight up monetary things so to me making a lot of money

1155
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
is happiness like they say money can't buy happiness I fully disagree

1156
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
to me happiness has like a concrete dollar value

1157
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
it's you know if I can make enough money by doing

1158
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
what I want to do then I'm happy and enough money in

1159
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
my definition is enough that I have

1160
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
savings that if anything goes wrong I'll be ready you know that I have

1161
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
money in savings so that if anything goes wrong

1162
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
it won't bankrupt me having no debt

1163
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
feeling like if I need to buy something I can just buy it

1164
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
you know like I wanted a thousand dollar laptop I bought one

1165
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
like because I wanted a laptop that wasn't gonna fucking fail on me like all my others

1166
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
did and I bought that and it wasn't a financially

1167
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
crippling thing to do so it was just something I could go do you know

1168
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
that to me is like the most valuable thing

1169
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
more so than the laptop itself the fact that I could buy it

1170
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
is the most valuable thing to me that's the feeling of security

1171
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
and if being able to do what I want and to be able to go out and eat everyday

1172
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
and always eat stuff that I like you know and to be able to

1173
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
you know just afford to have a decent lifestyle like that's

1174
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
what happiness is for me and I feel that like you know

1175
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
because all I really like to do is work and eat as I've said on this podcast before

1176
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
the only thing I really want to do is to work I love making videos

1177
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I love doing shit and the only time that I feel stressed about it is when I feel like I'm not

1178
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
getting out of the house enough and it's easy to go out and just

1179
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
eat a few times a day and there I feel like I've gotten out of the house and let's get back to

1180
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
work you know I've put out so far this month

1181
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
as of this recording I have put out 20 videos that I was in

1182
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
according to my playlist there's 20 videos have been released

1183
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
that I was a part of that's not including at least

1184
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
15 unreleased let's plays that I haven't edited yet

1185
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
you know commentary I filmed with DeVue that I haven't edited yet

1186
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
like a podcast

1187
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I recorded with Wave Motion Canon which may or may not be out by the time of this

1188
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
recording I don't know when it actually releases

1189
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
you know I've done it I do lots of work I'm always working and on top of that

1190
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I've watched a few complete shows I've played 24 hours of fucking

1191
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Pokemon Sun you know I've been

1192
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
working out every couple of days with Ben

1193
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I've been going out to eat all the time I keep myself busy

1194
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and the only times I feel sad and upset with my life

1195
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
is when I'm not busy when I don't have any ideas

1196
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
for work or I'm not satisfied with any of my ideas that's the worst time

1197
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
when it's like I don't actually want to do any of these ideas I have and there's nothing

1198
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
else like right now I actually probably would be in

1199
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
a little bit of a video creative rut if not for the fact that I'm playing

1200
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Pokemon you know like that's what's keeping me busy right now is that

1201
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Pokemon is clear and I love it and right before that

1202
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I was like you know watching all those Chris

1203
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
videos and getting into like some of those ideas and like I'm always jumping

1204
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
from inspiration to inspiration so that I never get bored because if I get bored I get sad

1205
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
and I don't want to be sad so you know

1206
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
yeah I guess that's where I'm at now and I hope you enjoyed this story I hope it wasn't

1207
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
too depressing or that it was interesting I really don't know if it was interesting at all

1208
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
like to me again this stuff is like almost about a different person

1209
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
because that story you know

1210
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,000
ended in 2010 like that's that's how

1211
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
2011 I was 20 years old you know when

1212
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
when I got the job at Target and finally kind of

1213
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
that was in late 2012 and I kind of put a stop to it all you know like

1214
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
well I mean I was depressed I was a little depressed when I worked at Target because I had to work but like

1215
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
once I started the channel and everything kind of picked up from there I've never had

1216
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
a huge the worst it's ever been is when I broke up with my girlfriend you know because

1217
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
it was my first big breakup and we've been dating for six months and it was like a huge blow

1218
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
but that's like the worst I've felt since then

1219
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
so yeah hopefully that's

1220
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
inspirational to some people if you're dealing with major depression to like

1221
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
find some way and you know my brother Victor

1222
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
who the medication didn't work for him he just kind of like accepted

1223
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
the idea that he'd be depressed forever like that was how he got out

1224
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
or not how he got out of it how he dealt with it was just to be like this is who I

1225
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
am like just to self-identify as a depressed person and just live with it

1226
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
but he's not depressed anymore because now he's in a really happy

1227
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
relationship and that's like totally made him like a different guy

1228
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
you know he's like happy all the time now used to be he was always angry

1229
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
like every day that I talked to him he was angry for no reason

1230
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
and now he's usually happy for no reason

1231
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
so he's totally about faced just thanks to getting into a good

1232
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
relationship so you know if you're depressed seek to change something

1233
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
and if you can't change anything by yourself try to find somebody who can

1234
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
and there's a lot of different ways to reach out I did it

1235
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
through text usually you know writing a letter and just leaving it somewhere

1236
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
because it's a lot easier than talking to someone you know if you can't

1237
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
talk up to your parents and talk to them but you can at least write something

1238
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
on a piece of paper and just leave it where you know they'll see it and then

1239
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
like you know and then you're at school so you don't have to be there when they read it
