1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,280
During RADCON 2, I think I overdosed on PCP. I really love these PC people. The most in

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,160
the world. They are the coolest people and the most interesting guys. But there's no

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,240
possible theoretical human who is so interesting that I want to hang out with seven of them for a

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:44,560
straight week. Constantly. It was hard actually. It was actually really surprising. Uh, because

5
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,800
there were so many fun things to do and so many fun times to be had, but then there were just so

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,560
many moments in the middle where suddenly it's like, uh, oh, I'm just sort of sitting here not

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,440
knowing what to do, being like, hmm, so I just kind of retreat back to my room and then just do

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,680
what I was doing normally, but this time way more distracted because I know there's people out there

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,400
and, you know, every five hours or so, or every 30 minutes, someone will be banging on my door

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,480
being like, hey, here's a fun thing you can do. And I'm like, you know what, I agree. And so I

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,120
could never get anything done. That, uh, that Digibro's Discuss Yuri on Ice video, for instance,

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,800
is a, I was working on that for like a week and a half, I think, because I spent like a whole week

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,160
just barely trudging through it over the course of days and days because I had nothing else to do

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:41,680
in between sitting around during Radcon, um, but I never was able to give it a good consecutive

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,040
session. So I just felt disorganized the whole time, you know? It was still good, totally worth it,

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,800
but it felt kind of burnt out. And I had like this moment of, gosh, am I slipping away from the

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,880
PCP? Am I like becoming a bad? Am I becoming shit? Am I like, does everyone, does everyone still value

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:09,440
me? Am I basically just being a parasite on this establishment? You know, I get, I feel like I've

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,400
been too worried about what, um, the other PCP people think of me, or rather I know this for a

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,640
fact. I think it's because my whole life, I've never given that much of a shit about what people

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,200
think about me. Like it's, it's, it's always been like, you know, if you're not related to me, then

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,800
the only thing that can make me like you, or like an absolute requirement for me, like caring about

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,440
you is you caring about me. And like, if you don't, if you don't like me and you don't approve of me,

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,760
then you don't matter to me. And I'm genuinely like that. And even people who I do like, I don't

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,760
value them so highly that like their opinion of me can make me seriously question, like instantly

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,840
question my own opinion of myself. But then, like all the PCP people are that, they're people who I

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,160
think are so good and interesting and good that things that they say can really affect me, like

28
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,560
inspire me and whatever. And if they say something like critical towards me, I'm like, oh no, no.

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:22,560
And like, you know, I take it too far and I'm trying to get over that hump stump. I don't know,

30
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,320
I think, I think, I think I'm fine now. I just don't, please don't give me advice on how to deal

31
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,680
with this problem I just stated. I have it under control. But I mean, it is true that like,

32
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,320
it does cause problems sometimes. Because yeah, I guess I just, I guess I just want to shock it

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,480
up to inexperience of giving a shit what people think about me. Like I'm so not used to it. I'm

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,400
so not accustomed. I'm so not accustomed to people saying things and me really caring immediately.

35
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,160
That it's like bothersome to me. You know, I'm trying to, I kind of have the gain up right now

36
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,320
to encourage me to talk more softly, but I'm just not good at talking softly. It makes me

37
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:14,960
awkward. So I'm going to turn the game down. Yeah. Yeah, don't don't don't get me wrong.

38
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,520
Well, did I turn, did I turn the game up? No. Yeah. Anyway, don't get me wrong. I had a great

39
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,240
rad con to it was a great experience and all, but it just, you know, it just had to kind of like

40
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,560
recover afterwards. And I was, I was kind of kind of in a depressive funk for a couple of days,

41
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
because I was feeling like I was pissing people off and stuff. And they're like,

42
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,800
but now I'm recovered. I, I was just like, you know what, no, this, this whole operation we're

43
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,160
doing is too good. It's the best thing ever. And I get to be a part of it. And it needs to happen.

44
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,200
It needs to work. I want it to work. And I want it to work well.

45
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,040
I value it extremely highly. I mean, the position I'm in now, which I know I talked about this in

46
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,960
the first episode of my show here, but the fact that doing Digi's videos doesn't take that much

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,920
time. And like, that's really the privilege of this job. Like it doesn't pay that much yet.

48
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,640
Like it pays like a normal amount of money. But the privilege is how little time it takes. And I

49
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,840
can spend all that time working on other things. And I have in fact continued to be consistently

50
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,040
working on programming. That's the main thing I've been doing still. I mean, I wasn't doing a lot of

51
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,840
it during Red Contour, but I am definitely getting back into it. And I just want to let you know

52
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,400
that like, yeah, every, every Patreon dollar that is coming through Digi and then going on to me,

53
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,560
I am using, I am really using all of my time. I am really maximizing my efficiency. Because

54
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,600
because it's a good way to live. I don't like being bored and I don't let myself be bored. Like,

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,160
again, I was in kind of a depressive funk for the last couple of days, rather the last like 36

56
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,160
hours. And I almost never liked that. In fact, I don't know if I've ever been exactly like that

57
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,680
until just now. And it was terrible. I was like, God, I can't get out of bed. This sucks not having

58
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,280
the motivation to get out of bed. So what I did was this is a hashtag life hack. If you can't get

59
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,920
out of bed, throw your phone somewhere else in the room so that you don't have it anymore. And the

60
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:33,600
only way to get it is to get up. That's how I, that's how I did it. Oh, God, I'm, I'm just like

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,560
springing back so hard from that funk. And I'm now I'm like so high again. Like, yeah, I know Digi

62
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,560
on his most recent episode, or at least in the first half of his most recent episode of his

63
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,360
decompression chamber is saying how like, you know, don't think that even though I'm having a

64
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,720
fun time making videos, I'm always having a fun time. I spend a lot of time being bored, he says.

65
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,120
And for me, that is just really not the case. I am, I'm wired all the time. That's why this show

66
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,520
was called it. That's why this show isn't named after letting go and like disperse. So it's named

67
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,320
after I specifically thought what's the opposite of decompression? What's the most intense compression?

68
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:22,720
What's the most intense collision that happens in the known universe that can be recreated by man?

69
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,600
And that was the idea of this show of the title anyway. But also the theory behind the show

70
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,840
is I don't really relax much. It's just fun being stuff all the time, you know.

71
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:46,160
Maybe, maybe I have some optimism chip programmed in me because I was raised to believe that there's

72
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,840
a God and everything will be great at the end. I don't know. For those who listen to all of the

73
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,200
apescape playthrough by peace by us on this channel, you'll probably know that I was saying

74
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,760
this before in that show, but to spin it in a much more positive way, I feel like on some

75
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,360
fundamental level, the way my perspective of the universe is wired is kind of, is kind of

76
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,320
programmed around the assumption that God is real and that like most of what the Bible says is

77
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,360
accurate and stuff. Even though I completely every second intellectually don't think that,

78
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,640
I feel like it still sort of affects, like it's still part, it's still intrinsic to my core

79
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,120
understanding of the universe. And so I guess that just kind of makes me optimistic. Maybe I'm

80
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,040
wrong though because that I should be at my core depressed because I'm not upholding Christian values

81
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:45,840
in my life. I mean, I mean, I'm kind of upholding most of the agreeable ones. I don't know. Yeah.

82
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:55,200
Oh, yeah. So I want to give you an update on my, my, I mean, on me becoming a hashtag code boy.

83
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,960
I finally figured out that C plus plus, I can kind of retire that one for now. Like it was,

84
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,800
it was useful learning programming through that. But I was thinking more about what specifically

85
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,320
my goals are, what my, what am I, what's my demand here. And really what I demand is,

86
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:20,400
is a, as a platform on which I can make a game or make a program 100% all manually by myself,

87
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,520
like where I'm in control of every detail, but where the details are not that obtuse and they

88
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,120
don't stack up to become that complicated. Because like all the ideas for games I have are nothing

89
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,520
mechanically revolutionary, right? I'm not like, well, specifically the main idea I'm thinking of,

90
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm kind of running through it in my mind and I'm like, no, there's not going to be any

91
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,440
ridiculous programming challenge in this. Like it's all going to be basic stuff that already

92
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:56,720
exists in games, um, simple games, but reconfigured. So yeah, I'm confident that I don't need to become

93
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,480
incredibly amazing at detailed stuff. I just need to be organized and push on and stuff, you know,

94
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,480
you know, you know, you know. So a C plus plus, the problem is that just getting graphics on the

95
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,280
screen requires like downloading, like you have to build an engine for that, but like there's

96
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,000
ways to like have the engine built kind of for you sort of, but even that's kind of complicated.

97
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,880
You have to install SDL, which seems like a good program, but it's just every five minutes I run

98
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,520
into a thing where it's different for me than it was for the tutorial video that showed me how to

99
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,600
do it. So I was like, okay, I need to put this down. And like, so I was kind of, you know,

100
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,600
shifting around some, I looked at Game Maker again. And I was like, yeah, I can't do this,

101
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,040
because it's just, it's so, it's so much about menus, you know, menus that I didn't make. So I

102
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,840
don't feel like I'm completely in control. Like I know all the little twists and knobs, definitely

103
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:02,560
not into, um, drag and drop programming. And I mean, I know that you can make Game Maker without

104
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,520
using any drag and drop, you can do it entirely in GML, it's native programming language. But I'm

105
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,400
like, I just, I don't need this, I don't need these middle managers, you know, like every time I got

106
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,720
frustrated with C plus plus, I was like, you know what, fuck it, I'm going to go over to Godot. I'm

107
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,120
going to, I'm going to figure out that program. And before I even get like three minutes into a

108
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,200
tutorial, I'm like, I can't do this. I can't deal with like having my hand held by this other thing

109
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,960
that's trying to make it easier for me, because that just means I understand what I'm doing less.

110
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,280
So I finally got into Python. And I think that this is the, this is the, the sweet combination

111
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,600
of elements, the sweet spot that I've been looking for. Because I think it's, it's definitely centered

112
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,880
more towards people who are more simple minded, I think. I'm not, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm wrong.

113
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,920
I believe Google uses Python actually, so maybe not, but you know, it just seems like it's more

114
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,960
about being clear and like, like, sure, you have to do all the work manually. It is a programming

115
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,800
language, but it's more straightforward and like things are much more what they seem to, what they

116
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,040
look like at face value. There's no like sucker punches that you don't understand. I assume I

117
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,720
have barely just now scraped the surface of Python. So, you know, I'll see how that goes. But I, I

118
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
skipped ahead in some tutorials a bit, and it seems as though getting graphics on the screen is

119
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,800
more straightforward with it. I'm not sure though, but it, if nothing else, I can tell just by the

120
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,680
design of the graphics of all Python and Python accessories that they care more about aesthetics

121
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:43,120
and presentation and like smoothness and feeling good than C++ does. That's, that's kind of the

122
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:51,520
thing. Like C++, it always looks so dorky. It looks so like Windows 95, but hold the vapor wave,

123
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,360
where, and then like, meanwhile Java is like, well, you know, Java is universal and stuff,

124
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,840
but it's like, so I'm sure I could figure that out. But like the Java logo is so crappy looking

125
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,760
compared to other things. And like, and like the Java installer looks so ancient and cruddy. And I'm

126
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,840
like, for one thing, on the surface level, on phase value, it makes me feel less aesthetic. But

127
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:22,320
more importantly, if the Java people saw fit to make it this way, to let it look like this, then

128
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,840
they're not the kind of people who I think I can work with. They're not the kind of people who I

129
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,640
think designed something that I can understand. Because I think they just don't look and think

130
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:39,360
the same way I do. Um, yeah, doing all this coding, learning stuff has really made me

131
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,080
reconsider or made me consider more deeply for the first time. What is complexity? What is

132
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,600
complicatedness? Because I know those two words are actually different, complicated and complex.

133
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,720
Um, complex, I believe, means things that just has a lot of information. Complicated means the

134
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,480
information is confusing. It might be the other way around, but I'm pretty sure. Like, basically,

135
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,720
I think a lot of people have it backwards in terms of trying to simplify things,

136
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,120
or maybe I'm just weird, I don't know. But like, for example, imagine a list of a bunch of things,

137
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,920
a bunch of stuff on a list. And if it's a bunch of stuff, it's like, man, that's hard, that's

138
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,440
confusing, that's complicated, because there's so many things to remember. But meanwhile, I think

139
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,640
a comparatively small number of things that are like woven together in a very weird way

140
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,880
is more, is more difficult to learn. Like, the relationships between them

141
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,040
is harder to learn. Maybe it's an autism thing. Maybe I should get myself tested. I don't fucking

142
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:51,520
know. But the point is, I think people in general, I'm going to assume, are better at learning things

143
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,800
from a big drop-down list. Like, where every piece of information means the same kind of

144
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,360
things. Like, they have the same parameters, and they all relate to each other linearly.

145
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,240
Because that way you can like, it's like your brain can like, store a method for how to

146
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,280
take that information in, and you can apply that method each time to taking in each entry on the

147
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:21,520
list one by one. Meanwhile, if something is like, you know, only five or six things, but they're

148
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,560
all woven together with this complex web, you have to keep reformatting your brain in order to

149
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,360
take any information. And I think that reformatting your brain to make a new method is more difficult

150
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,960
than simply running an existing method. Now, obviously, both are different forms of learning

151
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,200
that are very enjoyable. You know, I'm just saying that one is harder than the other, which,

152
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,080
when successfully done, makes you feel even more satisfied. Like, it's sort of like the difference

153
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,920
between, you know, like watching a movie that like adds new elements to your friendly, familiar

154
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,440
format, and it's enjoyable and fresh and new for that reason versus a movie that, you know,

155
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,280
challenges what your definition of a movie even is, which is, you know, it can be even more exciting,

156
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,720
but maybe less enjoyable, who knows. So I feel like with object-oriented programming, I feel

157
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,800
like that's the mistake that people are making, or at least the mistake I made. You know, I don't

158
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,400
want to speak for anyone else because I haven't done a lot of programming. I mean, I've done a

159
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,920
decent amount. I did make half of an RPG, but, you know, I'm not super experienced. I haven't like

160
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,240
watched other people extensively. So I don't want to speak on anyone else's behalf, but on my own

161
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,800
behalf, I feel like what I was trying to do was to try to reduce the size of the list of how many

162
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,840
things to know by weaving them together in this tight package so that it would look smaller on

163
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,520
paper, like it would all be intricately woven, and therefore it's all organized and everything

164
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,320
connects. But connections are difficult to keep track of, and that if I just had the discipline

165
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,480
of just, you know, grind down until you're done with the list, then you did it. You know, just

166
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,280
study and practice. Basically, that's what it is. It's the difference between study and practice

167
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,720
versus trying to come up with a new method to cheat your way around it or get it more easily.

168
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,680
You know, you need both in your life, but, you know, keep in mind when one is appropriate and

169
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:26,560
the other is not appropriate. Yes, yes, yes. Going back to the whole, you know, feeling like I'm

170
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,200
falling apart from the PCP, which I no longer do. That's just, you know, sometimes an emo

171
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,800
bullshit, like feeling sometimes, which, you know, I think I won't have anymore. I'm gonna be perfect

172
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,040
from now on. But like, I guess I get afraid of that because I feel like I've been like that in

173
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,880
the past. I feel like as a kid, I was always like that because I've just, there just weren't people

174
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,520
who I liked enough to give a shit, you know? Like, again, you know, I was homeschooled and all,

175
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,760
but I had plenty of social interaction. Just like not, I guess most people in life, you're either

176
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,440
forced to hang out with the same people all the time because of school, so you just have to

177
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,000
fucking deal with it. Or you find people who you like and you can retreat into them, you know?

178
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,160
So I guess the difference is that I didn't have that forced to be around people who I don't want

179
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,960
to be around. Like I could just, in my life was, my life has always, has always been pretty dang

180
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,720
modular. You know, I've always been able to do what I wanted to and work on what I wanted to.

181
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,000
So I guess the positive is that, that it makes me like really accustomed to the idea of just being

182
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,520
like, hey, I'm gonna, I just decided to jump on YouTube and it's, it's pretty easy for me to just

183
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,280
suddenly start devoting all my time to it or suddenly start devoting all my time to one thing

184
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,560
or another because I've never, never been constrained by, you know, the schooling method

185
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,400
because it's like if you do homeschooling, you can just, you can kind of crank out the work

186
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,800
pretty quickly. And yeah, I mean, it depends on your parents, but that's kind of how it was for me.

187
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,600
You know, I did a, I did a pretty mediocre to bad job with schooling, which I, if I had gone

188
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,360
to a public school, I would have done almost certainly the same bad job, but over a much longer

189
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,280
period of time stretched out over the course of every day. Whereas, you know,

190
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,080
at home, it was just a couple hours of feeling like I'm shitting around and being stupid.

191
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,160
But yeah, my point is, yeah, like the benefit that the pro is that I always felt able to just

192
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,000
like jump on something and just start doing it. And I've just, it's easy for me to have the focus

193
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,480
on things that I want to do. But the downside is there are a lot of things that you're sort of

194
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,720
supposed to go through as a frustration in life that I just avoid. I don't know, maybe that's,

195
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,760
I guess that's also a pro, but you know, it just, it just means that there are certain things that

196
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,200
like I never had to deal with as a child. And like part of it is having to hang out with the same

197
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,920
people who you hate all the time. If there were people who I hated, I could just stop hanging

198
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,840
out with them. But yeah, like there was, um, there was one church I went to from like ages 10,

199
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,000
11 through 12 that my parents went to this church and like they got bored of it and they left.

200
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,160
Like, I guess I get my misanthropy from my dad who always, you know, associates himself with

201
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,560
people and then like disconnects from them and eventually leaves. I feel like that would have

202
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,000
been my life if I hadn't discovered the, the, the, the pro crest and praetors people

203
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,560
who are people who I can like respect consistently and never get tired of,

204
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
except during ride gone to a little tiny bit. But anyway, that's beside the point.

205
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Like anyway, in this church, like before my parents decided we should stop going there,

206
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,280
like, you know, they have a youth group thingy or like a tween group or whatever it was. And like,

207
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,560
I liked doing it because I liked being in there more than the adult church, because like it was

208
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,440
a small room where there was more audience participation and it was more direct to direct

209
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,920
to indirect. It wasn't like sitting in a giant auditorium and having a guy lecture you for three

210
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,960
hours, which by the way, I don't know if I remember, I remember one time I had a Catholic

211
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,480
friend on the internet who went to like a Baptist church one, one Sunday and he'd never realized

212
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,280
that like most churches that aren't Catholic, the sermons are like three hours long. I'm not

213
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,240
kidding. Apparently in Catholicism sermons are really short because the Catholics are like really

214
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,720
good at actually making their religion aesthetic and enjoyable on some level, I guess. Anyway,

215
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,920
yeah, so like three hours sermon with the adults and I was just like, this is terribly boring,

216
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,760
I hate it. But if, you know, with the youth group, I can at least feel more involved, you know, and

217
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,880
that's nice. But what really frustrated me is that like, like they would often be like, you know

218
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,120
what, we actually want the youth group to be with the adults this time because this message is important.

219
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,600
And I was like, okay, well, I hate this, but fair enough. But it just got to be to the point where

220
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,120
it was like 75% of the time, like three out of four Sundays, it honestly felt like three out of

221
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,640
four Sundays, they wouldn't do the tween group thing. Because because this message was just so

222
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,320
important. Honestly, I honestly now looking back on it, I just now had a suspicion that maybe the

223
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,640
guy who ran the tween group thing was just didn't want to do it most of the time and asking them

224
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,120
to excuse him out of it. I don't know. But that's probably not the case. They probably thought that

225
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,560
the messages were just that important that all the 11 year olds had to listen to it.

226
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,400
But anyway, what was really frustrating is that on the occasion I finally went to the

227
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,480
tween group thing, you know, it was more involved, but I didn't like the people there and they would

228
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,200
piss me off. And well, they only pissed me off twice, right? Well, no, they only pissed me off

229
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,400
once. Here's how it went. Like I just didn't like being there. I was just weird. I think this was,

230
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,160
I was going through my phase where I decided to like not wear underwear during the summer,

231
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,600
because I was like, my butt is sweating constantly. So I just don't wear underwear,

232
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:45,680
I won't feel it clinging to me. And then also during the winter, this was my period when I was

233
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,440
like, I just need to wear gloves all the time so that my hands don't get chapped. This was before

234
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,600
I discovered you could just put lotion on your hands and then your hands won't get chapped during

235
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,160
the dry season. At the time I was just like, I'm gonna wear gloves all the time. And you know,

236
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,200
I'm sure I'm awkward and like, it's like, I don't talk in ways that would make me seem natural,

237
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,080
but I do talk in ways that make me seem unnatural, you know, again, didn't really care about these

238
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,680
people or their opinion of me. It just made me feel like, okay, I just don't need to be here.

239
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,720
It just made me feel a little bit uncomfortable. Not really uncomfortable, just why am I here?

240
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,920
What am I doing? Right? I remember one time we were like, never mind, I won't get into like

241
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,680
time. There were just some times we were like, don't touch me or some kid was like, we're like,

242
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,680
one girl, we were like holding hands to pray and one girl was like, why do you wear gloves all the

243
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,600
time? And I don't remember what answer I gave. I think I think I probably just said, oh, because

244
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,640
my hands get chapped. So I just want to keep them warm all the time. But yeah, I probably came off

245
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,760
like a huge weirdo. But I don't think I was like that stand out for people to care that much,

246
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,440
you know, it's a bunch of 12 year olds, of course, they're all they're all probably feeling miserable

247
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,400
too. But like, there's one time where like, what happened, we had water cups, I just spilled the

248
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,440
water cup on my pants. And I was like, I'm frustrated, right? And like, you know, today, I just like,

249
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,680
oh, shit, I spilled water on my pants. But you know, at this time, I didn't have the maturity

250
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,400
to just do that. I was just like, Oh, God, I don't want anyone to see this. Like, I don't mind that

251
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,080
much. It's just that it stresses me out. So I went to the bathroom and I was just trying to dry it

252
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,360
off. And like, one of the teachers was like, Hey, what's up? Like, it was like a female girl person

253
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,960
woman who was like, she wasn't in the bathroom with me. But you know, like when I came out,

254
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,440
she's like, Is anything wrong? And like, and I was just I was just frustrated, right? I was just

255
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,640
frustrated at like, now I'm like spending 30 minutes just trying to dry my fucking pants off.

256
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,480
And instead of like, participating in whatever they're doing, which is probably going to be at

257
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,040
least somewhat stimulating, right? I don't want to be here anyway. And so I eventually walked back

258
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,320
in with the teacher lady. And like, everyone was just kind of silent for a second. And one girl

259
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:53,280
said, What's wrong? Are you constipated? And like, everyone laughed. Like, you know, the classic,

260
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,720
you know, laughing at the child in the classroom type of thing. And like, it didn't bother me.

261
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,000
It just amplified my why the fuck am I here? You know, I was just like, I don't I don't need you

262
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:12,000
people, right? Now, I must clarify that on one hand, I've never been someone who minds being

263
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,200
laughed at. Like for me, I was actually asked like last night, I was talking to my squiggle. And

264
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,120
the squiggle asked me like, what is what is like the your biggest fear? What's your biggest concern?

265
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,200
What's your biggest insecurity? And I said, people not finding me funny, me not being funny, that is

266
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,440
literally the only thing that could make me make myself image plummet into 0%. That's really the

267
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,840
only I could be terrible in every other way. But as long as people are laughing because of me, I'm

268
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,400
okay, I can live, right? And, and then like the question is raised, well, what about when people

269
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,440
are laughing at you? And I honestly sincerely don't mind. If if me, if my existence or my actions

270
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,320
causes amusement to people, then I legitimately, I legitimately appreciate it no matter what the

271
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,320
context is really. So like, the fact that everyone laughed at me, I don't mind. I really thought

272
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,880
like, huh, it is kind of, I mean, that was a funny quip. It was well timed, you know? But it just was

273
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,320
like, yeah, but I don't really feel welcome here. Again, I want to emphasize the laughing on its own

274
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,600
didn't bother me. It was just like thinking, I don't need to be here. I don't want to be here.

275
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,040
I was just kind of grumpy about it for like weeks. And eventually like that girl was like,

276
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,720
hey, sorry that I said that to you. I'm like, don't don't worry, I don't mind, you know, nice.

277
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:41,520
But then, oh God, the the like like a month later, you know, however many sessions of this later,

278
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:49,360
like we were doing a Thanksgiving thing. Hold on, Thanksgiving, that would mean that this was

279
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,320
like November, which would mean like a couple months prior would have been when I was still

280
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,880
wearing gloves during September. So maybe it was just cold all the time. Maybe my hands got

281
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,520
chapped all the time. Maybe it was just dry that year. I don't even know. No, no, it had to have

282
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,240
been cold. Maybe that maybe the kid thinking maybe the girl asked me why I wear gloves all the time

283
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:18,480
was from the last winter. And and now and this Thanksgiving story I'm about to tell was from

284
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:26,800
the the year that felt that followed afterwards. Man, I actually you know what it's starting to

285
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,320
trip me out. I don't remember like I'm like the dates of things are blurring together for me more

286
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,600
and more like I was realizing just last night I don't remember if I was 11 or 12 when I jacked

287
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:46,320
off for the first time. I literally cannot remember if it was 2005 or 2006. Like I'm pretty sure it

288
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,480
was 2005. But then it conflicts with other dates and timelines I have in mind. So it may have been

289
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,560
2006. And then there's a part of me that's like wait, was it 2007? Was I actually 13? I really,

290
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,120
really don't remember. And so much of the stuff that I did on the internet at the time I have

291
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:12,960
deleted long, long ago. So I won't I can't check. Anyway, this is you know the whole when you look

292
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,920
on back on this you'll laugh this story with this youth this tween group thing is definitely the case

293
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,840
with this. So it was a Thanksgiving thing. And basically the assignment is we're gonna make a

294
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,480
friggin. Oh, geez, it's like you're just gonna make like a card like a thing what you're oh yeah

295
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,880
what you're thankful for of course that's what Thanksgiving is for I don't remember that but

296
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,200
putting one and two together I'm sure that's what it was make a little card with arts and crafts

297
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:47,520
signifying what you're thankful for. So actually I just remember we were actually in that church

298
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,080
for longer than I can I remember because I was actually in the kids group before that but then

299
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,840
eventually I moved up to the tween group in the same church right so I was probably there for

300
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,640
three years or so but anyway yeah so yeah make a card of what you're thankful for and like

301
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,240
and they had little um okay where's those little cone shaped things for Thanksgiving where you put

302
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,440
like fruit in it or something and you put like stuff in it and it's Thanksgiving themed it's like a

303
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,000
it's like one of those bugles snacks but it's Thanksgiving and like you put stuff in it like

304
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,160
that's a Thanksgiving thing so part of what they were you know prompting for these cards is that

305
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,280
you know decorate them with one of those bugles I think they actually were literally using bugles

306
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,920
like the snack and you put the thing inside of them but it may have been little plastic things

307
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,440
and I just didn't really care that much so I was just like gluing you know you glue it to the card

308
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,640
and I just glue I glued the fruit outside of the bugle like I didn't like like everyone else like

309
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,320
I was just kind of messing around with it didn't really care but then like the other kids were like

310
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,280
oh you're not doing it right you know you're like like look see what we're doing like you're

311
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,680
gluing you're putting glue into the bugle and then you're putting the little plastic fruit ornaments

312
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,280
into the bugle to uh to make them stick and it looks real but I was just sticking the bugle to

313
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:11,520
the piece of paper and then sticking the fruit to the piece of paper outside of the bugle and I

314
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,680
didn't think of doing it the way that they were doing it but they were like legitimately like like

315
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,600
correcting me about it you know which is you know remember these are a bunch of 12 year old so of

316
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,200
course they were just like and like a couple and I was like uh no the way I'm doing it is perfectly

317
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,200
fine right like I'm I'm doing it I don't care you know like I think at the time I was probably

318
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,800
arguing oh this is more good like this is better the way I'm doing it like I don't and like and then

319
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,080
like when it got to the point that there was like two or three kids being like no no you're doing it

320
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,880
wrong you're doing it wrong I was like they weren't mad they were just trying to help me but they

321
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,560
were doing it in this know it all kind of attitude and so I was just like fuck this you know I didn't

322
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,400
say that I was just like I literally just turned around walked out of the room because you know it's

323
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,320
it's a church I mean for those who don't if you haven't been to a church or maybe you've gone to a

324
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,920
certain kind of church all the churches I've been to it's not it's pretty relaxed you can just kind

325
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,280
of wander around and you know whatever so but yeah the point is I wasn't doing anything like breaking

326
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:17,440
the rules I was just being kind of audacious I'm like why do I need to be here I don't need to be here

327
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,680
I walked out I was just like I was mad like why are they giving me shit over nothing and I walked out

328
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,880
the door and it was like storming down the hall and I remember specifically um like there was some

329
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,040
adult woman person talking to another adult woman person like what's going on oh he's having another

330
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,000
David's having another issue with the kids another issue like oh great this is what I am I'm the one

331
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,600
who has the issues right so I was just like so I never went there again I think that may have

332
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,840
actually spawned at the end of us going to that church like I mean I probably told my parents about

333
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,920
that and they were like okay let's stop going there you know because they didn't like it either they

334
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:59,360
didn't like the people there either oh god it's so funny oh so you know I remember also like much

335
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,120
younger at a different church we went to like a church camp thing and there was a point in time

336
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,600
where I just got pissed off at everybody and I just I just went into the tent and I zipped the

337
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,360
tent up and I was just mad and like some other kid was like man remember last year when like you

338
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,360
were so mad at everybody you like you zipped the tent up so that no one would get in I'm like

339
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,680
yeah I guess I just have I guess that's just my reputation at some point I get mad at everybody

340
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,600
and I just want to storm off right and I lose nothing because I have I have computers video games

341
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,160
and the internet eventually when I was like 13 and I started using the internet all the time

342
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,120
even as a kid I had the internet I just didn't use it much I you have the infinite universe

343
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,360
to explore I don't need I don't need useless people who are normal you know so I guess because

344
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:50,160
that's my pattern uh then when like I feel angsty towards the pcp I get paranoid like oh god am I

345
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,000
gonna emo out and leave because I would then legitimately be crushed you know I value this

346
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,360
association this affiliation way too much you know so I need to get the fuck over it man

347
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,320
okay um that's it I'm gonna keep this short again that was a pretty self-contained point

348
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,480
I have other notes but they're all things that will continue to be relevant as the weeks go on so

349
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:28,000
I don't want to squeeze this uh this my topics out too quickly uh yeah I'm planning on you know

350
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,480
still doing this every week probably maybe but okay on one hand I feel like if I force myself

351
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,080
to do one every week then I'm gonna run out and it's gonna be pointless and it would be better

352
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,040
if I just do it when I feel like doing it but the thing is pressuring myself to do it on a schedule

353
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,080
makes me want makes me like forces me to come up with ideas and to put it together in a good way

354
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,120
so I think I am going to commit myself to doing this you know what I'm gonna commit myself to

355
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,360
doing it once every other week yeah that's what I'm gonna do hopefully it's been like two weeks

356
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,480
since the last one yeah so yeah that that will officially be the schedule of this until further

357
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:15,120
notice the uh the voodoo hadron collider will be once every two weeks two weeks two weeks

358
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:27,920
will have lost the contract and oscorp will be dead sometimes it's gonna do things yourself
