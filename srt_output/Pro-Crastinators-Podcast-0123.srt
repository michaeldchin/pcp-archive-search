00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,480
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm the best guy ever. Today we're joined by Hippocrit.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Mage.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,880
I was ill but I got better just in time for this podcast so you won't get to miss me.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:01:11,840
I've become games so much I'm dreaming in code. I'm starting to think in if else statements

6
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:24,080
in real time.

7
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
How long has it been?

8
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
It's been months.

9
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
It's been over two months.

10
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
It's been all I ever needed.

11
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
Congratulations.

12
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,440
I remember that the world is a nihilistic nightmare and that you're not supposed to live

13
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
it sober.

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,320
I'm, I'm, well, you disgust me.

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,800
I don't know, what's, what's up with that?

16
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,320
Hey, hey, you didn't introduce me, you fuck.

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Oh, oh shit.

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,800
Don't you know I have feelings?

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,760
In my weed induced stupor, I forgot that Ben Saint is also here.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,800
Yeah, don't you forget it. Don't, don't wear, that's my name, don't wear it out.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Patreon.

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
There he is.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,600
That's my name. Don't wear it out by not saying Ben ever again.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,320
Here's a thought. Should you ever do drugs?

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Yeah.

26
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Like ever.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,820
I think I want to say no.

28
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,820
I want to say no.

29
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,520
I want to say, all right, I was talking to a guy in my discord who was saying fuck alcohol,

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,080
I hate it, sucks.

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,640
And I was arguing the case for trying alcohol once in your life to at least know whether

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,160
you enjoy the feeling of being tipsy and getting a bit loose.

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, why don't you try jumping off a cliff, go to try it once, you know, see how it goes.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,240
Cause like, it's, it's undeniably does good things if you take a little bit of it every

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,920
so often in the right context, in the right circumstances.

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,480
Are you talking about like the health benefits of drinking wine or something?

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,560
No, I'm just, I'm just talking about like the social benefits and the relaxation that

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
it brings.

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Yeah.

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,000
And you don't need to think so hard about everything and you're not anxious anymore.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,320
I wish it had that effect on me.

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,920
The most important thing is that when you're at a party, you have something in your hand

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,640
and you don't look weird and you don't think you look weird because you have something

44
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
in your hand.

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,080
I mean, you didn't get my hand at every party I'm at.

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
It looked great.

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
You can drink anything.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,680
I, you know, I always am walking around just carrying something to make me feel less weird,

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,480
but then half the time what I'm carrying is weird.

50
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
And then I get low down.

51
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm literally at the shrug walking around.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
But I am atlas.

53
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
You know what you do?

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Here's a, here's a move.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,600
Here's a move that I have never successfully tried out, but one day I intend to do it because

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,280
it sounds great and I see no downsides is you go to a party or to a bar or you go to

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,760
a bar where everybody's drinking like beer and you, you order a champagne flute.

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,640
You order a flute of champagne and then you go around and you toast everyone with your

59
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,280
flute of champagne and you, I mean, I can imagine that you would look like the coolest

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
guy in the world doing this.

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,080
When you say flutes, do you mean like the musical instrument?

62
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Yeah, I was going to ask.

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
No, God damn it.

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,920
You fucking, you fucking Euro trash.

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Don't you speak English?

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
No.

67
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,800
The flute is the musical instrument.

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,200
When you see people drinking champagne on New Year's Eve, that's a flute.

69
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,320
Is it a flute or a flume?

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
It's a flute.

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:24,040
I, I, I just imagine a glass, I, who, what, I'm walking around with a trombone full

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
of beer.

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,320
My brain is just colliding the ideas of a flute and like a glass, it's like, what,

74
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,160
just imagine a wine glass, what thinner.

75
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,200
I, I, I, I'm just thinking, no, it isn't, it's round, a regular wine glass, round.

76
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,320
This has got to be the most boring discussion we've ever had on the protest.

77
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I know.

78
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
I know.

79
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
I guess of all time.

80
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,120
I mean, we've got a couple of strong contenders for that role, for that title.

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
Yeah, I guess so.

82
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
For that dubious distinction.

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I had a great dream the other day.

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
It was a great dream.

85
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I was never saying that, but I was thinking it.

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Oh, hashtag kick mage 2018.

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Yeah.

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Listen, listen, everybody.

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
You didn't kick me with anything.

90
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I'm just going to make the case that, you know what, let me, I'm just going to get

91
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
into a topic.

92
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Here's a topic.

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm throwing it out there.

94
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Not one of these.

95
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Here's the topic.

96
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,000
I've been saving this for like a month now.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We haven't gotten this fine.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't care.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But here's what it is.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,120
In fact, that thing that you've been waiting for forever to come out, examples, Card Saga's

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
Wars was this game that took literally 15 years to come out.

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
Are we just talking about Kingdom Hearts 3 right now?

103
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Kingdom Hearts 3, yes.

104
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Here's the, my topic is, those things.

105
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,800
First problem waiting and wanting things to come out.

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Just quick interruption.

107
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
I actually.

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
Having emotions and wanting and liking things.

109
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,720
Quick interruption quickly.

110
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,240
I Google champion flute and it's less thinner.

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,480
It's longer than, no, you're English.

112
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,080
It's fucking thinner than a wine glass.

113
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Jesus.

114
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Jesus Christ.

115
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Why do you doubt me?

116
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,320
Why do you undermine me, Mage?

117
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,720
Here's what the topic is.

118
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,320
The topic is that those things that you've been waiting to come out forever will be massively

119
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,560
disappointing 100% of the time and that it is never, ever worth the wait and that you're

120
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,040
fucking yourself over to even continue to care like for any amount of time.

121
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Well Nate, you solved the discussion and now we can move on.

122
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,600
Did anyone, I mean, here's like a counter example.

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,200
Ridley getting it to smash was the opposite of that and that was a good thing.

124
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,800
That wasn't announced.

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,640
That was like said, no, it's not happening and so to cling to it is a meme and therefore

126
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
just fine.

127
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,320
Well, that's exactly what it is.

128
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,760
To counter a little bit here, Nate, what about an example that you've done a video

129
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
on?

130
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,920
Doom 2016 was in hell forever and then it came out and it fucking ruled and it was the best

131
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,160
thing of all time.

132
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Wait, what was this?

133
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
I missed it.

134
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Doom 2016.

135
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
That game was in.

136
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Oh, Doom 2016.

137
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,240
Was in a miasma development hell and it almost became Call of Doom and that looked really

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,040
bad but then they fixed it and now it looks fantastic.

139
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,600
Okay, it's been two years here, man.

140
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Were people actually waiting for that game specifically though?

141
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,200
Was that happen or was that like a game that they're like, oh God, okay, we've got the

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Doom IP.

143
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,320
Okay, I guess now we'll make a new game.

144
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,360
It's been forever but we'll finally make something and then they make it.

145
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,360
The distinction of what you're talking about is when there is a promise and you're waiting

146
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,960
for it to be fulfilled, like I don't know who was waiting for Doom.

147
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,360
I guess maybe it was announced but I never heard about it until it was a real game.

148
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
So potentially Doom 2016.

149
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,400
I mean, I was never big in the FPS Doom scene.

150
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,280
I guess I'm still not but I played that game and loved it but yeah, I don't think that

151
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
game was announced.

152
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,640
Anyway, the Final Fantasy XV was announced as a different game 10 years ago and transformed

153
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,720
and changed and all these new trailers came out and stuff and that comes out and it was

154
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
some people like it.

155
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,520
I have many criticisms of it.

156
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,600
Kingdom Hearts 3, still not out.

157
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,160
I can already tell 100%.

158
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,240
It's not going to be as good as everyone wants it to be in all these millions of ways.

159
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,800
Maybe it'll be good in other ways.

160
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,400
You've got to live your life by the coda.

161
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,240
High hopes, low expectations, always.

162
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,440
Expect the worst.

163
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,320
Never expect it to be good.

164
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,200
Never go into anything like, cause Yatsy Kroshaw, Yatsy Kroshaw broke this down perfectly

165
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
one time.

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,440
He said, if you go into something with high expectations, there's two possibilities.

167
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,360
They'll be met and you'll be happy or they won't be and you'll be upset.

168
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,240
If you go into everything with low expectations, the two possibilities are that it will suck

169
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,760
and you'll be like, well, I expected this, or it will be great and you'll be like, wow,

170
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,440
what a pleasant surprise.

171
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,240
No matter what, if you go in with low expectations, the odds are always in your emotional favor,

172
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
so just never expect anything to be good.

173
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,240
But you're just miserable and you're not as happy as you would be otherwise.

174
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
How is it miserable?

175
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Why would you be happy cleaning up on something that ultimately fails?

176
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,520
You're operating under a cynical lens 100% of the time.

177
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,240
I don't consider it cynical to approach life that way.

178
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
I gotta go with Digi on this one.

179
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,240
It's like fucking Buddhism.

180
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,240
You gotta release your attachment.

181
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Getting hype for things is just a form of attachment to material things.

182
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,240
And not even this material thing, just attachment to an idea.

183
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,240
An idea that may fail to come to pass and will cause you pain.

184
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Relinquishing your attachment to these things will save you pain.

185
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:41,240
The idea is not to force yourself to artificially expect things to be worse than you think they are.

186
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,240
It's to strive to have that viewpoint, because I don't think of it like that,

187
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,240
but I do operate on that low expectations sort of thing.

188
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,240
I don't think anything's good until I see a lot of praise by a lot of people that I respect.

189
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I don't see any reason, and I don't like it.

190
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I see no reason to expect anything to be good.

191
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,240
There's nothing that would convince me other than...

192
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Digi people are so depressing.

193
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
I don't get how you find this depressing.

194
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Because being hype is fun as fuck.

195
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
No, it's not.

196
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,240
It's immoral to be hype.

197
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Super fun.

198
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Being excited for something is fun, and when you're let down, your excitement becomes righteous for you.

199
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Okay, guys, guys, guys.

200
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Tom is like, it's about the journey, not the destination sort of guy.

201
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Digi is more about the destination, not the journey.

202
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,240
You're not taking a journey by waiting for something to come out.

203
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
No, no, no, no, Digi.

204
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
She's right.

205
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

206
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
I kind of get what you're talking about.

207
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
I remember, okay, I guess I have mixed feelings,

208
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
I'm mostly on Digi's side.

209
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,240
I wasted two years of my life being hype for Spore to come out,

210
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,240
and I admit that following Spore and waiting for its development was a journey,

211
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,240
but it was a journey from happiness to sadness.

212
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
It was a purely masturbatory exercise.

213
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I like being a sidekick.

214
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
None of us here can talk about it.

215
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,240
It felt like something was happening, but it was nothing.

216
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
It was wasted time, and it was dumb.

217
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,240
I'm just, I just, I don't get why being like naturally cynical.

218
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,240
I don't go out of my way to push down happy thoughts,

219
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
and if I am hype for something, I don't like destroy that.

220
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I just naturally through having a cynical lens of things.

221
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Why would you be hype in the first place?

222
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
That's the mistake.

223
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Because it's fun.

224
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
It's fun to be hype.

225
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
I'm very sensible when I'm hype.

226
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Like, I was hype for Dark Souls 3 because I knew Miyazaki was coming back,

227
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
and I had a pretty good idea that that was...

228
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,240
That was the only game I've ever been really hype for is Dark Souls 3.

229
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
I legit let myself get hype because I was very confident it would be good,

230
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,240
but that's because there were like gameplay trailers where like you can see people play the game,

231
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,240
and I could tell, okay, all the things I hated about Dark Souls 2 are rectified,

232
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,240
and I could tell that just by looking at it for a second, you know?

233
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,240
I'm hype for a bunch of things right now, and I'm not ashamed.

234
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm excited.

235
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Tom, you don't have to be ashamed.

236
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,240
You need to replace, you gotta replace the excitement that you get from being hype

237
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,240
with the power that you can draw from looking down on people who get hype about things.

238
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
No.

239
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,240
That's why my eyes are as evidenced by this conversation.

240
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
You all discussed me.

241
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Look, me-hype isn't a moral action that no one should do,

242
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,240
but we're human, and we sin, and we're flawed.

243
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,240
So like, for example, I would say that I'm somewhat hype about the trigger show Pro-Mare.

244
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,240
That is, it's like the next, you know, girl-logging, kill-a-kill-a-pro-mare.

245
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Let me get an argument in Mayushi.

246
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Okay, I should be the most hype about that show out of anything, right?

247
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Because kill-a-kill and girl-logging are both in my top ten.

248
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Mayushi is my favorite director.

249
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,240
But, first of all, the show looks like it's gonna be in CG.

250
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
I'm not the biggest fan of CG.

251
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
The details are where you hit questions.

252
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,240
You know, and then I've also known that trigger doesn't always make the best show I've ever seen.

253
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,240
You know, wasn't into Darling and the Franks really.

254
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
So, I look at the show and I-

255
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Unpopular opinion.

256
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
I didn't like that one.

257
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
I didn't like Luluko.

258
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,240
I thought Luluko was really dumb and a waste of my time.

259
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
I said it.

260
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
I said it.

261
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
It was pretty short, though.

262
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
So, what was the waste of much time?

263
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,240
I think Pro-Mare, like on the one, I have high hopes for it.

264
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
I hope it's great.

265
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,240
But why would I expect it to be great?

266
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
Because that's just setting myself up for potential disappointment.

267
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,240
If it turns out to be great, I'll be like, fuck yeah.

268
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,240
And then I can be hype about it for the rest of my life once it's great.

269
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,240
You know, like, why would I want to be hype in the year and a half leading up to it

270
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,240
when I can be hype for the next 70 years afterwards that I live with the show existing?

271
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Because my life is so empty of meaning and hope and dreams and good things going on

272
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,240
that I have to vicariously live through the excitement of other things that aren't out yet.

273
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
People want something to say.

274
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Okay, guys.

275
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
People.

276
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Oh.

277
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Well, I think the thing that I'm having, like,

278
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,240
I'm not feeling the trying to think of the way to say it.

279
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,240
I feel this way, but I can't control it.

280
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Like, I just am the sort of person who is more cynical

281
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,240
and expects things to be not that interesting or not that good.

282
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
And I see things like that.

283
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,240
I don't think of it as like a thing you can switch off or change.

284
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Tisk, tisk, tisk.

285
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
You can't switch it off.

286
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
You can't switch it off.

287
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
You got to burn it out of yourself.

288
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
You got to sear it out with a red high.

289
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,240
What I'm saying is that when Tom is saying, like, how can you live like that?

290
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm like, well, how can you live like that?

291
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
How do I do this?

292
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Okay, guys.

293
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Let me, let me, let me say how I deal with this.

294
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Then shut up, please.

295
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm going to write this down and I'm going to publish a book about it.

296
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,240
And I'm not going to say it out loud ever because it's not possible.

297
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Okay.

298
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
But, okay.

299
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
So this is how I deal.

300
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,240
And I don't expect anyone else to be able to deal with stuff like this the way I do.

301
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
And so this is how I do it.

302
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
So I hear about a thing.

303
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
And I was like, oh, neat.

304
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I kind of like the idea of this thing.

305
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,240
And then I completely forget about it until it actually comes out.

306
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
And when it comes out, I go like, oh, neat.

307
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
That's, that's fun.

308
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,240
That's, that's exactly what I'm describing as like the perfect way to be.

309
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,240
I just, because like, what's the point of waiting one and a half years and like expecting

310
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
and just being on edge.

311
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
It, it, it's not doesn't frustrate me.

312
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
It just, it's like, it makes me anxious.

313
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,240
It's just like, I wanted to come out and wanted to come out and just taking the time out of

314
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
my day thinking about it.

315
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
And like, that's how you live.

316
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,240
But I bet if like your favorite thing was getting a sequel, you would share like, I would

317
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I'm like, I like Dragon Age and I'm kind of worried about it because of what EA's been

318
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,240
up to and why, why are you on stuff?

319
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,240
But I don't spend time thinking about it or stressing over it.

320
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,240
And there's another game, an indie game that's going to come out in like two or three years

321
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
called Temp Temps or something like that.

322
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
It's going to like a Pokemon MMO sort of, but it's not Pokemon.

323
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,240
And I was pretty excited to see about that.

324
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Yeah.

325
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Like, I don't remember what exactly they predicted the launch or whatever.

326
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
It was like, oh, that looks neat.

327
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I really want to play it right now.

328
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Best forget about it for the next two or three years.

329
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,240
It's an unfortunate reality that we've gone into a time in the world where we're, it's

330
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,240
now very common to like be introduced to something two or three years before it will come out.

331
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
And that's not even that long.

332
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
I got it.

333
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
I want to make the argument.

334
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
That's a fucking lifetime.

335
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
That is a lifetime.

336
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,240
I really look down on people who get hype about shit because of the fact that I think it

337
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
is ignorant consumer practice.

338
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,240
We live in a world where most of the time, the shit that they post about something before

339
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
it comes out is a fucking lie.

340
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Like either it's not going to be that way, even if it's not necessarily a lie, it just

341
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
probably won't turn out that way.

342
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,240
And like after Dark Souls 2, like there's no, like that game literally looks completely

343
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,240
different from the final product or like Watch Dogs or any of these games that had like

344
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,240
this crazy marketing push and the game comes out and is nothing like that.

345
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,240
It's like, if you get hype for a game before it's out, before there's reviews telling you,

346
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,240
you know, that you trust telling you that it's good, like you are just that.

347
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
You know what people should keep in mind for this?

348
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
I've written down the thing.

349
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,240
The fact that like, okay, the day that Steve Jobs did the demo for the original iPhone when

350
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,240
it was first announced and he showed off so many features that could go all in one.

351
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Like it could do all this stuff at the same time.

352
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
He could call people.

353
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
He could use these apps, et cetera, et cetera.

354
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Behind the scenes, like this was basically a lie that people just don't care about because

355
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,240
what was actually going on was behind the scenes, they had slapped together this like hodgepodge

356
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,240
piece of shit that technically was able to do just the exact features that were demonstrated.

357
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,240
But if he had done like anything out of sequence, the whole phone like would have exploded

358
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
and broke and things would have gone to shit.

359
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Like it happened to work correctly in this one small way that they created the demo for,

360
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,240
but like was this a functional piece that was actually ready to be shipped?

361
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
No.

362
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,240
And in a way, there is a deception there, which is similar to how like, for example,

363
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
like all these game trailers that are made and all this stuff is made like on super high-rig

364
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,240
PCs and shit that can run these kind of games at way better resolution,

365
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,240
have all kinds of like better graphics and they're eventually going to ship the thing with.

366
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,240
So you've got to know every time there's something like this, you're being lied to at least a little bit.

367
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Hippo, you said you wrote something down?

368
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Yeah, I wrote down my stance.

369
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I now understand what it is until I have experienced a thing.

370
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,240
It doesn't exist and there's no reason to have an opinion on it.

371
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
That's the best way to be.

372
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Also, I'm mostly hype about the things that I am going to make or I'm trying to make

373
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,240
because they're in my brain and I kind of skate there.

374
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Yeah.

375
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
So I'm hype about whatever I'm doing.

376
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,240
But other things that I don't know the entire backstory of,

377
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,240
I can only really feel anything about it once I have or as I am experiencing it.

378
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
The world should work like this.

379
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
People, and I wish it worked like this 100% of the time all the time.

380
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,240
A person who's making something is obsessed about it, is deep into it,

381
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,240
and doesn't talk about it to anyone.

382
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,240
They keep it to themselves.

383
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,240
They then release it and instantly completely forget about it

384
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,240
because it just exists as an isolated art piece that can never be touched or edited.

385
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Then they move on to something else and they do it again.

386
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,240
And everyone, they only know about this thing once it's out

387
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
and then can actually see what was produced.

388
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Judge it and then we work on it.

389
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Literally unworkable, but okay.

390
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
I normally don't know.

391
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Why is that unworkable?

392
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Because we live in a capitalist society where you have to make money,

393
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
so the hype cycle is necessary from a business standpoint.

394
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
Don't say that.

395
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Don't sound so disappointed, Tom.

396
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
You fucking call me this.

397
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
I'm not, because I like the hype cycle.

398
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I'm hype for Devil May Cry 5.

399
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I'm hype for the Doom Eternal.

400
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,240
I'm hype for fucking something else.

401
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
Metroid Prime 3.

402
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
Hey, did you see that?

403
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
Let me tell you, Tom.

404
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,240
You're making me realize, well not realize, I was already thinking about it,

405
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,240
but my big problem with what I call hype beasts

406
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,240
and specifically games that get that super hype culture around them,

407
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
not just games, I guess, anything,

408
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,240
but what I hate about the hype beast culture is that

409
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,240
so much energy and excitement gets put into something that's not out yet

410
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,240
and it makes it so nobody goes back.

411
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,240
People get so excited about what's coming next

412
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
and that's all they fixate on.

413
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
It's like, oh man, I can't wait for this game.

414
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
I'm saving up for this game.

415
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
You're already mentally making space for this game in your life

416
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,240
and it's like, dude, take that energy and just go play an old game.

417
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
That's great that you haven't played yet.

418
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
You can hype about that.

419
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
You can do both.

420
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
It's funny you mentioned that because I get the same,

421
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
I mean, I'm hype for all these new games

422
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,240
but at the same time, I'm working on a 16-bit retro style game right now

423
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,240
so I've just been blasting, I don't know if you've been hearing it from my room,

424
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,240
but like Mega Drive music like the entire time,

425
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
just to keep me in the mindset of it

426
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,240
and one of the tracks came on for TMNT Hyperstone Heights

427
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
and I'm like, whoa, this soundtrack is fucking legit

428
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
and then I got hype to play that game

429
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
and I want to go on eBand, I want to buy it, I want to play it

430
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
because it sounds cool.

431
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
I've always experienced-

432
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Just get hype for everything.

433
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Just be hype for everything that's cool.

434
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
I've always experienced from my friends

435
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
but nothing's cool.

436
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Oh my god.

437
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
God damn.

438
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,240
I can't even remember the last time I was hype.

439
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
That's why you're miserable then.

440
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Here's how I feel.

441
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Like, I see a thing, I see a cool game

442
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,240
and I think, boy, I wish that could make me feel something.

443
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
There's some deeper issues there, unfortunately.

444
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,240
I've always been around people who like,

445
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,240
they are just constantly looking forward to the next one

446
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
and like, my brother Victor,

447
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,240
he plays dozens and dozens of games.

448
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
God damn.

449
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Not at all.

450
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
When people complain about modern games-

451
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,240
What's in a century something interesting comes around?

452
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,240
I blame stagnation entirely on this hype culture

453
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,240
because it's always people getting hype about a new thing

454
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
and then it comes out and they all play it

455
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,240
and whether it ultimately turns out to be good or disappointing

456
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
will be sussed out in the aftermath

457
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,240
but the only reason that game gets played by so many people

458
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,240
is that it was hyped, is that the hype cycle existed

459
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,240
and so there's so many times where people will be like,

460
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
oh, modern games, they're so shitty

461
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,240
because every new big game that comes out sucks

462
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
and it's like, well, stop making big games,

463
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,240
stop making a big deal about a new game,

464
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,240
just go play something else that is revealed well.

465
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
It reminds me of a thing I wanted to,

466
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
because it's related to hype culture.

467
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
I don't particularly mind people getting hype,

468
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
people getting happy about things,

469
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
because it's not going to bother me, you know?

470
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
But what bothers me, though, a little bit

471
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,240
is pre-order culture, which is kind of like tied with...

472
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
I consider that a part of hype culture.

473
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,240
I've never pre-ordered a game and I never will.

474
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
Same here.

475
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
God damn it.

476
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,240
I was going to say, oh yeah, I'm big on...

477
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Alright, so I'm like a super late adopter of anything.

478
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,240
I really believe in letting other people do the work for me.

479
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
That's why you'll be happy someday, Ben.

480
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
You're just a late adopter of it.

481
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,240
I don't get hype for things that are coming out.

483
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Ben's a late adopter of food?

484
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
He prefers to let other people try it first

485
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,240
and then reach into the garbage to try what they've already tested.

486
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Cuts, let me fucking get this out.

487
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
I don't get hype for shit.

488
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
I'll be like, okay, whatever.

489
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,240
I'll let it come out, I'll let it be out for a year,

490
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
and I'll wait, and if people...

491
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,240
I only try anything if I hear it recommended by multiple people.

492
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
This is kind of my sort of...

493
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,240
The pattern I've fallen into is that I basically don't check out anything

494
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,240
unless multiple unrelated sources have told me,

495
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
like, this is cool, you should check it out.

496
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,240
You're the late majority slash laggard of the bell curve.

497
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
I am a laggard, yes.

498
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,240
I am a big laggard.

499
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
But at least I'm not a blaggard.

500
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Did anyone fucking get that joke?

501
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Yes, because I know that word.

502
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
You guys know that word?

503
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Okay, cool.

504
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
What does it mean?

505
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Viewers, if you don't know that word, fuck you.

506
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
How dare you?

507
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Laggard.

508
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
You probably say viewer...

509
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Hey, I'm calling you out.

510
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
You probably...

511
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,240
You probably say blackguard, you bitch.

512
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
That's a cool word, too, but...

513
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Yeah, but it's wrong.

514
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Yeah, alright.

515
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,240
All those times you played a Dungeons & Dragons

516
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,240
and you were a paladin and your DM was like,

517
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,240
I'm gonna be real clever and trick you into falling,

518
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,240
you were a blackguard, nope, you were wrong the whole time.

519
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
I always play an angel.

520
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
You were, in fact, a blaggard.

521
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Get fucked.

522
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Well, I mean, this topic is essentially,

523
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
I sure hate how reality is,

524
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
wish I could do anything about it,

525
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
you know, that's a shame.

526
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,240
I mean, yeah, that was my next point.

527
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Yeah, what's the deal with reality, anyway?

528
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
My next point was like the hype cycle,

529
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
like Tom was saying, that's like capitalism,

530
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
you have to do it, and I'm like, well,

531
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
I don't like it then, I don't like the system.

532
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Break the system.

533
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
If there's no way to change and there's nothing better,

534
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
I'm gonna make video games in the woods

535
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
and release them in the woods,

536
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
and you can only find them by digging under the trees

537
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
to find little cartridges.

538
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Ironically, if you did that and talked about it,

539
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
it would generate some hype.

540
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,240
I would only do it after it has fallen out of relevancy,

541
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
so they can't pre-order it.

542
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Pre-order your ditch and then you have to go find it.

543
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Um, yeah, I don't know, whatever.

544
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
We've talked about this enough.

545
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,240
In closing, Cyberpunk 2077 looks fucking lit

546
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
and I can't wait to see more of it.

547
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Get fucked.

548
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
I haven't looked into it.

549
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,240
I think it's also that I'm very easily

550
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,240
sated by things I've already done.

551
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Like, I replay a lot of games,

552
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
I rewatch a lot of things,

553
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,240
you know, I've rewatched like most of John Grumps

554
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,240
and a lot of Dan Grumps, like multiple times over,

555
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
and all that.

556
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
I find a thing that I like and I stay with it

557
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,240
and I don't really feel the need to see anything new.

558
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,240
That brings me to a question for everybody.

559
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,240
How easy is it for you to get recommendations?

560
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Because for me, the reason that I go out of my way

561
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,240
to watch every single anime

562
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,240
is that I've never known anybody

563
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,240
with close enough taste of mine to rely on them.

564
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,240
And that kind of goes for all mediums.

565
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,240
I think most people have a critic who they're like,

566
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
oh, this guy has the same taste as me,

567
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,240
so whatever he gives a positive score, I'll check out.

568
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Or they more broadly can just go to Metacritic

569
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,240
and whatever is broadly considered good,

570
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
they end up liking.

571
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
In my case, it's so unreliable

572
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
because so often the thing I like

573
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
will be talked about by nobody

574
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
or it'll be totally underrated,

575
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
and then the thing that everybody loves I watch

576
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
is fucking terrible.

577
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
I've just been like, fuck it, I can't rely on anyone,

578
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
I'm just going to consume absolutely everything.

579
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
I used to be entirely Metacritic and stuff-driven.

580
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
I used to be like, oh, this game got a good review

581
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
because I had GamePro and EGM

582
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,240
and all those mags back in the day,

583
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
and that's how I made my purchasing decisions.

584
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
But there were a couple of times when I've played games,

585
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,240
like the last five or so years,

586
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
that were critically either panned

587
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
or just okay that I thought were fantastic.

588
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
So my new thing is just like,

589
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
it just looks cool, I'm going to give it a shot.

590
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,240
I don't care if it has like a one, maybe I'll like it

591
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
because they're not me and they don't know

592
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
what I would enjoy, they just know what they enjoy

593
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,240
and fuck them, I'm better.

594
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
When it comes to getting recommendations,

595
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
and I feel like a lot of people

596
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
probably feel the same way,

597
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
it's incredibly hard for me to like,

598
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
even you people,

599
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
even anyone in my life,

600
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,240
it's incredibly hard for me to take a recommendation seriously.

601
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
Like for example,

602
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
I've been doing streams for a while

603
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
and there's been people in there saying like,

604
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Nate, watch this movie Gattica

605
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
from 1997, this guy Chakuto

606
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
and a bunch of other people

607
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
were meming me to watch Gattica

608
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
and they were trying in little ways to tell me

609
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
why I would like it so much.

610
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
It's very utilitarian, it's very like,

611
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
try real hard and overcome the odds

612
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
and I finally gave it a watch.

613
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Battlestar Gattica.

614
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Gattica, yeah, that's it.

615
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Yeah, classic.

616
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
It was good and I did enjoy it,

617
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
but it took literally months

618
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
of these people meming me over and over

619
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
to watch it before I would give in.

620
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Whereas, if I just go,

621
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
this is what I do, this is how I actually get recommendations.

622
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
I go to people who I don't know who they are

623
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
so I don't know if I should

624
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
or should not trust them, which is just 4chan.

625
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
I just go to 4chan,

626
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
look to see what anybody likes

627
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
and I'm like, that's the thing.

628
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
This person, they've got no stake in this,

629
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
I'll go watch the thing they recommended

630
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
because they liked it.

631
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
The best thing, I'll tell you, the best board on 4chan

632
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
for recommending things is Mew

633
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
and it's because not only do they have

634
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
tons of charts for every conceivable genre,

635
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
so if you like a specific genre you can use that,

636
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
but it's pretty normal

637
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
on there to post chart threads

638
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
where people will have literally their top 100 albums

639
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
and that's such a huge sample size

640
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
that if I find someone

641
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
who's got 20 of the same albums I like,

642
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I can be like, okay,

643
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
I'll listen to some of the shit in this guy's top 10

644
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
and see if I'll like it

645
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
and even then it's rare that I even find anything

646
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
but I don't know,

647
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
it seems like I've just got

648
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
to traverse this insane amount

649
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
of crap to find anything

650
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
that I'm going to like

651
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
but I consider myself really good

652
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
at recommending stuff to people.

653
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
I don't recommend things often, but if I see something

654
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
I think one of you guys will like,

655
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm usually pretty confident about it

656
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
and I usually get positive feedback

657
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
on it, so I hope I've been

658
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
a good recommender.

659
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Music seems like a format

660
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
where you'll like,

661
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
because it's like brief, you can consume a lot

662
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
so I can see why you do a lot.

663
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
It's a lot easier to just burn through,

664
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
and you can tell pretty quickly

665
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
you can listen to the first song on an album

666
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
and usually get a good sense

667
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
of if this is your vibe,

668
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
you know?

669
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
I feel the same way about anime though,

670
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
I can watch like three minutes

671
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
of how contentious.

672
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
For me, it's a little hard

673
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
if someone comes up to me and they're like,

674
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
hey, it seems like you're singing

675
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
and it depends on my mood

676
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
and how I'm feeling that day,

677
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
if I feel like watching anime,

678
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
I might give it a watch, but that's a very big might,

679
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
but most of the time

680
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
the more people recommend something to me,

681
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
the less inclined I am to watch it,

682
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
so for instance a lot of people,

683
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
I haven't watched Evangelion

684
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
and people always greet me

685
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
like, yes, whenever I say that,

686
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
it's like, you haven't seen that.

687
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
I don't really think you would like Ava.

688
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
That would not strike me as your taste.

689
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
I recommend you Angels of Death.

690
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
I know you'll like that show.

691
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
I don't know about Ava.

692
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Yeah, I don't like Mecha's

693
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
and it's an old anime,

694
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
which, I mean, all the enemies can be good,

695
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
but first of all, Ava's not old

696
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
and second of all, it's not really

697
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,240
that mecha-driven.

698
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
You know what they say?

699
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Mecha-driven anime of my anime is my friend.

700
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
Well, it's just like

701
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
the mecha genre

702
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
is probably the most sorely

703
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
misunderstood genre in anime

704
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,240
because people always say like,

705
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
oh, I don't care about mecha

706
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
and it's like mecha shows are always about characters.

707
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
They're always about...

708
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
they're just like any other show.

709
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,240
They're just a show where,

710
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
instead of superpowers, we have robots.

711
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
That's the only difference.

712
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
That's the thing to like...

713
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
I know, you said this before

714
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
and I did take note,

715
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
but the thing is for me,

716
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
there's a lot of anime

717
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
out there and

718
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
why should I force myself to watch

719
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
an anime in a setting

720
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
that I don't particularly like?

721
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
I don't really like sci-fi or robots.

722
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
I really think that with anime,

723
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
the fetish is the point,

724
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,240
as I've said in my

725
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
the purpose of anime video.

726
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
And I really would say this about all art

727
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
is all basically saying the same shit.

728
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
The messages are all pretty

729
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
similar at the core of it.

730
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
It's either about understanding yourself

731
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
or about understanding how you fit into society.

732
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
That's a good summary of

733
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,240
my point in my last

734
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
We Agua, why manga is better than anime.

735
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Where I just said, look, I just like anime.

736
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
That's why I watch it.

737
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
I could just read a book about the same shit.

738
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
I just like the things that are generally going on here.

739
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Yeah, and that's the thing.

740
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
All art

741
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
is basically trying to get to the same couple of

742
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
points. So the question is

743
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
what is it that resonates with you

744
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
specifically?

745
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Let's say that there's a hero's journey,

746
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
for instance. There's like 10 million things

747
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
that are the hero's journey.

748
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
But if you

749
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
don't feel like you connect

750
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
with the broad bell

751
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
curve idea of the hero,

752
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
then you need a different hero

753
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
to take that journey.

754
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
So that's why

755
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
there's always people who are like...

756
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,240
They try to make the same show

757
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
except the protagonist is a girl.

758
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Or the same show except it's a black guy.

759
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Just because it might be easier

760
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
for certain people to connect with

761
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
even though it's basically the same story.

762
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
There's a value to that.

763
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
So I think that with anime

764
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
it's for autistic people.

765
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
If you can't

766
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,240
relate to live action stuff,

767
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
then you need something where the characters

768
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
are openly expressive

769
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,240
and have big Mimi

770
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,240
hype shit because you're dumb.

771
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
So that's why we all...

772
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
You can't just like the aesthetic of anime

773
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
without being literally autistic.

774
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Why is that not allowed?

775
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Why?

776
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
Because have you ever met someone

777
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,240
who liked anime and wasn't autistic?

778
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Have you looked in the mirror, Nate?

779
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
My parents' generation don't even understand

780
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
what cartoons are

781
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
or that you can convey emotion in animation.

782
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
But I do get... What am I going to do?

783
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
I'm going to watch Seinfeld and pretend

784
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
that that gives me all the stuff that...

785
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Like you said, I'm sure there's a live action

786
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
movie with a hero's journey in it

787
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
that means... I don't know

788
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,240
with themes of overpopulation exactly the same

789
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,240
as like Gurren Lagan. Why can't I

790
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,240
just like the way

791
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
Gurren Lagan tells that story

792
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
without being literally autistic

793
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,240
because I'm not looking at

794
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
actual live actors, whatever.

795
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
What's with this obsession

796
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
with autism all the time, dude? I don't get it.

797
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,240
What's going on here? You're always bringing it up.

798
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Please explain to me why everything's

799
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
about autism. Am I missing something here?

800
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
It would take too long. I don't want to go through that again.

801
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Did you watch the Only Yesterday podcast?

802
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Uh, no, but I...

803
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
Go watch that. I go on and on

804
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
and on about it in that.

805
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
But anyway,

806
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
I'm sorry.

807
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
Point just being that it's all about

808
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
the fetishistic elements.

809
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
There's no reason to watch one anime

810
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
over another other than

811
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,240
that this one resonates with you

812
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
as opposed to that one.

813
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
There's no real... I don't think it's

814
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,240
defensible to say like, oh

815
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,240
you have to watch this show because

816
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
it's deep. It's like, no.

817
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
All anime is about the same shit. Ava

818
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
is about the same goddamn shit as anything else.

819
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
It's an extremely well

820
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
told story and that makes it

821
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
a great show. I fucking love it.

822
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
But if someone's like, oh, I

823
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,240
don't care for this aesthetic, I'd be like,

824
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,240
well then go watch something with

825
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
an aesthetic you do care for.

826
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Which is why Mage needs to watch Angels of Death

827
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
because it is literally

828
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
mage the show.

829
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
It has a cute spooky boy with the

830
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,240
scythe and they like it already.

831
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Excellent.

832
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Getting back

833
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
to the whole recommendation

834
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
thing, I've thought about it

835
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,240
and it's always been really

836
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
difficult for people to recommend me things

837
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
and I don't think

838
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
anyone can. When it comes to like

839
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
gaming at YouTube

840
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
reviews of things

841
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
there's no like gaming

842
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
reviewer that I actually go to for advice

843
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,240
or like a recommendation.

844
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
I usually just watch them for entertainment

845
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
or just like

846
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
an exhaustive look at something.

847
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
Mathematosis comes the closest

848
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
but that's because what he talks about is basically

849
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,240
everything. The only actual reviewer

850
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
who's like decent

851
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
the only actual reviewer I could actually watch

852
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
not for the jokes is basically

853
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,240
Super Bunny Hop because everyone else

854
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,240
will put it like, for example like a

855
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
Kadikaris or even a ProJarad. They put

856
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,240
too many terrible jokes in their

857
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,240
content to actually be enjoyable

858
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
whereas Super Bunny Hop is like kind of light hearted

859
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,240
but really it's just like a real journalist

860
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,240
who will do the due diligence and I can respect.

861
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
I was going to say that

862
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
because it's so difficult

863
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
for people to recommend me things and there's nobody

864
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
out there that really understands

865
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
exactly my thing, the way that

866
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,240
I do, that's the reason I

867
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
have this whole thing of wanting

868
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
to analyze the games that I like

869
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,240
so that I understand

870
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
what about them is the good part

871
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
and so I can understand that in new

872
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
games if I see them. I'm pretty confident

873
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
that I could recommend you things

874
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,240
it's just that I feel like you've played

875
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
anything I would recommend you

876
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
and I don't know if that's because

877
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
there's not enough games you would like or if

878
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
it's because I don't know enough games

879
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
but like I feel confident

880
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
I could find you shit you'd enjoy

881
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,240
well maybe. Have you ever played

882
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Shantelies?

883
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
I think you'd probably enjoy that.

884
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
That's the one with the

885
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,240
I did cool girl games on it

886
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
yeah, way back

887
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
the biggest failure of my entire channel

888
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
I liked the look of that, that was kind of cute looking

889
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,240
yeah I think you'd enjoy that game

890
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
it's pretty short too so

891
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
if you felt like playing a random steam game

892
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
I don't think it would be like your favorite or anything

893
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
but I think

894
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
well we need a new topic here

895
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
I'm sorry I wasn't

896
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
paying attention I've been swiping

897
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Tinder sluts

898
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
that's what I'm up to bitches

899
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
yeah

900
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
just a cavalcade

901
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
just a cavalcade of fucking

902
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
sluts

903
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
I wonder how that's going Ben

904
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
oh it's just

905
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
who's this we got Angela

906
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
sounds like a slut

907
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
yeah

908
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
she's got a nose ring

909
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
what? yeah we're in

910
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,240
we're in boys

911
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
this is going down

912
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Angela I would like to apologize

913
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
on behalf of the procrastinators podcast

914
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
for the words we've said against you

915
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
so you know

916
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
that's what I'm up to

917
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
locking them down left and right

918
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
back on the games though

919
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,240
I've been

920
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
oh god damn it

921
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
not more games

922
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
last week I was ill like I said

923
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
and during my ill time

924
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
I found a game on 3DS

925
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
and I've been playing it

926
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
and it's like it's really mediocre

927
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
like it doesn't stand out too much

928
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,240
it has some interesting ideas and stuff

929
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
that's what I want to hear about mage on my podcast

930
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
tell me about these mediocre games

931
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
the thing is like I've been

932
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
having so much fun with it

933
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
despite like it's like I kind of

934
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
wanted to recommend it to someone

935
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
but then I thought like

936
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
well it doesn't really stand out too much

937
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
from other like JRPGs

938
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,240
what is it what game is it

939
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
it has a long title one of my gripes with it

940
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
seventh dragon 3

941
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
code

942
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
something something it's like a three letter word code

943
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
god what is this is this the next kingdom hearts

944
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
spin off kingdom hearts

945
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
seventh dragon 3

946
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
that's less ridiculous than you'd think

947
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
it has a really neat system of like

948
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,240
all the playable characters that you can play

949
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
can actually choose the appearance

950
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
of the name even voice

951
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
I really like that you can choose their voices

952
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
and class as well

953
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
and you can change those at any time

954
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
so

955
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
I do feel sometimes

956
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
that I enjoy

957
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,240
complete shit

958
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
and I don't know why

959
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,240
that's how I feel about music

960
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
like sometimes there'll be like

961
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,240
my love of nightcore is well documented

962
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
oh I actually made a video about that

963
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
the puzzle

964
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
the puzzle pirates video is a video about a game

965
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
that is kind of terrible but I just

966
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
enjoy it so much for no reason

967
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
then I think that nightcore

968
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
much like Eurobeat

969
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
is inherently good

970
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
like I don't really

971
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I don't really think you can make

972
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
I don't think you can make a nightcore

973
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
or Eurobeat song that is not enjoyable

974
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
are you sure

975
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
you guys are talking about the same kind of nightcore

976
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
you could definitely pick the wrong song

977
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
I haven't listened to that much nightcore

978
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
but like it's one of those things

979
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
where like just inherently the style of it

980
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
is there all the same song basically

981
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
are we I mean technically

982
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
all you have to do is to find a nightcore

983
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,240
as speeding up a song and raising the pitch

984
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
technically all nightcore is

985
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
is just a song sped up

986
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
do that and technically it's nightcore

987
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
what happens if you speed up a nightcore song

988
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
that's a good question

989
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
what a nightcore song always is though

990
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
is some kind of Japanese dance song

991
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
sped up and pitch shifted up

992
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,240
or

993
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
come clean by Hilary Duff

994
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
recommendation

995
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
obviously there's a lot of meme nightcore out there

996
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,240
that doesn't fall into the category of

997
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
what I'm talking about but like

998
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
the vast majority of nightcore

999
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,240
is just sped up Japanese dance songs

1000
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
I can't agree that

1001
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
I want to relate a story

1002
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
because like of the beats

1003
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
like being fast

1004
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
and stuff and it's fun

1005
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
I wouldn't say

1006
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
I wouldn't go as far as to say all nightcore

1007
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
is inherently good

1008
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
I want to relate a story

1009
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
from my real life from my real internet life

1010
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
so me and Munchie

1011
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
were commentating on the soul cup

1012
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
on the twitch.tv

1013
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
slash rowdy frickers cop killers

1014
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
the stakes were high

1015
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
I won't go into what that was all about

1016
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
but it was a Pokemon tournament with incredibly high narrative

1017
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
stakes and

1018
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
I've developed a habit

1019
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
of when people use

1020
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
weather conditions I play nightcore songs

1021
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,240
and when people use rain

1022
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
when people use rain dance and summon the rain

1023
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
in a Pokemon tournament

1024
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,240
I always put on

1025
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
come clean by Hilary Duff

1026
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,240
because the lyrics of that song are about rain

1027
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
and it's really

1028
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
let the rain fall down and break my dreams

1029
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
let it wash away

1030
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
my sanity, yes

1031
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
and it's great

1032
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,240
low-fi hip-hop also is a genre

1033
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
that's just inherently good

1034
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
and that's when I have very little exposure to it

1035
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
granted all of you

1036
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
have watched some YouTube analysis

1037
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
all of these genres I'm talking about

1038
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,240
none of them are ever great

1039
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
except for

1040
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
running in the 90s is the only great Eurobeat song

1041
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,240
that's a great song

1042
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
but all of these genres

1043
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
every song is basically the same

1044
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
and

1045
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
none of them are memorable

1046
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
you just kind of listen to it

1047
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
and you can leave it on for hours

1048
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
and it just creates a feeling

1049
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
that you can perpetuate all day

1050
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
and that's why low-fi hip-hop is always in a stream

1051
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,240
because it's just like a 24 hour stream

1052
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,240
of fucking

1053
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
this vibe

1054
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,240
and you'll never pay attention to it

1055
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,240
maybe you'll catch an Alan Watts quote here

1056
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
in there

1057
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
it's like going into

1058
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
a restaurant where there's just a guy

1059
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
doodling on the piano

1060
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
the room of vibe

1061
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,240
of some sort of jazziness

1062
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
oh no he's doodling on the piano

1063
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,240
doodling

1064
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
incidentally

1065
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,240
I know that probably this is how a lot of people

1066
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,240
feel about Future Funk

1067
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
but I would say that Future Funk is boring

1068
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,240
and shitty

1069
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,240
I got some Future Spunk for ya

1070
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,240
how about that

1071
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,240
I like the electricity

1072
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,240
I should listen more to that

1073
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,240
save that

1074
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Future Spunk for the Tinder Sluts

1075
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
let's talk some more about Tinder Sluts guys

1076
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,240
okay

1077
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,240
did she respond yet

1078
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,240
that whore

1079
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,240
she did actually

1080
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
but talking about a real conversation

1081
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
is a little uncomfortable for me

1082
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
so let's change the topic on second thought

1083
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,240
I have nothing but respect for all women

1084
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,240
especially Angela

1085
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
but moving on

1086
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
I uh

1087
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
what

1088
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
responding to a man on Tinder

1089
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
Jesus Christ Angela

1090
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,240
what the fuck

1091
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
every time a girl responds to me I just roll

1092
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,240
I was like oh god

1093
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,240
desperate much

1094
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
I would have topics but I'm still

1095
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
like trying to pull my mind back

1096
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,240
from the august void

1097
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,240
of making a video every day

1098
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,240
yeah hey that was something

1099
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
I mean you've done it before

1100
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,240
I did Miyama but better and for free

1101
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,240
you know you're not wrong

1102
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
but I mean uh

1103
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
people don't like give you credit

1104
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
I guess just cause you didn't talk about but you did a Miyama

1105
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,240
for long before I did

1106
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
and for what it's worth

1107
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
you just didn't give it a catchy name

1108
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,240
that was your problem

1109
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
and you did this one either

1110
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
back in October 2014

1111
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,240
the one from last time was like

1112
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
way worse

1113
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
cause like by the end

1114
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
like the whole last week of it was like

1115
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
horse shit like just vlogs

1116
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
and like bad memes and

1117
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,240
and even before then most of the videos were just like

1118
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
not that amazing like

1119
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
with this month it was I was holding myself

1120
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,240
to a higher standard I wanted every video to at

1121
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,240
minimum be something that you would go back

1122
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
and watch again conceivably

1123
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
like not just stuff that was there to

1124
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
just fill a day

1125
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
though there were a couple of vlogs that were kind of like that

1126
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,240
in our town but um

1127
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
it was a fucking waking nightmare it was hell

1128
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
and I regretted it

1129
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
except that it worked so

1130
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
I was curious about that how much prep work did you put in

1131
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
like cause obviously some big videos

1132
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,240
zero did it all during that month

1133
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,240
literally I didn't have

1134
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,240
a plan to do this until like 7pm

1135
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,240
the night before

1136
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,240
like I just I was sitting there

1137
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,240
trying to figure out like what am I gonna do

1138
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,240
to resurrect my channel

1139
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
I have no idea and then I was like

1140
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,240
I guess if I did a video every day for a month

1141
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,240
that would make something happen

1142
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,240
so I just went into my discord and I said

1143
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,240
who wants to bet against me that I can't do a video every day

1144
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,240
all month and uh

1145
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,240
and then I did it

1146
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
no one has ever regretted to my knowledge

1147
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
this whole like do a

1148
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
video per month thing

1149
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,240
unless they gave up and failed

1150
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,240
or if they uh

1151
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,240
I mean you'll feel tired and exhausted

1152
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,240
but no one has ever regretted doing it

1153
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,240
if they want their channel to grow

1154
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,240
like a fucking million view video

1155
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
that you made in there

1156
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
I think I could have gotten away with doing a video

1157
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
every other day

1158
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
and spent a little bit more time on each video

1159
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
and therefore been able to make stuff that was like

1160
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,240
that had more growth potential

1161
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,240
even that

1162
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
people like

1163
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
even just like one gap

1164
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,240
of a day makes

1165
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,240
so much of a difference in like the viewing habits

1166
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
of people when they're expecting a digital

1167
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
video every day

1168
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,240
and people like PewDiePie

1169
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,240
they do it every single day

1170
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
so we know this is a winning formula

1171
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
that's what I would love to do

1172
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,240
someday if I could eventually get to that point

1173
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
generate that much content and stuff

1174
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,240
though obviously the kind of content I ideally want to make

1175
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,240
is a little more high effort

1176
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
but still

1177
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,240
I'm a big fan of this kind of shotgun approach

1178
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
of like forcing yourself to make content

1179
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,240
to a timeline

1180
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,240
like you said you would not have made

1181
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,240
this fucking your million view video

1182
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,240
by the way it was a great video that I was totally

1183
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,240
on board with and absolutely loved

1184
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
I think that the thing about it is that

1185
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,240
at some point

1186
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,240
I was like waking up at like 3pm

1187
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,240
for most of the month

1188
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,240
and I'd set myself

1189
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,240
like the stipulation

1190
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,240
no one really made me do this

1191
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
but I just kind of took it for granted

1192
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
that I had to get them out by midnight

1193
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
so it was usually like wake up at 3pm

1194
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,240
and then spend the next 7 hours

1195
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
in a cold sweat

1196
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
trying to figure out

1197
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,240
what the hell am I going to do by midnight

1198
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,240
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck

1199
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,240
and then there's a few times

1200
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,240
I'd have to like throw out the thing

1201
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
and in the meantime

1202
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,240
in order to keep my soul in any way active

1203
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,240
like usually what would happen is

1204
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,240
I would get the video done

1205
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,240
right around midnight

1206
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,240
post it and then afterwards

1207
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,240
instead of working on the next day's video

1208
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,240
I would do anything else

1209
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,240
creative with my time

1210
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
make some songs or like do anything else

1211
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
because like

1212
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
it was just so exhausting to be thinking about the videos

1213
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
all the time but then that meant every day

1214
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,240
it was like a crunch

1215
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,240
it was always like

1216
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
I don't really get started until like 8pm

1217
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,240
and then it's just like a mad dash till midnight

1218
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,240
damn son

1219
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,240
but I

1220
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
explained this to Tom on a

1221
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,240
livestream last night that I think

1222
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,240
what it

1223
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
the approach that I took to it that made it work

1224
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,240
I would advise this to anybody who's trying to like

1225
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,240
make content on a timetable

1226
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
or make content fast is

1227
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,240
that

1228
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,240
the first thing you should think about is

1229
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,240
what can I do

1230
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
in this time frame

1231
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,240
not what do I have ideas for

1232
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,240
but like okay I have

1233
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,240
5 hours to work with

1234
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,240
what can I do in 5 hours

1235
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,240
and then like figure that out

1236
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,240
and so the whole month was just like

1237
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,240
it was just nonstop experiments

1238
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,240
and like what is a style of video

1239
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,240
I can do that would be relatively satisfying

1240
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,240
that can be done in this short of a time

1241
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,240
so like a single

1242
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,240
episode analysis or

1243
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,240
like a reaction

1244
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,240
watch along kind of thing or just like

1245
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
you know any random opinion piece

1246
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,240
that I don't require

1247
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,240
like editing that would require me to

1248
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,240
like go through a show and find specific moments

1249
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
if it's something that I could just

1250
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
you know brain blast and then like record screen footage

1251
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,240
or hand held footage

1252
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,240
like anything that is

1253
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,240
easier to create

1254
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,240
you know go for that

1255
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,240
and so take note of this people this is

1256
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,240
important stuff if you want to be a content creator

1257
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,240
it's so important to shape

1258
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,240
the stuff that you make to the reality

1259
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,240
of your life and the world you're in

1260
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,240
you gotta think of that first

1261
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,240
that's exactly how I fucked up

1262
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
my career so badly as to necessitate

1263
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,240
this because

1264
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
at the time when we were planning to move to Boston

1265
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,240
I decided to launch into doing this

1266
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,240
how they marketed thing

1267
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,240
and the conceit of that series was that it was

1268
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,240
going to take a lot of time

1269
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,240
to make the reality like

1270
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,240
it was going to take a lot of actual marketing

1271
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,240
I was going to pay a lot of people to be involved

1272
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
and it was like

1273
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,240
the videos were going to be huge so it was going to be like

1274
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,240
one a month at best

1275
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,240
and

1276
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,240
that took me away

1277
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,240
like it meant that I wasn't putting anything out and so

1278
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,240
I kind of disappeared and then

1279
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,240
I had to move so that extended

1280
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
me disappearing and so there's like two months where I wasn't

1281
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
really doing anything and my Patreon just plummeted

1282
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
and granted that's partly because

1283
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
I didn't have everyone's goodwill

1284
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,240
necessarily because I was making

1285
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,240
videos in so many different styles that

1286
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,240
everything I was making would satisfy

1287
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,240
someone but none of it

1288
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
satisfied everyone so like

1289
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,240
for instance early this year

1290
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,240
in like January or February

1291
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,240
I put like a lot of effort

1292
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,240
into these two videos that I made on the turntable channel

1293
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,240
that have like 2,000 views

1294
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,240
a piece so like

1295
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
you know that's like a lot of

1296
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,240
my energy that's me putting as much effort

1297
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,240
into those as I would into

1298
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,240
probably more into those than I would

1299
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,240
into a main channel video and yet

1300
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,240
like even among my Patrons not that many people

1301
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,240
watched it so from their perspective

1302
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
I just didn't make anything from their perspective

1303
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
it's like oh I haven't gotten any Digi content

1304
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,240
and so like it's from

1305
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,240
that point that standpoint of like

1306
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
everyone's a little disappointed

1307
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
that I then was like oh well

1308
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,240
I'll make everybody happy again by making

1309
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,240
a big thing and then I

1310
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,240
disappear to go make the big thing and they're all like

1311
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
oh I guess Digi's fucked off let's unpatron

1312
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,240
and now I'm like oh I couldn't

1313
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,240
I can't afford that I can't

1314
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,240
afford to make big thing while everyone's

1315
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,240
unpatroning and I just moved into a more expensive

1316
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,240
place so you know and then that

1317
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,240
becomes well alright

1318
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,240
because me and Tom throughout July

1319
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,240
were planning some like really big

1320
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,240
shit that would have also

1321
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,240
been like a long time build up kind of

1322
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,240
thing and it was a great idea

1323
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,240
and I'll talk to you guys about it

1324
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,240
sometime but like

1325
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,240
it was just like this will take time to make

1326
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,240
real that's not the right time

1327
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,240
to be doing that yeah I don't have time

1328
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
like I need money now I am like

1329
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,240
you know I am coming at

1330
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,240
out of each month with less money than I

1331
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,240
went into the month with and that is terrifying

1332
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,240
you know so

1333
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,240
so like yeah so that's

1334
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,240
that's why it became okay let's take

1335
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,240
the opposite approach what can I do

1336
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,240
in three hours that can get a million views

1337
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,240
you know well just one one thing I was

1338
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,240
wondering about was just like your Shinsekai

1339
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,240
your video is like a 40 minute analysis

1340
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,240
video that clearly was like

1341
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,240
was like DeVu working on that like during the

1342
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,240
month DeVu worked on that literally

1343
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240
the entire month and

1344
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,240
still alright that's what I thought

1345
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,240
but and you got it up like

1346
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,240
so close to the edge right but you did

1347
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
it was it was late actually but I

1348
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,240
put out a I put out a contingency

1349
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,240
video right before midnight

1350
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,240
that was just like a two minute meme video

1351
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,240
oh that's funny and then

1352
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,240
and then I unlisted that but you can find

1353
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
it in the every every YouTube video featuring

1354
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,240
DigiBro playlist Nate you'll love that I check the thing

1355
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,240
it says it came out the 31st at least on my

1356
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,240
on my YouTube it depends on your time zone

1357
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
because YouTube is

1358
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,240
in California time so it was on time

1359
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,240
in California time well see I'm not holding

1360
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,240
you to any kind of crazy standard here because I got

1361
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
many of my meme amount of videos out

1362
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,240
after midnight but before I like went to sleep

1363
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,240
or anything right the nights that I

1364
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,240
so day doesn't end until you sleep

1365
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,240
but yeah the how

1366
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,240
because how they marketed is also like a

1367
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,240
fully edited experience and that one

1368
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,240
DeVu had finished before the month started

1369
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,240
and like I

1370
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,240
I had to do a bit for

1371
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,240
question about how they marketed

1372
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,240
did someone request

1373
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,240
an ad for patreon.com

1374
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,240
slash Ben saying who

1375
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,240
because I saw it and I was like

1376
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,240
I didn't what's this

1377
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,240
almost nothing that was advertised was

1378
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,240
like the person themselves

1379
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,240
you know it was like always people asking

1380
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,240
it seemed like it was a bunch of a bunch

1381
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,240
of goofs a bunch of goofs and memes

1382
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,240
for the most part I mean I guess I actually

1383
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,240
you know don't have anything that they

1384
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,240
want to advertise so I was thinking about

1385
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,240
this did you I've actually been seriously thinking

1386
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
about like how to like increase like ad

1387
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,240
presence in my stuff I haven't done anything yet

1388
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,240
but I'm thinking about it and what you've done with

1389
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,240
with how they market has given

1390
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,240
me some very good ideas I'm just thinking

1391
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,240
about like I don't know whatever Alex Jones

1392
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,240
got banned on YouTube etc everyone's getting

1393
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,240
banned if you do bad things I'm like okay

1394
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,240
what can we do if like ads

1395
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,240
go away main YouTube ads

1396
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,240
the solution is pretty clear

1397
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,240
and obviously this would take a lot of work to get into place

1398
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,240
but like like

1399
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,240
like this individual paid ads

1400
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,240
during ad breaks that you would otherwise have which

1401
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,240
I built into me a math from the start

1402
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,240
Arab we ag was that is

1403
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
and then like you do through

1404
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,240
through patreon but like you could do it through any

1405
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,240
means and having specific people

1406
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,240
advertise stuff whether it's like a dick

1407
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,240
shaving butt or whatever the fuck that is

1408
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,240
or individual people on patreon or any kind of connection

1409
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,240
thing I'm just like this is just such a good

1410
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,240
idea to do something like this

1411
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,240
makes all the sense in the world and it doesn't

1412
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,240
rely on YouTube to like

1413
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,240
you suck a lot I mean there is a

1414
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,240
thing about that because yeah I think YouTube

1415
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
doesn't can tell

1416
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,240
if like if somebody says

1417
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,240
like reports you for having a paid

1418
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,240
promotion in the video and you don't list it

1419
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,240
and well I would just make sure that I

1420
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,240
like it then YouTube can just take your

1421
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,240
video down if you're promoting Alex Jones

1422
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,240
or something well like something

1423
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,240
controversial things then I guess you know

1424
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,240
like you have the option as a businessman

1425
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
to choose what you do and do not use as an

1426
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,240
advertisement in your content so I

1427
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
certainly would exercise that authority

1428
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,240
if I was going to but like it's

1429
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,240
still you're still under the

1430
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,240
jurisdiction of YouTube it's not like an escape

1431
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,240
from all that well yeah

1432
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,240
but I mean let's if you got well you could do

1433
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,240
this on another site like daily motion or

1434
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,240
what the fuck

1435
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,240
hey the bonus episode for the PCP went live

1436
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,240

1437
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,240

1444
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,240
Ben Saint here you might have heard

1445
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,240
him he did the editing

1446
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,240
and the animation

1447
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,240
for the new bonus episode

1448
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,240
what's it about oh talking while eating

1449
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,240
talking while eating

1450
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,240
five dollars people patreon.com

1451
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,240
slash the procrastinators

1452
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,240
the editing and the animation

1453
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,240
Ben did is truly

1454
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,240
I would say

1455
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,240
that I would say that I took Hippo's

1456
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,240
seed of an idea

1457
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,240
for how to make an episode look good

1458
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,240
and then rendered it completely

1459
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,240
obsolete

1460
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,240
no

1461
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,240
wrong

1462
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,240
see if you can post last episode

1463
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,240
make you look stupid

1464
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,240
I'm loving this arms race

1465
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,240
of increasingly good PCP animation

1466
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,240
by the way

1467
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,240
that's what made the early PCP

1468
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,240
great was the arms race of editing

1469
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,240
I still want to try and edit

1470
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,240
once I'm back home

1471
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,240
do it mage just get

1472
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,240
after effects

1473
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,240
but in the early days it was mostly about

1474
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,240
the intro segments

1475
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,240
there was a brief flirtation

1476
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,240
with the animated

1477
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,240
color bars around the names

1478
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,240
and then it was kind of like dropped

1479
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,240
and then the arms race was in the intros

1480
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,240
and then nobody cared for a while

1481
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,240
and then now we're back to being

1482
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,240
we're holding ourselves to a higher standard

1483
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,240
now now that we're making more money

1484
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,240
it's worth our time

1485
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,240
what the hell are we talking about

1486
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,240
before we got sidetracked by this

1487
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,240
we were talking about

1488
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,240
your month of videos

1489
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,240
and the shinsukai yori and timing

1490
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,240
and stuff

1491
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,240
that's what it was

1492
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,240
I got to tell ben that it was

1493
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,240
someone named heavy roman

1494
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,240
who paid for that ad

1495
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,240
he is not a patron of you

1496
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,240
heavy roman

1497
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,240
kippo you wanted to say something

1498
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,240
well

1499
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,240
he's done his part

1500
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,240
so he's excused from patroning

1501
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,240
did you think of that ad by the way

1502
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,240
did you like it

1503
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,240
I kind of like

1504
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,240
just didn't notice it at first

1505
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,240
I don't really remember

1506
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,240
the actual content of it

1507
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,240
it's just

1508
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,240
the four panels of the guy

1509
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,240
sniffing that rock and then exploding

1510
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,240
oh yeah

1511
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,240
all that's right

1512
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,240
sent to the metroid theme

1513
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,240
did he make the ad

1514
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,240
no I made all the ads

1515
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,240
oh you made the ad

1516
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,240
well I was surprised that you went with beastcapades

1517
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
but I'm not against it

1518
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,240
it's the thing what I requested

1519
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,240
it was your suggestion

1520
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,240
yes I am happy I am pleased

1521
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,240
what was her suggestion

1522
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,240
that commands

1523
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,240
eat the rain

1524
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,240
oh yeah

1525
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,240
the thing is

1526
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,240
that with your comics

1527
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,240
making

1528
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,240
I don't know how to convert your art to video

1529
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,240
because most of it's black and white

1530
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,240
and it's in a page

1531
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,240
I don't know how to convey it

1532
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,240
with beastcapades because all the images are the same size

1533
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,240
and there was more color

1534
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,240
I knew it would be easier to

1535
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,240
represent

1536
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,240
to do a paneling on screen

1537
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,240
where they'd all be the same size

1538
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,240
and it was just a really exciting page

1539
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,240
because it was all visual

1540
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,240
there's no text or anything

1541
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,240
I remember now

1542
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,240
and I remember that

1543
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,240
the beat drops or whatever

1544
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,240
when it explodes

1545
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,240
and I was like yeah

1546
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,240
bring back beastcapades right fucking now

1547
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,240
no vapors 3 is done

1548
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,240
throw it in trash bin

1549
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,240
nobody likes vapors it's gone

1550
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,240
at least of all me

1551
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,240
and yet I am bound

1552
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,240
fair enough

1553
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,240
it also makes sense because the aesthetic

1554
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,240
of beastcapades is kind of metroidish

1555
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,240
so

1556
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,240
it's the metroid theme

1557
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,240
that plays over the comic

1558
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,240
beastcapades

1559
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,240
is the best thing

1560
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,240
and it does render everything else

1561
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,240
beastcapades yet

1562
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,240
well I mean it's not done

1563
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,240
you might as well hold off

1564
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,240
I didn't know it was something

1565
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,240
that was going to happen

1566
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,240
I'm patron from patreon.com

1567
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,240
speaking of

1568
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,240
like video

1569
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,240
speaking of like the whole

1570
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,240
loads of videos in a month

1571
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,240
I have not been making videos and I'm stupid

1572
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,240
but like

1573
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,240
where's the videos at

1574
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,240
oh you know

1575
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,240
there's things coming up

1576
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,240
I talk about it

1577
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,240
more on my patreon podcast

1578
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,240
patreon.com

1579
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,240
but

1580
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
at the moment

1581
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,240
the thing that's coming up

1582
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,240
is october which is curby month

1583
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,240
so that will be full of things

1584
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,240
and I will be trying

1585
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,240
curby month like every october

1586
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,240
every october

1587
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,240
I'm really happy about that

1588
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,240
cause I hate that literally everyone does

1589
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,240
like spooktober

1590
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,240
and I'm like I don't like horror

1591
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,240
so it just means everyone becomes worthless to me

1592
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,240
basically for an entire month

1593
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,240
which also means that

1594
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,240
I kind of want to finish

1595
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,240
belljap in September

1596
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,240
so that I don't have anything else

1597
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,240
like creative so that's my plan

1598
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,240
is to do belljap this month

1599
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,240
and then curby month

1600
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,240
next month and hopefully after that

1601
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,240
I will be making videos a bit more frequently

1602
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,240
I'm very sorry

1603
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,240
people like him

1604
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,240
I want more give and take videos

1605
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,240
cause that's like my favorite channel on youtube

1606
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,240
I forget

1607
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,240
I just do anything on that

1608
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,240
what is your favorite

1609
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,240
give and take review

1610
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,240
video type that comes out

1611
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,240
my favorite is chain mail saga

1612
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,240
more chain mail videos

1613
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,240
I like the stuff that just feels like

1614
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,240
a fucking psychic brain blast

1615
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,240
where it feels like this idea

1616
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,240
just like hit you and you did it

1617
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,240
15 minutes and like

1618
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,240
and it's utterly like

1619
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,240
nothing I could have possibly predicted

1620
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,240
that's my favorite type

1621
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,240
of youtube video in general

1622
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,240
it's just like when someone just makes something

1623
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,240
because clearly like it crawled into

1624
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,240
their psyche and they had to expel it as fast

1625
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,240
as possible

1626
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,240
kind of like uh I mean that's sort of

1627
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,240
what I forget how to say it's like GMC

1628
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,240
fo sho or GMC

1629
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,240
GMC fo sho is pretty fucking great

1630
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,240
that only he kind of expands that joke and he makes it

1631
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,240
a big production it's dope

1632
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,240
did any of you watch my video raw beef

1633
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
probably

1634
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,240
I did see raw beef

1635
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,240
yeah raw beef is a perfect example of what I'm talking about

1636
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,240
where I just like

1637
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,240
I just like I gotta make a song about being the raw beef

1638
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,240
and then it's just a video

1639
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,240
of like a piece of beef spinning around

1640
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,240
it's actually a pork shoulder turns out but like

1641
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,240
it's just me screaming

1642
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,240
about raw beef over like this crazy

1643
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,240
ass beat I made and uh that's it

1644
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,240
that's the whole video

1645
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,240
wait was that like a minute long

1646
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,240
raw beef it's like 20 seconds

1647
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,240
yeah I okay I think I saw that

1648
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,240
yeah

1649
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,240
so I want more like that I want more raw

1650
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,240
I mean and that that was kind of the premise

1651
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,240
of the song what I meant the deeper

1652
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,240
coded meaning behind raw beef

1653
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,240
yeah tell is that

1654
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,240
like that is what I consider that type of content

1655
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,240
to be is the raw beef

1656
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,240
it's that that uncooked

1657
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,240
shit that shit that just goes right

1658
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,240
from the cow into your mouth and you get the most

1659
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,240
nutrients out of it because

1660
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,240
they didn't cook nothing out of it

1661
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,240
you get fucking salmonella

1662
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,240
I want the salmonella god damn it

1663
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,240
this is exactly why it's good to have

1664
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,240
something like the the mea math of a style

1665
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,240
thing that forces you to not

1666
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,240
be afraid of producing

1667
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,240
those into a video like how many times this

1668
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,240
happens to me less and less but I remember so clearly

1669
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,240
being like I'm making a video

1670
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,240
when I was making the Ridley video that now is like

1671
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,240
110,000 views or something

1672
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,240
at many points along

1673
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,240
like oh is this actually gonna be good does anyone actually

1674
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,240
give a shit is this funny

1675
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,240
they're gonna laugh and like it's wildly

1676
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,240
successful for my channel like it's great

1677
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,240
everybody loves it

1678
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,240
to destroy those fears

1679
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,240
by just being like I have to make it

1680
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,240
I have to put my brain out for people to judge

1681
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,240
generally goes pretty well

1682
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,240
those are my favorite videos

1683
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,240
of yours too are the ones that

1684
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,240
like I said in general my favorite is

1685
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,240
anytime it's something that I couldn't imagine

1686
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,240
anyone else making because it just

1687
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,240
feels like it it

1688
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,240
blasted right from the back

1689
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,240
of your mind and like there was no thought put

1690
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,240
into like oh I gotta make

1691
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,240
something successful or formulaic or

1692
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,240
like something that people will like it's just

1693
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,240
like yep how can I realize

1694
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,240
my favorite video of yours

1695
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,240
is uncovered final fantasy

1696
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,240
15 yeah because I returned

1697
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,240
to it all the time like I'll watch it

1698
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,240
again and again because every part of it is

1699
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,240
so unique and none of it feels

1700
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,240
like anybody else's video you know

1701
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,240
I love that fucking

1702
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,240
video and the musical at the end it's

1703
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,240
everything like that

1704
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,240
just

1705
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,240
shoot in my fucking head

1706
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,240
what a great time

1707
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,240
that video was yeah it's great make

1708
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,240
another one for my best bitch

1709
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,240
I'm working on it

1710
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,240
do it

1711
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,240
don't make me sit

1712
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,240
in 15 minutes of you explaining that manga

1713
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,240
it takes less time to read than anime

1714
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,240
I know I know

1715
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,240
I know

1716
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,240
wow Saab everyone fucking gets it

1717
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,240
point pointless

1718
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,240
thing to note a

1719
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,240
video of mine went big and is now

1720
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,240
my most watched

1721
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,240
video and I didn't realize it

1722
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,240
which one what

1723
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,240
it's just it's one of the ones I did

1724
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,240
during Igmovo tour didge that I sort of

1725
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,240
slapped together which was the

1726
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,240
PS2 memory card models video or I just

1727
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,240
looked at all the PS2

1728
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,240
like you know how in PS2 memory

1729
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,240
cards you look at the data and they have

1730
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,240
like little 3D models representing

1731
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,240
the save files and I just looked at

1732
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,240
them and said things about them

1733
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,240
and that's got 80,000 views out of nowhere

1734
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,240
that's such a gib thing and it's something

1735
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,240
that like someone would only make when

1736
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,240
there's like a time crunch to get something out

1737
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,240
and they have to like think of what to do

1738
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,240
the comments for that video were all like this is really cool

1739
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,240
and I don't know why more people don't talk about this right

1740
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,240
because that was yeah and it's funny that

1741
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,240
people are like oh yeah this is a video

1742
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,240
that happened my favorite genre was

1743
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,240
always PS2 memory card

1744
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,240
icons that's my that's the peak

1745
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,240
artistic medium it is now because gib

1746
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,240
invented it that's right

1747
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,240
he started a whole business a whole

1748
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,240
thriving industry

1749
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,240
I certainly have a very successful video

1750
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,240
I think I googled it to

1751
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,240
see if somebody else had done a similar video

1752
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,240
and they had there was this one guy

1753
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,240
who had done it already and I was like

1754
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,240
damn but I'll make it anyway

1755
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,240
and his video wasn't very good so I'm like

1756
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,240
I can do better was his like rating them like out of 10 or

1757
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,240
something he did like the top 10 or something

1758
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,240
I don't remember I think after watching yours

1759
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,240
I watched a couple other ones also about

1760
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,240
like PS2 memory cards and I was fascinated

1761
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,240
by the whole thing what was the best one

1762
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,240
there was one that was like obviously the best

1763
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,240
but I can't remember what it was

1764
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,240
it was like super well animated

1765
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,240
watch the video link in the description

1766
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,240
people

1767
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,240
I'm just happy that that

1768
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,240
could ever happen to me a video

1769
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,240
that I thought is done for

1770
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,240
suddenly gets views out of nowhere I mean

1771
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,240
it's quite kind of died down but that just doesn't happen

1772
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,240
I usually just to me I get

1773
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,240
a bit of a boost sometimes but it sort of

1774
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,240
never really goes anywhere I've accepted

1775
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,240
the fact personally that I'm

1776
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,240
I'm not super smart genius

1777
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,240
who will know exactly what's

1778
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,240
going to do great on YouTube my approaches

1779
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,240
I'm just going to try to make stuff

1780
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,240
relatively fast and throw as

1781
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,240
many ideas out there as possible that I think are like

1782
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,240
kind of good and just

1783
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,240
see what that's when it comes like making like a popular

1784
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,240
video I've given up I don't know

1785
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,240
what's going to be popular well I don't

1786
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,240
really try to do the popular

1787
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,240
video I just hope that I do

1788
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,240
becomes popular kind of the same

1789
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,240
I mean right now I know I should make a video

1790
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,240
darling in the Franks I'm 100% sure

1791
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,240
that's what I should be making right now in the

1792
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,240
DeVoo Bay right now

1793
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,240
DeVoo Bay

1794
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,240
it's soaking in

1795
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,240
the DeVoo goo at this very moment absorbing

1796
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,240
all the juices the DeGoo and the good

1797
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,240
he just finished watching the show

1798
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,240
he posted just now in

1799
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,240
the chat like that

1800
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,240
the ad on the page

1801
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,240
is he listening is he listening

1802
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,240
hippo's shirts no

1803
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,240
no I didn't know

1804
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,240
yeah yeah I saw that that's because

1805
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,240
I'm sure you guys are seeing

1806
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,240
this but like you get ads now

1807
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,240
for like things that you've bought or have looked at

1808
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,240
like on the sides of page because like Google is

1809
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,240
tracking what you do and if I already bought it why

1810
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,240
would I want another one stop

1811
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,240
hey here's a here's a thing this is

1812
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,240
definitely real this is 100% real

1813
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,240
I forget the exact example

1814
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,240
but have you guys

1815
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,240
like recently I forget what it was

1816
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,240
me and Michelle were like talking about something

1817
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,240
and like I went and I bought

1818
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,240
something it might have been like I was talking

1819
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,240
about like the new smash or something and like

1820
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,240
talking about how much I love my switch as I all

1821
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,240
do every day all hours of the day

1822
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,240
and like Michelle

1823
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,240
who has never bought a video game

1824
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,240
in her life because she isn't allowed to by me

1825
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,240
what a fake gamer girl

1826
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,240
I know right

1827
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,240
like she starts to get ads

1828
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,240
on her phone for like

1829
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,240
like the switch and like video games

1830
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,240
and at this point they're not even

1831
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,240
like pretending like they're not doing

1832
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,240
they just listen to us

1833
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,240
like she didn't search for it they're listening

1834
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,240
to us and they're catering to it

1835
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,240
by audio they're listening every second

1836
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,240
of every fucking day

1837
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,240
I'm not constantly getting ads for fucking

1838
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,240
like lolliporn like what's going on

1839
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,240
I've had that conversation

1840
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,240
how come I'm not getting ads for guns

1841
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,240
yeah

1842
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,240
I should try that

1843
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,240
I should try that

1844
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,240
I should try repeating

1845
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,240
how come I'm not getting ads for guns

1846
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,240
here's a test

1847
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,240
I guess like

1848
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,240
keep repeating the same words

1849
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,240
for like a while and see

1850
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,240
dude mage people have done that

1851
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,240
people have done that

1852
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,240
but not only that

1853
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,240
somethings can buy

1854
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,240
it is objectively true that this is

1855
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,240
something that is happening

1856
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,240
there's enough testament to

1857
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,240
I mean this is why they had to update the privacy

1858
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,240
policies on like every fucking website

1859
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,240
because the EU is currently hammering

1860
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,240
Google about this

1861
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,240
Google is no longer naughty

1862
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,240
yeah

1863
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,240
they took that out of their fucking thing

1864
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,240
they literally took that out

1865
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,240
of their company policy

1866
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,240
the do no evil they straight up removed it

1867
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,240
well this is

1868
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,240
all I'm saying is

1869
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,240
sometimes evil is

1870
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,240
I just can't

1871
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,240
you could not

1872
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,240
that is the funniest thing that I've heard

1873
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,240
all year

1874
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,240
is Google literally

1875
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,240
first of all it was always goofy that they had that

1876
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,240
in their thing but like to have to remove

1877
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,240
it because they have to acknowledge that what

1878
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,240
they are doing is evil

1879
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,240
surely their official

1880
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,240
stance is that they took it out

1881
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,240
because it was goofy in the first place right

1882
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,240
they had it in there

1883
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,240
and now they're removing it

1884
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,240
now is not the time

1885
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,240
have they said why

1886
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,240
I mean there's probably a PR

1887
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,240
statement on why they took it out that has to do

1888
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,240
with like professionalism or we revolving

1889
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,240
as a company and you know evil and good

1890
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,240
or subjective terms so you know we're just

1891
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,240
like it's all good man

1892
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,240
like maybe

1893
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,240
Satan was right you know like who says God

1894
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,240
should reign in heaven above you know

1895
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,240
hey Satan gave us

1896
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,240
the fruit of the tree of knowledge

1897
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,240
everything we've done is all because of

1898
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,240
Satan

1899
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,240
and Google is used for

1900
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,240
searching knowledge so

1901
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,240
we were Satan all along guys

1902
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,240
are you saying that

1903
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,240
Google came down

1904
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,240
from the heavens and gave us the Google search

1905
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,240
bar the fruit of the tree of

1906
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,240
knowledge and we've all eaten from it

1907
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,240
and now we're being tracked

1908
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,240
okay guys but Satan is actually bad rap

1909
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,240
he's not evil he just takes care of people

1910
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,240
in hell like it's not a fun job

1911
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,240
hey guys

1912
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,240
yeah he's like he's like Hades

1913
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,240
from like the Gris Pantheon

1914
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,240
who was forced to control a little hell

1915
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,240
oh god just test it down and he's like

1916
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,240
stay there and now everyone will hate you

1917
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,240
the apple logo actually isn't that

1918
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,240
the apple logo because like the original apple logo

1919
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,240
before they made it like actually cool was

1920
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,240
way more complicated it was an entire

1921
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,240
illustration of Isaac Newton and the apple

1922
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,240
falling on his head that was what the apple is

1923
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,240
it's supposed to represent

1924
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,240
a moment of genius because of course

1925
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,240
this is apple we're talking about and they have to be

1926
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,240
well yeah of course

1927
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,240
you know what's funny wait was there

1928
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,240
a biblical reference wait did someone just say

1929
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,240
something about like it's the apple of sin

1930
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,240
well I was making a comparison

1931
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,240
with their logo that now it's

1932
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,240
like an apple with a bite out of it seems relevant to

1933
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,240
like original sin kind of but it's actually

1934
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,240
it was never supposed to be that but

1935
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,240
alright yeah

1936
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,240
do you know what's funny

1937
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,240
is that tell me

1938
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,240
scary things

1939
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,240
scary things are now funny things

1940
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,240
upon hearing

1941
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,240
upon hearing that

1942
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,240
upon hearing that google is now listening

1943
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,240
to everything

1944
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,240
hearing that like

1945
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,240
google is listening in on us

1946
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,240
and watching us fap

1947
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,240
all I can think of is

1948
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,240
I can't wait for the memes about this

1949
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,240
I'm really excited to see all the funny

1950
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,240
fucking things I just feel

1951
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,240
I feel this is just funny

1952
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,240
it is the decadent slide to the destruction

1953
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,240
of civilization and I will fight against it

1954
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,240
scary things are now funny things

1955
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,240
people will meme

1956
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,240
into the dystopian future

1957
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,240
they will meme all the way down

1958
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,240
we are meming all the way to the bottom

1959
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,240
that's absolutely true

1960
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,240
exerbia just made a funny meme video

1961
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,240
about this very situation

1962
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,240
that you're describing hippo so

1963
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,240
you're right

1964
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,240
exerbia never heard of him

1965
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,240
exerbia is a youtuber who does

1966
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,240
comedic videos about existential dread

1967
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,240
that sounds good

1968
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,240
and sci-fi

1969
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,240
he's like a comedy sci-fi author

1970
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,240
with an english accent

1971
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,240
his videos are fun

1972
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,240
they can get a little repetitive because all of them are about

1973
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,240
existential dread

1974
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,240
and the smallness of man in the face of the universe

1975
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,240
I bet google gives him

1976
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,240
tons of ads for existential dread

1977
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,240
cause he talks about it so much

1978
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,240
we don't need ads for that

1979
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,240
speaking of ads

1980
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,240
to address the ad situation

1981
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,240
in how they marketed

1982
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,240
it actually did not go

1983
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,240
I don't really like the ads being

1984
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,240
I think ultimately it came out

1985
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,240
as well as it possibly could

1986
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,240
but the way that the video

1987
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,240
was planned was not to be like

1988
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,240
what it is at all

1989
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,240
I cut the first 6 minutes of the video out

1990
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,240
there was supposed to be a huge amount of outro

1991
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,240
and like

1992
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,240
if you remember the finisher fail video

1993
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,240
where it was like

1994
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,240
the last 15 minutes

1995
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,240
were like something entirely else

1996
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,240
that was supposed to be how they marketed it

1997
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,240
it was supposed to have

1998
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,240
more of an intro than go through the main bulk

1999
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,240
of me talking about the show

2000
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,240
and then spiral out into this whole other thing

2001
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,240
so the ads were not actually supposed to be

2002
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,240
sprinkled throughout the video like that

2003
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,240
they were supposed to be sprinkled throughout the outro section

2004
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,240
but because of the fact that

2005
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,240
I'm not doing it as

2006
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,240
the complete series anymore

2007
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,240
that would have come out

2008
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,240
I just cut all the extraneous shit

2009
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,240
but because people had already paid for the ads

2010
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,240
I felt like I had to do them

2011
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,240
and if I put them all at the end

2012
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,240
people would just click off the video as soon as they got to the ads section

2013
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,240
so I wanted it to feel like

2014
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,240
they were integrated in a way that made sense

2015
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,240
for them to be there and to make people watch them

2016
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,240
but like ultimately that

2017
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,240
particular video would have been better

2018
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,240
without the ads

2019
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,240
it's not every time

2020
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,240
that I'm like with you on like

2021
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,240
I'm pushing bullshit that you're trying

2022
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,240
whatever shit that is

2023
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,240
but in this case I actually

2024
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,240
I saw a bunch of people being like I really didn't like the ad breaks

2025
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,240
they really took me out of it

2026
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,240
maybe it's because I'm thinking of like from a business perspective

2027
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,240
but I'm like I mean would these people have preferred

2028
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,240
use like because I would

2029
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,240
I would absolutely put like ads in my videos

2030
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,240
at opportune times that are like the Google ones

2031
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,240
like what's the difference

2032
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,240
putting like just someone's paid for ads

2033
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,240
because of your ad blocker

2034
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,240
well fuck the people with ad blocker

2035
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,240
which includes me

2036
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,240
ultimately like if you

2037
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,240
aren't paying me in any way

2038
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,240
if you're not watching ads

2039
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,240
and you're not a patron

2040
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,240
I don't feel bad for you

2041
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,240
I mean for me personally

2042
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,240
I just

2043
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,240
I'm very particular about like the video structure

2044
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,240
you know I want it to be like a clean

2045
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,240
just go through and everything's fine

2046
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,240
now granted I do think

2047
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,240
I could stand to be a lot more selfish

2048
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,240
with my videos probably

2049
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,240
for my own benefit

2050
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,240
but like I've only seen it as like the reason

2051
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,240
that I have a Patreon

2052
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,240
and that the Patreon is able to be so successful

2053
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,240
is that I don't do that shit

2054
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,240
that like you know people respect

2055
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,240
that I don't put in ad breaks

2056
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,240
I don't put in you know

2057
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,240
I don't put in shilling or anything like that

2058
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,240
but like in this

2059
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,240
case again like in the

2060
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,240
original context of video was planned for

2061
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,240
it would have made more sense and like

2062
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,240
how they marketed would have been a video series

2063
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,240
about once a month and the format of it

2064
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,240
would have lent itself to this and so

2065
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,240
it would have continually made sense going forward

2066
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,240
I think that

2067
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,240
a big part of what inspired the format

2068
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,240
of how they marketed was Weagawa

2069
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,240
so I think it would make sense for you

2070
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,240
because what I love about

2071
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,240
Weagawa is that because

2072
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,240
there's this looseness to it

2073
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,240
and that it has like multiple phases

2074
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,240
you can basically throw in anything

2075
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,240
like any random

2076
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,240
clip any random meme

2077
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,240
like you could just toss in there

2078
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,240
and it'll make perfect sense and it all flows together

2079
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,240
and that's

2080
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,240
it's just an excuse to make a video

2081
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,240
that's all it is

2082
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,240
so like I admire that but

2083
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,240
I don't know how to replicate it

2084
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,240
in my style

2085
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,240
it'd be like making a movie

2086
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,240
and then like sticking in like an ad in the middle

2087
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,240
and again like

2088
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,240
because of the fact that the original format was to have

2089
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,240
these super long outros where I could do that

2090
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,240
where it would be like

2091
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,240
it's already just a random mishmash of stuff

2092
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,240
it would make sense for there to be

2093
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,240
even more random stuff in there

2094
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,240
because like a big part of

2095
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,240
how they marketed was going to be that

2096
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,240
I would take clips from shows that are

2097
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,240
like marketing gimmicks and just

2098
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,240
play those clips

2099
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,240
kind of like in finisher fail there's like

2100
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,240
how they marketed episode zero

2101
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,240
and it's just like a bunch of scenes from

2102
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:07,240
Takunomi where they're advertising beer

2103
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,240
like in the show and I'm like literally saying

2104
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,240
this is how they marketed it

2105
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,240
with these beer ads

2106
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,240
so there was going to be a lot of like

2107
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,240
just random segments of like

2108
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,240
funny scenes from shows where they

2109
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,240
they obviously made this

2110
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,240
scene to market the show

2111
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,240
and then intercut with that would be ads

2112
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,240
that I made for my fans and like

2113
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,240
the only stipulation I had on the ads was that they were all going to be less than 10 seconds

2114
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,240
so it's basically just

2115
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,240
hey I'm going to and I said

2116
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,240
it's going to be less than 10 seconds and I said all the rules

2117
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,240
so like don't expect to get

2118
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,240
like a glowing review of your thing

2119
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,240
it's just going to be a fucking

2120
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,240
a little meme that

2121
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,240
you know puts the name of the thing you want in the video

2122
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,240
it's like a TV ad you know it's a few seconds long

2123
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,240
you've got to get your message out fast

2124
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,240
and I did them all

2125
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,240
just like a TV ad it's a couple

2126
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,240
seconds long and it says nothing in particular

2127
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,240
about the thing being advertised

2128
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,240
I mean you sound like you're making a joke

2129
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,240
but that's pretty commonly the case

2130
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,240
like you know

2131
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,240
TV ads in 30 seconds

2132
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,240
well what about those total non-secret

2133
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,240
commercial where like they're just talking about a lifestyle

2134
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,240
and then they're like Jeep Durango

2135
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,240
you know it's

2136
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,240
what's the thing

2137
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,240
like sure you can make a point that those guys have such brand recognition already

2138
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,240
you already know

2139
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:21,240
like what they're selling and they don't need to

2140
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,240
but whatever

2141
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,240
why is every car

2142
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,240
at the same like structurally

2143
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,240
because all it does

2144
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,240
driving up a mountain saying about

2145
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,240
if you can't do this with your normal car

2146
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,240
buy this new car

2147
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,240
like none of them

2148
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,240
they all end with the car

2149
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,240
like displayed

2150
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,240
at a three quarters angle

2151
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,240
and in my brain I combine

2152
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,240
every single one of those ads

2153
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,240
to the point where I don't know any car ad

2154
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,240
specifically

2155
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,240
I'm not being advertised a single brand

2156
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,240
I'm just being advertised

2157
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,240
speaking of cars

2158
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,240
was it on the PCP that I shared my idea

2159
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,240
for the perfect

2160
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,240
way to end the Fast and the Furious series

2161
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,240
I don't think so

2162
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,240
imagine it

2163
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,240
the year is 2020

2164
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,240
or 2022

2165
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,240
either one doesn't matter

2166
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,240
not 2021 now it's not okay

2167
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,240
but the year is 20 whatever

2168
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,240
and Fast and the Furious 10 is coming out

2169
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,240
and it is 150 minutes

2170
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,240
of extremely expensive

2171
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,240
cars being driven off of a cliff

2172
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,240
in one continuous shot

2173
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,240
is the most expensive

2174
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,240
movie ever made

2175
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,240
the only sort of car

2176
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,240
and that's it

2177
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,240
that's it

2178
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,240
why is it 155 minutes

2179
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,240
was there some significance to that number

2180
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,240
that's usually

2181
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,240
you want it to be a decent length for your money

2182
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,240
you're paying like $10 to get in there

2183
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,240
I thought there was going to be a reason for that

2184
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,240
because he doesn't want the number

2185
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,240
seems like a reasonable time frame

2186
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,240
for Fast and the Furious 10 to come out

2187
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,240
okay

2188
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,240
the only car advertisement

2189
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,240
I'm not even sure if it's a car advertisement

2190
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,240
but he had a car in it

2191
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,240
I'm pretty sure it had a car in it

2192
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,240
I just remembered like this

2193
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,240
it was kind of funny

2194
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,240
it was shot from the back

2195
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,240
it appeared like a very attractive lady

2196
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,240
it was walking up to a guy

2197
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,240
with a car I'm guessing

2198
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,240
and then like boom

2199
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,240
actually the attractive lady is a guy all along

2200
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,240
and it was

2201
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,240
got him, you're gay now

2202
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,240
it was

2203
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,240
really makes me want to buy their car

2204
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,240
for tricking me about my sexuality

2205
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,240
you bully

2206
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,240
yeah at the bottom

2207
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,240
it says buy our car fair

2208
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,240
I would remember that

2209
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,240
they should do that

2210
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,240
you see that one

2211
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,240
you see that one where the guy

2212
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,240
you see that one where the guy is eating a baby Ruth

2213
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,240
and he just like pulls out

2214
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,240
pulls out a gun, pulls out an assault rifle

2215
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,240
and just lays waste to like

2216
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,240
a school

2217
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,240
a school playground

2218
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,240
he's just standing there eating the baby Ruth

2219
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,240
that one really made me want a baby Ruth

2220
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,240
that sounds good

2221
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,240
I enjoy that

2222
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,240
Tom I didn't hear a word you said

2223
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,240
oh Ben that wasn't a commercial

2224
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,240
that was the actual school shooting

2225
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,240
that's just how you're coping

2226
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,240
oh is that where I was

2227
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,240
on the last full moon

2228
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,240
that's a full moon mentor

2229
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,240
he's a lichen school shooter

2230
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,240
or a school shooter

2231
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,240
what is it called

2232
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,240
what is it called a baby Ruth

2233
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,240
can you explain that to me

2234
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,240
it's just the name of the candy

2235
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,240
it's named after Babe Ruth

2236
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,240
I really don't like the word baby

2237
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,240
in any sort of food that I consume

2238
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,240
I'm eating a baby

2239
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,240
what about sugar baby

2240
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,240
I don't want to eat baby carrots

2241
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,240
they're just normal carrots

2242
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,240
I'm stuck on the

2243
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,240
I'm stuck on the where

2244
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,240
school shooter

2245
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,240
the full moon comes out and he looks at it

2246
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,240
and he's like oh no it's happening again

2247
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,240
and then an AK-47 appears in his hands

2248
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,240
it grows out of his hand

2249
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,240
and his virginity regrows

2250
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,240
and his registration

2251
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,240
to incel is like r slash incels

2252
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,240
it activates once again

2253
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,240
and his jacket grows

2254
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,240
and becomes leathery

2255
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,240
you know what

2256
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,240
I could believe oh my god I got a perfect

2257
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,240
I got a perfect joke and a segue

2258
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,240
all in one are you ready

2259
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,240
here we fucking go

2260
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,240
I could believe that that was me

2261
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,240
because I do like baby Ruth

2262
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,240
and I would say

2263
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,240
that I wouldn't eat one because I'm keto

2264
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,240
but if I was asleep

2265
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,240
it was a full moon so it was like I was dream

2266
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,240
it was like I was having one of my keto

2267
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,240
keto dreams you dream of eating carbs

2268
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,240
and you wake up because it's a nightmare

2269
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,240
and that's it perfect transition

2270
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,240
to tell you all know that I am on

2271
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,240
day two of a fast

2272
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,240
I have not eaten in almost two days

2273
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,240
and I feel wonderful

2274
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,240
dude fasting does make you feel like you become a god

2275
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,240
no I'm not hungry

2276
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,240
sometimes I kind of want to eat

2277
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,240
because like it would taste good

2278
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,240
and it would be something to do

2279
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,240
but I'm not like hungry

2280
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,240
it's funny you mentioned that Ben

2281
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,240
because I'm fasting today

2282
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,240
I decided yesterday that I'm not eating today

2283
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,240
I decided yesterday too

2284
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,240
oh my god what the fuck

2285
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,240
guess what I had for breakfast

2286
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,240
I did every Monday by the way guys

2287
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,240
I had a big ol' slice of cake for breakfast

2288
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,240
that's what I had

2289
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,240
that is not posted

2290
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,240
every week

2291
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,240
why do you fast every Monday

2292
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,240
I decided like one day a week

2293
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,240
would be neat

2294
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,240
so I decided on Monday

2295
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,240
it feels great it makes you feel like a god

2296
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,240
no I hate it

2297
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,240
but I go through with it

2298
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,240
well

2299
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,240
it's fun

2300
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,240
it does have its health benefits for at least one day

2301
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,240
I'm not sure about two things

2302
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,240
are you guys achieving your stated goals

2303
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,240
of losing gaining weight or whatever

2304
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,240
well I wasn't really

2305
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,240
I had lost a bit

2306
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,240
I had lost like 10 pounds

2307
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,240
and I had been stable for maybe like two weeks

2308
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,240
and I was like okay I'm at a plateau

2309
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,240
so it's time to fast

2310
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,240
time to break this plateau

2311
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,240
alright

2312
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,240
time will tell

2313
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,240
just don't like

2314
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,240
I sometimes don't eat

2315
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,240
as that much and I sort of like

2316
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,240
I'm too lazy to go and

2317
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,240
make something so I'm like

2318
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,240
I'll be hungry for a little bit

2319
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,240
like I'm hungry right now and I could

2320
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,240
go and run away

2321
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,240
and like eat something

2322
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,240
but like I'm okay with just

2323
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,240
even after this is finished just sitting here

2324
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,240
for a bit not eating

2325
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:37,240
I don't know whether I'm gaining the benefits of all this like fasting stuff

2326
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,240
because I don't do it every single day

2327
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,240
I very often like it wasn't

2328
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,240
that uncommon for me

2329
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,240
even like before I was thinking about

2330
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,240
what I wanted to eat well

2331
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,240
to like well when I lived

2332
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,240
on my own it was common for me to just

2333
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,240
like wake up

2334
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,240
and not be hungry and then

2335
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,240
go the rest of the day doing something

2336
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,240
and just not get hungry because I was like

2337
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,240
focused on other things and I would go like the entire

2338
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,240
day without eating and maybe at

2339
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,240
night I'd be like oh I guess I should eat something and I need something

2340
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,240
well we're talking about food

2341
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,240
my fucking oven broke

2342
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,240
and it's a

2343
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,240
big gay boy and so

2344
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,240
I called the seers and

2345
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,240
a guy came and I paid him $100

2346
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,240
to tell me your oven's

2347
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,240
broke

2348
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,240
because

2349
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,240
apparently what happened is that

2350
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
the panel broke your oven's broken now you're

2351
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,240
gonna be give me a thousand dollars to fix it

2352
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,240
yeah well okay so this

2353
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,240
this dude's like the panel

2354
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,240
is broken that like controls the oven

2355
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,240
and to replace the panel and he

2356
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,240
points me to some numbers and he's like

2357
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,240
here's how much the part itself costs

2358
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,240
which is like $360

2359
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,240
and I'm already like holy fuck

2360
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,240
right and then he's like and here's the

2361
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,240
total cost after repairs

2362
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,240
$618

2363
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,240
and I look at it

2364
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,240
and I look over at the stove and I look at him

2365
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,240
and I say how much does the stove cost

2366
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,240
and he says $600

2367
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,240
and I was just like I'll

2368
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,240
just buy a new stove

2369
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,240
and he's like yeah fuck

2370
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,240
that right so then

2371
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,240
this one's got sentimental value

2372
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,240
no this is

2373
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,240
apparently a new stove that was bought

2374
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,240
right before we moved in

2375
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,240
does it not have any sort of

2376
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,240
warranties or anything

2377
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,240
apparently they didn't get a warranty

2378
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,240
on the guy

2379
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,240
fantastic

2380
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,240
if it's a new product they have to have a warranty

2381
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,240
it's like by law

2382
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,240
you have to have a year warranty

2383
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,240
the guy said that if there was a warranty

2384
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,240
it would have come up when he looked up

2385
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,240
the stove in his system

2386
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,240
then someone's broken the law federal law mandates

2387
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,240
a year warranty on every consumer product

2388
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,240
well we don't know how long ago it was actually bought

2389
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,240
and put into place or anything

2390
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,240
I was told that they had just bought it

2391
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,240
not long before they moved out and I know they moved out

2392
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,240
in February

2393
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,240
I think you need to call bullshit on

2394
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,240
whoever said that

2395
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,240
you might want to actually call the manufacturer

2396
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,240
I might do something because I didn't buy a new

2397
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,240
stove because what I

2398
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,240
me and May were talking about

2399
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,240
and then we're like is it

2400
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,240
possible that we can just get a

2401
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,240
toaster oven and it'll be just as good

2402
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,240
yes

2403
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,240
and I'm like

2404
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,240
because I didn't want to believe that that was true

2405
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,240
because it seems wrong

2406
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,240
but then

2407
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,240
it does doesn't it

2408
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,240
I'm in my page so I told the people

2409
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,240
on my page in discord about this oven situation

2410
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,240
and this guy Kaisimir

2411
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,240
in his 30s and he lives in Japan

2412
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,240
is like man I haven't owned an oven

2413
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,240
in years

2414
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,240
and I was like and then he points out

2415
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,240
that in Japan

2416
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,240
almost no one has an oven

2417
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,240
apparently in Japan

2418
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,240
full ovens are just extremely rare

2419
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,240
they just use toaster ovens

2420
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,240
like they just have like

2421
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,240
I mean I know that a lot of okay I've seen like

2422
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,240
you ever watched cooking with dog no

2423
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,240
it's weird

2424
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,240
how many recipes

2425
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,240
of microwaving like this seems like

2426
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,240
a lot of Japanese food

2427
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,240
is like involves a microwave

2428
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,240
I think it's just because of space concerns

2429
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,240
they just don't have room for full ovens

2430
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,240
and then so I'm looking into it and I'm realizing

2431
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,240
like a toaster oven is literally just

2432
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,240
an oven that's not that big

2433
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,240
and like the only reason that you would need

2434
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,240
a full-size oven is to

2435
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,240
have a full-size

2436
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,240
oven and I'm like well I never cook

2437
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,240
for more than two people all we really use

2438
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,240
our oven for is make a chicken cord on blue anyway

2439
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,240
so

2440
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,240
so we went to Walmart

2441
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,240
and found a $50 oven

2442
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,240
that was on sale for $30

2443
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,240
and now I have a $30 toaster oven

2444
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,240
instead of a $600 stove

2445
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,240
and I haven't yet confirmed that it can do

2446
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,240
everything I want because if it can't make

2447
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,240
chicken cord on blue then I'm going to be a sad boy

2448
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,240
I don't know if I want to spend $600

2449
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,240
just so I can make chicken cord on blue

2450
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,240
can't fry things on toaster ovens

2451
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,240
can you do that?

2452
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,240
this is like fried egg or something

2453
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,240
but you can't do that in an oven either

2454
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,240
well did you

2455
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,240
did you do your stove?

2456
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,240
the stove top still works

2457
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:01,240
it's just the oven

2458
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,240
to be honest I almost

2459
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:05,240
I almost never cook in

2460
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,240
like my oven oven

2461
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,240
I use the stove almost exclusively

2462
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,240
back at my old place I used the oven a lot

2463
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,240
because I used to eat lots of mozzarella sticks

2464
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,240
and like

2465
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,240
cheesy bread and garlic bread and shit

2466
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,240
but like the only reason I had to use

2467
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,240
the oven is that the toaster oven is a little slower

2468
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,240
and ours was too small

2469
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,240
to like really fit anything in it

2470
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,240
but we just bought a bigger one

2471
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,240
like they make bigger toaster ovens

2472
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,240
this is basically just a fucking oven

2473
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,240
I'm sitting here and I'm like I just bought an oven

2474
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,240
for $30 and this motherfucker

2475
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,240
was going to charge me $618

2476
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,240
to fix the one I already fucking

2477
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,240
ahhh what is this world

2478
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,240
like I just

2479
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,240
I never even heard of a toaster oven

2480
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,240
I had never even considered the idea

2481
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,240
I had never considered

2482
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,240
the idea of a living life without an oven

2483
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,240
until

2484
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,240
that guy said like oh I haven't had an oven in years

2485
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,240
and I was like what?

2486
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,240
and then I thought about it and I was like there's nothing I make

2487
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:01,240
in the oven I can't make in a toaster oven

2488
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,240
so why would I need an oven

2489
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,240
if you want to make a big

2490
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,240
Sunday roast

2491
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,240
why would I ever do that

2492
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,240
and even then

2493
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,240
you can get pretty big toaster ovens

2494
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,240
I didn't go for like a gigantic oven

2495
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,240
I was just seeing a toaster oven that was big enough

2496
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,240
that you could like bake I don't know a pie

2497
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,240
the biggest one that they had at Walmart

2498
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,240
was like $100

2499
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,240
and it was pretty fucking huge

2500
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,240
and it literally advertises that you can cook

2501
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,240
a full chicken inside of it

2502
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,240
like they had a picture of a full roasted chicken

2503
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,240
on there

2504
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,240
I think yep

2505
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,240
yep

2506
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,240
so you never had a toaster oven growing up

2507
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,240
but like yes the answer is yes

2508
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,240
you can do everything you want

2509
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,240
just because I heard the oven

2510
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,240
because I didn't want to fuck with it

2511
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,240
it takes like 15 minutes to heat up

2512
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,240
and I'm not that hungry

2513
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,240
apparently the toaster oven

2514
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,240
is more power cost effective too

2515
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,240
like heating up a stove costs more

2516
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,240
this is just another example

2517
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:01,240
of American excess that we just don't need

2518
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,240
I guess so

2519
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,240
this looks too powerful

2520
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,240
look at that fucking thing

2521
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,240
that's like extreme

2522
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,240
it's got a top one too

2523
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,240
holy fuck

2524
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,240
whoa

2525
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,240
okay well hold on

2526
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,240
get that toast out of there

2527
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,240
who the fuck is cooking bacon this way

2528
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,240
who's cooking bacon in a toaster oven

2529
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,240
in like a bacon tray that's a thing

2530
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,240
yeah

2531
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,240
why not

2532
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,240
does that coffee pot say nostalgia

2533
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,240
on it

2534
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,240
what

2535
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,240
wait yes

2536
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,240
no hold on

2537
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,240
it does

2538
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,240
it says nostalgia

2539
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:45,240
where does it say

2540
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,240
I guess it's a retro design

2541
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:49,240
obviously it's made by white industries

2542
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,240
anyone get it

2543
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,240
anyone get it

2544
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,240
dude

2545
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,240
we've changed

2546
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,240
we've changed from using the word retro

2547
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,240
now we're using the word nostalgia

2548
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,240
I'm nostalgic for retro

2549
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,240
that's why it has nostalgia

2550
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,240
it's like an oldish

2551
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,240
cream plastic

2552
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,240
yeah it really is

2553
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,240
you used to call that a retro design

2554
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,240
now they're calling it nostalgia

2555
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,240
retro is too mainstream

2556
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,240
it's a toaster oven

2557
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,240
now I'm hungry

2558
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,240
now I wasn't hungry

2559
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,240
and I was totally good with my fast

2560
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:27,240
the fast is ruined

2561
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,240
give it 10 minutes it'll pass

2562
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,240
well you know what guys we've been talking about some bullshit for a while

2563
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,240
I say we change tax

2564
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,240
and we get some fucking coal

2565
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,240
please god

2566
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,240
do we have a fucking

2567
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,240
do we have a thing now

2568
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,240
this is gonna be awesome

2569
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,240
I'm actually really excited about this piece

2570
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,240
it better just be someone screaming fuckers in the franks over and over again

2571
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,240
that's what I want

2572
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,240
did we screen these

2573
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,240
or are these just like

2574
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,240
yeah but I mean they don't get

2575
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:57,240
automatically recorded we get to edit them

2576
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,240
so if anyone says something real bad we can always cut it out

2577
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,240
so I'm not too worried about it

2578
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:03,240
what could they possibly say

2579
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,240
would it be bad enough for us to cut it

2580
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,240
oh I don't know maybe actual

2581
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,240
advocating violence against a specific group

2582
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,240
who knows I don't know

2583
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:13,240
but it's speakpipe.com

2584
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,240
slash the procrastinators

2585
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,240
I think the link to the description regardless

2586
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,240
so go to that and leave us voicemail

2587
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,240
this is why I don't go to the meetings because I like to be surprised

2588
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,240
I believe the link is PCP voicemail

2589
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,240
what is it

2590
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,240
speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail

2591
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,240
thank you PCP voicemail that's the one

2592
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:31,240
yeah do that click the link the description is there

2593
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,240
and leave us a message and here we go

2594
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,240
alright let's see what we got first on deck

2595
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,240
okay here we go this is from

2596
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,240
Gavin at

2597
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,240
her booty poppin

2598
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,240
is he wanted us to know that's his name on twitter

2599
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,240
let's see what he's got for us

2600
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:47,240
here we go

2601
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:49,240
hey guys I have a question for y'all

2602
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,240
if a significant other

2603
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,240
had gotten sexually unattractive

2604
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:55,240
to the point where you have

2605
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,240
no desire to have sex with them in particular

2606
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:59,240
during the time you've been in a relationship with one another

2607
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,240
but you still have a desire to have sex

2608
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,240
would you wait it out

2609
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,240
to see if they could become sexually attractive again

2610
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,240
and if so how long would you wait

2611
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,240
until you decide to look for a sex elsewhere

2612
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,240
if you're not willing to wait indefinitely

2613
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,240
also would you stop dating

2614
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,240
or in your romantic relationship with this person

2615
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,240
if you decided upon yourself

2616
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,240
that you've waited long enough for them to become

2617
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,240
sexually attractive again

2618
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:23,240
so is he just saying she got fat

2619
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,240
yeah he's saying his bitch got fat

2620
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,240
basically

2621
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,240
what else could you mean

2622
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,240
okay

2623
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,240
oh yeah you know my girl

2624
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,240
got acid attacked in the face

2625
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,240
by a terrorist

2626
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,240
for not being a proper

2627
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,240
enough Muslim woman

2628
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:43,240
so she's not attractive anymore

2629
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,240
but maybe I'll wait it out and see if it gets better

2630
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,240
Ben I'm assuming this is a joke

2631
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,240
because no lie

2632
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,240
if that happened

2633
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,240
there comes a time

2634
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,240
why saddle yourself

2635
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,240
that you're not attracted to

2636
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,240
for your whole fucking life

2637
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,240
just because something bad happened to them

2638
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,240
why isn't your responsibility to put up with that forever

2639
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,240
oh yeah

2640
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,240
of course

2641
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,240
this guy's thing

2642
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,240
the only way

2643
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,240
that it could be reversible

2644
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,240
is if he's just talking about getting fat

2645
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:17,240
he's talking about getting fat

2646
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,240
so I don't know

2647
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,240
why he didn't just say that

2648
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,240
but like

2649
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,240
so this literally is not a problem for me

2650
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,240
so

2651
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,240
the way I see it

2652
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,240
if I'm attracted to someone

2653
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,240
on

2654
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,240
I'm not attracted to someone just because they're thin

2655
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,240
if getting fat is enough

2656
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,240
to make a girl completely

2657
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,240
sexually unattractive to me

2658
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,240
she probably wasn't that attractive

2659
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,240
in the first place

2660
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,240
I don't think there's a certain point

2661
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:49,240
if she gets

2662
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:51,240
if a girl

2663
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,240
if a girl got that fat

2664
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,240
and you couldn't

2665
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,240
steer that ship away from it happening

2666
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,240
you have not done your job as a partner

2667
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,240
oh come on

2668
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,240
it's not your problem

2669
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,240
no I'm not saying it's your problem

2670
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,240
I'm just saying

2671
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,240
right

2672
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,240
this had to happen over the course of years

2673
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,240
you don't just balloon

2674
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,240
to a point of being completely

2675
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,240
okay

2676
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:19,240
if you're saying that your girl

2677
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,240
is no longer attractive because she gained

2678
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,240
like 30 pounds

2679
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,240
you need to

2680
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,240
your standards are a little too

2681
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,240
30 pounds is a lot of weight

2682
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,240
I don't think it's enough to make a girl

2683
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,240
who has a hot face

2684
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,240
unattractive

2685
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,240
if a girl is attractive it's not

2686
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,240
I mean

2687
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,240
he's not saying

2688
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,240
my girl gained X amount of weight

2689
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,240
is it okay that I no longer find her attractive

2690
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,240
he's saying

2691
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,240
the only way you can get there

2692
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,240
that's all it comes down to

2693
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,240
the only way you can get there is

2694
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,240
like I said

2695
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,240
the only possible scenario where this can happen

2696
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,240
is that they gained a lot of weight

2697
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,240
because he's implying that it has to be

2698
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,240
something reversible

2699
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,240
so we're assuming that she gained X amount of weight

2700
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,240
if a girl is attractive enough

2701
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:09,240
for me

2702
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,240
the weight is not

2703
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,240
the biggest factor of sexual attraction

2704
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,240
it's her face

2705
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,240
it's her

2706
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,240
general shape and demeanor

2707
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,240
so like

2708
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,240
a girl would have to put on a considerable amount of weight

2709
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,240
before I would be like

2710
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,240
I can't fuck you anymore

2711
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,240
and I think that if there's no way

2712
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,240
that I would allow that to happen

2713
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,240
like at some point

2714
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,240
as it's happening I'd be like hey we need to

2715
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,240
we need to move, we need to back pedal

2716
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,240
and to answer this question

2717
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,240
I guess if it got to a point where

2718
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,240
you could not correct that course

2719
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,240
and she's just let herself go

2720
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,240
and she doesn't give a fuck

2721
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,240
we're not even having a relationship

2722
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,240
because we're not participating together

2723
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,240
at that point it's just a breakdown

2724
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:55,240
of communication and issue between

2725
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,240
the two people

2726
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:59,240
you gotta say something

2727
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,240
if the girl has no idea that you feel this way

2728
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,240
that's a huge problem

2729
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,240
that means you're failing

2730
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,240
but also I feel like

2731
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:09,240
if it is weight

2732
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,240
and it's

2733
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,240
something that he just let happen

2734
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,240
and didn't talk about it, that's one thing

2735
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,240
but I also think that if somebody puts on

2736
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,240
just a bit of weight

2737
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,240
and then you're no longer attracted to them

2738
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,240
and you're considering breaking up

2739
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,240
I don't think you were that connected to them in the first place

2740
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,240
that's how I feel

2741
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,240
it's gonna be possible

2742
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,240
if you've got a guy who prides himself

2743
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,240
on his physique and wants to date a girl

2744
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:35,240
who feels the same way

2745
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,240
and maybe they even bonded over their physical fitness

2746
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,240
if the girl starts to slip

2747
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,240
and it's not

2748
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,240
it doesn't matter

2749
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:45,240
but then the person is not doing this thing

2750
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:47,240
that is important to the other person

2751
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:49,240
I'm never gonna judge anybody

2752
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,240
for breaking up with anybody for any reason

2753
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,240
because this is a voluntary opt-in situation

2754
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:55,240
I feel like this is not something that you would need

2755
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:57,240
to ask for advice from us for

2756
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,240
this is something that would be a topic

2757
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,240
of conversation with you and this girl

2758
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,240
you know why he's asking

2759
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,240
it's because he's not attracted

2760
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,240
maybe it's not the specific guy

2761
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,240
the idea here is he's not attracted

2762
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,240
or something like that

2763
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,240
and he feels guilty about feeling this way

2764
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,240
that's what's going on

2765
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,240
I wanna say something

2766
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,240
like okay

2767
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,240
the circumstances don't really matter

2768
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,240
the specifics of how much weight was

2769
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,240
gained or whether it was an acid attack

2770
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,240
it's all whatever

2771
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,240
I'm still on that

2772
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,240
acid attack joke by the way

2773
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,240
still just ringing the comedy out of that one

2774
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,240
if you're

2775
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:37,240
not attracted

2776
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,240
the whole idea of

2777
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,240
well let's wait and see

2778
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,240
if we can get back

2779
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,240
let's wait and see if we can

2780
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,240
get her attractive again

2781
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,240
if she'll do that

2782
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:51,240
it shouldn't be a wait and see

2783
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,240
it should be working towards that

2784
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:55,240
it shouldn't be like hopefully my girlfriend

2785
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,240
is gonna start losing weight

2786
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,240
be like hey I don't want to fuck you anymore

2787
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,240
you need to lose weight or this is ending

2788
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,240
I think if you're at the point

2789
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,240
where you're past the point

2790
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,240
if you're not attracted to them anymore

2791
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,240
I think it would be kind of

2792
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,240
asking for a miracle

2793
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:13,240
I think the odds that

2794
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,240
weighting are gonna pan out and be worth it

2795
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,240
are really low

2796
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,240
I mean you know

2797
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,240
he's gotta make that calculation himself

2798
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:23,240
maybe this is a really meaningful

2799
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,240
if you're married to someone and then they get fat

2800
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,240
it's like well Jesus what are we gonna do here

2801
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,240
time for a divorce

2802
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:31,240
sure you might break up with him over this

2803
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:33,240
trying to imagine a circumstance

2804
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,240
where she's like

2805
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:37,240
I imagine if you come to her

2806
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,240
like hey I'm not okay with this

2807
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,240
we need to work through this

2808
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,240
like if her answer is

2809
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,240
no I want to

2810
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,240
be fat then just break up with her

2811
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:49,240
if her answer is

2812
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,240
if her answer is like oh I will try to work through this

2813
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,240
with you like let's work together

2814
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,240
if you do this you will be the bad guy

2815
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,240
unfortunately

2816
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,240
that's okay

2817
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,240
we're talking about breaking up with her

2818
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,240
if she doesn't

2819
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,240
you just have to be firm on your stance

2820
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,240
talking out of my ass

2821
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,240
I will break up with you if you don't lose weight

2822
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,240
but I'm willing to help

2823
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,240
and then if she won't do the steps

2824
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:15,240
that you're trying to take

2825
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:17,240
then you just gotta keep making it clear

2826
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:19,240
you know the problem is

2827
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,240
this situation is framed by society

2828
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,240
that the person

2829
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:25,240
making the complaint is wrong

2830
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,240
because society now is like

2831
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,240
healthy at any size

2832
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,240
you're just being a shallow, vapid person

2833
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:33,240
but it's not that you're being a shallow, vapid person

2834
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,240
it's that this is like Nate said

2835
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,240
a voluntary kind of relationship

2836
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:39,240
that both parties entered into

2837
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,240
and now one of the conditions

2838
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,240
that brought you into it has changed

2839
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,240
and so it's not you being shallow

2840
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,240
it's that one of the main reasons

2841
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,240
you were invested in it to begin with

2842
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:51,240
is no longer valid and so the entire contract

2843
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,240
is now null and void and so

2844
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:55,240
it is not rude, it is not shallow

2845
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:57,240
it completely makes sense

2846
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,240
you say society but I think most people

2847
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:01,240
would agree with our stance here

2848
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,240
I think it would have to

2849
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:05,240
I think even today this would not be

2850
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,240
considered unreasonable

2851
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,240
I'm sure people would do it

2852
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:11,240
I'm only saying more that society

2853
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,240
would say that

2854
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,240
the culture would present someone

2855
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:17,240
doing this as being kind of a dick

2856
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,240
I mean I think you could

2857
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:21,240
probably spin it

2858
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:23,240
either way

2859
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,240
I don't think there's an argument to be made that you're a dick

2860
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,240
if you're trying to help them lose the weight

2861
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,240
it'd be one thing if you're just like you need to burn weight

2862
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,240
or else fuck you

2863
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,240
I don't think you should have to

2864
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,240
help them

2865
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,240
I don't think you should be responsible for them at all

2866
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,240
you don't have to

2867
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,240
I think if you're in a good relationship

2868
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,240
then there should be some

2869
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,240
like I'm not saying you have to

2870
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,240
literally like take them to the classes

2871
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,240
and everything I'm just saying that like

2872
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,240
if you just break up with someone out of nowhere

2873
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,240
and you didn't mention this was a problem

2874
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,240
that would be a dick move

2875
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:57,240
if you're like telling them like hey this is something

2876
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:59,240
that I have a problem with

2877
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:01,240
there needs to be an effort made on your part

2878
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:03,240
then I don't think that's being a dick

2879
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:05,240
yeah

2880
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,240
seems reasonable to me

2881
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,240
you know

2882
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,240
you guys may or may not be aware

2883
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:13,240
you guys may or may not be aware

2884
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,240
that I not too long ago got out of a relationship

2885
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:17,240
and

2886
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:19,240
it's not

2887
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,240
but it feels kind of the same

2888
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,240
like in my case

2889
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,240
it was the personality that got

2890
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:27,240
fat in this case

2891
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,240
but you know

2892
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:35,240
there's this great market

2893
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,240
my only point is that

2894
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,240
you can't like wait for it to get better

2895
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,240
like you gotta

2896
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,240
you should

2897
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,240
9 times out of 10, 99 times out of 100

2898
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:47,240
it's better to cut that cord sooner rather than later

2899
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,240
then there's this amazing

2900
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:51,240
there's this manga called

2901
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,240
Enclosed Called Fat

2902
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,240
by Moyoko Anno

2903
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,240
and there's an amazing line

2904
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,240
where the main girl is like

2905
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,240
fat and

2906
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,240
there's a lot of people who wrong her

2907
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,240
throughout the story but her solution

2908
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,240
to that is to become a cunt

2909
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,240
and like she loses a bunch of weight

2910
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,240
by just purging and shit

2911
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,240
and then like once she gets skinny

2912
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:15,240
she's just like a total bitch

2913
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,240
there's a scene where this personal trainer

2914
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,240
who had like wanted to work with her

2915
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,240
but she like blew off the personal trainer

2916
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,240
she didn't want to have to work for it

2917
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,240
she just wanted to vomit her way to victory basically

2918
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,240
and she meets the personal trainer again

2919
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,240
and she's just saying some like some cunty shit to her

2920
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,240
and then she leaves the restaurant

2921
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:33,240
or whatever that they're at

2922
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,240
and the trainer says to her assistant

2923
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,240
the assistant's like oh well she lost a lot of weight

2924
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,240
and she goes no

2925
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,240
the fat was in her soul

2926
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,240
there you go

2927
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,240
I think I've seen that panel

2928
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:47,240
like on 4chan or something

2929
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,240
I know the comic

2930
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:51,240
and I've definitely seen that panel

2931
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:53,240
the fat was in her soul

2932
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:55,240
you know it just makes me think I know we spent a while on this

2933
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,240
but like it just I think like

2934
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,240
people will get mad at you

2935
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,240
like the thing that keeps coming to my mind is like

2936
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:03,240
what if your wife has a baby

2937
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:05,240
and she gains like a hundred pounds

2938
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:07,240
while having the baby

2939
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,240
it's like okay of course

2940
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:11,240
and then help her work it back down

2941
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,240
two years later

2942
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,240
and we're still

2943
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,240
I mean that's a thing

2944
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:19,240
your first mistake was you got married

2945
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,240
alright that was your first problem

2946
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:23,240
and your second mistake was

2947
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,240
once you have a kid

2948
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:27,240
I don't know pity at all

2949
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,240
I think if you have a kid

2950
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,240
then you're not gonna be like

2951
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:33,240
so concerned about how sexually attractive

2952
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:35,240
your wife is you're a little more concerned about other things

2953
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:37,240
it seems like a lot of guys

2954
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:39,240
cheat after their fucking wife has

2955
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:41,240
a baby and they get fat and unattractive

2956
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,240
like let's avoid it

2957
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:45,240
men's libido doesn't die down

2958
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:47,240
what do you do

2959
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,240
what do you expect

2960
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:51,240
what you do is that you're clear to like your wife

2961
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,240
in this case that like listen I love you

2962
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,240
we had a kid I want to raise together

2963
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:57,240
I gotta tell you though your fat as hell

2964
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:59,240
and hashtag no fat checks

2965
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:01,240
we need to work on this

2966
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:03,240
you said I had like 10 more

2967
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,240
voicemails right

2968
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,240
look we're not gonna listen to all of them

2969
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,240
wait we're not

2970
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:11,240
well I mean we got like

2971
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,240
like 50 there's no point

2972
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:15,240
we probably got like 15 of them

2973
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:17,240
that's like way too many to listen to all of I think

2974
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:19,240
I just grabbed some random ones

2975
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,240
we could probably go through them faster

2976
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:23,240
I mean we 100% could

2977
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:25,240
should we

2978
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,240
play the next one

2979
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,240
should we have it that

2980
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:31,240
voicemail shouldn't be for questions

2981
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,240
since we already have a question section

2982
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,240
I mean

2983
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,240
what would we prefer

2984
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:39,240
I feel like if we're getting questions from voicemails

2985
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,240
um

2986
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,240
then we don't do questions but then that just means

2987
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:45,240
people have to record and we won't take any

2988
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,240
I mean we could do that I mean

2989
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,240
I don't know I'm just throwing that out there we can think on it

2990
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,240
depends on what we discuss it later

2991
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:53,240
leave a comment

2992
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:55,240
alright well let's get to another one here's one from

2993
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:57,240
Mishin

2994
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,240
this guy's a big patron guy

2995
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,240
see him around alright let's see what he has to say here

2996
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:03,240
Nate

2997
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:05,240
he's pronounced Trafalgar

2998
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,240
say it with me

2999
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:09,240
Trafalgar

3000
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,240
Trafalgar

3001
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,240
okay this guy

3002
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:15,240
this guy has been told me that I say Trafalgar

3003
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,240
or Trafalgar

3004
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,240
Trafalgar

3005
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:21,240
Trafalgar

3006
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:23,240
Trafalgar

3007
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:25,240
Trafalgar

3008
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,240
Trafalgar law

3009
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:29,240
there's a character in one piece

3010
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:31,240
that is named after a real person

3011
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:33,240
who is called

3012
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,240
he's named after

3013
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,240
a battle

3014
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:39,240
where somebody

3015
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,240
was a pirate or a sailor

3016
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,240
I don't know what I'm talking about

3017
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:45,240
in London there's a place

3018
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,240
called Trafalgar Square that's how you say it

3019
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:49,240
Trafalgar

3020
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:51,240
more like Trafalgar

3021
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:53,240
Trafalgar we hold on

3022
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:55,240
now I'm confused

3023
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:57,240
because I go

3024
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:59,240
to the underground

3025
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,240
sometimes and I swear

3026
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:03,240
they said the word before

3027
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:05,240
I'll have to listen because I'll be traveling soon

3028
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,240
so I'll have to pay attention if I pass it

3029
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,240
how they pronounce it

3030
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:11,240
yeah if you're around there let me know

3031
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:13,240
let's get the real shit

3032
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,240
Nate am I crazy

3033
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,240
or did one of our weird

3034
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,240
smattering of ritualistically

3035
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:21,240
sung birthday songs in our family

3036
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:23,240
did one of them mention Trafalgar Square

3037
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,240
no way

3038
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:27,240
I don't think so

3039
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,240
let's review those

3040
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:31,240
and get back to them

3041
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:33,240
let's go through the entire list

3042
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:35,240
right now

3043
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:37,240
maybe we did

3044
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:39,240
here's another one from

3045
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:41,240

I wanna know your opinion on

3051
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,240
diegetic

3052
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,240
things in games

3053
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:57,240
they're good

3054
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:59,240
diegetic

3055
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:01,240
diegetic things

3056
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:03,240
what do you mean by diegetic

3057
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:05,240
non-diegetic

3058
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:07,240
he's just fucking joking around

3059
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:09,240
he doesn't mean anything that's not a real question

3060
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:11,240
he's just goofing around

3061
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,240
I thought we screened these

3062
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,240
what do you mean no

3063
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:17,240
diegesis explicit that we do not screen

3064
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,240
I'm coming out

3065
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,240
I'm coming out as anti-diegesis right now

3066
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,240
I don't believe in it

3067
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:25,240
is the next fucking call

3068
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:27,240
that doesn't mean let's just move on

3069
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:29,240
fucking hero trash you don't even speak

3070
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,240
ok next one

3071
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:33,240
this one's from Gazy Eric

3072
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:35,240
Gazy Eric or something

3073
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,240
alright what do you got

3074
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,240
hey guys

3075
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:41,240
girls like me

3076
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:43,240
because you sound like that

3077
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:45,240
you can't just live in the woods bro

3078
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,240
you will be raped by bears

3079
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:49,240
the bears will rape you

3080
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:51,240
stop being afraid of the government

3081
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:53,240
you need to be afraid of the bears

3082
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:55,240
the government

3083
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:57,240
you see the government works for you

3084
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:59,240
but who do the bears work for

3085
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:01,240
they just want to

3086
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,240
right and that's why

3087
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,240
you need to be afraid of the bears

3088
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:07,240
they make bear mace

3089
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,240
this

3090
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,240
alright I pause it

3091
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:13,240
this fucking Canadian idiot

3092
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:15,240
there are no bears in the UK

3093
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:17,240
I thought this was so random for you

3094
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:19,240
probably

3095
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:21,240
you really

3096
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:23,240
you really just poked a hole

3097
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:25,240
right in his

3098
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:27,240
argument

3099
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:29,240
you didn't even need to live in the UK

3100
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:31,240
there is bear mace and there are shotguns

3101
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:33,240
they are made to deal with bears

3102
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,240
what if they sneak up on you

3103
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:37,240
it's a fucking bear

3104
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:39,240
you get bear dar

3105
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:41,240
alright next one

3106
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:43,240
yeah we sell bear dar

3107
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:45,240
so we got that covered

3108
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:47,240
if only Steve Hornet had that

3109
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,240
you know sting radar

3110
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,240
that is

3111
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,240
alright here we go

3112
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:55,240
Ligma

3113
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:57,240
no PCP

3114
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:59,240
you are stupid for being called the PCP

3115
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:01,240
while your logo explicitly says

3116
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:03,240
TPC

3117
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:05,240
it's incongruent

3118
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:07,240
it's a call out

3119
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:09,240
wait what was that last bit

3120
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:11,240
he said it's incongruent

3121
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:13,240
it is incongruent

3122
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:15,240
it is incongruent

3123
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,240
we talked about this

3124
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:19,240
we talked about changing it

3125
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,240
and we all agreed we should change it

3126
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,240
just like everything else we do

3127
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:25,240
we need more follow through

3128
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:27,240
we have discussed this

3129
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,240
the idea is that the channel and the group

3130
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:31,240
are the procrastinators

3131
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:33,240
and this particular podcast is the

3132
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:35,240
procrastinators podcast

3133
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:37,240
but we refer to ourselves as the PCP

3134
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,240
for short because it sounds better

3135
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:41,240
than TPC

3136
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:43,240
also we can't say the TPC

3137
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:45,240
just be the PCP

3138
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:47,240
the PCP makes more sense

3139
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:49,240
it's a clusterfuck our names are terrible

3140
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:51,240
but

3141
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:53,240
I still like the idea

3142
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:55,240
despite

3143
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:57,240
how difficult it is to say

3144
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:59,240
we always say we're the PCP blah blah blah

3145
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:01,240
I still prefer

3146
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:03,240
the fact that we are the procrastinators

3147
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:05,240
and this is one of the podcasts

3148
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:07,240
we have the procrastinators drawcast

3149
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:09,240
the PCD

3150
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:11,240
we just don't use those abbreviations

3151
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:13,240
and

3152
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:15,240
we have other things

3153
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:17,240
we kind of have a new thing

3154
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:19,240
the races

3155
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:21,240
actually

3156
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:23,240
there's a thing that you'll

3157
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:25,240
by now you'll have seen it already

3158
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:27,240
it's the fucking

3159
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:29,240
backseat gamers

3160
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:31,240
backseat gaming

3161
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:33,240
we should google that

3162
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,240
we'll confirm that

3163
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:37,240
you'll know what the actual title is

3164
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:39,240
but this is the procrastinators present

3165
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:41,240
backseat gaming live

3166
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:43,240
there is a

3167
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:45,240
show done by smosh

3168
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:47,240
called backseat gaming

3169
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,240
there is no channel called backseat gaming

3170
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,240
but you know

3171
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,240
it is smosh

3172
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:55,240
so these videos have like a million views each

3173
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,240
alright well whatever

3174
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:59,240
here's another one

3175
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,240
here's one from

3176
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:03,240
slightly better guy ever

3177
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:05,240
alright

3178
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:07,240
well played

3179
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:09,240
hello

3180
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:11,240
I love that wine

3181
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:13,240
podcast

3182
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:15,240
Nate

3183
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:17,240
in the same episode of the podcast

3184
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:19,240
which is

3185
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:21,240
expressed as a desire for

3186
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:23,240
on the one hand

3187
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,240
small government

3188
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:27,240
in a libertarian sense of the word

3189
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:29,240
and on the other hand

3190
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,240
the goal of humanity should be

3191
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:33,240
starfleet

3192
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:35,240
I believe

3193
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:37,240
should be pointed out to him

3194
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:39,240
that star trek

3195
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:41,240
is literally communism

3196
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:43,240
no it's not

3197
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:45,240
they're post scarcity

3198
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:47,240
does communism even mean anything

3199
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:49,240
in a post scarcity society

3200
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:51,240
anytime someone says that they are missing

3201
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:53,240
that in star trek you are allowed

3202
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:55,240
to do whatever you want

3203
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:57,240
there is no obligation

3204
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,240
whatsoever there are people who live their whole lives

3205
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:01,240
in hollow rooms just

3206
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:03,240
fapping like all day

3207
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,240
explicitly stated there are people who just

3208
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:07,240
have escaped into hollow

3209
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:09,240
reality because there is no

3210
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:11,240
obligation to do anything in that world

3211
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:13,240
I hear this too much it's disconcerting how

3212
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,240
many times I hear this point so

3213
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:17,240
slightly better guy ever you are in fact not

3214
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:19,240
you're slightly worse guy ever

3215
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:21,240
look star trek exists in a world

3216
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:23,240
just to be super explicit where

3217
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,240
like the economic system

3218
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:27,240
known as capitalism and communism are

3219
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:29,240
completely obsolete because there is

3220
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:31,240
no need to control the distribution

3221
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:33,240
of resources because everyone effectively

3222
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:35,240
has infinite resources

3223
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:37,240
at least in terms of like you can generate

3224
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:39,240
food there is no need to worry about it

3225
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:41,240
they've got whatever food generator

3226
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:43,240
things I forget what they're called

3227
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:45,240
to say that we need to still adhere

3228
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,240
to the same paradigm as capitalism

3229
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:49,240
or communism it doesn't work that same way

3230
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:51,240
things have completely changed

3231
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:53,240
because they've got the food assemblers

3232
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:55,240
and whatever and like

3233
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,240
sure it's fair to say that like I'm sure

3234
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,240
big businesses are still out there

3235
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:01,240
but like currency has

3236
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:03,240
not really

3237
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:05,240
you know what okay there is actually something to the argument

3238
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:07,240
because trade still exists

3239
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:09,240
there is still things and items

3240
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,240
that you can't just replicate replicators

3241
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:13,240
that's what they're called but like

3242
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:15,240
people do exchange those

3243
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:17,240
god you know what am I wrong here

3244
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:19,240
I'm because like

3245
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:21,240
when they trade with the Ferengi the

3246
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:23,240
the Starfleet has to actually use things of value

3247
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,240
like things that can't just be generated

3248
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,240
and what is it it's like a gold

3249
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,240
gold pressed latinum that's like

3250
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:31,240
the currency that they love

3251
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:33,240
gold pressed latinum

3252
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:35,240
it's gold pressed latinum and you see what they do

3253
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,240
is they take worthless gold

3254
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,240
they take worthless gold that can be replicated

3255
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:41,240
and they encase liquid

3256
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:43,240
latinum within these gold bars

3257
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:45,240
what the fuck is latinum

3258
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,240
latinum is a fictional thing that is very valuable

3259
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,240
and is like used for stuff

3260
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:51,240
it's like it's like latinum but you without the

3261
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:53,240
P in it it's valuable for some reason that I

3262
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:55,240
can't remember um so you can use that like

3263
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:57,240
they put it in gold because the stupid

3264
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:59,240
people watching the show will know that it's

3265
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,240
gold and shiny and worth something

3266
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:03,240
that's right they encase it in worthless gold

3267
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:05,240
explicitly worthless gold

3268
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,240
because the human brain is wired

3269
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:09,240
to respond to gold as if it were money

3270
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,240
or something I'm sure that's why the show writers

3271
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:13,240
chose to do that yeah I think that makes sense

3272
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:15,240
in world as well but like

3273
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:17,240
okay but in Starfleet alright if you're

3274
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:19,240
let's say you're a person in the Federation

3275
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,240
you've got like for example

3276
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:23,240
there are like shipyards where they build

3277
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:25,240
starfleets they use giant like

3278
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:27,240
they use giant replicators

3279
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,240
to produce ship parts that are then assembled

3280
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:31,240
they have to like do that okay

3281
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,240
if you've got a businessman who has one of

3282
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:35,240
those and you've got somebody else

3283
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:37,240
who like doesn't have one okay you know what

3284
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:39,240
here's the issue is that the Federation

3285
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:41,240
Federation itself is post scarcity

3286
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,240
but there is a whole entire galaxy out

3287
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:45,240
there still operating within

3288
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:47,240
you know capitalistic enterprise in order to

3289
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,240
interact with them you have to kind of lower yourself

3290
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:51,240
down to these ancient capitalist

3291
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:53,240
tradition and so well kind of kind of

3292
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:55,240
but like there's like

3293
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:57,240
within the Federation there's nothing

3294
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:59,240
that's for like like communism enforces

3295
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,240
you to say no you get this

3296
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:03,240
and nothing else within the Federation

3297
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,240
you can be a capitalist

3298
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:07,240
it's just that like there's no point in

3299
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,240
trading things like food because

3300
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:11,240
everyone can just get infinite food all the time

3301
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:13,240
so that industry gone doesn't matter anymore

3302
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:15,240
you could trade like minerals and stuff

3303
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,240
which you absolutely can do and

3304
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,240
people do all the time so it's still

3305
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:21,240
how does the how does how do you

3306
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,240
stock a replicator with the

3307
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:25,240
I'll tell you how the only thing a replicator

3308
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:27,240
needs is power because a replicator

3309
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:29,240
what it does is where'd you get that

3310
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:31,240
well I know because the way replicator works

3311
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:33,240
is it doesn't use anything except the

3312
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:35,240
subatomic subatomic particles

3313
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:37,240
that are scattered throughout the universe

3314
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:39,240
in a basically infinite amount

3315
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:41,240
it just reassembles those particles

3316
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,240
from like the space within the replicator

3317
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,240
just fucking makes it out of

3318
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:47,240
cosmic background radiation

3319
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,240
so you've got like

3320
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:51,240
does it like suck up space dust

3321
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,240
on the way and then it's got a full tank

3322
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:55,240
of atoms

3323
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,240
subatomic particles exist everywhere

3324
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:59,240
all the time subatomic particles

3325
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,240
you're a subatomic

3326
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:03,240
tarticle

3327
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:05,240
nailed it there's no amount of

3328
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,240
like

3329
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:09,240
stuff that you could make that would like use them up

3330
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:11,240
they're just everywhere all the time

3331
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:13,240
so that's how it works

3332
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:15,240
dude what about a

3333
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,240
scared post-it society

3334
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:19,240
where the male doesn't arrive

3335
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:21,240
we could like replicate our

3336
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:23,240
wait shit I missed it

3337
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:25,240
he said a

3338
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:27,240
scared post-it society

3339
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:29,240
where the male

3340
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:31,240
never shows up on time

3341
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,240
I have bad news for you

3342
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:35,240
that's a real life

3343
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:37,240
alright that was good

3344
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:39,240
alright I think we answered this question

3345
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:41,240
it's not a cognizant

3346
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,240
what if we could replicate our weed bro

3347
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,240
the point is like you can still

3348
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:47,240
be a businessman at a federation

3349
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,240
like if it was actual communism they would like kill you

3350
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:51,240
if you try to be like

3351
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:53,240
a businessman in a capitalist way

3352
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:55,240
so don't worry about it

3353
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:57,240
alright here's one and this will be like the last one

3354
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:59,240
I think

3355
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:01,240
this is the best idea

3356
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:03,240
this is the best idea

3357
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:05,240
this is actually the best addition to the show

3358
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:07,240
I'm the one who did this

3359
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:09,240
I'm making all the credit

3360
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:11,240
Tom's the one who set it up for us

3361
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,240
really we'll escape from people

3362
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:15,240
framing their shit exactly like

3363
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:17,240
the biggest problem in the universe

3364
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:19,240
voicemails

3365
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:21,240
hopefully when they see the freedom

3366
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:23,240
that they're given here

3367
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:25,240
this is another one from our good friend

3368
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:27,240
xxx epic gamer 420

3369
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:29,240
xxx

3370
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:31,240
let's see what he's got for us

3371
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:35,240
is it playing?

3372
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:37,240
nothing I don't hear anything

3373
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:39,240
hang on let me disconnect

3374
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:41,240
I'll try this

3375
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:43,240
I did do that right

3376
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:45,240
play go

3377
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:47,240
how dare you insult my god damn

3378
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,240
my quality munchie

3379
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:51,240
this isn't okay

3380
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:53,240
I was not dealing with this

3381
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:55,240
I challenge you on the name of the lord

3382
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:57,240
as a battle

3383
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,240
on trek super slam

3384
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:01,240
next week 5 o'clock

3385
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:03,240
time zone you do see

3386
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:05,240
okay

3387
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:07,240
this is real shit I'm not gonna stand for this boy

3388
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:11,240
okay I guess our good friend epic gamer

3389
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:13,240
we'll have to pass this along

3390
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,240
yeah we'll have to pass this along

3391
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:17,240
also like it's weird that the PCPs come out like a week later

3392
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:19,240
so I don't know exactly what like time

3393
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,240
but apparently munchie's been challenged

3394
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,240
for the game of epic shrek super slam

3395
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:25,240
was that the game?

3396
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,240
it appears to be a Nintendo DS

3397
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:29,240
like a brawl game

3398
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:33,240
that sounds good

3399
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:35,240
it's also on gamecube

3400
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:37,240
I guess

3401
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:39,240
okay that's what he's talking about

3402
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:41,240
and playstation 2

3403
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:43,240
Jesus fuck

3404
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:45,240
how is this even real

3405
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:47,240
here's another one

3406
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,240
this is from hentai is a japanese colloquialism

3407
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:51,240
alright

3408
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:53,240
what do we got

3409
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:55,240
this question goes out to all the members of the pcp

3410
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,240
if you can switch bodies with any member of the pcp

3411
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:59,240
for a limited amount of time

3412
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:01,240
and do whatever you want

3413
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:03,240
side to body

3414
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:05,240
and why

3415
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:07,240
before we address that question

3416
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:09,240
I just want to point out that hentai

3417
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,240
is not a japanese colloquialism

3418
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:13,240
but it is an american colloquialism

3419
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:15,240
because that's true

3420
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:17,240
the way that we use the word hentai

3421
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:19,240
is not how it's used in japan

3422
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:21,240
do they use it that same way

3423
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:23,240
I mean what do they call it

3424
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:25,240
the word hentai just means pervert

3425
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:27,240
or strange over there

3426
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,240
but the word ecchi means sex

3427
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:31,240
and when they call something

3428
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,240
like an ecchi game

3429
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:35,240
this is like an h game

3430
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,240
and I think that because of the fact that the word hentai

3431
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:39,240
is used a lot in anime

3432
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:41,240
especially in the 90's

3433
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:43,240
like characters would call each other hentai all the time

3434
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:45,240
and so like

3435
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:47,240
when they call someone hentai

3436
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:49,240
when in an anime they say

3437
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:51,240
when a boy breaks into a girl's room

3438
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:53,240
and she is naked and she screams hentai

3439
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:55,240
she's actually using that as an adjective

3440
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:57,240
she's describing how pervert she is

3441
02:02:57,240 --> 02:02:59,240
she's saying you are a pervert

3442
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:01,240
she's calling him a pervert

3443
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:03,240
now it's an adjective

3444
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:05,240
she's describing the situation with this

3445
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:07,240
adjective phrase

3446
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:09,240
she's calling him a pervert

3447
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:11,240
literally saying you pervert

3448
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:13,240
hentai is mostly an insult to

3449
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:15,240
it can mean pervert

3450
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:17,240
or it can just be weirdo

3451
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:19,240
if you called someone a hentai in another context

3452
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:21,240
you might just be saying they are warped

3453
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:23,240
in the head kind of thing

3454
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:25,240
but it was a popular insult

3455
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:27,240
especially in the 90's in anime

3456
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:29,240
so when that shit came to America

3457
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:31,240
we tried to give a name to porn

3458
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:33,240
and we saw that they were called like h anime

3459
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,240
which would be read as ecchi anime

3460
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:37,240
we called it hentai

3461
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:39,240
because we are conflating these two terms

3462
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:41,240
this is how I understand the history anyways

3463
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:43,240
so

3464
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:45,240
hentai as a description of porn

3465
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:47,240
is an American colloquialism

3466
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:49,240
that's true

3467
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:51,240
anyway what the fuck was the question

3468
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,240
oh yeah if we could switch

3469
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:55,240
be in someone's body

3470
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:57,240
I would switch with Tom

3471
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:59,240
I would draw something from a top down perspective

3472
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:01,240
much more easily

3473
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:03,240
and then I would leave

3474
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:05,240
I would inhabit munchies body

3475
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:07,240
so I could enslave humanity and bend them to my will

3476
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:09,240
that's what I would do

3477
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:11,240
yeah

3478
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:15,240
I would inhabit munchies body

3479
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:17,240
and then just jump through windows

3480
02:04:21,240 --> 02:04:23,240
I would probably inhabit any of you American guys

3481
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:25,240
and eat all the American things I haven't tasted before

3482
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:27,240
like a peanut burger and jelly sandwich

3483
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:29,240
I still want to have them

3484
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:31,240
do it to Ben so he could ruin his keto

3485
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:37,240
it's the baby roost school

3486
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:39,240
shooting all over again

3487
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:41,240
oh that gives me a good idea

3488
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:43,240
I would go into

3489
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:45,240
any one of you American

3490
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:47,240
boys bodies

3491
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:49,240
and I would log into my pokemon go

3492
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:51,240
catch loads of toys

3493
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:53,240
spin loads of pokeballs

3494
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:55,240
stop thinking

3495
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:57,240
it saves on

3496
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:59,240
flight money

3497
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:01,240
and I could be at red corn

3498
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:03,240
for as someone else

3499
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:05,240
convenient

3500
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:07,240
then we'd have to pay for the plane ticket

3501
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:09,240
with your money

3502
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:11,240
I would go into mage's body

3503
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:13,240
and then I'd just look in a mirror and be like ah

3504
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:15,240
this is what mage looks like

3505
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:17,240
and then I'd go talk to biter in real life

3506
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:19,240
I'd be like what's he like IRL

3507
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:21,240
I'm gonna learn

3508
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:23,240
the year you would do that though

3509
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:25,240
because one fourth

3510
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:27,240
of the year I'm in Lithuania

3511
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:29,240
hence no biter

3512
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:31,240
if I end up in Lithuania I will just

3513
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:33,240
use your money that's not my money

3514
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:35,240
to fly back

3515
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:37,240
then you could meet the mysterious

3516
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:39,240
cryptid that is

3517
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,240
Grammy mage

3518
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:43,240
see you later grandma

3519
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:45,240
don'ts your head is in the toilet

3520
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:47,240
I'm leaving

3521
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:49,240
Grammy mage behind

3522
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:51,240
goodbye

3523
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:53,240
she's not called that

3524
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:55,240
she's Archmage

3525
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:57,240
she's an ancient wizard

3526
02:05:57,240 --> 02:05:59,240
the Archmage beckons

3527
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:01,240
I just really like the prefix Arch

3528
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:03,240
I would enter Tom's body

3529
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:05,240
and commit crimes

3530
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:07,240
because

3531
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:09,240
he's too poor

3532
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:11,240
to sue me

3533
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:13,240
and bring a claim to court that it was actually

3534
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:15,240
me

3535
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:17,240
so he gets stuck with the rat

3536
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:19,240
yeah

3537
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:21,240
if you guys entered my body

3538
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:23,240
would you be able to speak Lithuanian

3539
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:27,240
I'm gonna go with it

3540
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:29,240
I don't think so

3541
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:31,240
oh I changed your mind you were saying yeah

3542
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:33,240
I was bullied

3543
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:35,240
I mean come on

3544
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:37,240
what do you get the other person's knowledge

3545
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:39,240
that's crazy

3546
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:41,240
if you jump into their body

3547
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:43,240
and you gain their knowledge then how much of it is

3548
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:45,240
I mean if I gain their knowledge

3549
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:47,240
then how much of it is she's body

3550
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:49,240
just so I can understand

3551
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:51,240
this is not a headmate

3552
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:53,240
this is not a headmate situation

3553
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:55,240
this is a freaking fighter

3554
02:06:55,240 --> 02:06:57,240
I agree

3555
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:59,240
obvious

3556
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:01,240
we've milked this question enough

3557
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:03,240
it's a gold standard

3558
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:05,240
I feel like we've had this question before

3559
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:07,240
I don't remember ever answering

3560
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:09,240
I like their answers better this time

3561
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:11,240
well the problem with the question is that

3562
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:13,240
the only person with a body

3563
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:15,240
there to be in is Munchie

3564
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:17,240
because the rest of us are all like

3565
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:19,240
exactly the same and Munchie is like

3566
02:07:19,240 --> 02:07:21,240
like a towering monument

3567
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:23,240
to Carnage

3568
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:25,240
you should all want to swap into my body

3569
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:27,240
to experience

3570
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:29,240
to experience the mental and physical powers

3571
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:33,240
I thought about going into Ben's body

3572
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:35,240
so that I could be a human skunk

3573
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:37,240
and just run people out of rooms that I don't like

3574
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:41,240
Ben when you come over we have to take you to Keto World

3575
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:43,240
that's an exaggeration

3576
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:45,240
it's all the benefit none of the consequences

3577
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:47,240
here's one more thing

3578
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:49,240
if I couldn't be one of you guys

3579
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:51,240
I would also want to be in Hippo's body

3580
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,240
because then I could be like

3581
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:55,240
I could have like this British accent

3582
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:57,240
and then record funny stuff

3583
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:59,240
with the funny accent

3584
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:01,240
that's true

3585
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:03,240
that's true

3586
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:05,240
but it's not

3587
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:07,240
like Hippo's accent

3588
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:09,240
I like his accent more

3589
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:11,240
when he says things

3590
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:13,240
it's funnier than when I say things

3591
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:15,240
that's of mysterious

3592
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:17,240
that's true

3593
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:19,240
okay here we go

3594
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:21,240
next one from Munchie

3595
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:23,240
you're right mage I can't take Hippo's

3596
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:25,240
that's not funny

3597
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:27,240
alright everyone shut the hell up

3598
02:08:27,240 --> 02:08:29,240
Munchie what do you got for us

3599
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:31,240
I'm really passionate about

3600
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:33,240
that land ownership topic

3601
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:35,240
you guys touched on in the last episode

3602
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:37,240
like if you live somewhere

3603
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:39,240
for like 5 to 10 years

3604
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:41,240
or whatever you get to own that place

3605
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:43,240
so why are my parents kicking me out of the basement

3606
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:45,240
this is fucking bullshit

3607
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:51,240
I think

3608
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:53,240
you got a case

3609
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:55,240
just because

3610
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:57,240
I don't have a job

3611
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:59,240
I own this

3612
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:01,240
it's the law

3613
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:05,240
I think he's got a case

3614
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:07,240
I'll give you a review of the aesthetics

3615
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,240
of Isis's flag

3616
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:11,240
thank you

3617
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:13,240
I haven't seen that

3618
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:15,240
I'll look that up

3619
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:17,240
I know what it looks like

3620
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:19,240
it's got that minimalism going on

3621
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:21,240
oh

3622
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:23,240
it looks like a fucking

3623
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:25,240
Blackbeard's Jolly Roger

3624
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:27,240
it looks like the cover of a Godspeed You Black Emperor album

3625
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:29,240
yeah I like it

3626
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:31,240
I gotta say

3627
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:33,240
this is really turning me around

3628
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:35,240
look at

3629
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:37,240
I just googled it

3630
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:39,240
it is kind of piratey

3631
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:41,240
it's really piratey

3632
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:43,240
it's sort of

3633
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:45,240
I don't really care for the

3634
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:47,240
font they used

3635
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:49,240
I don't like how imperfect the circle is

3636
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:51,240
what is with this bullshit

3637
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:53,240
I like that

3638
02:09:53,240 --> 02:09:55,240
I think this would look

3639
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:57,240
it's got that DIY aesthetic

3640
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:59,240
I think it's pretty nice

3641
02:09:59,240 --> 02:10:01,240
it would be right at home in a zine

3642
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:03,240
I guess that's true

3643
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:05,240
this flag just screams India

3644
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:07,240
they're pretty handy

3645
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:09,240
I guess it does

3646
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:11,240
but I will always prefer the Nazi

3647
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:13,240
rigid German

3648
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:15,240
efficiencies

3649
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:17,240
perfect symbol

3650
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:19,240
I know I think

3651
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:21,240
I'm going with Isis

3652
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:23,240
I think I'm going with Isis

3653
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:25,240
it was inevitable

3654
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:27,240
Ben's Isis I'm a Nazi

3655
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:29,240
stay tuned for the next bonus episode

3656
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:31,240
oh shit

3657
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:33,240
not bad

3658
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:35,240
we have to learn the languages

3659
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:37,240
alright

3660
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:39,240
what else we got here

3661
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:41,240
do we want to comment on his whole

3662
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:43,240
I think we all agree he deserves to live there

3663
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:45,240
in the basement

3664
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:47,240
yeah yeah yeah

3665
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:49,240
contact your representative

3666
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:51,240
call up Joe Biden

3667
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:53,240
to join us

3668
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:55,240
you know who I hear is

3669
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:57,240
pretty good about property ownership

3670
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:59,240
is Donald Trump

3671
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:01,240
maybe give him a call

3672
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:03,240
he probably would know how to handle this

3673
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:05,240
you got to call the law offices

3674
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:07,240
of Barry Feinstein

3675
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:09,240
he's absolutely convinced you have a case

3676
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:11,240
he can

3677
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:13,240
probably talk your dad into giving you a small

3678
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:15,240
loan of a million dollars

3679
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:17,240
alright

3680
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:19,240
this will be our last one

3681
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:21,240
I could do these for another hour

3682
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:23,240
but we got to get to the end

3683
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:25,240
the other questions and stuff

3684
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:27,240
alright this is our last one

3685
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:29,240
this is from Shankins

3686
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:31,240
let's see what you got brother

3687
02:11:31,240 --> 02:11:33,240
hey during Radcon 3

3688
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:35,240
you guys did a Katamari LP

3689
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:37,240
I paid a five dollars

3690
02:11:37,240 --> 02:11:39,240
to ask a question on the

3691
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:41,240
live stream chat

3692
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:43,240
but you guys never responded and ended up

3693
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:45,240
ending the stream without looking at the chat

3694
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:47,240
so I'll ask you guys

3695
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:49,240
the same question that I did back then

3696
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:51,240
again

3697
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:53,240
is there any hard evidence

3698
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:55,240
really hard evidence

3699
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:57,240
just incredibly erect evidence

3700
02:11:57,240 --> 02:11:59,240
that the female orgasm exists

3701
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:01,240
please respond

3702
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:03,240
well

3703
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:05,240
I've seen some hard evidence

3704
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:07,240
I think

3705
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:09,240
how do you know it's not faking

3706
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:11,240
we can't perceive anything to be true

3707
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:13,240
I'm going with no

3708
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:15,240
I mean

3709
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:17,240
wait no

3710
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:19,240
I want to hear what you have to say about this

3711
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:21,240
so that I can just

3712
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:23,240
as I can tell you

3713
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:25,240
that it does exist

3714
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:27,240
but

3715
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:29,240
ok but consider this

3716
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:31,240
we can only be sure that our own

3717
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:33,240
consciousness exists

3718
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:35,240
with that logic

3719
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:37,240
you guys' orgasms don't exist

3720
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:39,240
so to say

3721
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:41,240
I completely agree you can't prove the male orgasm

3722
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:43,240
I mean there's like a physical

3723
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:45,240
product of a male

3724
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:47,240
orgasm you know

3725
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:49,240
is it also for the other one

3726
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:51,240
there's no yes

3727
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:53,240
I mean you can't tell the difference between

3728
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:55,240
what even is it

3729
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:57,240
like what is expelled there and what is expelled there

3730
02:12:57,240 --> 02:12:59,240
I mean really what are we talking about here

3731
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:01,240
I'm going to stop

3732
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:03,240
by the way

3733
02:13:03,240 --> 02:13:05,240
I'm going to stop now

3734
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:07,240
how embarrassing for her

3735
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:09,240
it's because we're getting close to the truth

3736
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:11,240
and we can't

3737
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:13,240
yeah exactly I think we have to call it here

3738
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:15,240
there's no evidence provided to this day

3739
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:17,240
would you be more comfortable if we were debating

3740
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:19,240
the male orgasm

3741
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:21,240
they're equally non-existent as far as I'm concerned

3742
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:23,240
I think that's really

3743
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:25,240
regardless of the gender

3744
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:27,240
orgasm is a social construct

3745
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:29,240
doesn't actually exist

3746
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:31,240
that is true actually

3747
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:33,240
I think that that

3748
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:35,240
well

3749
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:37,240
well it depends on if you consider

3750
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:39,240
we didn't have sex we just sort of came out of the ground

3751
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:41,240
I think there's

3752
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:43,240
a difference between

3753
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:45,240
I think there's a difference between coming and

3754
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:47,240
orgasm and

3755
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:49,240
I think that that difference

3756
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:51,240
are you sure about that

3757
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:53,240
is that based on anything

3758
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:55,240
no I'm not sure anything anymore

3759
02:13:55,240 --> 02:13:57,240
oh I'm going to cooom and then you do it

3760
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:59,240
do you have to say is that what makes it an orgasm

3761
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:01,240
it's like a dragon ball of the attack

3762
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:03,240
you have to do it in the name of the attack before you do it

3763
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:05,240
I consider an orgasm

3764
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:07,240
to be when it's like a full body experience

3765
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:09,240
what

3766
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:11,240
well I don't think that's medically

3767
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:13,240
an orgasm this is

3768
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:15,240
what it is

3769
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:17,240
I don't feel it in my whole body

3770
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:19,240
but like I definitely know what it is

3771
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:21,240
and when it's happening

3772
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:23,240
maybe it does exist but like no one has truly

3773
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:25,240
no human could possibly experience it

3774
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:27,240
because it would like explode

3775
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:29,240
like a nuclear bomb

3776
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:31,240
I guess it all just depends on where you draw the line

3777
02:14:31,240 --> 02:14:33,240
on what is or isn't an orgasm

3778
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:35,240
I'm just looking at pictures of baby ducks

3779
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:39,240
alright I think it's like the speed force

3780
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:41,240
it's like a force that exists outside

3781
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:43,240
of us that we tap into

3782
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:45,240
when we reach that higher level existence

3783
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:47,240
I think that makes sense

3784
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:49,240
I'm going to run with that

3785
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:51,240
so an answer to your question

3786
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:53,240
dear viewer, no

3787
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:55,240
as fake as you are to us

3788
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:57,240
as we are to each other

3789
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:59,240
it makes sense to me

3790
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:01,240
we're all just phantoms

3791
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:03,240
we're all just shadow phantoms

3792
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:05,240
you're the only thing that exists

3793
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:07,240
we're all humans of each other

3794
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:09,240
but phantoms in a dream

3795
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:11,240
alright with that said

3796
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:13,240
I think that was all the ones that I converted

3797
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:15,240
I have to fucking go through and download

3798
02:15:15,240 --> 02:15:17,240
and put them on SoundCloud anyway

3799
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:19,240
I think that was all of them so we're done with that

3800
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:21,240
alright let's get a pity question too in here

3801
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:23,240
wrap this motherfucker up

3802
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:25,240
oh there's a question directed at me

3803
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:27,240
that I want to answer because

3804
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:29,240
it's about my favorite topic ever

3805
02:15:31,240 --> 02:15:33,240
Kajiro's bitter story

3806
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:35,240
do you dream about monsters mage?

3807
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:37,240
that's a good question Tom

3808
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:39,240
Kajiro's bitter story

3809
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:41,240
I think

3810
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:43,240
Kajiro, Kajiro, but yeah

3811
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:45,240
mage have you ever had a dream

3812
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:47,240
that predicted the future

3813
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:49,240
like how I saw the title of the next bonus

3814
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:51,240
I dreamed a dream that mage wouldn't talk about her dreams

3815
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:53,240
shush shush shush

3816
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:55,240
I am talking

3817
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:57,240
alright

3818
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:59,240
like how I saw the title of the next bonus episode

3819
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:01,240
talking while eating in a dream yesterday

3820
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:03,240
I was finishing his question

3821
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:05,240
that's cool that you did

3822
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:07,240
yes I actually

3823
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:09,240
I think there were several occasions

3824
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:11,240
but one that I remember clearly

3825
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:13,240
to this day that it still freaks me out

3826
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:15,240
is like okay so like I was like

3827
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:17,240
11 to 12 years old

3828
02:16:17,240 --> 02:16:19,240
and I had a dream about like this

3829
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:21,240
amazing park and this big ass tree

3830
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:23,240
that I never saw before I never been there

3831
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:25,240
but I had a dream that I was walking there

3832
02:16:25,240 --> 02:16:27,240
and then like fast forward to like two years later

3833
02:16:27,240 --> 02:16:29,240
I'm in England

3834
02:16:29,240 --> 02:16:31,240
for the first time in my life 14 years old

3835
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:33,240
walking in this park

3836
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:35,240
like holy crap

3837
02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:37,240
this is the park I had a dream about

3838
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:39,240
and there we go

3839
02:16:39,240 --> 02:16:41,240
and I think

3840
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:43,240
you can continue

3841
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:45,240
oh thank god

3842
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:47,240
I had a dream about 9-11 happening

3843
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:49,240
the day after it happened

3844
02:16:49,240 --> 02:16:51,240
because I was so distraught

3845
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:53,240
and I love

3846
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:55,240
9-11

3847
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:57,240
good

3848
02:16:57,240 --> 02:16:59,240
you were distraught that it was over

3849
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:01,240
and you'd never get to experience it again

3850
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:03,240
yeah I was too young

3851
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:05,240
it's before my time

3852
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:07,240
it's not fair I never got to see the original broadcast

3853
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:09,240
so that was a pity question

3854
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:11,240
from Twitter right?

3855
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:13,240
no I think that was from the thing

3856
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:15,240
that was from the chat

3857
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:17,240
I see a question here

3858
02:17:17,240 --> 02:17:19,240
from Rusty Shackleford were any of you

3859
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:21,240
ever chunebio when you were younger

3860
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:23,240
and I want to say I'm still chunebio

3861
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:25,240
sometimes

3862
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:27,240
when I'm alone I mean sometimes I still

3863
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:29,240
just strike a pose

3864
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:31,240
I'm like conjuring energy blasts

3865
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:33,240
from my hands just to make myself feel good

3866
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:35,240
about myself

3867
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:37,240
I don't think we need to remind you about Nate in high school

3868
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:39,240
with the vampire hunter D hat

3869
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:41,240
and the fucking

3870
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:43,240
you know and when I was a kid

3871
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:45,240
and being completely silent

3872
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:47,240
at all times because he thought

3873
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:49,240
it would make you more mysterious

3874
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:51,240
I wasn't much better

3875
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:53,240
I had that red leather coat

3876
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:55,240
that I got for a red mage cosplay

3877
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:57,240
and then I wore it to school

3878
02:17:57,240 --> 02:17:59,240
even though it was way too hot

3879
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:01,240
and more chune I'd say

3880
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:03,240
I mean I guess we were just playing

3881
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:05,240
when I was a kid at summer camp

3882
02:18:05,240 --> 02:18:07,240
me and this kid I think his name was David

3883
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:09,240
I can't really remember

3884
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:11,240
we literally said to each other

3885
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:13,240
no no no David, Nate

3886
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:15,240
I have superpowers

3887
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:17,240
I have superpowers

3888
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:19,240
wait you did this?

3889
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:21,240
I just lied I just told vicious lies

3890
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:23,240
that I just had superpowers

3891
02:18:23,240 --> 02:18:25,240
I said like dude

3892
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:27,240
I'm gonna rub my feet on the floor

3893
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:29,240
and then I'll touch something felt

3894
02:18:29,240 --> 02:18:31,240
and it'll be a zap

3895
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:33,240
it'll be nuts

3896
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,240
that's clearly me having superpowers

3897
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:37,240
and then I lied about how I one time made a big energy ball

3898
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:39,240
and it was fucking dope

3899
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:41,240
I spent a while believing

3900
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:43,240
that I was God

3901
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:45,240
and that everyone else was just my dream

3902
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:47,240
my brother Victor

3903
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:49,240
I still think

3904
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:51,240
at one point that he could manipulate fire

3905
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:53,240
if he tried hard enough

3906
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:55,240
me and my friends in high school

3907
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:57,240
we were

3908
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:59,240
vociferously researching

3909
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:01,240
developing telekinetic powers

3910
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:03,240
and we were trying to develop them

3911
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:05,240
we were doing research and reading articles

3912
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:07,240
and trying to do it

3913
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:09,240
one time he told me that he did do it successfully

3914
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:11,240
I didn't believe him

3915
02:19:11,240 --> 02:19:13,240
but it was an actual

3916
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:15,240
hardcore effort for a while

3917
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:17,240
well that's cool

3918
02:19:17,240 --> 02:19:19,240
to develop telekinetic powers

3919
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:21,240
when I was

3920
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:23,240
I respect that

3921
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:25,240
I seriously believed

3922
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:27,240
for like a number of months

3923
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:29,240
after reading

3924
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:31,240
the volume 2

3925
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:33,240
of Dragon Ball the Manga in the library

3926
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:35,240
alone

3927
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:37,240
that Kamihameha could be possible

3928
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:39,240
I've tried many times

3929
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:41,240
I've tried as well

3930
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:43,240
but I realized that that was stupid

3931
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:45,240
and then I thought the much more rational explanation

3932
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:47,240
the much more rational way to become Goku

3933
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:49,240
is just to wear

3934
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:51,240
weights around my feet

3935
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:53,240
and never take them off

3936
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:55,240
and I would walk around all the time

3937
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:57,240
I asked for Christmas as a present leg weight

3938
02:19:57,240 --> 02:19:59,240
and I would wear them a lot

3939
02:19:59,240 --> 02:20:01,240
and I tried to jump

3940
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:03,240
and I was convinced that it was working

3941
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:05,240
because when it took off the heavy weights

3942
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:07,240
I felt lighter therefore I'm jumping high

3943
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:09,240
remember when Krillin and Goku

3944
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:11,240
wore the turtle shells and they took them off

3945
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:13,240
and they jumped so high

3946
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:15,240
I was actually thinking about Samurai Jack

3947
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:17,240
when you were talking about the leg weights and jumping

3948
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:19,240
when I was like 10 or younger

3949
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:21,240
I think I was absolutely convinced

3950
02:20:21,240 --> 02:20:23,240
I will become a magical girl

3951
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:29,240
didn't you

3952
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:31,240
her magic was just knives

3953
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:33,240
and guns

3954
02:20:33,240 --> 02:20:35,240
when I was like 15

3955
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:37,240
when I was like 15

3956
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:39,240
God damn it

3957
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:41,240
when I was like 15 I was convinced

3958
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:43,240
I was going to become a magical girl

3959
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:45,240
and you did

3960
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:47,240
you know

3961
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:49,240
Hummer is the kind of magical girl that I like

3962
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:51,240
she just uses tons of weapons

3963
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:53,240
that was pretty dope

3964
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:55,240
but she does have like a void closet

3965
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:57,240
where she keeps them

3966
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:59,240
yeah she does have hammer space

3967
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:01,240
it's not like she's totally not powerful

3968
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:03,240
I never thought that I had

3969
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:05,240
powers I don't think

3970
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:07,240
but I did think

3971
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:09,240
that I was like a super genius

3972
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:11,240
who could basically do anything

3973
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:13,240
given the proper

3974
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:15,240
like if I put my mind to it

3975
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:17,240
like if I put my mind to it

3976
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:19,240
yeah

3977
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:21,240
and I was pretty edgy

3978
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:23,240
I also made like origami shuriken

3979
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:25,240
threw them around

3980
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:27,240
when I was 8

3981
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:29,240
I told my friends I could see pokemon

3982
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:31,240
which I didn't

3983
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:33,240
yeah I was like oh they're all around

3984
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:35,240
no that was pokemon go that's on the game

3985
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:37,240
yeah that was pokemon go

3986
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:39,240
I guess that was another dream that predicted the future

3987
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:41,240
kind of

3988
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:43,240
it kind of

3989
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:45,240
went really far though

3990
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:47,240
we all like

3991
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:49,240
I don't even want to get into that story

3992
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:51,240
but one of the things we did

3993
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:53,240
that kind of surprised me to this day

3994
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:55,240
that it didn't freak me out

3995
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:57,240
there was like this kindergarten

3996
02:21:57,240 --> 02:21:59,240
next to one of my friends houses

3997
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:01,240
and I was like well you see

3998
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:03,240
you can't see the pokemon

3999
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:05,240
but when they died they leave bones behind

4000
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:07,240
so let's try and find all of the bones

4001
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:09,240
that are scattered in this kindergarten

4002
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:11,240
and assemble a pokemon skeleton

4003
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:13,240
and one thing is

4004
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:15,240
in the kindergarten

4005
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:17,240
we found enough

4006
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:19,240
fucking bones to actually assemble

4007
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:21,240
something that looked like a creature

4008
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:23,240
whoa

4009
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,240
yeah is this real?

4010
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:27,240
did this really happen?

4011
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:29,240
it was a war zone after all

4012
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:31,240
yeah this like

4013
02:22:31,240 --> 02:22:33,240
horrifying ghost apocalypse

4014
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:35,240
that is

4015
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:37,240
what mage forgot to

4016
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:39,240
tell her gullible friends

4017
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:41,240
that she was actually just

4018
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:43,240
assembling all the bones of the corpses

4019
02:22:43,240 --> 02:22:45,240
she'd murdered here

4020
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:47,240
and she was getting rid of the evidence

4021
02:22:47,240 --> 02:22:49,240
she was getting them to dispose of the evidence

4022
02:22:49,240 --> 02:22:51,240
the violent violence does not leave any traces behind

4023
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:53,240
yeah

4024
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:55,240
also

4025
02:22:55,240 --> 02:22:57,240
guileful

4026
02:22:57,240 --> 02:22:59,240
clever and guileful

4027
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:01,240
in her violence

4028
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:03,240
here's a question

4029
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:05,240
here's a pity question that is intriguing me

4030
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:07,240
from a dank wizard

4031
02:23:07,240 --> 02:23:09,240
aka flameonfieri

4032
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:11,240
um

4033
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:13,240
have y'all seen those

4034
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:15,240
new CGI animated

4035
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:17,240
sex ads of fucking fortnite

4036
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:19,240
and overwatch characters

4037
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:21,240
then play almost every porn video now

4038
02:23:21,240 --> 02:23:23,240
and it plays a wicked loud

4039
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:25,240
annoying ass song during it

4040
02:23:25,240 --> 02:23:27,240
how is no one talking about this

4041
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:29,240
why don't you have adblock?

4042
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:31,240
why are you on porn sites without adblock?

4043
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:33,240
that seems like you don't understand

4044
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:35,240
adblock?

4045
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:37,240
i have adblock

4046
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:39,240
adblock was created to avoid situations like this

4047
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:41,240
i'm gonna go to you porn right now

4048
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:43,240
well apparently it doesn't work

4049
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:45,240
adguard is bulletproof

4050
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:47,240
alright

4051
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:49,240
i've watched a lot of CGI

4052
02:23:49,240 --> 02:23:51,240
overwatch porn

4053
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:53,240
but that's of my own volition

4054
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:55,240
that is like the least appealing thing

4055
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:57,240
i can imagine

4056
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:59,240
i just really like CGI porn

4057
02:23:59,240 --> 02:24:01,240
overwatch has great porn

4058
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:03,240
not the CGI porn

4059
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:05,240
the source filmmaker

4060
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:07,240
wait

4061
02:24:07,240 --> 02:24:09,240
wait hold on

4062
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:11,240
hold on somebody fucking likes CGI porn

4063
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:13,240
what the fuck

4064
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:15,240
CGI porn is like my favorite porn

4065
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:17,240
CGI is like

4066
02:24:17,240 --> 02:24:19,240
literally the worst thing porn

4067
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:21,240
i mean it's like that's a big negative

4068
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:23,240
that's a big minus

4069
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:25,240
points in my book

4070
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:27,240
i like it a lot

4071
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:29,240
i'll have to show you

4072
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:31,240
i gotta send you some

4073
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:33,240
i gotta send you some of the really impressive shit

4074
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:35,240
cause there's every

4075
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:37,240
most of it is really lazily done

4076
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:39,240
but every once in a while someone will like

4077
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:41,240
actually go out of their way to like

4078
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:43,240
animate entirely through like a whole

4079
02:24:43,240 --> 02:24:45,240
scene you know

4080
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:47,240
like not just repetitive motion but like an actual

4081
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:49,240
animation and that shit is fucking

4082
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:51,240
mind blowing

4083
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:53,240
yeah it can be pretty impressive

4084
02:24:53,240 --> 02:24:55,240
it's blowing something besides your mind

4085
02:24:55,240 --> 02:24:57,240
alright

4086
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:59,240
okay okay yeah like

4087
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:01,240
like anything i'm sure it can be done well

4088
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:03,240
i have seen some that is done well

4089
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:05,240
but yeah that

4090
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:07,240
alright but i mean aside from the CG

4091
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:09,240
thing just the overwatch

4092
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:11,240
characters i hate them they make me mad

4093
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:13,240
i think diva is so popular

4094
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:15,240
they just make tons of it

4095
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:17,240
it's not so much a matter of that i would

4096
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:19,240
seek it out as that if you are

4097
02:25:19,240 --> 02:25:21,240
someone who is trying to find CG porn

4098
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:23,240
and like you think

4099
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:25,240
diva is acceptable then you're gonna end up

4100
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:27,240
watching a lot of it

4101
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:29,240
yep of course

4102
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:31,240
well none of the other ones are hot

4103
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:33,240
they have a question for me but i don't want

4104
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:35,240
to answer it because i feel like

4105
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:37,240
i'll drag out the joke too much this episode

4106
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:41,240
okay fair enough

4107
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:43,240
i think

4108
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:45,240
i think may is pretty hot is she the eskimo

4109
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:47,240
oh yeah the big

4110
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:49,240
the chinese lady

4111
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:51,240
she's not an eskimo she's chinese but she does wear that big bulky coat

4112
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:53,240
she's

4113
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:55,240
like an iso climber

4114
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:57,240
because she's like working at the south pole or something

4115
02:25:57,240 --> 02:25:59,240
she's doing like she's an environmentalist

4116
02:25:59,240 --> 02:26:01,240
well she's cute i like her

4117
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:03,240
yeah i mean yeah she's pretty cute

4118
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:05,240
although she's

4119
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:07,240
her actual body type is excellent

4120
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:09,240
but she looks like she would

4121
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:11,240
be fat when she's wearing her coat

4122
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:13,240
but she is in fact not fat

4123
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:15,240
that's probably my favorite like great

4124
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:17,240
cucking that happened in recent years is that

4125
02:26:17,240 --> 02:26:19,240
like after oh like the fatties were like

4126
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:21,240
yeah we've got fat representation

4127
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:23,240
i feel it until like well into

4128
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:25,240
the game being out like what she actually

4129
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:27,240
looks like under the coat so like fan artists

4130
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:29,240
had largely drawn her as fat for like

4131
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:31,240
fucking eight months or something

4132
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:33,240
don't get me wrong i can understand fat people

4133
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:35,240
like wanting fat representation to feel like

4134
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:37,240
that's fine but i would always prefer just a way

4135
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:39,240
hotter chick i'm always gonna want that

4136
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,240
plus it was just hilarious to watch

4137
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:43,240
that happen

4138
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:45,240
agreed

4139
02:26:45,240 --> 02:26:47,240
do we want any more questions

4140
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:49,240
we're pretty much

4141
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:51,240
ben what were you saying

4142
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:53,240
i was saying i'm trying to find like

4143
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:55,240
some official image of what she looks like

4144
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:57,240
under the coat because i haven't seen it

4145
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:59,240
okay watch there's a whole CGI short

4146
02:26:59,240 --> 02:27:01,240
of her like the official overwatch one

4147
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:03,240
like that is tons of like you can see

4148
02:27:03,240 --> 02:27:05,240
i think that you might you might be able

4149
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:07,240
to find an image where

4150
02:27:07,240 --> 02:27:09,240
it was like a song festival thing

4151
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:11,240
there was like a spray you could get

4152
02:27:11,240 --> 02:27:13,240
that had an image of her like playing

4153
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:15,240
like tennis or something and she was

4154
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:17,240
not fat and i

4155
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:19,240
remember that was like the spark that set off

4156
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:21,240
the whole social justice

4157
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:23,240
fucking insanity

4158
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:25,240
because they were just like she's not

4159
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:27,240
the where the roles i can't do it

4202
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:53,240
if it counts i'm going with a straight up

4203
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:55,240
lobster roll

4204
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:57,240
i love lobster rolls so much

4205
02:28:57,240 --> 02:28:59,240
they are the best they're always super expensive

4206
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:01,240
and they're delicious i think it's

4207
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:03,240
i love them but wait

4208
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:05,240
but wait is it is it a sandwich

4209
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:07,240
if it's on a roll that's the question

4210
02:29:07,240 --> 02:29:09,240
i need two slices of red

4211
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:11,240

4212
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:13,240
dude is cereal a sandwich

4213
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:15,240
because it's sandwiched between two layers

4214
02:29:15,240 --> 02:29:17,240
of the bowl on each side

4215
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:19,240
isn't lasagna just a stack

4216
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:21,240
of pasta sandwiches

4217
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:23,240
alright guys

4218
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:25,240
let's

4219
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:27,240
i want to answer that

4220
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:29,240
pre keto

4221
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:31,240
i probably would have said the ruben

4222
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:33,240
although now that you mentioned the lobster roll

4223
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:35,240
that's a pretty strong contender too

4224
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:37,240
but i really like rubens

4225
02:29:37,240 --> 02:29:39,240
but now that i'm keto

4226
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:41,240
lettuce wrap burgers go to fucking

4227
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:43,240
i don't know

4228
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:45,240
what part of a lettuce wrap burger is a sandwich

4229
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:47,240
well the lettuce is the

4230
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:49,240
and it's meat between things

4231
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:51,240
yeah fair enough

4232
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:53,240
what was the place between

4233
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:55,240
two things completely wrapped

4234
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:57,240
it's enclosed

4235
02:29:57,240 --> 02:29:59,240
let's just count in the wraps

4236
02:29:59,240 --> 02:30:01,240
because i haven't had that many sandwiches

4237
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:03,240
tell them the place

4238
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:05,240
i'm dying to know the place

4239
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:07,240
but what was the place we went

4240
02:30:07,240 --> 02:30:09,240
after the miyazaki movie

4241
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:11,240
after nine inch nails

4242
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:13,240
miyazaki's classic film

4243
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:15,240
oh it was called

4244
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:17,240
burger stop

4245
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:19,240
or some shit like that

4246
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:21,240
it's just like a regular ass name

4247
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:23,240
whatever anyway the gorgonzola

4248
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:25,240
burger there is a great burger

4249
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:27,240
get a lettuce wrap

4250
02:30:27,240 --> 02:30:29,240
i think it was literally called burger stop

4251
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:31,240
it was not burger stop

4252
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:33,240
it was called burger go

4253
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:35,240
oh how silly

4254
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:37,240
i don't remember what it was called

4255
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:39,240
all i know is that i like italian subs a lot

4256
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:41,240
they're delicious

4257
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:43,240
i got an italian sausage right here

4258
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:45,240
it's an italian sausage

4259
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:47,240
it's an italian sausage

4260
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:49,240
if we're counting wraps

4261
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:51,240
i would actually really like to

4262
02:30:51,240 --> 02:30:53,240

4263
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:55,240

wraps and sandwiches you guys mentioned

4266
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:01,240
because i haven't tasted

4267
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:03,240
i haven't

4268
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:05,240
seen them being sold

4269
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:07,240
in the uk

4270
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:09,240
and it's usually like your standard BLT

4271
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:11,240
in ham and

4272
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:13,240

4278
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:25,240
mage

4279
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:27,240
mage

4280
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:29,240
there are pizza places

4281
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:31,240
but when i'm in lefina

4282
02:31:31,240 --> 02:31:33,240
i don't eat much pizza

4283
02:31:33,240 --> 02:31:35,240
when i'm in the uk i eat some pizza

4284
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:37,240
i'm just

4285
02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:39,240
i'm just asking because in poland

4286
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:41,240
i noticed there were a lot fewer

4287
02:31:41,240 --> 02:31:43,240
there were way fewer pizza places

4288
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:45,240
than there are in america

4289
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:47,240
in america there's lots of them

4290
02:31:47,240 --> 02:31:49,240
there's lots of chains but in poland

4291
02:31:49,240 --> 02:31:51,240
there was like one in lublin

4292
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:53,240
there was like one or two places you could get a pizza

4293
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:55,240
and they were kind of weird

4294
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:57,240
something was just a little different

4295
02:31:57,240 --> 02:31:59,240
about the pizza that they made over there

4296
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:01,240
i don't know

4297
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:03,240
japan pizza was like a big special thing

4298
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:05,240
same with the burgers

4299
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:07,240
no place that wasn't mcdonald's

4300
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:09,240
served a burger that just tasted

4301
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:11,240
like a burger

4302
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:13,240
there was a different quality

4303
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:15,240
it's not like

4304
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:17,240
you ran into the culture

4305
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:19,240
the place i live in currently in lefina

4306
02:32:19,240 --> 02:32:21,240
the nearest mcdonald

4307
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:23,240
is like

4308
02:32:23,240 --> 02:32:25,240
a over a 60 minute walk

4309
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:27,240
on foot and i can be bothered

4310
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:29,240
what is the

4311
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:31,240
what type of food restaurant

4312
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:33,240
is the most common surrounding

4313
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:35,240
let me think

4314
02:32:35,240 --> 02:32:37,240
about lefianian

4315
02:32:37,240 --> 02:32:39,240
restaurants i guess

4316
02:32:39,240 --> 02:32:41,240
question mark

4317
02:32:41,240 --> 02:32:43,240
just like what is a food

4318
02:32:43,240 --> 02:32:45,240
what would be the main item

4319
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:47,240
on the menu at the places around you

4320
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:49,240
the thing that everybody gets

4321
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:51,240
i have a follow up question

4322
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:53,240
in the philippines everywhere sells adobo

4323
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:55,240
like chicken adobo

4324
02:32:55,240 --> 02:32:57,240
is just like it's a staple

4325
02:32:57,240 --> 02:32:59,240
it's on every menu at every store

4326
02:32:59,240 --> 02:33:01,240
i don't go to many restaurants

4327
02:33:01,240 --> 02:33:03,240
that's the thing though but

4328
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:05,240
oh well

4329
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:07,240

what are some chains

4331
02:33:09,240 --> 02:33:11,240

4332
02:33:11,240 --> 02:33:13,240
that are common around here

4333
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:15,240
there's a chili pizza

4334
02:33:17,240 --> 02:33:19,240
never heard of it

4335
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:21,240

4336
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:23,240

too much because i don't go to restaurants too much

4342
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:35,240

02:33:35,240 --> 02:33:37,240

02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:41,240
i just don't pay attention to them

4346
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:43,240
i'm not asking just about pizza

4347
02:33:43,240 --> 02:33:45,240
the only chains i know

4348
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:47,240
i can remember seeing

4349
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:49,240
usually pizza chains

4350
02:33:49,240 --> 02:33:51,240
all mage eats his pizza

4351
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:53,240
yeah that makes sense

4352
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:55,240
well she also eats birds milk

4353
02:33:55,240 --> 02:33:57,240
as we learned

4354
02:33:57,240 --> 02:33:59,240
in the bonus episode

4355
02:33:59,240 --> 02:34:01,240
pageruns.com

4356
02:34:01,240 --> 02:34:03,240
let's answer the question

4357
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:05,240
to find out what the fuck birds milk is

4358
02:34:05,240 --> 02:34:07,240
i didn't know birds produced milk

4359
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:09,240
ah

4360
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:11,240
well then you'll find out

4361
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:13,240
we'll learn something new every day

4362
02:34:13,240 --> 02:34:15,240
i actually answered the question

4363
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:17,240
from the very small amount

4364
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:19,240
of sandwich like things that i've eaten

4365
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:21,240
i really like hoisin duck wraps

4366
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:23,240
but only if i add mayo to them

4367
02:34:23,240 --> 02:34:25,240
so there we go

4368
02:34:25,240 --> 02:34:27,240
hoisin duck wraps

4369
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:29,240
whoa i wanna try that

4370
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:31,240
that's not a thing i could find easily here

4371
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:33,240
it's not too fancy but it's nice

4372
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:35,240
it's just like basically duck meat

4373
02:34:35,240 --> 02:34:37,240
and lettuce in a wrap

4374
02:34:37,240 --> 02:34:39,240
that's why i add mayo

4375
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:41,240
because it adds to them

4376
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:43,240
swap that you

4377
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:45,240
and that sounds like my kind of meat

4378
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:47,240
if you know what i'm saying

4379
02:34:47,240 --> 02:34:49,240

4380
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:51,240
