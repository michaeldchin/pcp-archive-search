1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
Well, we did it everybody. We made it back to The Pro Crastinators Podcast for another week of content.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
They said it couldn't be done. They said it shouldn't be done.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:30,800
They said, they said, my god, an all guest episode. The PCP has degraded. It has lost. It has lost. It's a vital Chouadevive.

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Ever since Geoff left, it's all been downhill and there's been nothing good. It's just been a series of escalating humiliations wrought upon themselves.

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,400
And they said this was the final straw. But guess what? We can go lower, baby.

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:53,600
There's more dirt under the barrel and under the bottom of the barrel to dig down into if we put our minds to it.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,600
And here we are to do just that.

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,200
That's the new goal of the podcast is to be as embarrassing as possible.

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:11,600
My goal, I'll tell you what my goal with the PCP is, is I want to divide the audience as much as possible.

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,600
I want to make controversial decisions that some people will think is great and some people will hate it.

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,600
And the goal here is that I divide the audience enough that the split audience hates each other more than they hate us.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And we can escape. We can escape notice. We can throw it on a smoke bomb and run out the back door.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I mean, I feel like that's already a thing.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We've got the types of fans who are invested enough to come on the All Guests episode.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And we've got all the cowards who said, nah.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:56,400
That's what it is, a pure cowardice not being on the Oops All Guests episode.

17
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Damn cringe.

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,400
You think that's the divide people who were on and people who weren't?

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Yeah, I mean, that's the difference.

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Sure.

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Alright, a big announcement.

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I fucking did the manga.

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,800
I made a whole 50 page manga chapter for a contest.

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,800
The Tezuka Awards, I submitted it and I'm gonna win.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Can't fucking believe you.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Can't fucking believe you.

27
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I didn't think it was possible like in week two.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,800
I was like, there's no way I am going to be able to get all of these pages done.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,800
It's the worst thing that could have ever happened to me and I kept going, dude. I did it.

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Okay, I have, I was following along at the beginning.

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,800
I sort of fell off following your progress later in the month.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,800
So, so tell me, you said that you're the...

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Whoa.

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Okay, I'm fine. I'm fine.

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Sorry.

36
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Did you fall and you nearly fall off the cliff?

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,800
No, I was, I did. I did earlier today.

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I was trying to sleep and I straight up had the, it was the strongest sensation of I'm about to fall asleep

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,800
and I'm going to fall off the cliff and I would, I jolt awake like, ah, I'm falling.

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
But no, that's, that's not, that's not what's happening.

41
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,800
The point, okay, the point is, you said that like your actual manuscript was like 80 pages or something

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,800
and you had to like split it, right? To qualify.

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Yeah.

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
You ended up doing that?

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
I, first week, I was like, let's, I got a basic story in my head.

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I haven't written down the dialogue or like scene direction, like close up of this white shot of that.

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Like I did with Lord of Ghosts.

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
I was just flying off the seat of my pants, basically.

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,800
And I was like, let's just try and sketch as much as I fucking can.

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,800
First week, I got 55 pages sketched, I think.

51
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
And I realized-

52
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
So many fucking pages to sketch.

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
It's a lot of pages to sketch.

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Not all the pages are as good as other ones, but you know, you know, they work.

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
They all serve the function that they are intended for.

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Dialogue scenes are harder to make interesting.

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,800
But, um, I got to, yeah, page 55 and I was like, okay,

58
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I, this is past the limit.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Wait, can I interrupt you for a sec?

60
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Do you have it scripted out before you sketched it?

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
No.

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Okay.

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I was sort of figuring out, okay, well, what could I put on this panel?

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I knew basic story beats, like Clarissa comes to town, altercation with bandits.

65
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Town sees her, kill the guys and be cool and they ask her to help.

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,800
She says, okay, she goes, you know, she finds bandits, you know.

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Okay.

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Yeah, that's how I do it too.

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I don't, I don't script in advance.

70
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Yeah.

71
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
And it worked, it worked fairly well.

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,800
It's just that the time pressure was like, I have no idea how long it's going to take me to line like the ink, all of these.

73
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,800
So I have to like cut it off at some point, whether or not the sketch is good enough.

74
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
And I was just like, ah, I just move on like all the time.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
I was just like, ah, fuck, it sucks.

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Got to move on though.

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,800
So first week, getting all the sketches done, I realized that there's too long.

78
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,800
The story that I have drawn, some of the panels may be too big.

79
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,800
It doesn't fit in the allotted 55 maximum page limit, this one story.

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
So I had to split it.

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,800
And I decided on page 50 is a decent enough place that you could feasibly imagine the ending being.

82
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
It's just a really bad ending.

83
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Yeah.

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,800
So for the contest, it sucks because it's not really finished.

85
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
But I think it tells enough of a story.

86
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
So did you finish the whole thing or did you just finish the part you're submitting?

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I finished the part I'm submitting.

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,800
I think I might stream in September as well to finish Clarissa like chapter two or like part two.

89
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
And then once it's all finished, I'm going to put it on my site.

90
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,800
And that's that's my plan for the moment.

91
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:35,800
But yeah, it was it was eight and a half hours of work every day, every weekday that is for all of August.

92
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:46,800
First week sketches, then I had like a depressing like depressive episode and like Monday of the next week where I was like, oh God, I'm not I'm not fast enough at drawing.

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm bad at this.

94
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Oh, I'm so bad at drawing.

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,800
And I was like, there's no way I can do this fast and good enough.

96
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,800
And then I got over it by the next day is like, yeah, I'll just do it.

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
And then I did.

98
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Yeah.

99
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Yeah, that's how you do it.

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
No, I actually I actually will simply do it simply.

101
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
I will just do it.

102
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
And I will just try to do as much as I can.

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:21,800
And after the first after the second week, I was like, OK, the rate at which I can line like ink pages.

104
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:40,800
If I keep up a pace of fully inking four of these sketched pages every day, I will have enough time to add, you know, speech bubbles and dialogue and tweak it and clean it and then submit it by the end of the month.

105
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,800
So I was like, once I had that plan, it was just like, go, go, go, go, go.

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
And I did it.

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I was I just kept going and it was cool.

108
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,800
And it was so many people came in the chat and they subscribed and they made all that they made so many bits fly all over the screen.

109
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Everyone was so hype.

110
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Everyone who came to the stream was great.

111
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:10,800
And there was like a slowly like the last one or just in general, just in general, just over the course of the week, like the people saying it's inspiring and it's cool and it's epic and it's based.

112
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Yeah.

113
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I mean, they're not wrong.

114
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:24,800
And I think I forget when this started, but people started drawing fan art, mostly jokingly, like specifically lewd Clarissa fan art because I said, don't do that.

115
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
And so they did it.

116
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
And it was a trick because I actually wanted it.

117
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Haha, you fucking idiot.

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Yeah, okay.

119
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,800
I mean, by the end of the month, the stream was just covered in fan art.

120
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Yeah.

121
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:47,800
And as the policy I came up with, if you draw a fan art and submit, like just give it to me, I will put it on screen for the entire rest of the month.

122
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,800
And by the last stream, there was so much that you could barely see what I was drawing.

123
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Perfect.

124
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,800
So yeah, very successful in all aspects.

125
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:06,800
I love everybody who came to see and cheer me on and just watch and it's just like, wow.

126
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Wow.

127
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
So yeah.

128
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,800
And then I submitted it live on Saturday, the 29th.

129
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,800
I saw the link to the media bang page that it was posted on or whatever.

130
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
You know what I'm talking about?

131
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Medibang, yeah.

132
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Medibang.

133
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Yeah, what is that?

134
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Because I saw it there.

135
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
It was posted there.

136
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
It had a couple thousand views or something.

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Yeah.

138
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I don't know.

139
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Is that where you have to host it for the contest?

140
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
That site is where the contest is submitted.

141
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:55,800
It's a Japanese website made for mangaka to post their internet manga and illustrations and you post your comic and whatever.

142
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,800
And when you're submitting a comic, you can add it to an ongoing contest.

143
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,800
And I selected the Tezuka Awards while I submitted and then it was locked in.

144
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I submitted it and it was in the awards.

145
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,800
And also it's just on the site for people to read.

146
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
And I looked through the submission things.

147
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
There was this pay button.

148
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
And I was like, excuse me.

149
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,800
You can have people pay to read your stuff?

150
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Is it like a band camp thing?

151
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
It's like pay what you want?

152
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Sort of deal?

153
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,800
No, I think you can give people a preview and then you have a set price.

154
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,800
So if you want the whole thing, you have to pay 420 yen to see the whole 50 pages.

155
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
But I have zero yen.

156
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
You just have to go to Japan then, won't you?

157
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,800
And I have to go in the rice fields and grind some of that rice.

158
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
That's how you get yen.

159
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Yeah, okay.

160
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
So yeah, 420 yen.

161
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,800
And I think like two or three people have purchased that.

162
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
420, nice.

163
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Yeah, it's like $3.99.

164
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,800
And yeah, I didn't intend to get money from posting it.

165
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,800
But I thought if it's on there and some of the fucking submissions to this contest

166
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,800
get an unbelievable amount of views.

167
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:41,800
There's this shitty one, this awful six page one piece ripoff called Two Piece.

168
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Okay.

169
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,800
And it is just like Gear 5, Gear 7, Luffy versus Blackbeard at Raftel.

170
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,800
And it's just a bunch of traced images, no story, no nothing.

171
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
What the fuck?

172
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Okay, yeah.

173
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,800
And it got like 80,000 views because it was posted right at the beginning of the contest.

174
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,800
And I saw it and I was so angry that this could happen.

175
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,800
But it means that there's a lot of eyeballs on Medibang apparently.

176
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I guess a lot of non-English speaking countries including Japan use it to look at things.

177
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
And so Clarissa has got like 6,000 views or something.

178
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,800
It had like 2,000 when I looked and that was like right after you posted the link or it felt like it anyway.

179
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Yeah, I was like there's no way that this could be just my fans.

180
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Because when it was on stream, there was 30 viewers in the stream and it had jumped up to like 280.

181
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
It was like whoa.

182
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
So have you made any money off it?

183
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Has anyone like bought it?

184
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Yeah, like two or three people.

185
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Okay, alright.

186
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,800
So you know, it was like a little pocket change just for the thing.

187
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Okay, now the other submissions, are they like, do they all like look like anime?

188
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Or are there a bunch of like not strictly anime looking shit?

189
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:15,800
I see the vast majority are going for a sort of anime manga style trying to look as professional as one of those mangas as possible.

190
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,800
The very most popular one does look like that.

191
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
And it's very, the story sucks.

192
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
I read a little bit of it and it's just like.

193
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
What is it?

194
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,800
There's a boy who is like in a world with constant conflict and dragons.

195
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
There's angels and devils.

196
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
There's angels and dragons?

197
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Tell me more.

198
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
There's like angel people and devil people.

199
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
The angels fight the devils.

200
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,800
But there's this boy who has an angel and he becomes an angel with black wings.

201
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
He could be your angel or your devil?

202
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
No, just the angel.

203
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Sorry.

204
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Okay.

205
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
But he's got black wings and it's like oh wow.

206
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,800
You ever, you ever read Helc?

207
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Like milk?

208
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Yes.

209
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
No.

210
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Oh.

211
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Helc?

212
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Oh, I don't know.

213
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
I don't know if I want to go on it.

214
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
It's not, it's not relevant at all.

215
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
It just reminds me of Helc and I really like Helc.

216
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,800
And sometimes I just want to talk about Helc.

217
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Helc?

218
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Helc is the, is a manga about, I haven't read all of it, but like it starts off either in the demon world and like the demon world is trying to choose a new king.

219
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
And the way that they choose a new king is they have a tournament, right?

220
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Of like various contests.

221
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,800
It's battling, but it's also like various like tests of skill and like long jumping and shit like that.

222
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,800
And all these demons are competing in this tournament to be the new king.

223
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,800
And demons hate humans, right?

224
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
That's like the thing.

225
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
The demons like they live away from humans because they think humans are gross.

226
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Humans are like terrible colonizers.

227
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
They're evil.

228
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
They're shit.

229
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
They're embarrassing.

230
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
They hate everything.

231
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
They're disgusting.

232
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Is this human named Helc?

233
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
He's this giant fucking hulking guy.

234
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
And everyone's like, why is a human competing in the demon tournament?

235
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
And why does everyone love him so much?

236
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,800
And this reporter goes up to me and he's like, excuse me, Mr. Helc, why are you competing to become the demon king?

237
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
And he's just like, hmm, it turns to the crowd.

238
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Humans suck.

239
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
And the whole crowd's like, yeah, Helc, we love you, Helc.

240
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,800
And the conflict later is like humans are bad.

241
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Humans are the human kingdom is really bad in Helc.

242
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:29,800
But like the humans discover a way to like reach the next stage of human evolution, which makes them like grow angel wings.

243
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,800
So they're like humans like are angels in that.

244
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,800
And oh, and they they figure out like a way to use like white magic to like revive themselves.

245
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
They're basically immortal.

246
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Like these fucking priests can just like bring people back from the dead.

247
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
So it's like impossible to kill the humans.

248
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
They're like the biggest fucking problem.

249
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,800
They're like it's terrible scourge on the planet because they're just like, yeah, we're just going to take everything.

250
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
And now we got wings and we can never die.

251
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
So, you know, everyone's fucked.

252
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Pretty, pretty good.

253
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Pretty, pretty good.

254
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Okay.

255
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I'll never talk about Hulk again.

256
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Is it like Hel Hulk?

258
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
It is the.

259
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Okay.

260
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:14,800
His name is like he had like a partner or a brother or something who was killed by I think by the humans.

261
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
I think like it was executed as a traitor or something.

262
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,800
And the two of them were named like Helc and like Achles or something.

263
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
And it's like their names together are supposed to be like Japanese for hercules.

264
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,800
So he's like the hell and the other one is the the Culeys or whatever.

265
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
That's what the name is supposed to mean.

266
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I see.

267
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
So like RL like herk, but Helc.

268
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Yes.

269
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Yes.

270
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Like, like how Boruto is supposed to be bolt.

271
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Why?

272
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
I had no idea.

273
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Yeah.

274
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
So wait.

275
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Boruto.

276
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Boruto.

277
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
And Naruto is like Naut.

278
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Well, no.

279
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Naruto's name is not a pun.

280
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Naruto's name is just a reference to those like spiral.

281
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Oh yes.

282
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Yes.

283
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
The funny thing that I don't know what it is still.

284
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
It's a fish.

285
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
It's a fish cake.

286
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
He's a fish boy.

287
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
It's a fish.

288
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
No, he's a spiral boy.

289
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,800
The fish part's not relevant.

290
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Anyway, so you said you were saying that the top one is this like fucking Angel Demon

291
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Dragon.

292
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
It's it's Angel Demon Dragon fantasy world.

293
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Like I couldn't get invested sort of story, but sure.

294
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
It's extremely popular.

295
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
800,000 views on that one.

296
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
And it's like that.

297
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
That's that's that's going to get a poggers.

298
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
That's a PogChamp moment.

299
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
That's a PogChamp moment.

300
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,800
And it's like, if this, I mean, this popularity is not the way to win you.

301
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Things are just submitted to the site as like a, you know, a comic website.

302
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Contests are one judged by judges.

303
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
And so it doesn't matter how popular you are.

304
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
As long as you're in the contest, you have a chance.

305
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,800
But it's interesting to see that there's that much like viewer base,

306
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,800
even potential for something.

307
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,800
So I think I might upload Lord of Ghosts on there as well.

308
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Cause why not?

309
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Would you submit Lord of Ghosts?

310
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Or I guess it's too long.

311
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,800
It's too long for the contest, but like, I mean, there are other contests.

312
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
The site has loads of contests all the time, but this one is like the big one

313
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,800
that is like in association with Shueisha Inc. or whatever that has shown on Jump.

314
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Well, shit.

315
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Maybe I should get in on it.

316
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Maybe, maybe I'll just fucking upload some shit on there too.

317
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I don't know why not?

318
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Why the fuck not?

319
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I never really thought of much of it as like a site that you can like get noticed,

320
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,800
but apparently, apparently there's a lot of eyeballs.

321
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,800
But are there, are there other ones that like do not look like anime manga?

322
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
I skimmed them.

323
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,800
I only really looked at the covers so I couldn't tell,

324
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,800
but there were a few that had like a different art style, like a western-ish.

325
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,800
The ones that were submitted are either from,

326
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
this is the international portion of the contest.

327
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
The Japanese one is completely separate.

328
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,800
So we weren't, in this thing, I'm not competing with any Japanese people,

329
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
which is good for me.

330
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
But I am competing with Chinese and Korean people.

331
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:32,800
So, you know, but I think Clarissa stands out among like the ones that I saw in terms of it being extremely simple art style,

332
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
you know, with thick lines compared to a lot of the other things,

333
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,800
which are either anime-inspired, very heavily manga-inspired,

334
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,800
or sort of painterly or scratchy,

335
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,800
not really going for the cutesy sort of look quite as much.

336
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Wait, are you saying that yours is cutesy?

337
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,800
I think Clarissa, like, looks sort of cute,

338
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,800
like the thick black lines and the sort of bloobly character designs.

339
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Bloobly.

340
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Yeah.

341
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Yeah, sure.

342
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Okay.

343
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Yeah, I'm very proud of what I made.

344
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I think it's good.

345
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I think it could obviously be improved.

346
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
I kind of was rushed to get it done.

347
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,800
So like, the first few pages are a bit like, oh.

348
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,800
But I, you know, there's a few pages in there that I'm genuinely like,

349
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
this is some of the best work I've ever made.

350
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
I'm so happy about it.

351
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I'm so happy about it.

352
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Well, that's, I agree.

353
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Yeah, I do think, I mean, I haven't, I haven't read the whole thing through.

354
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I've just seen like the parts you were sketching.

355
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Yeah, I thought some of the stuff I saw you drawing there,

356
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
I also was like, this is some of the best work you've ever done.

357
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Good stuff.

358
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Thank you.

359
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Thank you.

360
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
You're welcome.

361
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I guess, I guess on the subject of comics, let's see.

362
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I ordered my fucking, I ordered Vapors 2 to be printed.

363
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Oh, shit.

364
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I paid for the order.

365
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I'm looking at the invoice for it now.

366
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
I paid for the order.

367
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I paid $2084.51 to have that printed on August 21st, 2020.

368
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Here we are.

369
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
It is August 30th.

370
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
It has not been printed yet.

371
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
It has not been shipped, but I'll guess I'll give it another week or two.

372
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Because these things, I think these things are delayed due to COVID, lol.

373
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,800
The last, that was a test copy that I ordered took almost exactly two weeks to be printed

374
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
and shipped to me.

375
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:37,800
I assume that a big load, the mother load will take as long or longer than that.

376
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:45,800
I'm waiting on fucking tenor hooks over here to get those, but they're coming, presumably.

377
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Very exciting.

378
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,800
I have all my envelopes.

379
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I have all my white ink pens for addressing them.

380
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,800
It's going to be, it's going to be, it's good that it's coming soon because I'm kind

381
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,300
of like I finished the Simon punishment finale and now I'm like, well, I got some stuff I

382
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
could work on.

383
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,800
But what I would really like to do is just kind of not, just kind of zone out and just

384
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,800
do a bunch of busy work for a while, just addressing envelopes.

385
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Honestly, I could, I could really get into doing that for a little bit.

386
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Like sorting pins by sorting pins.

387
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Man, they're, they, they give me the fucking, the pin manufacturer is like, oh, the coin

388
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
design.

389
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,800
You want the hard enamel or the soft enamel.

390
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
And, and by the way, soft enamel looks bad.

391
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,800
So I'm like, no, hard enamel.

392
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,800
And they're like, okay, well, we recommend the soft enamel because the hard enamel, like

393
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,800
the coin design has so many small lines that like during the polishing process, the lines

394
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
might all run together and it might not work.

395
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,800
And I'm like, the other pins had small lines on them.

396
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
The other pins had lines just as small and it looked fine.

397
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Totally fine.

398
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Why are you fucking with me like this?

399
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Why are you, why are you doing this?

400
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
You mean the challenge coin or is that some other thing?

401
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Yeah.

402
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Yeah.

403
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,800
The challenge coin, which is, so the pin people were going to also do that.

404
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Yes.

405
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
The pat, the patches were made by a different company.

406
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,800
The pin people were also going to make the coin using basically the same process.

407
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
And they are going to do it.

408
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Eventually, she was all like, oh, I don't know, you know, the, the polishing process,

409
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
the lines could mesh together.

410
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Finally, I just had to be like, I don't care.

411
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Just, just fucking do it.

412
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Just fucking go ahead and do it.

413
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
And if I have to just redo it from scratch and it looks like shit, then so be it.

414
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
You know, fine, whatever.

415
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
We got to get the show on the road.

416
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
So you're getting the test of the coin.

417
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
See how it looks.

418
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I am getting the full order of most of the pins and I'm getting a test, like a color,

419
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,800
like two more color tests of the cop killer pin because I wasn't quite happy with the color.

420
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
I was a little too pink for my tastes.

421
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,800
And I should be getting a test copy of the coin as well in hard enamel in a lighter green

422
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
and soft enamel in a darker green.

423
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,800
And I will be comparing them and being like, which one looks better in, in person?

424
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Hmm.

425
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,800
And yeah, very exciting.

426
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Very exciting.

427
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Been spending a lot of money on this stuff, but you know what?

428
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
It's okay.

429
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
That's what the Kickstarter was for.

430
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
And now I get 2% cash back.

431
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Get 2% cash back on my city double cash credit card, baby.

432
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,800
That's the power of a good credit score.

433
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Epic.

434
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Very, very epic.

435
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I've been thinking about like, uh, kickstarting.

436
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Not the Clarissa thing.

437
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Well, obviously I want that to be finished before I even consider kickstarting, but like,

438
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,800
I've got so many things I could, I could make books of.

439
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Beljape, I think is like the next project.

440
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I think once that Clarissa is done, I'm going to like make Beljape a physical book PDF.

441
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
However, that is supposed to be done.

442
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
I have no idea really.

443
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,800
And I'm going to see, like I looked into book, like payment things, how much, how many pages

444
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
it would be.

445
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:15,800
And like, approximating because I need to like turn the video game and the animation

446
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,800
and the gifts into multiple little images.

447
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,800
It's a whole Homestuck problem.

448
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,800
And yeah, I mean, Beljape, right?

449
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Hey guys, what do you think about Beljape?

450
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Would you buy a little Beljape book?

451
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Am I right or am I right?

452
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Yeah, I don't know how much money.

453
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,800
I kind of completely forgot all the fact of the statistics that I came up with.

454
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I will buy a Beljape book assuming it's not like a hundred dollars.

455
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
No, no, no, nothing like that.

456
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,800
It would be like the sort of price for something of that size that you would find in a bookstore.

457
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Like, oh, what is this?

458
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
It's kind of hefty.

459
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
It's kind of hefty this thing.

460
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Imagine what?

461
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
It'd probably be like 30 bucks?

462
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
30?

463
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Yeah, I'm hoping.

464
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
More and I don't know.

465
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Might be more, but I'm going to try and get it down as low as possible.

466
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
I just don't want it to look like shit.

467
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
That's the only thing.

468
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,800
There's no reason to make it if it's going to look like shit.

469
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:20,800
I've been thinking about, I was thinking about doing a Kickstarter

470
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,800
for like a physical slime and punishment book, which I'm not going to do that.

471
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Because even though the finale came out, but the finale is not the end,

472
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
there actually is a little bit more that's going to come after the finale.

473
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,800
So the slime and punishment is not technically done, so I'm not going to think about that yet.

474
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,800
But even so, I'm definitely not going to do any more of that until the pin Kickstarter

475
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
and the Vapors 2 Kickstarter are completely fulfilled.

476
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Yeah.

477
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,800
And I will probably even wait a little while after that because I will be relieved.

478
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
I'll be so relieved when I have those done and taken care of.

479
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,800
It's been like the better part of a year since the Vapors 2 Kickstarter wrapped up,

480
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
which is terrible.

481
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
It's so embarrassing.

482
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I can't wait for this nightmare to be over.

483
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Next time I kickstart anything, I am not going to jump the gun.

484
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I am going to have the whole thing done.

485
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,800
The whole thing will be done and ready to immediately go to print when the Kickstarter is finished.

486
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
I promise this to myself.

487
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
I will not put myself through this again.

488
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:31,800
It's not to say that it's not worth it, but it could have been so much easier if I'd just done it later.

489
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Oh, yeah.

490
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:39,800
I was thinking about if I did make a bail shape book, I could have bailed J-Pets.

491
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,800
I could get artists to make little bail shape comics.

492
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Yeah.

493
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Just don't put off and procrastinate writing them like I did.

494
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I don't even know what they would be.

495
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:59,800
It's such a weird history of like, oh, Pumpkin Alley, how do they meet?

496
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
I could write that.

497
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Actually, I could write that.

498
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,800
A bail shape is such a self-contained story, though.

499
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Yeah.

500
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,800
A bail shape side story could be literally anything.

501
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,800
It really could, which is why it's so hard to think of what it could be.

502
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Yeah.

503
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Pumpkin and the Gango to Space.

504
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,800
I don't know.

505
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,800
I mean, bail shape ends with like, who knows what sort of wacky adventures will follow?

506
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Sort of note, right?

507
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Yeah.

508
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,800
So it could be who fucking knows.

509
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
They all just burn in the lava.

510
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
They die.

511
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Yeah, actually, a whole world of possibilities.

512
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
There's a fucking hole in our...

513
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
What is it?

514
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Is it a raft?

515
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
It's a rock.

516
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,800
It's like cooled magma because the jewel of splish is like consistently emanating like

517
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,800
a coolness sphere.

518
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
Like a...

519
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Not a wet sphere.

520
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
I don't know.

521
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Pumpkin isn't dead, so it's definitely not like making things watery.

522
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,800
It's just like making the magma turn to rock and be not going to kill them.

523
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Yes.

524
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Excellent.

525
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Beautiful.

526
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Oh, but it sprung a leak though.

527
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Ah, fuck.

528
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Ah, darn.

529
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Perished.

530
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Yeah, have me write the bail shape...

531
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,800
The bail shape at where they all just die immediately afterwards and make a cannon.

532
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Yeah, why not?

533
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
There's a different timeline.

534
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
That's the alpha timeline.

535
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Ben, do you want to talk about Chris Chan's response to Slam and Punishment finale or

536
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
is that secret?

537
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
No, that's not secret.

538
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Oh, wait, you mean the stuff that she messaged me personally?

539
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Yeah.

540
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Yeah, I don't mind.

541
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Do you have the screenshots that I said?

542
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
I didn't show them to everyone.

543
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
I posted them in the...

544
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
They're just up here in the PCP chat.

545
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
They're so wacky.

546
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
They're so wacky.

547
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Should I go through them?

548
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Should I like read them?

549
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Yeah.

550
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
This is...

551
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Okay, I'm going to say the thing about these...

552
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Chris's strategy is to try...

553
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Is to like rewrite history and be like,

554
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
No, no, no, here's why that didn't happen.

555
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
And she gives like three different...

556
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:39,800
She tries like three different get out of jail free cards and they all like contradict each other.

557
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,800
It's total nonsense.

558
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Okay.

559
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
So, right.

560
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Slam and Punishment comes out.

561
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,800
You know, Lockecom goes from the beta timeline to the alpha timeline and returns with all the

562
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
spoilers.

563
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
The Grand Canyon is full of slime again.

564
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,800
The city falls on Chris Chan's sonichu, presumably crushing her, presumably to death.

565
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
I don't know.

566
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,800
I mean, never found a body, but you know, let's see what it looked like was happening.

567
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
So I...

568
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,800
So I message Chris and I basically say,

569
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,800
Hey, Christine, sorry, I've got bad news.

570
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,800
But, you know, Lockecom's back in the alpha timeline and they're real mad.

571
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,800
They're real mad about the Soda Rain Holocaust and they're going to war.

572
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
You know, the war has been declared.

573
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
The war is on.

574
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm sorry.

575
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Quickville is under attack.

576
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
And Christine says,

577
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
I got news for you, Ben.

578
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,800
What you said there did not take place in the C197 of this timeline at all.

579
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:49,800
By the way, she has tweeted before specifically referencing this taking place in C197.

580
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
So this is contradicting herself.

581
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
This is nonsense.

582
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,800
See, that happened in an alt timeline from this one, right here.

583
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,800
That affected the alpha timeline, but not here.

584
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
The Omega timeline.

585
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,800
You picked up on one of the many, many self counterparts from your Chris Chan Sonichu of this dimension.

586
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,800
You may call it C197 alpha, but it was actually dimension C194.

587
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Sister dimension of reality, 1214.

588
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
And do you know how I...

589
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Do you know what any of these...

590
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Are these made up new things?

591
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
These are just completely made up.

592
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
These have never been referenced before.

593
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,800
There has never been a C194 or a 1214.

594
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
These are just like, I don't know, let me think of a different number.

595
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
No, no, no, it was actually this other number.

596
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I promise.

597
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,800
So, first she claims that, no, no, that's not the alpha timeline, it's the Omega timeline.

598
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Then she claims, not only is it not the right timeline, it's actually a completely separate dimension entirely.

599
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
So it doesn't even matter.

600
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
This Omega timeline thing is totally irrelevant.

601
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
And why would it matter even if it were true?

602
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,800
It's just like a different Greek letter.

603
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,800
And do you know how I know that, Ben?

604
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Because the Chris Chan talking with you right now came from that very dimension.

605
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:12,800
So the conversation you're having with this Chris Chan is from C194?

606
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,800
That's what she says.

607
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,800
That's what she says, but I don't buy it.

608
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,800
I was there while that cop fucker had me in his slimy, mutated grasp.

609
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:33,800
But as that beta plane landed on him, I literally teleported out of there in an instant, at least to all of you.

610
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
I am literally faster than time.

611
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:43,800
So not only does she claim, no, no, no, that wasn't the alpha timeline, that was the Omega timeline.

612
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,800
And also, no, no, no, that wasn't C197, that was C194.

613
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,800
And also, no, no, no, no, it also didn't kill me because I teleported out of there really fast.

614
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
So, you know.

615
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,800
This is multiple layers of redundancy.

616
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,800
Yeah. There's all on every possible level.

617
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,800
This is not what it appears.

618
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
She continues,

619
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,800
I can what you call time stop at any moment.

620
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:15,800
All I had to do was hit that pause, clear my mind, teleport out of his grip, and mox speed dash far away from the impact zone.

621
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,800
I was in the next date over, and then some upon that impact.

622
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Your beta time liners ended up falling at the hands of their alpha self counterparts.

623
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Not even slime could protect any of them.

624
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Quickville remained very much safe and sound.

625
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Wait, what does she mean by your beta timelines ended up falling at the hands of their alpha self counterparts?

626
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:48,800
What it seems to me to be suggesting is that the slimed people from the beta prime timeline came to the alpha timeline.

627
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
You know, the city fell...

628
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Okay, here she's contradicting herself again, because first she says that no, this was the omega timeline,

629
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,800
but now she's saying, okay, yes, the beta timeline people did come to the alpha timeline,

630
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,800
but then they were killed by the alpha timelines.

631
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,800
So, like, what is the so-called omega have to do with it? Answer nothing. It's a fiction.

632
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Unlike everything else, which is real.

633
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,800
But she seems to be suggesting that the de-slimed alpha timeline people killed the beta people that came there,

634
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,800
even though all the alpha people would be dead, because the city fell on top of them and crushed the alpha timelines version of Mlachikam.

635
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
So it's just destroyed.

636
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,800
And B, the beta time liners have slime, which makes them invincible compared to someone who don't have slime.

637
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,800
We saw Phantom Horn, he just easily dispatches everyone from the alpha timeline.

638
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
He just butchers them without a second thought.

639
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Because without slime, what can they possibly do? Nothing.

640
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,800
So it's ridiculous. It's totally, totally absurd on its face.

641
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Anyway, Chris continues,

642
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Quickville remained very much safe and sound, and all remaining slime was nullified as well.

643
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Nice try, though.

644
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,800
But you know that a deity is not one to be trifled with that easily.

645
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Okay, so that's all bullshit.

646
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
And then here, and then here we go.

647
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,800
You might like to know, also, that back in my timeline, Michael Jackson lived a few more years beyond yours.

648
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:21,800
He put out two additional albums of inspiration and uplift, as he counted from his experience of falling in golden years into elderly ages.

649
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,800
But his fate was the same as yours.

650
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
He OD'd.

651
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,800
He didn't want to feel that old when he felt so young.

652
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Like Sonichu going back in time within your Chris Chans to undo your COVID virus.

653
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,800
I came back in time to see your fate play out.

654
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,800
I will be personally talking with you again, face to face, very soon, with my body and my Magi Chan.

655
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
See you then, Ben.

656
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Lightning Bolt, Blue Heart, Lightning Bolt.

657
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
So.

658
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
I don't know if this is a threat.

659
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Wait.

660
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
You just had to tell me.

661
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,800
You know, I know we're talking about timelines and realities and the nature of the universe and stuff,

662
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,800
but let me tell you a little bit about Michael Jackson.

663
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,800
He got older, and he made some new albums.

664
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
And then he OD'd.

665
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
He didn't like being old, so we OD'd and he died.

666
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
What does it mean his fate was the same as yours?

667
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Is Chris Chan predicting your death?

668
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I think Chris is implying that I, I mean, I think it's that like I,

669
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,800
the implication is that I am like OD'ing on the slime or something like the slime is corrupting me.

670
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
I think that's an illusion to that.

671
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
I see.

672
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
That's the best thing I can come up with.

673
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,800
So then like Sonichu's going back in time within your Chris Chans,

674
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,800
possessive Chris Chans to undo your COVID virus.

675
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:02,800
So she's saying that Sonichu went back in time in the C197 timeline,

676
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,800
or I don't know what timeline she's talking about.

677
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,800
I don't know what dimension she's talking about, but in some dimension,

678
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,800
Sonichu went back in time and undid COVID,

679
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
which is I appreciate a lot.

680
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
That's pretty cool.

681
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
I want to read that.

682
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
I want to read that.

683
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Yeah, I want to read.

684
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Me too.

685
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,800
I wish I wish he was a little more specific about it.

686
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Anyway, this is all complete nonsense.

687
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Like I have seen reports from C197 that the war is raging.

688
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
The war is raging right now.

689
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
You know, there's photographic evidence.

690
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
It can't be denied.

691
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Chris doesn't want to see, doesn't want to acknowledge that it's true,

692
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
you know, but it is.

693
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Quickville is under attack.

694
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
It is being besieged.

695
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,800
And you know, the people of New Los Angeles City will not be satisfied with anything less than total surrender.

696
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,800
So, you know, sad, but true.

697
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm glad I'm glad we went into that.

698
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
Yeah.

699
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,800
So if you want more, Michael Jackson, go to fucking, I don't know.

700
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,800
C194 or the old mega time?

701
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Which one?

702
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Which one are we in?

703
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,800
We, I mean, we right now are in 1218.

704
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
We are we are in 1218.

705
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Sonichu and Endless War take place in C197.

706
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Wait a minute.

707
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,800
If C197 is the cartooniverse that corresponds to 1218.

708
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Why is C194 the one that corresponds to 1214?

709
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
What's the logic there?

710
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Okay.

711
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Numbers, numbers, numbers.

712
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
What, what, whatever, whatever.

713
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
So.

714
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Omega timeline.

715
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Ridiculous.

716
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Absolutely ridiculous.

717
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Give me a fucking break.

718
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Okay.

719
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,800
So anyway, I guess I'll be seeing her soon.

720
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
I guess she will be visiting me bodily.

721
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Whatever that means.

722
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
It means you're going to meet up again.

723
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
There's no more brony cons to go to, but you know.

724
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,800
I, I just, she's, she's going to have to come to me if that's going to happen.

725
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:29,800
And I kind of think, I kind of, my, my reading of this is that she intends to do it via some kind of astral projection or teleportation.

726
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,800
I don't think she's going to like get a train up to Boston.

727
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
E?

728
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
Yeah.

729
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,800
I guess she'll be visiting me in my nightmares, but physically, physically.

730
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
Physically, in reality.

731
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
But she doesn't say what dimension that'll be happening in.

732
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
So.

733
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
It's probably happening right now.

734
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Just right behind me.

735
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
I mean, um.

736
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Maybe she, she, she was the one who like created that, that dream, that puzzle dream you had.

737
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Ooh.

738
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,800
She, oh, she's the one that set up all the puzzles or magic, maybe Magi Chan did.

739
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
Yeah.

740
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Magi Chan Smiler.

741
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
And because you didn't solve the riddles.

742
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
You didn't solve it quickly enough.

743
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,800
And then you woke up the, the, the, then that means slime is sucks.

744
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,800
We couldn't unlock the secrets of the slime and it stayed trapped in the dream realm.

745
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Oh fuck.

746
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
That made me think of something.

747
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
What was it?

748
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Oh, oh, I was, I was going to say, I mean,

749
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
Uh,

750
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Magi Chan did bottle, make a, make a physical appearance in the Sonichu 102 lecture.

751
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
So, I mean, I guess anything is possible.

752
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Oh shit.

753
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Do you remember that?

754
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
Do you remember that?

755
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
I, I do.

756
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,800
I didn't see it.

757
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
I couldn't see it.

758
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Like, I didn't see it, but like, no, I've been going over the footage and I think it's, it's undeniable.

759
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,800
I think an entity, an entity from C, from C197 appeared.

760
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
And I think it was Magi Chan.

761
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
I don't know.

762
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,800
I can't prove it, but, uh, all the evidence points to it.

763
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,800
So it was very, I mean, I'll be releasing that and you'll, people can, you'll be able to judge for yourself.

764
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Uh, uh, uh, was it, was it only a dream?

765
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Or was it, or was it reality?

766
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Hmm.

767
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
Hmm.

768
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Hmm.

769
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Think about it.

770
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Think.

771
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Think about what you're trying to do to me.

772
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,800
Uh, uh, and, and as we all know, uh, Aretha Franklin's think is the,

773
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,800
is the anthem of Quickville.

774
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,800
Uh, so, you know, think, do it.

775
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Okay.

776
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Okay.

777
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
Okay.

778
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
Uh, excellent.

779
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
Okay.

780
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Uh, beautiful.

781
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Well, I think we've, I think we've covered everything there is to cover about that.

782
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:02,800
Um, well, uh, I guess I could like, uh, I could talk a bit more about, um, girl shit.

783
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Like, like, like girl shit.

784
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Like, like female, like, huh?

785
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Um, so last two, two episodes ago, I explained that I'm like gender something still don't really know.

786
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Gay.

787
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,800
Gender gay.

788
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Um, trying out female pronouns.

789
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:31,800
I was trying to do voice, uh, like feminization to be like high pitch, but I was like, I don't

790
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,800
know, whatever it's, it's hard and I keep forgetting to do it.

791
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I'll figure it out eventually if I ever do that.

792
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:49,800
Um, but you know, um, uh, dude, dude, uh, I'm going to go to Amazon.com and buy a skirt

793
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,800
and it's going to arrive and I'm going to put it on.

794
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
And that's all I've got to say about it.

795
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
No, no, no, no, no.

796
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
No, I'm going to buy a skirt.

797
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Uh, yeah, I mean, makes, makes sense again.

798
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
I got nothing to say about it really.

799
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:17,800
It's just, I'm just continuing to be a gender freak, a cool person that is better than everyone else

800
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,800
based and dab.

801
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Oh God.

802
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Oh God, our views.

803
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Oh God, our views are plummeting.

804
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,800
Oh God, our audience.

805
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
They're hemorrhaging audience.

806
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
They weren't here already.

807
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
They left.

808
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
They're splitting.

809
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
No, no, keep going.

810
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Split the audience.

811
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Make them hate each other.

812
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Divide them against one another for our mutual gain.

813
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,800
They saw that Nate still wasn't here and they said, no, and they left a little comment

814
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,800
about it.

815
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,800
I can't wait till Nate comes back, but he's trans.

816
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,800
I can't fucking, I can't wait for Nate to come back for everybody's trans and more

817
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,800
trans than the, than everyone else.

818
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,800
She's more trans.

819
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,800
Haha.

820
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,800
Oh, here.

821
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Yeah.

822
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,800
The, I know it's like, it's, it's, it's embarrassing to talk about.

823
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
All right, I get it.

824
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,800
Like I can't, I can't like get the words out because it's like, woo, woo.

825
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
You know all that stupid shit.

826
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,240
it. Everyone's always saying like, oh, you were, well, wow.

827
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,360
Oh, well, well, that was stupid. Yeah.

828
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,360
Girls, huh?

829
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,360
What?

830
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,200
You don't look like one. You don't sound like one. I know.

831
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,080
Die. Die. Okay.

832
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:41,440
But I've been shaving my legs to get rid of that hair that, that I have on them.

833
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,440
Right.

834
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:48,120
And the, I think I told like, when I shave, when I show up, shave my legs.

835
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,000
Didn't you say you shaved them at Radcon? You hated it.

836
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Because it like hurt, right?

837
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,120
Yeah, at Radcon four, I shaved them for the OVA, which is in production.

838
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,680
Oh, I don't keep, I don't, we probably shouldn't say too much,

839
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,040
but I do want to say that you posted a thing.

840
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,000
You posted an update on the OVA.

841
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,280
Yes. And I thought it looked sick as fuck.

842
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,760
Yes, I was kind of, I was kind of like, I'd sort of been dreading it.

843
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,160
I'd sort of been feeling like, I feel like it's stagnated.

844
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,960
I feel like like nothing has happened on it.

845
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,400
I feel like I don't know if it's going to like be what I wanted it to be.

846
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,840
I don't know how many like compromises we're going to have to make

847
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,520
and how is this going to disappoint me?

848
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,360
And you posted the thing and I was like, no, it's fine.

849
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,560
It's going to be good. It's actually going to be cool.

850
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,040
Which is so, what a fucking, what a relief, actually.

851
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,320
But yes. Yes.

852
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,640
OK. And I won't, I won't go into any specifics about it.

853
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,640
Yeah. What was I?

854
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,240
Oh, yes, I shaved my as much of my body as I could for that.

855
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,480
But I'd never done it before, ever.

856
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,120
Like my legs had never been shaven.

857
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,480
My arms had never been shaven.

858
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,320
When I did it, it was like, oh, wow, I feel like a completely different person.

859
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,840
But also I did it wrong.

860
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,680
I did it the worst possible way.

861
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,440
I used like a fucking cheap razor.

862
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,160
I think I told the store in the PCP.

863
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,520
I used a cheap razor and I dry shaved my whole body

864
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,320
because it didn't feel, it didn't hurt.

865
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,400
Yeah. And I thought that would hurt really bad.

866
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,320
Yeah. Like I was just, I was just sort of like amazed

867
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,600
at seeing the hair like not be there anymore, that I didn't realize

868
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,360
that I should probably think about this before I continued to do it.

869
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,920
And I just did this and I was like, yeah, this feels good.

870
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,640
Next day.

871
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,840
Extreme pain.

872
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,200
But like, you know, we got a thing to film.

873
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,640
So I filmed the thing.

874
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,480
We all did the stuff.

875
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,640
And yeah, it just hurt like shit for ages

876
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,240
because I cut my leg a million times.

877
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,400
Million microscopic death, death by a thousand thousand cuts.

878
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,720
But now I've researched how to do it.

879
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,320
And I've learned that there's a you just need to be not an idiot.

880
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,160
And you shave it the same way you would shave your face.

881
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,520
Use water. Yeah.

882
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,960
Use shaving foam and you make sure that it is warm and wet

883
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,240
and clean. You ever you ever use you shave in the bath?

884
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,440
That's what I've been doing.

885
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,640
You ever see a device called an epilator?

886
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,880
I think I saw it when I was looking around when I.

887
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,720
I used I used to I used to like try like shaving my chest and stuff.

888
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,760
Be like, well, this look good. And no, it doesn't.

889
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,600
I don't I don't do it. It's stupid. It was dumb.

890
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,360
But for a while there, I was like, I don't know, maybe I should do that.

891
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,600
And I and I did it and this was in like college.

892
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,480
And my my girlfriend at the time had, you know,

893
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,320
she had an epilator that she used on her legs.

894
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,440
And I was like, what is this?

895
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,760
And if you don't know an epilator, it sort of looks like a razor

896
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,640
that you might take to shave, but it doesn't shave you.

897
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:01,760
What it has in it are these like rolling pins or like bar.

898
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,720
I don't know how to describe them.

899
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,160
They're these like these rolling things.

900
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,960
It's sort of like never seen like them toss an animal carcass

901
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,120
into like a meat grinder.

902
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,800
And it like gets like it's no, it gets like rolled in

903
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,360
and like I have not squished in in between like the these rolling things.

904
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,080
An epilator is like that.

905
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,960
And what you do is you pass it over your body

906
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,880
and these rolling things like grab the hairs and rip them out by the roots.

907
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:32,480
So it hurts really bad, but you get really fucking smooth.

908
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,440
It's smoother than a shave because there's no stubble

909
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,960
or like it takes a while for the stubble to grow back in.

910
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,360
So and I mean, for me, I'm a very hairy guy.

911
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,680
So it was like a real nightmare.

912
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,320
Did you do it? Did you do it somewhere?

913
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,200
A couple of times, a couple of times I did it just to see

914
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,480
before I was like, I think I'm going to stop doing this.

915
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,560
There's no point to it.

916
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,800
It's done. How quick did it regrow?

917
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,400
It takes maybe a week for it to start being stubble again.

918
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,640
OK, I mean, I feel like just generally shaving does the same amount.

919
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,880
Like it's it's stubble.

920
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,240
Well, when you shave, like you start to get stubble like immediately.

921
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,120
Yeah. Oh, you're saying that there's absolutely nothing until a week passes.

922
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,120
I'm saying when you when you when you epilate,

923
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,200
yeah, you don't have like any if you if you do it all at once,

924
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,240
you don't have like any stubble for like at least a few days

925
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,000
because it's like under the skin

926
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,640
and it doesn't like the root doesn't regrow out the skin for a little while.

927
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,240
It's you're not cutting cutting it at the skin layer.

928
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,120
You're pulling it out from from deeper in.

929
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,560
Hmm. Hmm.

930
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,000
So I don't know.

931
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,480
Yeah, I heard of epilator.

932
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,920
I heard of like this this other thing that's like like lasers.

933
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,600
They use lasers to like burn the the the follicle so that it never goes back.

934
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,760
Is a thing.

935
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,920
I think sometimes it can grow back eventually, like some of it.

936
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,400
There's so many fucking hairs on a leg.

937
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,400
I saw the amount of power that the laser would need over the whole leg.

938
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,920
I mean, too much.

939
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,440
It's too much of a problem to really like I don't think is that is that the problem?

940
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,080
No, that laser would have to be too powerful.

941
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,960
I don't understand like how would it work?

942
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,360
Like how does a laser shoot?

943
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,360
Do they pull their hair out and then shoot the laser down the hair hole?

944
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,400
No, not down there.

945
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,040
I think it's more like because the skin is like semi

946
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:40,040
translucent, so they can it's like a cancer treatment in the same way

947
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,280
that you have two lasers and where they meet it burns, but everywhere else, it doesn't.

948
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,480
So they probably have two lasers and they pinpoint it at the specific point

949
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,640
and just do that a million billion times.

950
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,920
You know, I didn't know that's how it works, but it makes sense.

951
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,320
So well, I don't know how that that's how the hair removal works,

952
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,280
but that's how cancer treatment works, because if they shot you with the

953
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,560
the whatever it is thing, the gamma rays, I don't exactly know.

954
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,520
Yeah, but if they shot you with just that,

955
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,000
all of your cells would be affected the same way.

956
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,360
They need to pinpoint where the cancer is,

957
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,000
which is why it's really important to get it early, because then it's not all over the place

958
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,040
and you don't need to do that much chemo.

959
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,680
Right.

960
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,720
So they can just figure out where it is, shoot from a different angles

961
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,400
to pinpoint an area and then it burns that the fucking thing and it's gone.

962
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,920
Making me this is making me super nervous, because sometimes I haven't

963
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,280
I haven't been to a doctor.

964
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,000
I haven't had a checkup in like two years and I'm like sometimes I think about it

965
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,280
and I'm like, maybe I should get one.

966
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,360
And then I'm like, oh, God, but what if what if it's bad news?

967
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,440
I mean, what if I go in and they're like, well, you got cancer

968
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,800
and you've had cancer for almost exactly two years and it's too late.

969
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,320
Yeah, but like you ever think about that?

970
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,600
I mean, I don't really.

971
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,840
OK, I feel like I feel like.

972
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,760
I don't think I shouldn't go to the doctor

973
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,520
because I'm scared that it will be bad news.

974
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,280
I mean, yeah, I mean, sure.

975
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,200
Obviously, obviously, I'm not being rational about this

976
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,560
because like if you feel like there could be something bad,

977
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,280
it would be one a relief to now know that there is nothing wrong.

978
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,160
I don't feel like to catch it early if there is something wrong and potentially live.

979
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,480
I don't feel like there's anything wrong.

980
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,120
But I feel like sometimes you just go to the doctor

981
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,200
and you think everything's fine and they're like, actually, you're going to die.

982
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,960
Did they say that to you every time?

983
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,720
No, not to me.

984
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,080
Well, then what's the problem then?

985
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,520
I'm saying, what if I go and I'm like, yeah, you know,

986
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,560
I'm just coming in to get, you know, just test me for.

987
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,360
Yeah, whatever.

988
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,400
Just give me a prostate exam or whatever, you know, the standard.

989
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,760
And I'll just be on my way and they're like, oh, no, no, no, no, no,

990
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,960
your blood work came in and your blood is full of poison.

991
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,480
Excuse me. What?

992
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,840
Full of poison.

993
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,400
You could drink your own blood, you'd die.

994
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,880
Yeah, exactly.

995
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,640
But like, I don't know, you know, sometimes you feel fine,

996
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,480
but you're actually on death's door.

997
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,720
Well, I mean, I guess I guess the the potential, like,

998
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,240
worry, like needless worry of like knowing that you're going to die,

999
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,320
but having nothing you can do about it would like make the rest of your life suck.

1000
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:48,000
But I mean, worrying about it surely also makes the rest like it's the same thing.

1001
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,640
Worrying about the potential that you could be dying.

1002
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,480
Yeah, is about the same as like knowing that you're going to die.

1003
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:02,240
Well, not the same, but like it impacts your life in the same way negatively.

1004
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,120
So just if you go to just go to a doctor and they say,

1005
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,880
you just have to be really nervous and say, oh, is there anything else?

1006
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,880
Do you think I have anything else?

1007
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,400
And they just say, no, just go, go away.

1008
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,760
You're fine.

1009
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,360
You stupid piece of shit.

1010
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,800
I hope you die.

1011
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,160
That's what they should say.

1012
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,560
Oh, my God.

1013
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,280
Yeah, OK, this is me.

1014
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,200
I should fucking I should get an appointment.

1015
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,240
Yeah, get an appointment.

1016
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,320
Get one right now.

1017
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,760
Go to appointments.com.

1018
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,800
Get the doctor app.

1019
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,200
Need a dentist appointments, too.

1020
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,040
I got a couple cavities.

1021
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,560
I got a couple cavities that need to be dwelled and filled.

1022
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,440
Dwelled and filled. Drill them and fill them.

1023
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,520
And that's what they say about me.

1024
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,400
That's what I do when I have sex.

1025
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,120
I thought you didn't have sex.

1026
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,160
I thought you were an abstainence.

1027
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,880
I lied.

1028
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,680
I'm sorry.

1029
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,600
I went on Twitter and I can't believe.

1030
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,640
I told a lie for attention and likes and I got them.

1031
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,520
And everyone said, yay, I love Ben.

1032
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,240
He's a virgin like me.

1033
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,640
It's funny.

1034
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,520
It's funny that it got like attention and likes

1035
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,760
because everybody knew that it wasn't true.

1036
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,120
It's like it's like my most popular tweet

1037
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,520
in like weeks or months.

1038
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,360
It's like completely nothing about it is interesting.

1039
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,880
There's just like, I don't know.

1040
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,440
Hey, guys, I don't know what.

1041
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,320
I'm pretending to hate sex.

1042
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,760
Ha, ha, that's a funny joke.

1043
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,040
I like.

1044
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,360
And everyone's like, I love this.

1045
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,040
I want more of this.

1046
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,880
I want to encourage this kind of behavior.

1047
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,080
I mean, it's not terrible.

1048
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,440
It's just sort of like whatever.

1049
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,840
It's no, it's just baffling.

1050
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,800
It's just baffling.

1051
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,880
I don't know why I made it.

1052
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,120
And I was like, why are people like it?

1053
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,240
It did seem to me like a lull so random sort of tweet.

1054
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,560
Yeah.

1055
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,760
That's exactly what it was precisely.

1056
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,520
Um, I guess people are into that.

1057
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,560
I've been, I've been getting, I mean, I do those.

1058
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,520
I do those all the time.

1059
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,760
I know, I'm no better.

1060
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,240
I don't know why my attention to my Twitter

1061
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,120
has picked up a little bit.

1062
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,960
I was just like hemorrhaging followers

1063
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,560
and I still kind of am,

1064
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,760
but now I've started gaining a few to replace them.

1065
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,600
And I don't know why.

1066
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,720
Maybe it's because of slime and punishment.

1067
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,880
I don't fucking know.

1068
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Twitter sucks.

1069
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,320
I'm terrible at Twitter.

1070
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,920
My follower count has been in like slow decline

1071
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,560
for a long time.

1072
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,200
It's kind of a bummer actually.

1073
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,360
I honestly can't, I can't believe

1074
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,000
that anyone pays attention to their follower number.

1075
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,800
I mean, I just noticed it every once in a while

1076
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,720
to be like, oh, yep, went down a few more.

1077
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,560
Okay.

1078
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,720
The only thing is, is like,

1079
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,240
I see when somebody follows,

1080
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,440
but I don't see a button like a notification

1081
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,280
when someone unfollows.

1082
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,560
So I just assume it's constantly going up.

1083
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,520
No, mine is, I've lost like maybe a hundred

1084
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,240
over the last like year or so.

1085
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,600
Maybe maybe only six months.

1086
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,480
Oh, a year, six months.

1087
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,480
That's, that's not so bad.

1088
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,160
I think it's just people who followed me

1089
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,440
like a while ago and like forgot

1090
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,400
and they're just finally getting around to like,

1091
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,240
I don't even remember who this guy is anymore.

1092
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,080
He's changed his name so many times.

1093
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,680
He got so many funny things in the name.

1094
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,400
Mm.

1095
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,960
Ugh.

1096
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,120
Yeah.

1097
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,360
I have discovered a Twitter breakthrough,

1098
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,920
which is like, it's not,

1099
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,760
it's not something that is new.

1100
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,440
It's just something I've just realized

1101
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,760
because I've been stupid this whole time

1102
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,680
is that you don't follow people you know

1103
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,320
and want to keep up with.

1104
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,240
You follow people who retweets shit all the time.

1105
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,520
Specific shit.

1106
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,360
I found this guy and he's an artist.

1107
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,000
And I was like, oh, what is his art?

1108
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,640
And I was looking for his art

1109
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,800
because I saw he was an artist.

1110
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,960
I was like, where's your art?

1111
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,560
All it was, it was retweets of other artists.

1112
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,200
I was like, where's your fucking art?

1113
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,240
I can't believe all you do is retweet.

1114
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,360
Oh, there's one of them.

1115
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,960
So I found one of his hearts,

1116
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,160
but like 98% of what he does

1117
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,400
is retweet cool art from other people.

1118
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,080
And then I realized that he is a good artist

1119
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,720
who is curating Twitter for me.

1120
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,240
I should just follow him.

1121
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,080
And then I followed him

1122
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,000
and now my feed is filled with great retweets of cool shit.

1123
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,080
And that's all I see.

1124
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,000
It's the best.

1125
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,760
Because each individual artist would like post their art

1126
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,360
and then sometimes something else or some other thing.

1127
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,880
But this guy only retweets the cool shit that he sees.

1128
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,960
So it's like I'm cutting out the annoyance

1129
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,080
of following somebody who only posts about their art

1130
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,120
some of the time.

1131
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,240
And it's the best.

1132
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,760
Yeah, I guess so.

1133
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,760
I don't really follow Twitter for art that much, honestly.

1134
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,440
I actually use Twitter more as a news feed.

1135
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,200
I think I've talked about this before.

1136
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,040
I mostly go to Twitter to like read

1137
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,360
like what's fucking happening in like the news and stuff.

1138
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,040
I don't, I've got it all.

1139
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,480
I've got it all Arabic.

1140
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,880
Like I can't read it.

1141
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,760
Really?

1142
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,040
Yeah, I changed my location

1143
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,760
so I can't read what's trending.

1144
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,240
And it's always like just some letters.

1145
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,400
I feel like I said this before.

1146
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,920
I maybe, but I forgot.

1147
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,440
That's very funny.

1148
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,280
That's very funny.

1149
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,120
The person I follow is at Chibi Changa 12,

1150
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,280
but we'll put a little thing there

1151
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,120
so in case anybody wants to see cool art all the time.

1152
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,280
I don't think anybody wants to see that.

1153
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,240
Me.

1154
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,120
Okay, I'm gonna look at this picture.

1155
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,200
So this person does do their own art.

1156
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,280
Yes, very rarely do they post it.

1157
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,120
But, you know.

1158
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,360
Is it good?

1159
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,600
Yeah, it's quite good.

1160
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:08,120
It's like, you know, it's a professional looking.

1161
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,160
I mean, the thing I like about it.

1162
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,040
I see a lot of retweets from,

1163
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,960
I see a lot of retweets from Cheesy Manfredo.

1164
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,160
That guy is like always retweeting

1165
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,840
people's cool art and stuff.

1166
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,680
Oh, yeah.

1167
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,800
Honestly, that's probably the most art I see on Twitter

1168
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,440
is from Cheesy Retweeting.

1169
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,280
Well.

1170
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,800
You know, speaking of art and Twitter,

1171
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,400
I was thinking of making like a new Twitter account

1172
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,520
for not safe for work art.

1173
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,680
And I would draw like a big booby mummy milker.

1174
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,640
Or two per day.

1175
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,440
That's what I'm thinking of doing.

1176
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,640
Okay.

1177
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,680
Judge Jury Executioner, you can try to kill me,

1178
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,760
but I'm too quick.

1179
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,720
I can run away from you.

1180
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,680
Well, okay.

1181
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,560
I mean, I don't know, follow your bliss.

1182
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,200
Follow your bliss.

1183
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,600
Follow my bliss?

1184
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,280
Follow your bliss.

1185
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,600
Okay, sure.

1186
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,720
Okay.

1187
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,560
Okay.

1188
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,400
Okay.

1189
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,040
Well, I look forward to that.

1190
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,520
Should I follow it?

1191
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,120
Should I follow it or will you be embarrassed?

1192
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,920
No, people can follow it.

1193
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,480
I'm probably not going to like hide it and be secretive

1194
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,600
because it doesn't matter who cares.

1195
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,840
People already know that I like sex

1196
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,440
and things of that nature.

1197
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,040
And I think, you know,

1198
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,480
everybody's got a not safe work account these days.

1199
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,440
What does it matter if I have one as well?

1200
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,680
I made an OnlyFans and that was funny

1201
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,280
and epic and everyone liked it.

1202
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,040
Are there still updates on that?

1203
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,360
Is that updating or?

1204
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,680
No, I just sort of forgot to,

1205
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,280
I mean, this month has been like mostly the comic

1206
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,520
that I've been drawing and nothing else.

1207
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,520
But I don't know, I feel like OnlyFans

1208
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,360
takes such a large cut that it's not really worth doing it.

1209
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,680
Like it was funny from meme and for a bit of cash, but like...

1210
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,480
Hey, what's the only,

1211
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,240
what's Pump's OnlyFans account called?

1212
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,240
Pumpk911.

1213
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,560
Well, Pumpk911, OnlyFans.

1214
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,760
I'm gonna look this out.

1215
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,760
Here we go.

1216
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,080
Pumpk911.

1217
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:35,360
So, I don't know how to read a fucking OnlyFans.

1218
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,640
Can you like see how many followers a person has?

1219
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:43,520
I don't know.

1220
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,360
I see up in the top left, I see nine posts and 22 likes

1221
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,640
and that's all I can see.

1222
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,400
Oh well.

1223
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,960
Yeah, I've received 22 likes.

1224
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,920
Do you have any subscribers?

1225
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,360
Probably, why is it not loading?

1226
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,960
I clicked on the thing.

1227
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,680
It's not loading the page, whatever.

1228
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,160
Sometimes I'll see like,

1229
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,920
up here where it says how many posts and likes,

1230
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,520
sometimes there's more info

1231
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,760
and there will be like a little like

1232
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,040
stick figure with a heart next to it and a number

1233
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,280
and I think that's the number of subscribers,

1234
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,320
but I don't know.

1235
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,520
It doesn't actually say what it means.

1236
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,760
I think all of my subscribers have left

1237
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,320
because I stopped updating.

1238
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,000
But I don't know.

1239
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,240
I feel like it's probably

1240
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,640
worth my time to just build up

1241
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,800
like some sort of a public following

1242
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,720
and then say, hey, here's my specific

1243
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,040
not safe for work Patreon

1244
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,760
or whatever I end up deciding to do

1245
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,800
if I ever go that far with it beyond hobbyist.

1246
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,200
Indeed, indeed.

1247
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,800
Yeah.

1248
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,000
It really is not loading whatsoever.

1249
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,520
I'm seeing what I'll go right now.

1250
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,520
Only fans, it's like a really slow

1251
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,720
and like loads really badly like consistently

1252
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,160
when I go to it, which I never do.

1253
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,000
I would never, I would never support sex workers.

1254
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,400
So yeah, but it's always like takes forever

1255
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,040
to fucking get off the page where the only fans logo

1256
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,440
is just floating there.

1257
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,080
Bad website.

1258
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,400
Yes, sucks.

1259
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,960
Oh, should we talk about Munchie?

1260
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,480
Oh, what about him?

1261
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,240
Munchie leave.

1262
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,600
Munchie leave a disserver.

1263
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,760
Did he post a thing?

1264
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,600
All of this.

1265
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,440
All a disserver.

1266
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,280
In RFCK.

1267
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,760
Did he, he left all, did he leave this server?

1268
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,440
No, he's still here.

1269
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,960
He's just, well, I feel like

1270
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,480
he would probably not want me to butcher his statement,

1271
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,280
but I will say-

1272
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,200
I haven't actually read his statement in-

1273
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,840
The statement is basically he's,

1274
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,040
wants to focus on being a real person

1275
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,720
outside of an online personality.

1276
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,160
So the things he did as an online personality,

1277
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,920
such as podcasts and things, streams,

1278
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,800
he's abandoning, not abandoning,

1279
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,440
but he's leaving indefinitely

1280
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,520
and may one day return,

1281
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,400
but it's not like a sure thing in any way.

1282
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,000
Did he post that in the auditorium?

1283
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,840
He didn't.

1284
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,760
He posted that in Detention Set-O.

1285
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,040
Oh.

1286
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,800
He also posted it in Quick Draw.

1287
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,160
Oh, shit.

1288
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,200
Okay, well, whatever.

1289
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,040
I haven't read it,

1290
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,720
but I think he's like told me as much before.

1291
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,760
I am like, okay.

1292
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,600
Yeah, all right.

1293
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,120
If you want to like, you know, school starting,

1294
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,680
you want to focus on school or whatever.

1295
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,520
That's fine.

1296
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,040
Whatever.

1297
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,400
I don't think,

1298
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,360
I don't think,

1299
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,640
I don't mean to be dismissive,

1300
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,880
but I do think it's sort of weird

1301
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,200
and I don't really get it to be like,

1302
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,760
I'm going to be off the internet

1303
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,440
to focus on being a real person.

1304
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,680
Well, I don't think you use those exact words.

1305
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,520
Okay, all right.

1306
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,360
Yeah, all right.

1307
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,200
I shouldn't, all right.

1308
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,040
You're paraphrasing.

1309
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,840
I don't know.

1310
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,720
That's fine.

1311
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,240
Yeah, I just feel like,

1312
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,320
I mean, Munchie has been on the PCP in a while anyway.

1313
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,720
So it's not really an announcement

1314
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,000
that he's left the PCP, but like.

1315
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,080
I don't see why it has to be so black and white

1316
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,400
either or like I'm on the internet

1317
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,880
or I'm not on the internet,

1318
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,640
but at the end of the day,

1319
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,440
like whatever he wants to do.

1320
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,840
Well, it's not like,

1321
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,160
I feel like it's not like the internet.

1322
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:05,640
I feel like it's more of the internet personality,

1323
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,680
Munchie wears tiny hats.

1324
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,080
Like the things people expect

1325
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,040
of Munchie wears tiny hats.

1326
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,320
The appearances of Radcon, I assume.

1327
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,760
Making content at all.

1328
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,480
It's just like he wants to stop the expectations

1329
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,840
that he will continue to do that forever.

1330
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,280
Which is like, fairly respectable

1331
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,800
and I don't really mind

1332
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,480
that he still exists, obviously.

1333
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,080
And I'm his friend, so I can talk to him.

1334
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,480
I mean, Munchie doesn't really,

1335
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,800
you know, I mean, Munchie doesn't really make content.

1336
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,280
Like I have not been expecting Munchie content for a while.

1337
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,120
No, but like.

1338
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,160
The lecture came out and I was fine.

1339
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,000
Yeah.

1340
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,680
He got his things, all affairs all in order.

1341
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:54,080
But like, I think not doing RCK episodes

1342
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,520
and streams and endless world stuff was like a big thing.

1343
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,320
Yeah.

1344
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,360
Yeah, if you, okay.

1345
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,440
I'm looking at the statement right now.

1346
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,440
Okay, yeah, sure.

1347
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,520
I mean, I guess it's like, Munchie was already,

1348
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,720
like yeah, he might've been,

1349
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,360
I don't know exactly how much time

1350
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,000
he was spending on Endless War.

1351
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,920
I mean, if he wants to pull back from that, fair enough.

1352
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,120
It kind of seemed like he was mostly,

1353
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,920
like he was already mostly disengaged.

1354
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,760
Like he wasn't being on the PCP.

1355
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,640
He wasn't like making his own videos or anything.

1356
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,000
He wasn't like working on any art projects

1357
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,960
that were like people were anticipating.

1358
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,760
He had already like pulled back most of the way.

1359
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,600
Yeah.

1360
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,640
I think this is, he said he was like doing all that

1361
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,360
to see how it felt not doing any of this stuff.

1362
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,760
And it was fine.

1363
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,760
It's just whatever you want to do.

1364
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,920
It's just whatever anybody wants to do.

1365
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,760
I don't know.

1366
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,760
I'm just like.

1367
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,280
Where's investigative?

1368
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,600
Yeah.

1369
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,440
I'm just like,

1370
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,680
being doing stuff,

1371
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,560
doing the stuff that I do on the internet

1372
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,360
does not in any way prohibit me

1373
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,720
from doing other things in real life.

1374
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,280
So, it's.

1375
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,720
I don't think it's, it's like,

1376
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,560
it feels like it prohibits him from doing other things.

1377
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:34,040
I think it's just sort of a cloud over one's head

1378
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,960
to like be switched on.

1379
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,480
I mean, you know how he always like,

1380
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,760
when you turn a camera to Munchy,

1381
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,640
like he always does the funny thing.

1382
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,200
Like I feel like that he's got that sort of like

1383
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,800
the pressure to be a certain,

1384
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,480
you know, he wouldn't like live stream him

1385
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,840
just sitting around.

1386
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,800
He's not that sort of person.

1387
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,280
So, like the, any obligation that he has

1388
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:05,280
to like be someone internet personality wise,

1389
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,520
I think is what he was like

1390
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,200
trying to distance himself from.

1391
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,160
And I feel like you maybe are a little different

1392
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,240
where you just feel like it's the same.

1393
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,840
Real life in the internet is the same

1394
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,680
and you're just doing whatever.

1395
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,560
I do.

1396
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,840
I do feel like real life in the internet is the same.

1397
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,480
Like I guess on like a show or whatever,

1398
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,720
I guess I do put on like a little bit of like,

1399
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,200
I'll like bring my energy level up or whatever.

1400
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:35,200
Or I'll, you know, I do like behave in a deliberate way

1401
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,640
to like, you know, get good responses.

1402
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,560
But like I do that normally in real life

1403
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,320
when I'm just with people.

1404
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,240
I'm like, if I'm like hanging out with someone,

1405
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,480
I'll like, you know, try and like be funny or whatever

1406
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,160
or try and be like, I don't know, entertaining

1407
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,600
in the exact same way that I do, like on the internet,

1408
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,520
it's the same to me, to me anyway.

1409
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,320
When I'm in real life, I don't do anything.

1410
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:08,320
I just sort of like float through an experience.

1411
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,640
And when somebody says something to me, I go, huh?

1412
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,480
What?

1413
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,280
Yep, that's true.

1414
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,880
That's true.

1415
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,720
I heard it.

1416
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:24,120
Yeah, just just mentioning to people who may have like

1417
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,680
heard rumors of munchy and then this is,

1418
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,320
that is just a explanation.

1419
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,480
Well, okay, I feel like, I feel like I have now explained

1420
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:37,720
how I, why this is like different

1421
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,800
from how I would characterize these things.

1422
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,560
But like I respect it, it's fine.

1423
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,400
It's okay.

1424
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,440
Yeah, same.

1425
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,920
Yeah, dirt.

1426
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,920
But I am a little upset because it's like,

1427
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,120
cause I don't know if we're gonna finish our slime monopoly.

1428
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,800
Ooh.

1429
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,960
We're not gonna be able to finish slime monopoly.

1430
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,880
Slime monopoly was so fun.

1431
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,400
It was the funnest I've had in a long time.

1432
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,200
Even when munchy fucking squatters rights me.

1433
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,480
Even that.

1434
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,360
It was so intense.

1435
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,200
Yeah.

1436
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,760
And the board was so cool.

1437
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,000
I wish I could have stayed there for even longer.

1438
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,480
You know, I thought it was probably about time

1439
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,120
to quit playing that when you left anyway.

1440
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,880
So I was like, I kind of think this is good

1441
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,600
that we have a reason to be like, all right, call it here.

1442
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,720
We gotta judge the contest.

1443
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,520
Well, heck.

1444
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,440
I landed on the fucking get all of the money

1445
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,560
spot thing, didn't I?

1446
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,400
Piece of shit.

1447
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,840
You landed on, was it community service?

1448
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,280
Yeah, I got a community service or,

1449
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,840
yeah, I said collect all the money from the thing.

1450
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,920
No, no, no, no, I landed on the board.

1451
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,520
Wait, I can't remember.

1452
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,200
Yeah, you landed, yeah, you rolled a five.

1453
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,320
You were like, if I roll a five,

1454
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,640
I'm gonna land on community service.

1455
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,840
And you did.

1456
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,840
And you got like $800 from it.

1457
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,040
Yeah.

1458
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,560
I don't think it's called community service.

1459
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,200
Like the community chest, money.

1460
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,120
Kings ransom or something.

1461
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,720
Oh, Kingpin's coffers.

1462
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,560
That's the one.

1463
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,960
Kingpin's coffers, that's right.

1464
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,080
I got everything.

1465
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,520
I could buy so many hotels.

1466
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,360
That sucks.

1467
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,360
That sucks so bad.

1468
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,720
Yeah, we're fucked.

1469
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,480
But I don't know, if Munchy wanted to come back.

1470
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,920
That's the real reason Munchy is not coming back

1471
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,040
because he doesn't want to have to face me.

1472
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,000
If Munchy wanted to come back for a guest spot

1473
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,800
on a slime monopoly episode two, I would love that.

1474
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,000
But I don't know, I guess we'll see.

1475
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,160
I guess we'll see.

1476
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,880
Anyone that didn't, that didn't see,

1477
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,560
if you want to go to twitch.tv slash

1478
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,520
rowdyfricker's cop killers and watch.

1479
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,600
I don't think, it's not the latest video.

1480
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,920
It's the second the latest video

1481
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,800
because I highlighted them in like a weird order.

1482
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,240
But it was the slime fest, it's eight hours long,

1483
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,760
but the first like half of it is us playing slime monopoly.

1484
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,920
It's a custom monopoly board that Smirg made

1485
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,000
with the help of like input from other people

1486
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,120
in the RFCK community.

1487
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,960
It looks so good.

1488
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,140
It's like so custom, it's got like a new custom rule set

1489
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,220
that there's like new cards and there's new like

1490
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:15,500
mechanics added on to it.

1491
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,380
There's like a slimeoid mechanic

1492
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,340
that I don't think any of us ever got to really use,

1493
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:20,260
but it's in there.

1494
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,060
Even just having- The pieces are like pretty modeled

1495
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,060
and they're so good.

1496
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:24,980
They're so great.

1497
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:28,180
I love the little Lord of Ghost model with the,

1498
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:32,660
like you can look underneath like upskirt Lord of Ghost

1499
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:36,700
and you can see that Smirg has models like the eyes.

1500
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,540
I never did that.

1501
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,820
I never, you were saying that,

1502
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,660
but I never got around to peeking.

1503
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:45,660
I wanted to, I was curious next time

1504
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,300
if there is a next time.

1505
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,140
I hope there'll be a next time.

1506
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:50,940
I would like to finish that game.

1507
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,260
Cause like, yeah.

1508
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,300
Cause everyone says monopoly is like a terrible game

1509
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,660
and like a boring game that just makes everyone mad.

1510
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,260
And it's kind of true.

1511
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,460
And yet it was like so tense that I was enthralled.

1512
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,580
I was on the edge of my seat.

1513
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:04,940
It makes everyone mad,

1514
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,980
but people play it with their family

1515
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,820
and you don't want to be mad at your family.

1516
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:11,940
When you have like a rival, a friendly rival

1517
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:16,180
in like rowdy fucker cop killer sort of situation,

1518
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,020
then it's fun.

1519
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,740
Cause friends don't play monopoly,

1520
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,620
only families do, which is always wrong.

1521
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:24,700
When Munchy squatters writes me,

1522
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,380
I was legitimately upset and could not,

1523
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:30,340
like I could not talk for a while

1524
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,060
cause I was like too mad.

1525
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,940
You were like switched off.

1526
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,620
I was seething.

1527
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,540
And we were like, oh my God.

1528
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:38,380
What is it?

1529
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,220
He can't even speak.

1530
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:42,260
And you just said, like, I'm looking up the rules.

1531
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:45,220
Yeah, so it was like so dead.

1532
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,180
He fucking got me.

1533
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,820
He fucking got me.

1534
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,460
I mean, it was, it was like cheap.

1535
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,500
It was really cheap.

1536
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,580
But like he didn't say that he was moving,

1537
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:59,220
but it's technically not against the rules.

1538
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,740
You don't technically have to say what you're doing.

1539
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,060
And he fucking robbed me of like 50 bucks

1540
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,180
that should have been mine.

1541
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:10,140
But hey, that's capitalism, I guess.

1542
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:10,980
Lamal.

1543
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:14,060
Good times.

1544
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,100
I don't know.

1545
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,060
You want to go to voicemails?

1546
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:19,820
Yeah, we've been going for an hour and a half.

1547
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,740
Hour and hour 15.

1548
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:25,460
Do you have anything else to say about stuff?

1549
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,100
This now would be the time to do it.

1550
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,580
No, no, I'm just like,

1551
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,660
I'm really over.

1552
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:40,860
I'm really over not having delivered on my kick starters.

1553
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,340
And I'm really impatient for those fucking books to get here.

1554
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:47,100
So I can fucking do that.

1555
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,980
You should do an unboxing video of getting the books.

1556
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,460
Oh, maybe I could.

1557
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,340
Maybe I could, you know what I really want to do?

1558
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:59,340
I keep thinking about this and every time I think of it,

1559
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,740
I'm like, yeah, that is a good idea.

1560
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,940
I want to do like cooking videos.

1561
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,620
I want to do like a series of like.

1562
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:10,420
I would love to see how how Ben makes like the gummies

1563
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,540
and keto pizza and all of these weird things that you've come up with

1564
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:15,980
and you talk about, but like, I want to see it.

1565
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,180
Yeah, I feel like.

1566
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:22,500
Yeah, like my the pepperoni crust is like a it's like a Ben invention.

1567
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,500
Nobody else does it, but it works great.

1568
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,380
And it's and it's all and it's all me.

1569
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:31,100
I invented it and why not make a video being like,

1570
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:34,220
here's how I here's how I do it, lol.

1571
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:34,820
The worm.

1572
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,260
I mean, the worms is such like a strange thing

1573
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:41,220
that like no human being does.

1574
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:46,100
I feel like, yeah, that probably deserves to be documented in some form.

1575
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,340
But I would have to clean my kitchen because my kitchen, my my kitchen,

1576
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:54,140
my kitchen is filthy, but I but I can handle it.

1577
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,820
Yeah, I don't know.

1578
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:58,980
I keep I keep thinking about that.

1579
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:01,140
Probably when I have some free time and nothing better to do,

1580
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:04,940
I will I will do that because because why the fuck not?

1581
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,460
Oh, I haven't got nothing to say.

1582
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,860
Let's do voicemails. Yeah. Yeah.

1583
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,980
OK, let me get this side up.

1584
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,460
That's a fuck. What is it?

1585
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,300
Is it big pipe dot com slash?

1586
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:23,060
T. P. Crescinators.

1587
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:26,300
Is it the procrastinators?

1588
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:30,340
I will look it up on the procrastinators podcast dot com.

1589
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:34,060
It is speak it.

1590
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:37,100
No, no, speak pipe dot com slash PCP voicemail.

1591
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,780
Lol, is how you send us a frigging voicemail for us.

1592
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:42,700
Keep getting it wrong.

1593
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,460
I do too, because I keep thinking it's like the Twitter.

1594
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:46,660
It's T. P. Crescinators.

1595
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:49,460
But no, PCP voicemail, PCP voicemail.

1596
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:50,620
Oh.

1597
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:52,660
Do you see that?

1598
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:56,380
I think the first one is voicemail Lord Tards.

1599
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:58,980
You ready?

1600
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:01,500
Uh huh. OK, three, two, one, go.

1601
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:04,940
Two episodes ago, some guy called in

1602
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:09,740
autistically screeching about, quote, unquote, the voicemail god

1603
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,540
submitting his persona five voicemails.

1604
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:14,260
You frigging idiot.

1605
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:15,580
That's tiny Timmy.

1606
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,580
Don't you fucking remember the whole arc

1607
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,700
of giving him a name and shit, bro?

1608
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,180
Come on. Of course we don't.

1609
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:24,380
Because I don't know.

1610
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:27,300
I don't know who either of those people are.

1611
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,580
I've never heard. I don't know.

1612
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,180
Lore, we have lore now.

1613
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,460
Very confusing.

1614
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:34,940
Yeah, you know what?

1615
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,860
I'm going to give you lore and I'm going to forget it immediately.

1616
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,460
You are dumb.

1617
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,540
Dead, die, crushed.

1618
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:48,780
Um, OK, next up.

1619
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:52,780
Cringe conjurer three, two, one, go.

1620
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:56,060
Somebody was asking about recognizing your own cringe

1621
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,780
so that you can do based and it reminded me of an amazing story.

1622
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,380
I think you guys would appreciate.

1623
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,700
So I would go to Friday Night Magic, which is when you go to your

1624
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,220
comic shop to play Magic the Gathering with other losers.

1625
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:10,940
And we were playing one day and there is a table of people playing Pokemon

1626
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:14,180
and this one guy walks in and he was, I swear,

1627
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:17,980
the star football player of our high school and he walked in

1628
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:21,620
with a Pokemon shirt and his little deck box of Pokemon cards

1629
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,340
and the shopkeeper was like, hey, what's up, state champ?

1630
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,700
And everybody was like, oh, yeah, this guy's the fucking state

1631
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,500
champion of Pokemon, bro.

1632
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,860
Oh, he's so good.

1633
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:34,300
He made eye contact with me and my fucking nerdy friends

1634
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:37,540
from the same school and it looked like he saw a ghost.

1635
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,780
It was hilarious.

1636
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:43,020
He pulled us outside and fucking freaked out

1637
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,980
and was like begging us and like he would offer to buy us packs

1638
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:47,220
if we didn't tell anybody.

1639
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,020
That's so lame.

1640
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:52,060
So, yeah, you got to own your own cringe because if you don't,

1641
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,580
that's the cringiest thing of all.

1642
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:57,140
That's so lame to be like, please don't tell anyone.

1643
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:58,900
Please don't tell my friends.

1644
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,420
So that's so sad.

1645
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:01,180
I missed.

1646
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:04,620
So you said baseball champion at school or something?

1647
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:05,900
Some story.

1648
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,780
I don't think he mentioned which sport it was.

1649
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:10,900
Yeah. So sports kid, alpha Chad kid.

1650
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:16,420
Exposed for liking and Pokemon and being good at it as well.

1651
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:17,820
Being state champ.

1652
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,460
State champ.

1653
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,740
That's that's like that's like a big deal.

1654
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:25,140
I think that's straight out of like a like a sitcom.

1655
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,300
That's situation that is.

1656
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:32,900
That's like it's like light Yagami walked into my card store

1657
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,260
and say, hey, what's up?

1658
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,580
You're going to make you finally made it to nationals

1659
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,180
in fucking Magic the Gathering.

1660
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,060
Uh, it's like, um, yeah, it is.

1661
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:45,020
That's very, that's very sitcom.

1662
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:47,300
I was pleased.

1663
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,820
That's that is cringe.

1664
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,980
That I should have been like, like, oh, my God,

1665
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,700
this guy has really good sports.

1666
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,660
He's also really good at Pokemon.

1667
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,420
That just means he would get more popular

1668
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,900
with all the kids who like Pokemon.

1669
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,100
I thought I thought it was going to be.

1670
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:04,580
I didn't think we were going to go in the like, oh, and he was like,

1671
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,660
oh, no, please don't tell anyone.

1672
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,780
Like that seems, honestly, I'm not sure I believe it.

1673
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,540
That's that's trans my credulity.

1674
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,500
Imagine being because like what if you're like fucking

1675
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,460
star quarterback or whatever, if you're Alpha Chad, why would you be

1676
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:20,820
so insecure about like being state champ at Pokemon cards?

1677
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:21,700
I mean, I don't know.

1678
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:28,100
Maybe maybe like they get pressure from the like dad to be the sports kid.

1679
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,260
And they're like, OK, dad, I'll do what you wanted to do, but couldn't.

1680
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,700
OK, I'll do it.

1681
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:33,980
Sports kid. They did.

1682
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:37,540
Yeah, yeah, they did it because they like, but maybe they don't like it.

1683
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:40,580
Maybe they hate it, but they're just that, you know, pressure to do it.

1684
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:44,860
They secretly want to be a Pokemon kid.

1685
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:48,140
You can't you can't be star quarterback and hate it that much.

1686
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,380
Right. I mean, maybe.

1687
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:52,980
I don't know. I've never played an entire sport.

1688
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,100
But yes, own it.

1689
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,540
Not owning your cringe is the cringiest thing of all.

1690
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,500
Yeah, I think we can all agree that that's true.

1691
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,700
Mm hmm.

1692
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:05,540
Um, OK, next one, men and women.

1693
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:07,380
Huh? What? What?

1694
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:09,980
I was just going to say, he should have like seeing his friends.

1695
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:11,980
He should have just given him a wink.

1696
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:16,100
It's like, yeah, you know, oh, see, I mean, seeing these nerds

1697
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,140
at the table, seeing these nerds that he recognizes from his school,

1698
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:25,100
he should have just like winked like, yeah, I mean, yeah,

1699
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:28,220
that would have been a cooler thing to do with his hair bangs.

1700
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:30,340
It would have been more based, but unfortunately,

1701
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:32,780
but, you know, that's not the world we live in.

1702
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,420
Uh, OK, men and women, three, two, one.

1703
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,220
Oh, right. Let me get the record straight.

1704
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,820
Uh, men are like,

1705
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:47,420
and when we're like, do you understand it now?

1706
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:50,100
I go, OK.

1707
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:51,660
What? What?

1708
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:56,620
What I have only before understood on a sort of emotional visceral level

1709
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:59,740
now has been put into words for me to be communicated.

1710
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:03,820
I mean, like, true.

1711
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,460
Fuck, yeah.

1712
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,900
It's true. It's always been the case.

1713
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,900
Mm hmm. That's that's just biology.

1714
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,900
That's just science.

1715
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:19,900
Um, uh, uh, oh, I want to say,

1716
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:24,300
going going back to the Chris Chan's weird DMs in in the.

1717
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:29,420
In the Chris was arguing with Endless War

1718
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,020
and it's really weird to me that she called Endless War on Twitter, Ben,

1719
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:36,140
as though, like, Endless War is not a separate entity.

1720
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:39,420
Like, I don't know why she would think that, like, Endless War is Ben.

1721
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:43,420
Like, I don't like just like, you know, she is Chris Chan Sonichu

1722
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:47,540
and like a nightstar is like a separate entity from that, you know?

1723
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,140
So I don't know why she wouldn't like they call Endless War Endless War,

1724
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:52,100
because that's his name.

1725
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,820
So that's confusing to whatever.

1726
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,820
But there's the part where she's claiming that, like, oh, no, it was the Omega timeline.

1727
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:58,140
She made some replies.

1728
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,140
I didn't read them.

1729
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:03,220
But so the Omega timeline and, you know, Endless, not me, Endless War,

1730
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:06,500
like posts a picture of the of the timeline from Slime and Punishment.

1731
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,940
And he's like, you know, the diet, it's clearly labeled.

1732
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:11,260
This is the alpha timeline.

1733
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:14,100
You know, I'm sorry, but the science just checks out on this one.

1734
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,180
And a couple of people like that and thought it was pretty funny.

1735
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:19,140
And I was like, yeah, that's pretty endless war.

1736
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,180
That's a good, good one.

1737
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,620
I like that. Endless War, like, uses Twitter.

1738
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,180
He's got like no hands.

1739
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,180
How does he do it?

1740
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,340
Endless War. Yeah. Endless War uses Twitter.

1741
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:31,820
And like until now, he mostly just retweets like cool slime.

1742
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:37,180
Like he mostly just like will just retweet anything that like is like, oh,

1743
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:39,700
yeah, that's pretty slimy. Oh, yeah, that's green. I like that.

1744
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:43,020
But, you know, now the war is on.

1745
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:46,100
So I think he might he might get a little more active snarky.

1746
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:47,900
You might. Yeah, a little bit.

1747
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:48,820
You might have a little more.

1748
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:53,180
He might have some some opinions to share at Endless War.

1749
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:54,380
I think it's at Endless War.

1750
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,380
I think it's his handle on Twitter.

1751
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,300
Follow him. He's good. He's a good boy.

1752
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:03,180
OK, next one.

1753
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:05,500
It's cringe, but it's sincere.

1754
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,460
Three, two, one, go.

1755
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:10,420
Hey, PCP.

1756
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:13,580
Just wanted to say thanks for all the content you put out over the years.

1757
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,940
Been watching some of your vids since the pony days,

1758
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,620
but only got into the podcast back in 2017

1759
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:21,980
when I got my cushy programming job.

1760
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:26,540
I binge listen to it a lot, especially when things were quieter than usual

1761
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,180
in the office, made the days a lot less monotonous.

1762
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:32,860
And I also went to the dentist for surgery the other day.

1763
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:35,020
It wasn't fun.

1764
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:38,340
More so since I had to wear full PPE because of the rona.

1765
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,460
But I was able to sneak in my phone and earphones.

1766
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,660
And I listened to one of your older episodes,

1767
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:47,020
which made the experience less terrible overall.

1768
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:51,580
So, yeah, thanks for the podcast, the videos, the comics,

1769
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:54,540
the music and the games that you all have put out.

1770
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:56,260
Really good stuff.

1771
01:27:56,260 --> 01:28:00,380
Oh, and special thanks to Ben, Tom and Gibb for holding down the fort,

1772
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:02,460
so to speak for a while.

1773
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,260
Hope the others are OK.

1774
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:06,060
That's all. Bye.

1775
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,380
That's really nice.

1776
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,260
Yeah, thank you.

1777
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,980
I got I got nothing to say other than cool.

1778
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:15,060
Sorry about the surgery.

1779
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:19,140
I myself am terrified of dentistry

1780
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,340
and surgery in specific.

1781
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:26,460
So I will have to think of something to I will have to find something

1782
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:31,220
to listen to to help me deal with that shit.

1783
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,300
Just just record your own voice,

1784
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:36,660
saying things that aren't related to dentistry and listen to that.

1785
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:42,300
Boy, I don't want to think about it.

1786
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,500
I don't think about it.

1787
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,980
OK, next.

1788
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,660
Anyway, thanks. Thank you.

1789
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:48,980
We're doing our best.

1790
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:50,540
Doing our best.

1791
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:53,140
Next up is several discontent fish.

1792
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,540
Three, two, one, go.

1793
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:59,060
Konnichiwa. God damn it.

1794
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,500
I am Osamurai.

1795
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,980
This fucking asshole.

1796
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,700
I'm a sensei of Benno Cento, sir.

1797
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:11,700
And clearly, very much a dedicated to this joke.

1798
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:19,340
Benno, son, you said the cranno no longer need you for we have

1799
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:23,300
a miscellaneous tea, son, sura pricey.

1800
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,460
It was a note on Mr.

1801
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:30,420
Teal, but to me, haha, epic to roll.

1802
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:33,540
This is a one of the two.

1803
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:37,380
Each in Osamurai revenge scheme.

1804
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:40,300
On the table, Benno, son,

1805
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:46,260
for a pale, yellow boy, you pussy for Shinobi penis.

1806
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,340
Whoa, OK, until you next time.

1807
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:51,180
Sayonara. So this has taken a turn.

1808
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,420
I mean, up until now, I thought he wanted me to come home.

1809
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:58,700
But now he's I think he's just like, nah, we're going to rape you.

1810
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,220
You took too long. That's what happened.

1811
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:05,940
I just I didn't I wanted to be.

1812
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,620
I wanted to learn ninjutsu.

1813
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:12,540
I wanted to learn ninjutsu because I saw Naruto and I was like, yeah, that.

1814
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:16,260
And I couldn't I couldn't be I couldn't I couldn't continue my samurai training.

1815
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,300
You know, it would be illegal.

1816
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,700
It would be illegal to do both.

1817
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:22,100
You know, I made I made my choice.

1818
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:26,060
And I guess, you know, there's consequences to every action.

1819
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:28,180
It's the it's equal equal and opposite.

1820
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:32,620
Newton's Third Law or whatever, supply and demand, equivalent exchange,

1821
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:39,740
all these things, the world is a fuck to bazillion dead cops.

1822
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:45,740
I like I like that the Mr. T was actually him doing a voice.

1823
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,660
And he got you.

1824
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:51,420
He must have used some sort of he must have used some sort of genjutsu

1825
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:53,820
to become Mr. T.

1826
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,980
Typical.

1827
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:00,500
Well, that's distressing.

1828
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:03,220
But just like the dentist, probably best just not to think about it.

1829
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:08,420
Next up, we got another one from from Margar,

1830
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:13,180
who was who was a shouted down and mocked mercilessly last episode

1831
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:15,940
by all by all of our esteemed guests.

1832
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:19,980
So let's hear his response to that three to one.

1833
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:26,820
Margar here, I was regretfully unable to attend the last episode of the PCP

1834
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:29,620
due to my confinement in voice jail.

1835
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,620
It's still bad in here.

1836
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:37,140
There are still rampaging bandits and marauders sent by presumably Ben St.

1837
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:40,620
But we're doing the best we can here.

1838
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:43,220
I'm starting to make friends, starting to make plays.

1839
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:47,060
Maybe I'll rise up in the ranks and we'll see what happens.

1840
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:50,860
The violent revolution did not go according to plan.

1841
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:53,180
I need more supporters.

1842
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,140
We're we're trying.

1843
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:01,900
Also, the PCP, good luck with the whole having 50 people in one episode thing.

1844
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:04,340
Let's see how that works out for you.

1845
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:09,060
I'm not sure of the plan or the idea, but maybe it'll work out.

1846
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,340
Good luck. No, it worked out.

1847
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:13,500
You you were the only victim.

1848
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:19,460
They they the the people, you know, we've split the audience.

1849
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:22,980
And that segment of the audience is very much very much pro state,

1850
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,740
you know, pro fascist police state,

1851
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:30,300
you know, anti anti liberation.

1852
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,660
You know, they do not support our prisoners rights.

1853
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:36,020
So, you know, I'm sorry, that must be very distressing for you.

1854
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,180
But it is what it is.

1855
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:44,900
And sad, give what do you say to Margarh here?

1856
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:47,300
Get on the ground.

1857
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,980
That's what I said on the ground.

1858
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,660
Yeah, give me drop and give me 50.

1859
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:52,620
Drop and give me 100.

1860
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:55,100
Good, good, good luck in there.

1861
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,900
Drop and give me a hundred dollars.

1862
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:02,060
I will send some more fucking ruffians to rough you up some more.

1863
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:06,180
If you if you would like, I can I can do I can send more of those

1864
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:09,060
or I can send the same amount of it's let let me know.

1865
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:10,820
Let me know your choice.

1866
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:15,340
Next up, quick scoper champion of PCP Minecraft.

1867
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:17,620
Three, two, one, go.

1868
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:23,460
Hey, PCP, could you please play more Minecraft service kind of that out here

1869
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:25,780
with no players online for what feels like months?

1870
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:28,660
It would be much appreciated if you streamed more frequently

1871
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:32,620
since that last stream was kind of let down for it had been a three months

1872
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:36,260
wait with the channel takedown and they just disappearing from the podcast

1873
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:37,220
without word.

1874
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,340
I really want to serve to succeed as MeronPen,

1875
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:42,380
the only admin online on the server right now have been working hard

1876
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:47,100
on adding more facilities like Pokemon centers, gyms and even more trainers

1877
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:50,300
to battle. Also, it would be pretty cool if you could advertise the server

1878
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,700
more by either mentioning it or just playing on it.

1879
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:56,860
Well, I guess this is the way I say goodbye.

1880
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:01,140
Oh, God, fucking Arceus is going to rape me.

1881
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:02,300
No, please.

1882
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:08,420
Is that what Arceus sounds like?

1883
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:10,060
I suppose so.

1884
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,580
Well, sad.

1885
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:16,140
What do you think about Minecraft server?

1886
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:18,100
I guess we should advertise it more.

1887
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,180
But like the way we advertise it.

1888
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:21,460
Yeah.

1889
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:24,100
The way we advertise it is mostly through the streams there, right?

1890
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,300
Which one was it?

1891
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,140
When did we do the last one?

1892
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:28,300
It wasn't that long ago.

1893
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:30,340
Was it? Maybe it was.

1894
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,300
It was. I think it might have been.

1895
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:35,180
I mean, let me let me let me let me let me let me let me let me.

1896
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:41,180
The Procrastinators podcast.

1897
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:45,180
I'm going to check it was we streamed it.

1898
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:49,100
One week ago, maybe it was two weeks.

1899
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,900
It was less than two weeks ago.

1900
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,380
So I don't know.

1901
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:54,780
Yeah, we went for a while without streaming.

1902
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,820
OK, we went for a while without streaming

1903
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:59,300
because we weren't using the channel because of the hack.

1904
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:04,900
I do intend to stream checkers for heckles more now.

1905
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:09,620
Maybe we could try.

1906
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,820
Maybe we should have like a meeting and see if we schedule

1907
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:14,620
like a like a regular like bi weekly thing or something.

1908
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,820
Yeah, something like that.

1909
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:20,140
I don't want to be the guy who streams again, though.

1910
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,340
How come?

1911
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:25,260
Because it's so laggy and terrible.

1912
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,780
Like, I feel like it was unwatchable.

1913
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:30,060
Hmm. I don't know.

1914
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:34,700
I mean, I I personally hate responsibility.

1915
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:38,220
But so. But I mean, if nobody else wants to do it,

1916
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:40,300
I could do I could be streamer man.

1917
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:43,540
I'm willing to I'm willing to step up and do that.

1918
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:47,100
So, yeah, let's do that.

1919
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:48,180
Let's do that soon.

1920
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,900
Oh, I don't know.

1921
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:52,500
I'll see. I'll say something in the chat later

1922
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,460
and see what the interest level is and when we can maybe

1923
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:58,180
when we can maybe get that fucking going.

1924
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:01,540
Yeah, all right. OK.

1925
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,420
Message received.

1926
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:07,380
OK, next up, I'm just being cool.

1927
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:09,860
parentheses proven.

1928
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:11,580
So let's let's see what his proof is.

1929
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:14,180
All right, three, two, one, go.

1930
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:17,220
Hey, the PCP, I recently found in real life

1931
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:20,860
in the wild an example of the I'm just being cool

1932
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:23,060
crap where if you say something enough,

1933
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:25,700
it suddenly becomes true, right?

1934
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,420
Two rights make a real.

1935
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:30,580
Yeah. And it comes in the form of this podcast,

1936
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,700
as a local podcast, W-A-T-P.

1937
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,340
Who are these podcasts?

1938
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:36,540
W-A-T-P in the morning, everybody.

1939
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:41,100
That podcast has a bit at the end where, you know,

1940
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,460
basic conceit in case you're not familiar.

1941
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:46,660
If they review podcasts, they review podcasts each week.

1942
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:50,740
And basically, I've heard of the show kind of.

1943
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:53,660
And they do this thing at the end of the week

1944
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:57,180
or at the end of the show where it's the teaser for next week.

1945
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,740
Right. So they play like they play this drop.

1946
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,460
They play this like 10 or 20 second drop

1947
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:05,340
and then a couple of seconds from the show they were reviewing next week.

1948
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:10,940
And the joke is that the host, Carl, says to every guest who comes on,

1949
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:14,380
you know, explains it to them in great detail,

1950
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,500
as if everyone doesn't already know what a teaser is.

1951
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:21,860
And then proclaims insistently that this is the best part.

1952
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,300
Everyone looks forward to this.

1953
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,980
This is their favorite part, and he gets, you know, voice mails.

1954
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:30,140
And over the course of listening to this podcast,

1955
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:32,340
it just got funnier and funnier until it just.

1956
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:33,820
I love the teaser.

1957
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:35,740
And ironically, next week's teaser, I love.

1958
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:36,780
He made it. He made it true.

1959
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:38,020
Next week's teaser. It's great.

1960
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,060
OK, folks, see you later.

1961
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:47,420
Yeah, you just you just insist hard enough for long enough.

1962
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,300
And it becomes funny to do it.

1963
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:53,100
And if you do it ironically, you'll start to do it unironically.

1964
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:54,500
This is this is this is.

1965
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:57,980
Yeah, this is this is the theory behind I'm just being cool.

1966
01:37:58,060 --> 01:37:59,540
It's it's it works.

1967
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:02,700
It works in every it works in literally every situation.

1968
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:05,580
It's it's it's the secret, you know.

1969
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:08,300
I should start saying that in real life.

1970
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,500
I'm just being cool.

1971
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,500
Yeah.

1972
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,620
I don't, you know, I would say it in real life,

1973
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:14,340
but I rarely have the opportunity to.

1974
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:17,420
I know, it's the sort of thing where, like, you have to be caught

1975
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:21,340
doing something that people like, hey, what are you doing?

1976
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:25,220
And then you rip up with, hey, I'm just being cool.

1977
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:31,060
I mean, no, I guess I feel like I would say that if someone

1978
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:33,940
criticized me, I guess I just don't get criticized enough.

1979
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:36,780
And that's a big problem.

1980
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:38,460
That means I'm not pushing the envelope.

1981
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:43,780
Well, maybe maybe the trick is is not to wait until they say something

1982
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:44,980
because people try to be nice.

1983
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:48,180
They don't want to say they'll give you a weird look and they'll think something,

1984
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:49,900
but they won't like say anything.

1985
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:52,500
So you just need to like, as soon as anyone walks in the room,

1986
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:57,260
you just insist that I'm being cool before they even have a chance to

1987
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:59,460
like, like, like think anything.

1988
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:04,860
It's like they walk in the room and you're like, hey, hey, I'm just being cool.

1989
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:08,620
And it like it would seem like, why is he saying that?

1990
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:09,660
It seems suspicious.

1991
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:12,260
But you do it long enough and people will be like, yeah, he's just being cool.

1992
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:17,180
You know, you know, I got the, you know, actually.

1993
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:20,380
Got a little I got a little I got a little drunk the other day.

1994
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:24,340
I got a little sauce hanging out with some friends, got a little silly,

1995
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:25,460
got a little stupid.

1996
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:29,540
Honestly, that would have been a great time for me to bust out the, hey, guys,

1997
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:31,140
I'm just being cool.

1998
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:32,020
But I didn't.

1999
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:35,660
I don't think I did, but it would have been super funny.

2000
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:37,660
So I'm going to have to keep that in mind.

2001
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:39,780
I'm going to keep that in mind for next time.

2002
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,940
Next time I'm next time I act to the fool.

2003
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,700
I will, in fact, I'm just throwing sand.

2004
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:46,660
I'm just being cool.

2005
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:48,060
And that's all you need to know.

2006
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,940
Stop thinking about it, you idiot.

2007
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:53,700
Yeah, it's a great line.

2008
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,380
If you, hey, viewers, listeners, if you have ever,

2009
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:01,900
if you have ever been criticized and just said, no, no, no, I'm just being cool.

2010
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:06,620
Let us know how it worked, because I'm sure that it will.

2011
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:08,060
I guarantee it'll get you out of it.

2012
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,220
It'll get you out of a jam.

2013
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:11,780
They'll go, oh, I see.

2014
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:13,980
I apologize.

2015
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,020
Excuse me.

2016
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:18,780
You go to a protest and you say to the police, no, no, I'm just being cool.

2017
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:20,340
I'm being cool.

2018
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:22,340
They're like, oh, I guess he's being cool.

2019
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:24,460
Damn, well, I don't want to be uncool.

2020
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:27,180
You know, trans rights.

2021
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:29,420
That's what they'll say.

2022
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:31,780
Um, yeah.

2023
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:35,780
So anyway, being cool base, not being cool cringe.

2024
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:40,740
Next up, centrist voicemail three, two, one, go.

2025
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:47,340
If the establishment, right, labor unions, corporations,

2026
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:54,820
inter trade established black lists, you know what I mean?

2027
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:59,660
Like if they all agree on something and they want to enforce their will

2028
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:05,260
upon the workers of America, for example, they won't give you a job.

2029
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,620
If you don't take the COVID-19 vaccine

2030
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:14,540
already happening on Australia, already talking about it,

2031
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:18,420
they might as well be like a form of government

2032
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:21,220
because they own the means of production.

2033
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:25,500
And if you can't get a job, you can't produce anything.

2034
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:30,100
So you can't create value, which is required to live.

2035
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:39,460
So in conclusion, we need to control the private corporations

2036
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:42,940
and keep them from infringing upon our First Amendment rights

2037
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,540
and our body autonomy.

2038
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:50,820
Yeah. I mean, I agree.

2039
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:53,180
I agree with that.

2040
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:57,300
Um, is that centrist or is that a joke?

2041
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:02,740
It's, um, I don't know.

2042
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:03,420
Yeah, I don't know.

2043
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,300
I don't know if I would characterize it as centrist.

2044
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:09,500
That seems like it's an anti-capitalist thing to say.

2045
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:13,260
That's like your anti, you want to limit the power of big business.

2046
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:14,260
You want to regulate them.

2047
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:17,380
That seems like, I mean, it's liberal.

2048
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:20,700
It's it's like, you know, it's still like, OK, well, we're pro

2049
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:24,380
business, just we can't we can't let them do these specific things.

2050
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:30,220
I don't know. Um, I mean, yeah, people people give like,

2051
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:33,780
you know, like you're an Ann Cap or whatever, you're a fucking

2052
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:37,580
you're a fucking Libertarian or whatever.

2053
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:41,420
You're like, uh, companies are not the government.

2054
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:44,260
You know, companies are not bound by the Constitution.

2055
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:49,100
Company like a corporation, you know, it's they're a private enterprise.

2056
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:51,420
They can run their business however they want.

2057
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:56,700
And like on some level, I guess that makes sense, but on a practical level,

2058
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:01,940
like what if you what if you live in a society just for example, where the

2059
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:06,620
government is relatively weak and private corporations are relatively strong

2060
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:10,900
in terms of like influence they have over people's lives and the like the

2061
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:15,260
practical effect of the way that they run their businesses is that, you know,

2062
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:18,740
people are in effect having their freedoms limited, right?

2063
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:22,580
Like people are, I mean, I think people probably should take the vaccine

2064
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:25,540
if they if they if it works.

2065
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:29,820
But like, you know, if the if a corporation is basically

2066
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:34,540
basically making it impossible for someone not to do something that only

2067
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:37,180
affects them and should be up to them, but they can't do it because they live

2068
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:39,940
in a world that's controlled by fucking private interests and private

2069
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:44,140
interests are wielding their power to, to, you know, influence society

2070
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:47,100
in all these unjust ways, then you what is the what is the difference

2071
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:49,380
between that and living under a tyrannical government?

2072
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:55,100
Like there basically is none, you know, like maybe they don't control

2073
01:43:55,100 --> 01:44:00,740
the police, but if the police exist to protect their interests, which they do

2074
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:05,220
to a greater degree than they protect anyone else's interests, then effectively

2075
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:09,740
they have the private industry has police on their side and other people don't.

2076
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:13,540
And that's been the way it's been for a long time, you know, police will like

2077
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:18,860
police have been employed to, you know, break up, break up strikes and like,

2078
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:23,340
yeah, like fucking bust skulls of like unions and stuff and like, you know,

2079
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:26,740
get people working, declare strikes illegal and then like, you know,

2080
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:28,900
attack protesters or whatever. This happens.

2081
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,540
This is the world we live in.

2082
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:35,260
So I yeah, I guess I would agree.

2083
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:37,700
And I don't think that your voicemail is all that centrist.

2084
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:40,660
And I can't tell I can tell that you're joking to some degree,

2085
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:44,460
but I don't know if it's just the native of what you were saying,

2086
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:46,780
or if it was just the name of the voicemail.

2087
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:50,340
I don't know how much of it was a joke and I apologize.

2088
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:54,900
OK, any anything to say about that?

2089
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:57,740
Yeah, I generally agree.

2090
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:01,260
I don't really know how like I would

2091
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:05,580
like my exact stance on this this issue.

2092
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:09,820
But like when I see big company, I say I hate you.

2093
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:12,460
So that's that's my stance.

2094
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:14,500
I mean, everybody big company.

2095
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,260
I'm like, you should be smaller than that.

2096
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:18,500
You shouldn't have that power.

2097
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:22,020
Every everybody agrees that like monopolies are bad.

2098
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:25,740
Everybody will agree to that on paper, but then they'll be like, oh, well,

2099
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:29,700
you know, you can't like you can't like nationalize Amazon.

2100
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,300
You can't like buy out Amazon.

2101
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:32,300
You can't split that up.

2102
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:33,900
You can't like bust that trust.

2103
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:35,580
Everybody loves Teddy Roosevelt.

2104
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:36,660
He was a trust buster.

2105
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:38,300
He was a monopoly breaker.

2106
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,460
Everybody thinks that was great.

2107
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:43,900
But you suggest doing that today and the end caps like, no, you just want to

2108
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:45,500
you just want to take Jeff Bezos's money.

2109
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:48,060
He earned that you just want to steal people's money and give it to people

2110
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:49,860
that don't work, like, shut up.

2111
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:56,460
You know, even just saying that like you want to steal

2112
01:45:56,860 --> 01:46:01,020
somebody who works his money and give it to people who don't work as if

2113
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,740
like Jeff Bezos is working like 10 billion times.

2114
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:06,060
Not even that. Not even that.

2115
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:11,620
It's it's it's it's as if like, like, I don't know, working is

2116
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:13,860
tantamount to deserving to exist.

2117
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:18,740
Right. Some people like can't work as much.

2118
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:19,420
I don't know.

2119
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:22,980
Like, should you kill a disabled person just because they can't work?

2120
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,860
I mean, they're not contributing to the economy.

2121
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,660
Yeah, I mean, that's the argument.

2122
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:33,340
It's frankly, it's unethical for you to expect us not to kill them

2123
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:35,860
when they're a drain on everyone else's resources.

2124
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:38,460
That's a joke, by the way.

2125
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:41,260
This is this is this is this is my straw man.

2126
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:45,660
Uh, you know, I'm just fine.

2127
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:46,460
Final thought about this.

2128
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:47,460
I think about this a lot.

2129
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:52,660
It's like, OK, you kind of like people, people like libertarians and caps.

2130
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:57,860
They're like, oh, you know, socialism bad because socialism is totalitarianism.

2131
01:46:57,860 --> 01:47:01,060
You have to give the government all this power to do all this stuff.

2132
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:04,660
And if the government has that much power, they'll be authoritarian.

2133
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:10,460
It'll be tyranny and like, OK, in theory, I understand that concern.

2134
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:14,260
But if you if you like what you basically have, you have to balance

2135
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:17,660
the power of like private industry versus the government.

2136
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:20,860
And I understand that a government can become tyrannical,

2137
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:25,260
but at least the government in theory, at least in theory of the way

2138
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:28,460
we construct it these days has some sort of check and balance

2139
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:31,260
in the form of like people can be voted into and out of office.

2140
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,660
And you know, that's a little blurry now because money

2141
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:37,060
because like money is so involved in politics that like, you know,

2142
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:40,560
that it's kind of you can sort of buy an election and that's bad.

2143
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,060
Don't get me wrong.

2144
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:41,860
That is bad.

2145
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:45,960
But in theory, if it wasn't wasn't like that, if it were harder to just buy

2146
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:49,760
an election, then it would probably be better if the government had power

2147
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:53,260
versus had more power than private industry, because private industry

2148
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:56,260
has no checks and balances, whatever, just some guy owns it

2149
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:58,360
or some people own it and they can just do whatever they want.

2150
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:02,160
They're not beholden to anyone except their shareholders versus at least

2151
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,760
in theory, the government is like, okay, well, if they're bad,

2152
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:06,060
we can unelect them.

2153
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:10,260
That's how it should be, you know, so there.

2154
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:15,360
I mean, a private company is basically it's basically just a little

2155
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:17,860
a little like monarchy.

2156
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:24,260
It's just a little like fucking tiny or not even it's just an isolated

2157
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:28,060
little pocket of like feudalism where like one guy owns everyone below them,

2158
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:31,760
you know, for eight hours a day, five days a week or whatever.

2159
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,760
That's that's what a private company is.

2160
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:37,560
Most of the time you live in a feudal a feudal

2161
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,160
place.

2162
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:45,160
I don't can't think of the words that you would use to describe

2163
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:52,660
what it is that we us surfdom of Hamlet do radical base.

2164
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:53,160
Yes.

2165
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,160
Yes, surfdom, dudes.

2166
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:56,860
Okay.

2167
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:57,660
All right.

2168
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:59,460
I spent a long time on that one, but you know what?

2169
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,360
It was worth it.

2170
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:06,760
Next one, if we're ready for it is called bring Nate back and I can't wait.

2171
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,460
Three, two, one, go.

2172
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:14,560
Hey, guys, is it just me or is Nate hella cute?

2173
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:15,360
Haha.

2174
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,060
No homo though.

2175
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:21,360
Why does Nate have the cutest laugh on the PCP law?

2176
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:24,760
I don't know.

2177
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:28,660
I just I do like it.

2178
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:32,160
I do like it when I can make Nate laugh like uproariously.

2179
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:33,460
Yeah.

2180
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:35,160
Yeah.

2181
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:37,760
I mean, I like it when I can make anyone laugh, but it is funny.

2182
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:38,060
Hmm.

2183
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,560
Uh, sure.

2184
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:40,460
Uh, sure.

2185
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:45,160
I mean, yeah, I guess I can't really disagree with this guy's point.

2186
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:51,460
He's got that little like like like when he's trying when he's trying not like

2187
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:55,060
I can't fucking do what I'm thinking if you listen to it.

2188
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:59,460
It's like when he's trying like if I'm saying something funny or like

2189
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:02,460
he's listening to something funny and he's starting he's starting to laugh,

2190
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:06,760
but he's not letting himself like explode yet and he's got the he and then he

2191
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:10,560
starts when I think when I think of Nate's when I think of Nate's laugh.

2192
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:15,160
I think of like when he's like sort of he's laughing and he's genuinely laughing,

2193
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:21,360
but he's sort of like he's sort of like putting on a little bit of a an air

2194
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:21,760
about it.

2195
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:24,660
He's sort of like sort of making a joke out of the laugh by sort of turning

2196
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:27,960
it into a cackle where he goes like or something.

2197
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,060
That's not a real laugh.

2198
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:32,860
It's the real the real I usually get the impression that there is genuine

2199
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:36,960
mirth there, but it's also he is affecting it a little bit like for a bit.

2200
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:39,660
Uh, that that's more of like a aha.

2201
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:43,060
Yes, I I see that was a joke sort of laugh.

2202
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:43,760
Hmm.

2203
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:44,260
Hmm.

2204
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,260
Yes, indeed.

2205
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:47,960
That's that's that the same sort of energy.

2206
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:49,960
Perhaps perhaps.

2207
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,060
Um, cutie though, major, major cutie pie that Nate Bestman.

2208
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:57,060
Right.

2209
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:58,660
Frankly, a huge audience straw.

2210
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:03,460
And you know, without him, just, you know, property values of tanking.

2211
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,760
Uh, I even stock market crash.

2212
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:08,460
And I think it's because Nate hasn't been on the PCP in a while.

2213
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,060
Where's Nate Giggling?

2214
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:12,160
We need Nate Giggling on the PCP.

2215
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,660
Yes, please.

2216
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:19,460
Um, next one is from not a vampire.

2217
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:24,060
Who, um, I should mention, I'll, I'll put a link in the description.

2218
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:29,860
Not a vampire made a video about me called the emotional genius of Ben

2219
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:33,560
Saint, which is a little embarrassing because I feel like self aggrandizing

2220
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:36,860
to say that out loud, but it weren't, wasn't my words.

2221
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:37,860
It was their words.

2222
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:39,760
And so I liked that video.

2223
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:45,260
It was very, um, uh, explain a, you know, a very analysis.

2224
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:49,760
At first when I saw it, I was like, Oh, well, someone is praising me.

2225
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:50,660
Excellent.

2226
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:54,760
And I retweeted it, but I didn't watch it because I was like, I'm too embarrassed.

2227
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:57,560
I'm too embarrassed to watch this video and hear what they're actually

2228
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:58,360
saying about me.

2229
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:02,160
I'm just going to assume that it's fine and put it out there and not watch it.

2230
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:04,960
But I, I, I eventually was, I got curious.

2231
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,760
I cracked, I did watch it and I was like, Oh, wow.

2232
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:09,260
Oh, it's actually pretty nice.

2233
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:10,660
Not that embarrassing.

2234
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:15,860
I guess I, you know, I, am I allowed to say I agree with the points made?

2235
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:17,860
Uh, I thought it was good.

2236
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:20,560
It was, it was well, well written.

2237
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:20,860
Yeah.

2238
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:26,260
It was very, it was very personal, but like, um, the analysis was like easy

2239
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:29,360
to understand from that perspective, why they think these things.

2240
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:32,960
I'm like, yeah, I kind of feel that way too about Magda and stuff.

2241
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:34,260
Yeah.

2242
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:35,060
Yeah.

2243
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:35,660
It made sense.

2244
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:37,760
Uh, so anyway, link in the description.

2245
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,560
Go check that out, but let's hear the voicemail.

2246
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:42,460
Three, two, one, go.

2247
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:44,360
This question is for Ben.

2248
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:47,860
So a couple of us, let's go in the personal finance podcast.

2249
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:51,660
You said that to you gender was just language.

2250
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:55,760
So by that definition, do you consider yourself a gender by default?

2251
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:57,260
Hmm.

2252
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:03,260
Um, well, depends on what you mean by default.

2253
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:08,660
I would get, well, you, you grow up in a world that it says boys and girls do

2254
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:12,160
this and that, and you just sort of go with what you're told.

2255
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:15,660
And then you continue on in that way without thinking.

2256
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:20,360
So like kind of, I guess it depends on your upbringing.

2257
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:22,260
Yeah.

2258
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:24,960
I would, yeah, I wouldn't say it's automatic.

2259
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:30,560
I would say generally most people will find themselves kind of slotted

2260
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,960
into a group and just kind of go with that and that'll be their gender.

2261
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,560
So that's sort of by default.

2262
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:41,960
Um, I think no, I like, if our language was constructed

2263
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:47,760
differently and like it wasn't required to refer to someone in a gendered way

2264
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:51,260
with pronouns, like if pronouns just didn't work the way they do, I think

2265
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:57,360
maybe gender would not be automatic and, and, um, people would be, and people

2266
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:02,060
would maybe be more gender neutral by default because I, I do think that

2267
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:05,960
it is mostly just about the language used.

2268
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:11,860
Um, and so the way our language is constructed, you know, affects it.

2269
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:13,460
Yeah.

2270
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:19,960
Like, like even just titles like boy and girl, like you're necessarily, I mean,

2271
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:24,960
when you're young, you certainly don't need to be split up because you're kids.

2272
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:31,060
You don't know anything, but like, uh, there's, there's definitely arguments

2273
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:35,960
to be made for like the separation for like teenage years.

2274
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:37,460
It's a bit weird.

2275
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:37,960
Yeah.

2276
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,560
Uh, yeah.

2277
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:41,160
Yeah.

2278
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:43,960
Um, sure.

2279
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:50,360
But it's, uh, oh, there was this guy in my Twitch chat at one point who was arguing.

2280
01:54:51,460 --> 01:55:02,260
Um, he was arguing about like, uh, it was something about like free the

2281
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:04,660
nipple, like girls should be able.

2282
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:08,360
I saw, I saw some screenshots of this guy.

2283
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:09,460
Oh yeah.

2284
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:12,060
Um, and Kazi showed me Kazi.

2285
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:12,360
Yeah.

2286
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:17,660
Um, she was in there and arguing with him and it was like, I saw what he was going

2287
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:24,860
for, but he was just sort of arguing from a point of like, like status quo is

2288
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:28,860
what is like, like a circular logic, sort of the status quo is this.

2289
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:34,160
Therefore, this is the status quo that I like, and I don't want it to change.

2290
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:41,960
And he wouldn't like accept that maybe it could be better if it were to be changed.

2291
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:46,360
And he's like, but no, it's that I don't like it because this is how it is.

2292
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:48,060
And it should stay this way.

2293
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:53,260
And you just wouldn't like, he wouldn't concede that potentially there is benefit

2294
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:56,660
in changing how the, how the, you know, the current system.

2295
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:01,960
I feel like most people have that sort of viewpoint where like they imagine that

2296
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:06,960
if, you know, people talking about changing society in certain ways

2297
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:10,860
would be like a snap of the fingers and then suddenly everything is different

2298
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:12,460
and everything they knew was a lie.

2299
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:13,760
Yeah.

2300
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:16,960
And you'll go to jail and you'll go to jail if you don't agree with it.

2301
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:17,460
Yeah.

2302
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:21,160
And it's like, it's sort of like, oh my God, I don't want anything to change

2303
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:24,560
because stuff could bad happen to me.

2304
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:29,060
And it's like, it's not, it's not really about like it happening right now.

2305
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:35,460
It's about like, could you consider a future in which, you know, hypothetically,

2306
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,160
this is the system.

2307
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,060
You don't have to live in it.

2308
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:43,060
But like, could you accept that there may be benefits?

2309
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:44,560
Yeah.

2310
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,360
Like maybe we could try to go in that.

2311
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:51,260
Like it's, it's one thing to be like, there's a real lack of imagination

2312
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:52,760
going around.

2313
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:55,960
A lot of people are just, yeah, it's no imagination.

2314
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,760
Visceral, like negative reactions to things are like understandable.

2315
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:04,860
Like we all understand that if you grow up in a society that says this,

2316
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:08,760
then this other thing that is completely new and alien to you is going to like

2317
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:09,560
be the wrong way.

2318
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:13,060
You're going to be like freaked out and scared by it because the unknown is scary.

2319
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,660
So it's like, I get it.

2320
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:19,760
But like, you got to look past that at some point and understand that you're

2321
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,260
always going to be scared of stuff.

2322
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:25,560
You don't know what it is and you can't know for sure that any certain thing

2323
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:31,460
anything like is like certain bad or good until you think about it.

2324
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:36,060
And if you never think about it, you just like, oh, I what man turned into woman?

2325
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:36,860
That's gross.

2326
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:37,960
That's gross.

2327
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:39,860
Yes.

2328
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:43,460
It grosses me out.

2329
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:44,760
It's yucky.

2330
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:48,160
It's yucky and they dye their hair and I don't, and I think that's stupid.

2331
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:56,960
Um, I feel like I feel like I could say more about that.

2332
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:05,760
It's like, um, it's it's like that that guy was saying like, um, the nipple should

2333
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:12,860
be not free because it's because I would get aroused by seeing female nipples

2334
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:15,860
and I don't want that and that's not fair.

2335
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:20,460
That's like, it's violent against me for like women to show their nipples

2336
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:23,660
because it will cause this something to happen to me that I do not want to

2337
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,160
happen.

2338
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:27,860
Well, yeah, it's it's his argument was that he would make people feel

2339
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:33,660
uncomfortable if people walked around naked half naked and it's like true.

2340
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:40,660
You know, if they did it right now, if people lived up, grew up in a world

2341
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:47,660
where, you know, um, that the the the chair, like a bare chest of a person

2342
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:49,960
is not inherently scary.

2343
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:54,860
Like a human person, a man can have a bare chest and you don't really think

2344
01:58:54,860 --> 01:58:55,160
about it.

2345
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:57,260
You're just like, oh, it's must be a hot day.

2346
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:59,960
You know, he's taking a shirt off.

2347
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,960
Um, and a woman doing that is completely different, but it isn't completely

2348
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,360
different.

2349
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:10,460
It's just society has taught us that is it is completely different and because

2350
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:12,160
it's completely different, it's different.

2351
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:13,260
It's strange.

2352
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:13,660
It's new.

2353
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:14,660
It's fearful.

2354
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:16,360
You get scared of the idea.

2355
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:21,260
I mean, the argument he was putting forth was, you know, Boner City, which

2356
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:23,160
I was like, why, why was that be a bad thing?

2357
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:26,160
But like, I understand that some people don't don't want that.

2358
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:26,760
Right.

2359
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:28,260
So like uncomfortableness.

2360
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:34,060
It's it's like an inevitability of a society where it would be uncomfortable

2361
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:36,460
to do a thing, but you got to think of the inheritance.

2362
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,760
Like what is inherently wrong with that?

2363
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:40,560
What, why is it uncomfortable?

2364
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,860
And you got to think of like similar things that are not a problem.

2365
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:47,660
And why are they not a problem is because society has put that in there.

2366
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:51,860
Like, oh, we, you know, somebody doesn't wear a hat.

2367
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:53,360
Well, that's normal.

2368
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:55,460
We used to all wear hats.

2369
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:58,860
It used to be like seen as like stupid to not wear a hat.

2370
01:59:59,260 --> 01:59:59,760
Yeah.

2371
01:59:59,760 --> 01:59:59,960
Yeah.

2372
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:00,460
Yeah.

2373
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:03,560
And it's like society can change.

2374
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:06,360
It's just we don't inherently need hats.

2375
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:10,660
We don't inherently need to wear things on our chests when it's hot.

2376
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:16,360
I mean, this guy, if this guy were a frickin if this guy were a frickin Muslim,

2377
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:20,760
would he be in this chat being like it's it's wrong for women not to like wear

2378
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:24,460
the hijab because it's like it's like it's too tempting.

2379
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:25,960
Like it's too tempting for men.

2380
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:29,060
They'll get boners seeing like pretty girl faces and that's violence.

2381
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:30,660
That's violence against me.

2382
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:32,160
It's the same argument.

2383
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:33,660
It's literally the same.

2384
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:38,360
I think he was like saying Muslims have the right idea at some point.

2385
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:38,960
Oh, God.

2386
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:39,560
Okay.

2387
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:39,860
Cool.

2388
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:40,360
But I don't know.

2389
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:42,860
I don't know how much he was joking about that because I wasn't really paying

2390
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:43,760
too much attention.

2391
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:44,760
Sure.

2392
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:45,360
Sure.

2393
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:47,160
I was busy drawing.

2394
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,460
I don't want to shit on that guy, by the way.

2395
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:53,460
He's I don't think he's like like a terrible person.

2396
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:57,460
I just think he's not thinking about this very hard.

2397
02:00:57,460 --> 02:01:01,560
Well, I, Cassie was annoyed about it and she was complaining about it to me

2398
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:04,860
and I was like, hmm, sounds pretty annoying.

2399
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:06,660
It was pretty annoying.

2400
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:07,360
I mean, sure.

2401
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:07,860
Sure.

2402
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:09,560
I mean, people are allowed to have bad opinions.

2403
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:11,860
I think that's a pretty bad opinion, but you know, whatever.

2404
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:13,760
Yeah, whatever.

2405
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:14,260
It's fine.

2406
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:17,060
No, no biggie.

2407
02:01:18,860 --> 02:01:19,960
Um, well, fuck.

2408
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:21,260
We're at the end.

2409
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:22,560
That's all the voice mails.

2410
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:23,660
We made it.

2411
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:30,360
Well, thanks for, thanks for listening to another low energy to man to two

2412
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:33,560
man, to person, to person.

2413
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:34,760
Lol.

2414
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:38,060
It's very strange.

2415
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:41,960
Man turned into woman.

2416
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:42,960
That's gross.

2417
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:46,360
Disgusting.

2418
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:48,760
I've turned into woman.

2419
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:49,760
I'd just be strange.

2420
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:50,860
I'd be halfway there.

2421
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:52,460
I'd be halfway.

2422
02:01:53,260 --> 02:02:00,260
I'd be non-binary and I'm on my way and I'm feeling, feeling, feeling real gay.

2423
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:03,160
Um, that's, uh, that's the show, everybody.

2424
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:03,860
Yeah.

2425
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:11,160
Go, go to, uh, before PCP, go to give and take dot site where I might, but by this

2426
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:14,760
point, I may have the, no, wait, I may, I don't know.

2427
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:18,860
Go to, go to medibang.com, read the Clarissa, buy it if you want.

2428
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:20,960
How do they, how do they find it on medibang?

2429
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:22,560
Um, link in the description.

2430
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,060
Link in, link in the description.

2431
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:27,560
I think if you go to medibang and you look for the Tezca contest, you can just

2432
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:32,360
look at the submissions and then I'm, I think I'm on page two, uh, of the most

2433
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:34,960
recent submissions because there's been a lot already.

2434
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,360
Like, so there's the last few days.

2435
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:39,660
So it's like a, everyone's submitting right at the late, the end.

2436
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:40,660
Right.

2437
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:41,360
Yeah.

2438
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:42,160
Makes sense.

2439
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:46,560
Um, there's like all these voicemails come in and like the last 24 hours before

2440
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,460
the show, haha.

2441
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,860
Uh, it's, it's, uh, it's crunch time.

2442
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:50,860
It's crunch time, baby.

2443
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:51,360
All right.

2444
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:52,360
Cool.

2445
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:54,660
Um, well, hey, bonus episodes.

2446
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:56,860
Oh God, we didn't do a bonus episode this month.

2447
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:57,460
Did we?

2448
02:02:58,060 --> 02:02:58,560
Did we not?

2449
02:02:58,960 --> 02:02:59,960
I don't remember.

2450
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:01,260
I don't remember either.

2451
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,260
We'll figure it out.

2452
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:02,960
We'll figure it out.

2453
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,760
Uh, bonnet, but there's like, um, there's like fucking 30 plus bonus episodes for

2454
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:11,460
your enjoyment on, uh, patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

2455
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:12,460
Is it the procrastinators?

2456
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:13,560
Is it TP procrastinators?

2457
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:15,860
No, it's the procrastinators on Patreon.

2458
02:03:16,060 --> 02:03:20,360
The procrastinators, uh, for only $5, you can get in on that.

2459
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:22,660
It is cheap as free almost.

2460
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:26,360
Uh, it is cheap as free except for the money.

2461
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:29,460
Except for the little bit of money that has to change hands in order to make that

2462
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:29,960
happen.

2463
02:03:30,460 --> 02:03:35,060
Um, yeah, send us a voicemail, scrap on Patreon, uh, join the Minecraft server.

2464
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:38,460
Link in the description to the Minecraft server, which we will, we will stream

2465
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:38,960
again.

2466
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:43,960
Uh, I'll, I'll say definitely, definitely we will do it during the month of

2467
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:45,860
September, uh, for sure.

2468
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:48,760
May hope I would like to do it twice during the month of September.

2469
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,660
Yeah, twice.

2470
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:50,760
It should be easy.

2471
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:51,360
Yeah.

2472
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:51,860
Okay.

2473
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:55,160
So let's, let's, let's, let's soft commit to that.

2474
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:56,760
Um, all right.

2475
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,160
And thanks for listening, everyone.

2476
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:00,760
And I'll see you, uh, in the next one.

2477
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:03,760
Uh, uh, peace and love.

2478
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:05,260
Bye.

2479
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:07,560
Goodbye.
