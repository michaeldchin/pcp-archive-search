1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Hey, it's Digibro here. This big group decompression chamber was recorded by me, Tom Oliver, Best

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,300
Guy Ever, and Ben Saint a few nights ago. Originally, it was going to be a decompression

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:22,760
let's play video. The entire thing was recorded set to Ben playing a game called Dungeon Crawl

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:32,240
Stone Soup, which is this really unbelievably complicated and difficult to sort of parse

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:40,580
dungeon crawler roguelike game. We were just watching him play it while having this incredibly

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:46,120
lengthy discussion. Unfortunately, the video component of that was lost. All the footage

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,680
of Ben playing this game was lost to the ether, which is really unfortunate because a lot

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,240
of what Ben says in this is him reacting to things that have just happened in the game

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,920
when he speaks up every once in a while. We also addressed the game kind of explaining

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,920
it and what it looks like early on. This game is so esoteric and the visuals are so incredibly

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,280
minimal and bare bones and sort of difficult to even parse if you're watching from a distance

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,840
as I was while Ben was playing that losing the visuals isn't as big of a deal and most

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,640
of what Ben is reacting to he explains since it would not be even interpretable in the

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,640
video anyways. So yeah, I don't think we lost too very much. I hope that's the case anyways

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,600
and that you'll enjoy listening to this even without the video component, but if you want

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,160
to just maybe look at some videos of what Dungeon Crawlstone's Stone Soup looks like,

17
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,960
you'll be able to get an understanding of what we mean when we talk about it in the

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,200
few times that we do. But yeah, mostly this is three hours of totally unrelated discussion

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,000
about a broad range of topics and it was really fun and I hope you like it.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,440
Hey everyone, it's Radcon2 and everyone else fell asleep before getting the Pleeve and

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:21,960
the Weeb done, so me, Ben St, best guy ever, Tom Oliver, and Digi Bro, we're all up in

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:31,080
his room and I'm showing them my favorite game of all time, Dungeon Crawlstone Soup,

23
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,920
the coolest game ever that I spent a year and a half trying to beat and I'm going to

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,600
be playing it and we're going to just... How long is the session of this game? Are you

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,240
going to lose a bunch of time? Okay, there's no way I'll win. Winning takes like 20 hours,

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,840
so I will just see how far I can get in however long we feel like going. Alright, so in this

27
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,640
game you pick a race in the class and I'm going to go with a favorite, I'm going to be

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,880
a gargoyle Earth Elementalist. I bet. Just out of curiosity, you haven't played this

29
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,120
game in a while. Yeah. Have there been major updates? I haven't, yeah, I mean I don't know

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,520
what they are, but I'm sure there have been some. Okay. So yes. Ben's plenty loud, we'll

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,200
turn that more towards us. Okay. Alright, so I've got my, I've got down in the bottom

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,800
right, I've got my equipment and shit up in the top right and my stats here in the middle

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,520
is the map. It's black, missing pixels. This looks completely incomprehensible. See, I'm

34
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,000
exploring the map. Wait, you're playing? I am playing right now. This is, this is the

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,560
major game. This is the game. This is the game. What the fuck? Emphasis on the gay.

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,640
I just have to, okay, I'm going to sort of have my spell situation. I really like retro

37
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,280
aesthetics, but I have my limits in terms of how primitive you can get before I just

38
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,280
kind of feel like- I think we're going to have to lean up, Tom, to be heard. I feel

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,880
like this is so old it predates my interest. This is an old ass game that has been continually

40
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,200
in development. It's not even that it looks old, it just is minimal as fuck. It just reads

41
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,400
as archaic to me. I mean, minimal. Ben played a lot of dwarf, whatever. I mean, what, what

42
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,600
era does this make you think of, Tom? I don't know, it just feels like MS-DOS era. It makes

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,120
me feel like 95. I'm trying to remember what my- Maybe it's a win 95 port of a DOS game.

44
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I'm just thinking of video games that came out in 1995, most

45
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,760
of which are far more advanced than this. Right. Well, that's why I said DOS. I'm thinking

46
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,360
like something that started development in like 89 or something. I got a port to Windows

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,000
95 when DOS was like dying. Like Doom was a DOS game, right? Doom was a virtually a DOS

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,360
game. I feel like in 95, I played a lot of games that were out long before 95 because

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,200
we had a shitty computer. I didn't play any computer games ever again. And we didn't have

50
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,200
a console until, well, we might have had like a Super Nintendo at that time, I guess. My

51
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,280
history of video games was stupid as fuck. Yeah. I actually forget how to cast spells,

52
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,560
which is going to be a real problem for me. Shameful. Wait, what's that? Explain to me

53
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,360
what your role is, what your class is, and how you plan on winning. He's a man made of

54
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,360
rocks that throws rocks at people. Well, I don't just throw rocks. I'm an Earth Elementalist.

55
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,200
So I have a collection. I have, down here, I have 20 stones. I'm going to consume these

56
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,640
stones in order to cast stone spells. Everything you just said. Throw rocks. Whoa, what the

57
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,400
fuck was all that? That was auto-exploring. Okay, I found a goblin. What is this? The

58
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,680
game plays itself. Okay, okay. What is this nightmare reality you've sucked me into? Is

59
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,600
this door fortress too? Oh, I don't even, I don't actually know those spells. Oh my

60
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,320
god, how the fuck do I learn spells? The mouse is just sitting in the middle of the screen

61
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,200
and he doesn't even care. No, I left him. He's asleep. He's asleep. What, the mouse?

62
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Oh, wait. The goblin, dude. Oh, the goblin. Oh, wait, is this picking up the cursor?

63
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,240
Yeah. That's fine. It's no big deal. Yeah, for this game, that makes sense. Okay, I have

64
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,120
to figure out how to learn spells. Well, the meantime, I am out of my dev. Hold on, I'm

65
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,880
going to take the cursor from you for just a second so I can put this. Go ahead. I want

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,480
to put this on top so I can see the game because I can't see much of it through you. The audience

67
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,280
doesn't know what I'm talking about but you can have the cursor back. Okay. Spell casting.

68
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,160
I mean, so the main deal with this game is that you're in a dungeon and you get to new

69
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,840
floors and you basically just explore until you encounter enemies and then you just deal

70
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,160
with them and you try to get stronger and level up so that you can face increasingly

71
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,600
hard hordes. Activate a memorized spell by pressing Z. Okay, but how do I memorize the

72
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
spell? I assume that the appeal of this is that it's hard to ship. No, no, that's how

73
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,160
I activate a spell. It is very hard to complete successfully. And so there's two main goals.

74
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,440
The first goal is to get the orb of zat and emerge victorious from within the place. I'm

75
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,960
too inexperienced. But that's the bitch way to beat the game. There is a much, much harder

76
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,520
way to beat the game. We just collect every single rune and then you do the same. You've

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,640
got to collect 15 demonic runes. Okay, so here I'm coming up on this. Oh shit, he woke up.

78
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,640
All right, all right. I'm going to cast the sandblast. Is this like a roguelikes when you die,

79
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,880
you're fucked? Oh, absolutely. All right. It's a brutal game. It is a roguelike. The mere

80
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,440
comprehension of the game is the most brutal part of it. I mean, there's plenty of text on the

81
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,320
bottom left that shows up to tell you generally what's going on. It looks like it's written in

82
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,920
fucking code. It kind of is. It's kind of the aesthetic. It's definitely going for DOS. The

83
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,200
trend is right now. This is a game for math nerds. Oh no. I wouldn't say math nerds. Ben

84
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,080
does have a degree in physics. True. This seems out of my depth. I'm an art guy. I'm out of

85
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,640
magic. You have to just stab this newt. Okay, okay. There's a certain brand of PC game that like

86
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,920
that that I've seen people who are into that kind of game and they're like a lot of them. And when

87
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,280
I look at them, I see nothing. I literally don't get it. Do you like binding of Isaac,

88
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,000
did you? No. No? Okay, because this is that, but way harder and way more complex. I fucking

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,960
love binding of Isaac. Yeah, Ben and I both love binding of Isaac. This seems a lot more like,

90
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,360
like binding of Isaac is considered like a rogue light. I was just wondering if you liked it at

91
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,640
all. It took me a long time to even get a grasp on what the term roguelike meant. I'm going to

92
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,040
explain something that's really interesting. In this game, in this game, you have to eat to

93
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,480
survive. Right. So right now you can see at the bottom, there's my inventory, but then down at

94
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,760
the very, very bottom right, I step over this goblin corpse and I can see that I'm at bottom right,

95
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm standing on the goblin core. So I'm going to hit C to butcher it. And now I have meat in my

96
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,120
inventory. And I love to scale. I'm going to do the same to this newt. Okay, so I have meat. Now

97
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,240
that meat will go bad if I'm not careful. So I need to like continually be exploring. This sounds

98
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,240
like Ben describing his everyday life. This is why Ben's good at what he's doing right now.

99
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,360
This is just training for real life. If I'm not careful, it will go bad. I'll eat it anyways.

100
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,680
That's right. All right. Now let me, let me see here. I got to decide which like weapon. Oh no,

101
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,520
I want to be, I want to be, you want to throw your rocks at people. No, no, no. I want to be

102
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,840
casting spells, but I do want to be. Just know that the gargoyle is too dumb to throw a rock.

103
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,600
I played, where is that right now? I played this game a few times on Ben's suggestion and, and just

104
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,320
hit a wall of there being too many fucking menus and buttons. There used to be a thing. Okay,

105
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,680
there are cursed weapons in the game. And if you equip one, you cannot unequip it until you find a

106
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,520
scroll and cursing. Oh, that sounds awful. Well, here's the real kicker about that. Early on,

107
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:31,880
if you get cursed, you need, if you get cursed with say a club, you cannot equip a dagger in

108
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,680
order to butcher an animal. So if you get cursed with a bludgeoning weapon, you can't hold a

109
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,720
cutting weapon to butcher corpses and you will starve. And you don't know. If only we had another

110
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,520
hand to use something. They actually changed it. They actually, that used to be a thing like you

111
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,080
had to have a cutting weapon in order to butcher corpses. Now they change it. So your character

112
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,000
always has a knife and it doesn't actually stop you. But it used to actually kill you early on

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,840
in the game. Pretty interesting. I'm looking for. So to explain in brief to Tom what rogue is

114
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,400
rogue was an entirely text based game. Okay, that was like, you know, something like this, where

115
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,880
you're in a dungeon exploring us. Yeah, but it was, but it was randomly generated each time. And

116
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,360
and it's like, you know, you, you. Yeah, the main point is that if you die, you lose and there's

117
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,080
lots of traps, like you have to try to make it through the dungeon without, you know, getting

118
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,320
killed in traps and losing your weapons and shit and make it to the end. Okay. And so anything

119
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,240
that's like that in any way, which these days mostly means a hard game that you die, you know,

120
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,720
if you die, you go back. Yeah. But like the idea essentially is that each run is different

121
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,960
because you pick up different shit. Right. And it's like, it's usually randomly generated.

122
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Right. Yeah. And so you, you never know what kind of powerups you're going to get on your way to

123
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,560
the end. And binding of Isaac sort of like, like there's, there's a newer genre that people call

124
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,960
it rogue light, where it's stuff that's like, it takes some of those elements, but kind of

125
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,200
yeah, it's a little bit more pick up and play. And binding of Isaac was such a huge hit that

126
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,360
there's a lot of those now like FTL is another one and shit like that risk of rain is kind of one

127
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,400
of those, which I was the biggest fan of risk of rain. Yeah. But you used to be too glitchy to

128
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,440
even play risk of rain is aesthetically beautiful for sure. Yeah, that's true. Mechanically deep. I

129
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,640
have a follow up question that might be open up a can of worms. I'm going to regret, but I'm

130
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,280
going to, I'm going to go here anyway is, is to, to you guys were both involved in this

131
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,840
conversation and I observed. Yeah. Why are you okay with the term rogue like, but Metroidvania

132
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,640
pisses you off. I feel like they're kind of both. Don't look at me. I'm fine with both of them.

133
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,000
Because I, I listened to your argument about Metroidvania and it felt like kind of what you

134
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,640
just said is the same thing with Metroidvania. Like the idea when you say, because I don't play

135
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,680
rogue likes, I do have a very specific concern with that. And it's that he likes two very

136
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,120
different things about Metroid and Castlevania. And he finds the term, you know, the only

137
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,360
muddling, the only real problem with it is the fact that I really love Metroid games. And the

138
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,120
Castlevania games that are called Metroidvania are, I mean, I don't even hate them, but they're

139
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,640
just they're a different kind of game from Metroid where Metroid is really just Metroid has no

140
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,320
RPG elements really. It's just an action platformer where every once in a while you get a new

141
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,840
ability. Most of those abilities are not just for combat. Most of them are for exploration.

142
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,440
Well, there's some of that in some Castlevania. Even, even like the, even the beam upgrades,

143
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,040
you know, like, you get an ice beam, it lets you free enemies to walk on.

144
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,600
Everything has a purpose aside from combat. Combat is very secondary.

145
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:37,560
Whereas like Castlevania, Ario Sorrow, for instance, has like, it has a leveling system that is

146
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,480
like, okay, I played through about half of Ario Sorrow. And there was one part where I got to

147
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,640
death, and I couldn't beat him. So I ran back to the start of the game, because there's an item

148
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,320
shop there. So I could buy potions. And then I ran back. But in the time that I made that run,

149
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,400
I went up two levels, and I destroyed death. Okay, like I couldn't beat him before. And then as

150
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,920
soon as I gained two levels, I just fucking destroyed him. And the only reason I gained two

151
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,320
levels is just the process of going to the game. RPGs have that quality. I get that 100%. And I'm

152
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,280
totally with you. But my only counterpoint would be, because I think everything you just said is

153
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,920
100% valid. Metroid and Castlevania are completely different games. I just think when someone just

154
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,880
like, well, I mean, in terms of like, how combat works and how progression and stuff works, there's

155
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,960
definitely different kind of mechanics there. But when someone says a Metroidvania, I think,

156
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,440
just like you said in a roguelike, they're talking about permadeath and stuff. I think when you say

157
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,920
Metroidvania, they just mean an open and connected world with a grid-like map. I think that's all

158
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,080
the term really means. Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania, and that describes it. But it also is a

159
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,640
Metroid game. Well, there are some that lean more towards the Castlevania side. Right. But the

160
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,880
upsetting part to me is that I want to play all the Metroids. Would you rather have a Metroid-like

161
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,280
and a Castlevania-like? I would. Would that make you more satisfied? I would even be satisfied

162
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,520
if like Metroidvania can stay. Just also, if a game is just Metroid, just call it a Metroid

163
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:18,840
clone. You know, like Axiom Verge, if Castlevania didn't exist, there would be no reason to put

164
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,040
vania in the title of Axiom Verge. It's just a Metroid game. If Castlevania didn't exist, well,

165
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,320
sure. It does. I think the thing is, is that I think a lot of people who play Castlevania probably

166
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,160
enjoy that exploration and like progressively unlock the world. And we'll go to Axiom Verge

167
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:43,240
because of thevania in it. Maybe, but like the thing about Metroid is that like so much of it

168
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,360
is about the environmental design and like learning your way around is like learning about this

169
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:55,000
world. There we go. There we go. I finally killed the worm that's been dogging me. You're exploring

170
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,600
this alien planet that's got all this kind of personality to it and like there's distinct

171
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,960
worlds in there. You go to Norfair and that's like a fireplace and you explore there and you get

172
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,800
an ice beam which lets you freeze these molten lava things. In Castlevania, there's no connection

173
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,400
between any of the fucking hallways you go down. And it's all hallways. That's not true. There are

174
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,880
clearly themed areas in Dracula's Castle. In Aria of Sorrow? Absolutely. The clock tower.

175
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,520
There's the clock tower and that's like it. It's not it. The clock tower is the only place that has

176
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,760
like environmental challenges in the whole game. I'm not even interested in arguing about it,

177
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,080
but there are definitely different areas with different features. I would pretty much every

178
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,600
Metroid is probably more thematically distinct in terms of its locales by nature of because it's a

179
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,960
castle versus a planet. They are less different from each other. In Castlevania, there's times

180
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,520
where you'll be going down a hallway that's like a courtyard and you'll fight a couple of

181
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,760
skeleton dogs or something and then like a giant Medusa that has nothing to do with the environment

182
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,840
you're in and then you'll go through another door and now you're just in a totally different place

183
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,360
fighting totally different enemies that again have nothing to do with the place you're in.

184
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,520
And I'm not saying this is like makes it a bad game or anything. It's just not like Metroid.

185
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,240
The enemies you fight would be relevant to that spot and it would be like it's about exploring,

186
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,800
whereas Castlevania is really about combat. It's really about the leveling and the hit

187
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,640
sparks and sound effects and the pleasure of it. I absolutely agree. I think again I'm not to

188
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,280
read it myself, but I think the only point that I think the only distinction Metroidvania is trying

189
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:40,280
to make is it's talking about how the world map is laid out and nothing more. This slug is shooting

190
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,400
darts at me. Now there is one game... He's more than he appears. I will say... I can get behind a

191
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,160
door though and he won't be able to follow me. I will say that Dark Souls I think just is Metroidvania

192
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:58,600
because it is in every way it embodies both games. In fact it embodies all of them. It completely

193
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,200
embodies Metroid. It completely embodies original Castlevanias and it completely embodies the new

194
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,880
Castlevanias because it also has that combat system. So it's not that I think it's invalid

195
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,160
to suggest that there are games that are legitimately a combination of Metroid and Castlevania,

196
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,280
but like when people say Metroidvania it can either refer to these games that are exactly

197
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:29,400
like the Castlevania games. Like what's that one called Abyssal City? It's Valdestoria Abyssal

198
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,360
City is a game that's described as a Metroidvania and you play it and it just plays exactly like

199
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,320
the new Castlevania games. Axiom Verge is described as a Metroidvania, but it plays

200
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,200
exactly like Super Metroid. You know so to me there's kind of two genres here that are being

201
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,600
called the same genre. I think it's just supposed to be referring to the way the games laid out and

202
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,880
it's up to you to use like your brain to read one or two sentences and make the rest of the

203
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,560
distinction yourself. Well how am I supposed to know just based on like the description on the

204
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,640
Steam page? There's these really cool things you're probably kind of familiar with them because

205
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,600
you do it for a living but it's called videos and they really kind of clear that up pretty

206
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,080
quick. Further reading is just the only thing. Yeah. But you know what? If you make a purchase

207
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,000
decision based on one word. But I only buy impulse. I'll tell you that. Well then that's a personal

208
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,960
problem and you need that. I do think that I mean I haven't played all these games but I've played

209
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,160
massive amount of Metroids and Castlevanias and to call Axiom Verge a Metroidvania as opposed

210
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,360
to a Metroid clone is kind of just wasting everyone's time. Yeah. Just call it it's just a

211
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,280
Metroid clone. It is literally Metroid. That's what it is. There's no Castlevania element to it

212
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,080
at all. Yep. Well except in the elements that they are shared but you might as well just cut that

213
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,760
out and just say it's a Metroid clone. I think that's what most people mean when they use the

214
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,600
term. And the same is true. I guess that's my point. It's just that the term is a meme and people use

215
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:53,000
it a lot. I guess. And there's also the game Zio Drifter is also just Metroid and like it was

216
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,160
what made me kind of come to this realization about Metroidvania. It's why it bothered me

217
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,440
because I made a video about Zio Drifter and Axiom Verge and how each of the like it was called

218
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:09,400
Ways to Clone Metroid and like I at one point I had thought should I call this like you know

219
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,960
like Metroid like different kinds of Metroidvania but then I was like but there's novania. They're

220
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,280
just Metroid games. Yeah. You know and I think someone had even said like in the comments like oh

221
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,720
you mean Metroidvania and I'm like no these are just Metroid. It's just a Metroid game. I think

222
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,880
I still stand by my original argument and that it's just to describe the way the maps laid out

223
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,720
but I will grant you that a Metroid like and a Castlevania like would be more useful than

224
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,080
Metroidvania. You know I mean when I made my video in response the point I was trying to make was

225
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,160
like you're saying Tom that I think what they're trying to convey is that when they call something

226
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,120
in Metroidvania they're specifically describing that overlap. It's the overlap that is being

227
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,240
described by that term which does leave out things. I think it would be fair to keep that

228
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,600
Metroidvania is not a term that has to die but it would be nice if people distinguished

229
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,760
between the two more. It makes sense to me. Mostly like fans and reviewers who just throw

230
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,160
around Metroidvania all the time to describe games. Well we shouldn't we shouldn't we shouldn't be

231
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,480
listening to them at all anyways. You just told me to watch reviews to find out which one. No no I

232
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,240
didn't mean reviews I said like you go to the Steam page and you can watch your video like oh this

233
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,000
is what the game plays like. It's clearly Metroid versus Castlevania versus a mix of both.

234
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,440
I definitely played Axiom Verge because it looked exactly like Super Metroid. I just I just I just

235
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,720
don't I don't even think you on your at your worst would look at it look at the word Metroidvania

236
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,480
like I'm buying this because I saw this word I was doing any more research. I mean there's I have

237
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,800
had plenty of times where I saw the word and then watched the video and then determined which one

238
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,840
you see then you solved your problem but then I got autistically mad. Well you know we all have our

239
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,480
things. What's what's going on here Ben. But there are a lot of people who are very up in arms

240
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,800
about the proliferation of Broglie. I've encountered a unique monster that I've never heard of before

241
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,920
and I have no idea how strong he is. Robin? I don't know what he does. He's gonna steal from you and

242
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,400
give to his god monster friends. He drank a potion and became more agile. See that's over there that's

243
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,880
a magic amulet on the right and I want that but I'm scared of this guy. He's coming for you. But

244
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:12,360
it's okay because I've just learned a new spell. What is it? It's on a way fast. No it's um I have

245
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,000
stone arrow which is a much stronger version of sandblast. This guy's got a whole fucking goblin

246
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,040
cadre with him and that makes me nervous. Understandably. You know Tom actually now that you've made me

247
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:30,120
reflect on this I do I hate myself for being up in arms about the metroidvania term and here's why

248
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,560
because I'm realizing that the reason I feel strongly about this is the same reason that people

249
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,680
complain about the term roguelike. It's a reason I hate which is a fear of evolution because there's

250
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,840
people who a lot of people have their niche and they just want things to fit into that niche

251
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,360
and when that niche starts to evolve and no longer have like all the elements they want it to have

252
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,720
then it's like they feel this disconnect from it where other people might like you know some people

253
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,280
might like the rogue lights for the same reason they like rogue but then there's other people who

254
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,160
are like uh it's not actually like rogue it's it's more dumb down you know. It depends on what you

255
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,600
like you what you enjoyed about rogue. I mean it's a lot like and I can make two music comparisons

256
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,960
the the most obvious one would be new metal which is where you know metal the only reason that the

257
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,840
term new metal literally means not metal and it was invented by metal fans because when like Slipknot

258
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,320
and Lincoln Park and all those bands came out metal fans were so mad that people were calling it

259
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,440
metal that they came up with the term new metal so that people would like say like you know this is

260
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,480
not metal because we don't respect it even though like like there's there's certain like okay I would

261
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,880
not consider Lincoln Park a metal band even though there's there's a lot of metal influence there

262
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,160
I think it would be more fair to call them like uh like a metal hip hop fusion as opposed to making

263
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,240
up a term that is clearly intended to slag off the genre like new metal but like I don't fight

264
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,200
segments there's certain Slipknot songs that are indistinguishable from metal there is no

265
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,840
reason they should not be considered metal other than that metal fans don't like Slipknot

266
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,920
and therefore yeah yeah you know and the same goes now for Prague where you know progressive rock in

267
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,600
the 70s there's like a there's sort of specific kind of way it sounds but then with 2000 stuff like

268
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,040
all of it's considered Neo Prague or New Prague like Kohit and Cambry and the Mars Volta and stuff

269
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,080
like that like nobody will just call it progressive rock even though the Mars Volta is every bit as

270
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,120
experimental as any 70s progressive rock band like hang on hang on one second let me let me explain

271
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,840
what's going on right here this Sigmund is really bad yeah he's all he hangs that he's pretty strong

272
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,760
and he hangs out on low level floors it's his character description is specifically that he

273
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,160
hangs out on low level floors because he's a dick who likes fucking with weak adventurers yeah and

274
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,520
those words all in the description dick who likes fucking well oh let's let's see his description

275
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,000
um an elder the elder of a pair of brothers who came for the orb no one knows what Sigmund saw in

276
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,840
the dungeon to drive him mad but his shrewd magical status and wicked scythe and i'll leave little

277
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:07,080
time for his his what okay this is not what yeah he changed it they fucking changed it let's both

278
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,800
shit i hate when they change things he used to be just an asshole okay anyway anyway so he just cast

279
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,480
a spell on me and confused me which is absolutely terrible and i'm really scared right now so i think

280
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,800
my only hope my best chance is i have all these scrolls that i have picked up and they're unidentified

281
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,960
i don't know what these scrolls do the only way to learn what they do is to either use a scroll of

282
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,680
identification on them or just use them and see what happens so i'm going to just start using scroll

283
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,840
totally at random oh man and just hope that one of them is a teleportation scroll that will get me

284
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:42,520
the fuck out of here and what are your odds on that oh no i can't i'm too confused you're too confused

285
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,520
he confused me and now i can't do it now you can't read oh he cast a spell and now i'm more confused

286
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,280
oh god just get to the upstairs okay you know if i get up the if i get to these stairs a puff of

287
00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:00,280
flame i'm really fucked that really oh god oh god don't go that way oh god oh oh he's coming for

288
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:07,320
your butt please hold so close if it doesn't teleport okay can i get up there yes i fucking got away

289
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,680
thank god okay that was that was intense that was the first comprehensible thing that's happened

290
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,960
in this game well i have wanted to take the time to explain all right i think i'm gonna skip that floor

291
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,960
i don't want to fight that guy i want you to on your channel sometime do a playthrough of this game

292
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,440
where you just narrate everything you're doing that'd be interesting maybe i will that'd be pretty

293
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,160
cool maybe i will because so far i have had literally no idea we're talking about like a 20

294
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:39,240
hour process though yeah i mean he doesn't have to beat the game in one video yeah yeah but think of

295
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,280
all the mid-roll ads you could have on that now we're talking oh dear i don't have enough magic

296
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,440
but yeah so i think i think the people who the people who are calling games like uh like like

297
00:25:52,440 --> 00:26:00,280
ftl or and all that stuff rogue light are just people who don't want their niche to become mainstream

298
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,000
and for those people like like because it's kind of a rite of passage to like be i'm into something

299
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,720
so extreme like rogue you know like right i'm i'm i'm into this thing that like takes effort to get

300
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,000
into and these people who would probably never play rogue who are playing binding of isaac because

301
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,200
it's more accessible like they feel insulted that those people are saying they play roguelikes you

302
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,160
know when roguelike used to mean something so hardcore but digi isn't your criticism of the term

303
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:33,800
metroidvania uh just contingent on the fact that it it simply is what happened he's oh he threw a

304
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,400
he threw with the goblin at you he threw a goblin at me badass because the goblin thrower

305
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,720
yeah this guy's new this guy's new i'm just gonna i'm just gonna take some potshots at him as i run

306
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,720
towards the staircase yeah that's fair to try and like weaken him for later you were saying oh i was

307
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,920
just saying isn't your criticism of of the the metroidvania specifically based on the fact that

308
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,000
if for you it makes it harder for you to find what you're looking for in terms of you know

309
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,040
specifically metroid which isn't so much an issue of stopping evolution or anything it's just that

310
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:12,520
it's confusing on some level it's yeah it's just i'm upset at the idea of polluting this genre i care

311
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,600
about okay so that's that i want more metroid and instead i'm getting castle metroidvania and i'm

312
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,320
i'm sort of afraid that like when like for instance uh you highly recommended me shantae the pirates

313
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,400
yes i did and you said it was a metroidvania but then i stand by i started playing it and it is

314
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,480
identical to a castlevania game that's correct that's correct there would be no reason to call it

315
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,320
well metroid well castlevania itself is a metroidvania right yes but that's what he's talking about

316
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,520
if in the same way that i said that if axiom like if castlevania didn't exist there'd be no reason

317
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,320
to call axiom verge a metroidvania yeah or a metroidvania rather this you can call shantae

318
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,520
exactly like there'd be no reason to say it's anything other than a castlevania game i'm gonna

319
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,080
for the term yes ben what's up i'm gonna put on this magic amulet and see what happens let's find

320
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,600
out it's a cursed amulet of inaccuracy that that should be all right that's not that's not the

321
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,400
worst thing in the world it's still not good you know but the thing about shantae though is that

322
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,360
there are a lot of elements i'm just i'm just gonna start identifying shit it's probably a good idea

323
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,040
shantae specifically does contain a lot of things that are quite metroidy specifically you get

324
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,240
you get major power upgrades like you do in a metroid game that increase your mobility

325
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,880
in you know major steps along the game which i would argue are very there's stuff like that in

326
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,040
aria sorrow like you gain a double jump that's true that's true and you gain a little like uh the

327
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,520
thing that slows your descent little wings yeah the bat the bad thing and i'd say there's there's

328
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,880
more environmental challenges i guess we're talking about an issue of degrees

329
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,840
i think the problem is is that you just want to play more one of those scrolls with a scroll of

330
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,360
remove curse so i can get rid of the amulet well just like i feel like castlevania games the appeal

331
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,520
of them is very grindy and i'm not as into that whereas i agree whereas like like like with aria

332
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,640
of sorrow i realized like i made a video about that game ben ben's probably the only person who's

333
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,400
fucking seen it in the world i'd watch that i love aria of sorrow what is it well it's a very

334
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,000
critical critical very critical i will not watch it i just i just drank a potion and turned into a

335
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,160
tree into a tree yes you're fluttershy right now we went there i was i was gone up i was like no i

336
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,880
know that's gay i had to like process what you went by that oh really i'm so far out of wow

337
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,400
that's never gonna leave me i'm in too deep um anyway yeah a lot of my criticism is the same

338
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,200
thing that uh egoraptor talked about about like what the problem is with ever like castlevania

339
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,080
2 and and all the newer castlevanias which is just fascinating it's a game about running back and

340
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,480
forth across the world fighting lots of guys and the reason it's fun now as opposed to how it wasn't

341
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,120
two is because as he put it there's lots of hit sparks and sound effects and your weapons feel

342
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,200
good and it's really crunchy and awesome and you fucking slash these big guys like

343
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,640
it's it's yeah i fucking killed that guy and you gain like a thousand different weapons and a

344
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,800
million different ghost spirits and stuff yeah it's awesome and like you know i played through

345
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,320
like half the game and i just kind of got bored and stopped and then i watched like a video of

346
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,880
someone getting a hundred percent or no you know maybe i beat the game yeah but didn't do any of

347
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,160
the extra stuff because like i remember oh there's so much to do i remember getting really far and

348
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,400
maybe even beating it but then i looked at like a video of someone doing a 100% run and there's like

349
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,120
whole stretches of the castle i had oh so much i hundred percent of that game myself a couple

350
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,440
times there's so much there's all these secret bosses there's a thousand million weapons the ultimate

351
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,880
super mega boss oh and it made me realize that if you were someone who played this game in such a

352
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,720
way that you just kind of casually wander around and fight shit like forever and like tried to do

353
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,360
all the secret stuff it's a totally different game from the game that i was trying to play yeah

354
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,360
which is i'm fighting a snake right now one is kind of blow through one of the best perks of

355
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,520
being the gargoyles that i'm immune to poison so this guy is not that threatening oh actually he's

356
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,760
he's doing some kind of bad damage i don't like that i don't like that wait what's happening again

357
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,120
he's fighting a snake he's made of rocks so we can't be poisonous he's poisonous though he's a

358
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:18,600
poisonous serpent he's hitting hard dude i'm just gonna drink this potion of might a lot of the

359
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,000
castlevania games are our best played from a completionist standpoint and i got a lot of

360
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,400
enjoyment out of them doing it that way i mean i've i've i've been asked about this on these shows

361
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,640
before like why am i so bad at video games and why do i never beat them yeah and the reason is

362
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:42,120
that i with any media i am extremely impatient about it because i want to consume it and move on

363
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,480
yeah like i always feel anytime i i'm like working through one thing i feel like it's distracting me

364
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,960
from other things that i could be doing like like you know i just want to make a video i just

365
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,200
want to go do something else and and work through all this different stuff so when it when something

366
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,480
takes more than a couple days i get really antsy about it and i don't even if it's like even if

367
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,200
it's amazing you know and there's very few times like dark souls 3 is one of the only games that

368
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,560
like i beat it in two days and then i immediately started playing again you know i immediately

369
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,760
went on new game plus and made another character uh i beat it in a different way you know like i

370
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,440
think i beat it twice there's an altar either beat it twice i got most of the way through in a

371
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,400
second there's an altar of sif muna here sif muna is a pretty good god for a spellcaster but i'm more

372
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,080
i'm a sif muna is a god who just gives you lots of access to lots of spells cool i don't want to

373
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,240
worship her though because i'm going to worship vehumet who is specifically the god of destruction

374
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,600
magic he doesn't give you access to as many spells but he does like power up your destructive spells

375
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,000
and reward you for destroying things with magic so i'm not gonna i'm not going to start worshiping

376
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,080
sif muna can you is there anything you can do to unworship if you start worshiping someone

377
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:55,320
if you start worshiping someone you can renounce your religion but your god will um declare you

378
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,080
an affustate and curse you and take divine vengeance on you until they eventually like just

379
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,160
forget about it and they're like well whatever it's that's enough i see except for except for the

380
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,040
good there's three good gods well whatever that's enough there's three there's three good gods who

381
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,440
won't take vengeance on you unless you join an evil god and then their wrath will fall upon

382
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,240
how dangerous is the auto explorer you keep doing oh it's not dangerous at all because it stops when

383
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,320
literally anything of note happens yeah it's great so it just saves you time yeah digi i was gonna say

384
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,080
i think that's interesting how uh we we consume media differently because even just today i went on

385
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,760
a crazy tirade of cleaning the entire lower half of this house because i felt compelled to to make

386
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,720
sure it was all done and even when others told me to stop i simply could not bring myself to do so

387
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,000
i had to follow it through to the bitter end and uh yeah i just think that's all right the way we

388
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,720
play why are they telling you to stop well tom was cleaning i just felt so guilty he was cleaning

389
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,480
up all of our dishes as was victor as was victor and victor here's the thing victor and tom both

390
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,280
have the same kind of guilty conscience uh of like like if no one had done it that would have been

391
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,120
like like they would have felt a little guilty because they wanted it to get done but as soon as

392
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,840
someone's doing it it's like well i should have victor specifically mentioned that yeah it's my

393
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,800
good Samaritan nature like fighting against my inherently this is actually horrible i'm trapped

394
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:24,760
between nobles and a snake i just i mean if i was the snake i guess to me it's like well you guys

395
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,160
obviously wanted it to be clean more than i did because if i actually didn't want it to be clean i

396
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,880
would have cleaned it right well i'm not i don't even care about that the the point was just that uh

397
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,240
i i play games the same way i tackle other tasks because i do it as fast as i can as hard as i can

398
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,040
but it's the exact opposite you're a quantity and you're a quantity guy yeah quality quality yeah

399
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,920
yeah that's true yeah i mean this is true of everything okay check out these pro straps i'm

400
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,640
gonna try and use passwall and just like pass through a wall all right do it i have like never

401
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,960
fucking done this before you're a rock guy that's why you can do it right yeah passwall lets you meld

402
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:04,360
with stone oh you're like pika from one piece i like i like never use this okay this it's uh c

403
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:12,120
okay so z this is exciting c i feel like if this has not worked this did not work wasted my mp

404
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,560
damn okay okay i feel like if this had like more like advanced graphics i'd be totally enthralled

405
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,960
right now you guys are a bunch of babies this is fucking fascinating i'm completely no no no i'm

406
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,440
i'm enthralled but i just feel like it'd be some of this i don't know you guys are cowards is what

407
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:32,120
you are god damn weak cowardly i play fucking dungeon dragons or have my imagination yeah that's

408
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,360
your problem i can step on computer science major that's why i'm interested yeah i gotta scroll

409
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,480
of teleportation if i can survive for a couple more rounds i'll be safe the shimulinsky family

410
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,680
yes oh he won't let down a family of science a family of science that's true even though you're

411
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:52,040
both artists now you approach art from like you're the kind of guys who would make a game like this

412
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,360
that's true me and tom would probably make a game that looked absolutely beautiful and played

413
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,880
like generic dog shit some of the games i've made exactly i'd rather take the little more travel so

414
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,760
i can focus on making it look cool exactly the game i was trying to make uh with my buddies before i

415
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,200
started tbap which actually we stopped working on the game uh to work on tbap stuff man horses

416
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,520
ruined our and the world and the world was robbed and the world was robbed of this game where we were

417
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:23,240
playing as i was working on a 3d animated series with my friend before this was a this was a 2d

418
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:29,320
technical platformer that was all about being synced to music and we had the engine running

419
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,440
properly what and and basically is this the game you played is that a different game no totally

420
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,120
different game totally this was one we constructed ourselves out of unity instead of using rpg maker

421
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:45,160
yeah it was fairly pro you considered suing crypt of the necro dancer for stealing your concept

422
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,240
they kind of did steal our idea a little bit but ours was a 2d platformer instead of like a dungeon

423
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,520
crawler there's is a roguelite incident it is a roguelite it sure does let me just say i fucking

424
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,080
love uh crypt of the necro dancer that's the game on my list to play that is i never played games

425
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,960
anymore i don't yeah me neither but that one is really as you sit here playing by the way i just

426
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,280
want to take a moment to point out how ben's survival in that situation is is fairly pro

427
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,560
shit thank you ben says he doesn't play a lot of games but in the time he's lived with me he's

428
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,520
played more games than i have in like the last three years it's about how you approach things i

429
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,480
guess okay pokemon is not i don't view playing pokemon as a part of his life i don't play that as

430
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,080
playing what about just the the amount of prep work for the pokemon contest the well yeah that

431
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:37,160
again again that doesn't feel like playing a game to me well i mean it is objective okay shut up

432
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,920
it doesn't it doesn't feel like it though oh oh god oh sweet a published name invisibility

433
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:52,920
wasted i don't know yeah i don't oh crypt of the necro dancer i am right right i was re-watching

434
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,280
my end of 2015 video like stuff i loved in 2015 the first thing i commented on was crypt of the

435
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,280
necro dancer and i described it as uh um the game i've spent the most time playing out of all games

436
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:10,440
that i'm absolutely terrible at because i was never able to beat like like like the third floor of

437
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,840
the first dude i couldn't do that either it was too fucking hard yeah it's i mean i played for

438
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:21,720
probably 13 hours oh wow like the third floor that was that guy there that sings to your music right

439
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,120
yeah you can put in the middle of that that is probably a hard game i can actually get to read

440
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:32,360
a limel yeah it's my problem right now who is a god no kiko bakuga who's the god of death magic

441
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,800
specifically okay but i don't destruction not yeah yeah he's not yeah i want to subtle difference

442
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,440
that who meant the god of blowing chip up up with fireballs and such are you gonna be a still

443
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,680
an earth guy are you gonna switch to i yeah yeah i well i am gonna branch out a little bit like i'm

444
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,840
gonna learn magma bolt as soon as i can okay but uh which is fire earth cross class but um i am gonna

445
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,720
i am gonna specialize in earth the whole game okay what's your problem with uh trying to get

446
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,120
well it's not even blood just because gargoyles are really good at earth is that because i'm

447
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,200
like so self-critical when i die in a game i feel like that's a personal failure when you when you've

448
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,480
died in a game do you feel like you die for real a little bit inside yes every time every time

449
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,320
every every death in a video game is is a personal blow to my ego because i shouldn't i if i was

450
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,760
better i wouldn't have played a game like i want to be the guy that game will make you i don't want

451
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,680
not give a shit about dying a thousand times okay that's true i can leave rapid deconstruction

452
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,880
is a great fucking spell but right if i learned it right now the failure rate would be really high

453
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,440
and it's a pretty powerful spell so if you miscast spells really bad things can happen you can get

454
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,120
contaminated with magical energy that can actually mutate you like physically mutate you that's the

455
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,600
good thing about simple games like this is that they can implement crazy concepts without having

456
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:54,600
to like yeah that's where there's so much better than bullshit big budget shitty 3d games the first

457
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:02,040
time i ever won this game i was a crusader of oh i was a merfolk crusader and the reason that i won

458
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,560
was really early on i found an altar to the slime god whose name escapes me and all through the slime

459
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,520
god all through the game these slimes were always following me around they spawned on every level

460
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,000
and ate all the equipment like so like i didn't get any good drops because the slimes would eat all

461
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,840
my shit but the god would continually just fuck with me and mutate me and like by the time i like i

462
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,560
got the orb and i crawled out and i crawled out like i was colored in like iridescent scales and i

463
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,240
had like glow like glowing gold extra eyes like poking out from under my skin and i had extra arms

464
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,040
and shit it was fucking around do you win the game yeah like some of those were good like the extra

465
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,160
eyes give you an accuracy bonus and stuff like that fuck yeah so sometimes they're bad all right

466
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,400
well you convinced me this is the coolest game ever made it is yeah it is the coolest game ever

467
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,800
this is like if dnd were fun and good yeah you could play dnd by yourself and you didn't have to

468
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:58,360
worry about oh dear so much are you fucked no wait yes oh god the coolest game ever that we're

469
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,240
gonna have to restart right now um are there no save states that's a fickle mistress of course

470
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,200
that's for pussies never i've never played rogue or any rogue like so well just know you are not

471
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,600
no one's played rogue like no one has actually played rogue well i'm gonna be the first the reason

472
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,000
that rogue like has proliferated as a term because everybody wants to play rogue without playing

473
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,680
no one's played rogue everyone's played i mean there's a whole like the thing is this this is

474
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,040
really these should be called mystery dungeon games to me because that's what they're called in

475
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,720
japan there's a gigantic like you know pokemon mystery dungeons that's just a spin off of like a

476
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,880
huge fucking thing yeah but there's there's like well there's just a thousand games that are like

477
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,960
that because there's i mean there's dungeon crawler games and then there's like tons it's the word is

478
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,800
nariki dungeon so like there's there's like there's tons of games that are just spin offs of other

479
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,880
franchises that are just mystery dungeon versions of that franchise and then like and then there's

480
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,360
just like a million of them and they're like uh izuna legend of the unemployed ninja my sister was

481
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:04,280
a big fan of that i i fucking she bought it because there's a cute ninja on the cover well and i

482
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,800
bet you did too my friend i bet you did you gotta understand man oh i understand izuna legend of

483
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,000
the unemployed ninja is a game that i saw in the store yeah i'm unemployed and i want to be a ninja

484
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,760
i was immediately i was immediately the most captivated i've ever been with anything in my life

485
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,360
because that's so it's okay it's this ninja what the fuck tits and pink hair and she's got a big

486
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,840
smile and she's super cute i've never seen this altar before it look honestly looks like a god of

487
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:38,040
juggalos what does it does it not look like a tiny clown face to you it kind of does actually see

488
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:44,040
up here to verify us uskaya an altar to uskaya the reveler it appears to be the reveler sounds

489
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:50,040
clowny uh i'm gonna fucking go pray at it just to see oh man you're gonna throw your whole

490
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,800
don't join that dark carnival just sit ben okay i don't know usaka the reveler is a god of ecstatic

491
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,840
dance oh my god uskaya appreciates many forms of worship but in the dungeon most worshipers

492
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,560
stick to the dance of combat uskaya appreciates the passion rhythm of combat rewarding followers

493
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:10,040
for each strike they deliver and for the damage they deal their foes the longer the dance continues

494
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,200
the greater the path okay so it seems like he's like a melee god he's like a melee combat guy all

495
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:20,440
right that's cool so i'm not i'm not gonna join him pretty fun i that's awesome just like you get

496
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,160
up you don't say any prayers we just give him a nice nod and like a thumbs up as you walk away

497
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:31,080
the carnival you want about izuna the unemployed ninja yeah god so yeah i saw this game and it was

498
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,120
so beautiful and captivating because it's called the legend of the unemployed ninja so i was like

499
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,120
this is the greatest name ever of a game plus four plus four ring of intelligence just put it on

500
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:46,440
perfect for you feeling good going good i desperately need one of those so oh yeah dude i didn't buy

501
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,560
the game immediately because i looked at the back and it's like you know these very simple pixel art

502
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:56,040
kind of graphics and i was like this looks like it's probably a pain in the s rpg tactics game

503
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,000
or something uh so then i i i read reviews of it and all of them just assured me that the game is

504
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,040
hard as fuck because it's a dungeon crawler they're all hard as fuck um so i was like okay well i'm

505
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,120
probably not gonna play this because it's it's too hard uh and then it but i but i always wanted

506
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,400
it every time i was in the store i just never had the money for it and then they made izuna

507
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,040
to the unemployed ninja returns and that was always in the store and i was like i fucking want this game

508
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,800
still unemployed um yeah i don't want to factor this girl so bad and well here's the other thing uh

509
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,240
do you guys know about the character bico who's that okay she's a character who's famous on forechan

510
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:35,080
probably know her then she's she's got um she's got white hair and an eyepatch and she's the one

511
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,640
they made the comic for yeah this is the same b she's like five times yeah yeah she's missing an arm

512
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,000
and a leg and she plays guitar and anyway yeah i don't know tom knows the story i tried to get a

513
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,960
comic made of her but the artist who drew her is the same artist who drew the izuna art oh yeah so

514
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,880
me being a fan of bico also compounded my desire to buy izuna at this point i i need to remember

515
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:01,560
this part of the story yeah so i finally bought izuna 2 the unemployed ninja returns and i played

516
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,680
like 10 hours of it and it was too fucking hard so i'm gonna die i'm gonna die the terrible end

517
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,480
to that story of passion what's happening what's happening the fucking bee caught up to me i can't

518
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:18,440
run him i died bee you died that same bee that same bee got me a bee yeah well like a magic

519
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:24,280
bee i assume this mighty gargoyle was felled by a bee he's probably big he was a red bee no this

520
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,960
was you don't understand this was a red this is like a red bee like in donkey con they're invincible

521
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,360
you can't kill him so you know all right i'm just gonna fucking i'm just gonna rush through

522
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:39,240
and he'll understand this is a big bee really big guy well we're on run two now all right well you

523
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,760
know like you got yourself out of a lot of sticky situations so i'll give you props for that this

524
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,920
game is all about sticky enough to escape the honey though this game is about threat management yeah

525
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,320
as you're crumb across this game is about never taking any risk i feel like as you will deal with

526
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,560
so much shit in this game that if you even take risks that have a one percent chance of killing

527
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,640
you eventually you'll take so many of them that they'll kill you i feel like this is this is a

528
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,840
captain Picard game which is why it's a good game exactly you know what like a game he would enjoy

529
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,200
but he'd be good at i feel like he'd be good at it like he takes lots of risks though oh yeah but

530
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,520
you have to take risks to survive in this game so you know of course you would but yeah you do have

531
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,760
something there never need to say where you have to be adamant in your assertion that there are only

532
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,440
four lights that's such a cool scene it is a great scene there don't think i've seen this shit man

533
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,200
oh it's a good one oh i think i'm gonna die to this cockroach i feel like to explain it would be to

534
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,240
really die at least at least right away i barely survived i barely survived the cockroach all right

535
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:43,960
wow well that's a sentence i've said many times in my life and completely meant it

536
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:52,120
yeah and the thing about izuna too is that while it was hardest shit yeah it also just is like it

537
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:57,480
didn't have as much story as i would have liked like it's the kind of game kind of like uh like

538
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,440
diskaya or the niponichi games what always shocked me about those games is that like you'd go through

539
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:08,360
this gauntlet of like hours in a dungeon like this long incredibly hard dungeon that takes you like

540
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:14,200
fucking 50 tries to beat a level and then you beat it and you get like maybe three minutes of cut

541
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,200
scene that's mostly characters just saying dumb shit and the story makes no progress and then

542
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,600
you're right back in another dungeon that always frustrated me immensely about that yeah like

543
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:28,120
because i was used to you know rpg's like final fantasy 10 yeah you know good games yeah we're

544
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,640
gonna sit down for a fucking yeah yeah it's funny because some people like there's a lot of people

545
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,040
who really hate like the final fantasy games because of this reason that there's so much

546
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,960
cutscene but like to me i was kind of conditioned i grew up with those games and i like this condition

547
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,640
to expect that if i just beat a giant boss i'm going to get a sizable chunk of story for payoff like

548
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,560
i did not play those games because i thought it was fun to fight bosses the people who hate final

549
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,840
fantasy probably people who grew up playing stuff like dagger fall which is like the exact

550
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,000
opposite yeah it's a huge fucking big world well meanwhile like the make your own story essentially

551
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,960
the nipponichi games like the reward for that is some snarky dialogue and then they waste like 15

552
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,200
minutes of your time with bullshit conversations no one gives a fuck about and granted i like i didn't

553
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,280
get this at the time and god i fucking i bought an amulet of faith now that's not that might that

554
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,840
might really help me that'll really help me if i can survive to fucking get a god this time yeah

555
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,600
i makes gods really like you that's sweet i fucking i fucking bought like every nipponichi game

556
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:33,640
they released here because because i i the aesthetic appeals to me so much yeah like i'm so oh they

557
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,640
look so good dude that's so that's the disappointing part because you get drawn in for the aesthetic

558
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,240
and they don't really do anything with well i was also i'm gonna just like make you bought the game

559
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:48,280
i was also way into that was for i was full full heartily this is this is pure hubris pure

560
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:55,960
pretension and hubris yeah i was from well yeah i don't i don't think of myself as being

561
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,880
that pretentious because pretension means you're pretending to be something other than what you

562
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,080
are i am a leader on with your body i am elitist and biased but i don't think i'm pretentious but

563
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:10,120
as you don't you don't make any excuses this this was a matter of pure pretension that i was really

564
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:16,440
into tactics games the only reason i was really into tactics games is because i thought that because

565
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,880
i'm smart i should yeah i told i totally get that i'm smart dude i thought i was wicked smart

566
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,880
like i'm looking all the i'm feeling like playing chess for years over here exactly with all these

567
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,760
old anime boys like i i think the first one i played was probably fire emblem and i sucked at

568
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:36,680
it i could never beat level 15 uh x uh and like because you know i would restart if i lost a guy

569
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,520
so me too i just played the level like a hundred times i couldn't beat it and said fuck it and

570
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,240
just because i'm literally not smart enough to think of a fucking whoa whoa whoa i just drank

571
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:52,920
a potion of beneficial mutation my fingernails lengthened and now i feel fantastic is that like

572
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:59,640
a combat bonus i've done that before it is um i yeah i think it would give me a bonus to unarmed

573
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:04,440
combat so it's like it's a really small but hey that's zero point two points of death

574
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,600
yeah like i might be able to make off hand attacks like it's like make super power in that episode

575
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:16,440
of family gather they all got super powers you got the girls grow yeah yeah oh i remember that

576
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,720
but yeah so like over the course of like five or six years i really had it in my head that i was

577
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:27,560
way into tactics games it would buy like all of them and then play them for like barely any time

578
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:32,040
because i was so bad yeah you know i think the one i played the most of was the original diskaya

579
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:38,760
and then like but i had phantom brave makai kingdom fucking lapus l tactics all the way that one

580
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:45,480
that one sucks that one sucks shit uh i tried so hard to play that game for so long i thought that

581
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,560
it only sucked because i was not good enough and then i grew up like there was a time that is the main

582
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:59,240
girl was so hot the main girl lapus l tactics was like my my skill and my my personal preference

583
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,800
dude where does that divide it's super hard to find sometimes well the thing about lapus l is that it's

584
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:10,760
it's the the way that the combat system works takes forever like i don't remember that like you

585
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,800
have this okay it's all based on positioning where you have to like basically uh there's like a line

586
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,520
of colored blocks i do remember that and remember that like your character stands on that line and

587
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,440
whichever way they're facing the line faces that way yeah right like if there's a line cutting

588
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,880
vertically through the stage you'd have a character standing in it and turn them to the left and the

589
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:33,480
line breaks to the left right and so you want to position all your characters in such a way that

590
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,280
yeah you want to position them all in such a way that you get as many enemies in in this line as

591
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,880
possible and then when you attack it'll go down the line and hit all the guys but then like there's

592
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:50,360
also like uh like cutscenes for like you know hitting someone yeah and those like they load in

593
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:56,280
and they're slow and they load out and you can't turn them off so every even like the tutorial

594
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,960
battles are like 40 fucking minutes just because of how much shit you have to watch in between

595
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,360
attacking and like you know as a kid i just thought well i'm garbage at this game and i don't

596
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,800
get it so this is a so i so i'll play it later and then like you know like two years ago i busted

597
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,640
it out and i was like i'm an adult now i'm gonna play a lot of self because i love the aesthetic

598
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:20,840
of this game the characters look fucking great and i put it in and started playing it and i was like

599
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:26,200
this game fucking blows the characters all have generic anime personalities it's slow as

600
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,400
shit and the tactics are boring and fuck this game i'm never playing it again i really hate

601
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,360
tactics games i i played a lot i play fire only because my friends do i don't even like it i don't

602
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,840
know why i play it i don't think i would like it if i played one today and yet into fire he loves

603
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,640
fire but final fantasy tactics is one of my favorite games of all time and but that has a great

604
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:51,480
story it has a fantastic possibly the great story in all video games uh in terms of drama as i

605
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,480
understand the tactics system is complex and rich and wonderful as i understand it final fantasy

606
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,920
tactics is like like like the story is on the level of like the wire or game of thrones or

607
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,920
something it's like it's like it's like an epic political just like exponentially increase my

608
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,160
desire to play yeah it's it's have you played vagrant story or do you know it's the same writer

609
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,760
i want to play that they're they're both known for like these this is why i need to start late to

610
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,560
the party i'll have no yeah so i'll do all this shit tactics it would be a great late to the party

611
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:22,040
especially is a wonderful wait wait wait um i can kind of infer from the name but what is

612
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,960
late to the party uh basically it's an excuse for me to actually do all the things i keep saying

613
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:31,000
i've been wanting to do for the last like 10 years huh yeah like it's a good name it's all media

614
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,400
it's media that everyone else cares about that tom hasn't gotten to yet right i can i can be the

615
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:41,080
sole arbiter side of your nostalgia is bullshit or totally valid this is an alter to my club which

616
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,720
just be careful with that just be very careful i would tread lightly i would i would approach it

617
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:54,600
very from a very casual and um lighthearted opinionated project i would never i would never

618
00:53:54,600 --> 00:54:00,440
deal in absolutes yeah only a sif does that by the way i think that i'm kind of more of a sif guy

619
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,880
the best way to describe final fantasy tactics is like a cross between the real life war of the

620
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:11,960
roses and berserk that's how i would describe it it's awesome that sounds fucking great it's great

621
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,000
the drama between deletha and ramza is right up there with guts and i think it's really played

622
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,320
final fantasy tactics advance and i was like this must be like oh shit i wasn't a huge fan of that

623
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,720
game well you know it's a little hard to get into it at first kind of wrapping girls were kind of

624
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:33,160
cool viara yeah oh i played all the uh the other games but uh only the original is really truly

625
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,720
great and worth playing well tactics advance is like i kind of wish this story is not the same

626
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:43,480
kind of story it's totally different and it's still fun but it's goofy and not as serious and the

627
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:52,280
game is just less complex and less fun um yeah so all those fucking niponichi games man i it took

628
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:57,960
a long time to come to that realization that they're not like that like that you're not the problem

629
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,200
yeah that oh yeah that i'm not the problem and that they're not that they just weren't what i wanted

630
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,760
you're into them for the wrong reasons you're looking for something out of them they don't

631
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:12,200
deliver well jesse's video about fucking the witch in the hundred night was fucking perfect it was

632
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:18,040
captured all of my problems with those games it was so great that they have these these these

633
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:25,000
short weird vapid cutscenes and terrible voice acting and then if you like and if you try to

634
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:31,320
like you like you have to press x to advance the dialogue which causes them to talk at an unnatural

635
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,480
rate but then if you try to like mash x and you keep hearing the beginnings of sentences there's no

636
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,440
winning yeah there's no victory over the cutscenes and a lot of games would do well to to manage that

637
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,720
yeah and it's it's infuriating and it took me a long time to realize it and like thankfully i stopped

638
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:51,160
buying the games in like 2008 because i was never playing them so like i have i was like i'm not

639
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,840
going to buy any more until i get through the collection i have i did that too la pucelle and

640
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,240
i've got like three disguise sequels that have just sit in a box because i thought i would play them

641
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,680
it never did you you see over there the audience can't see this but do you see how there's one rack

642
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:11,400
that's just ps2 games i think so i've beaten maybe four of those and the rest of them are i went

643
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:17,800
through this period where i was really obsessed with jrpg's but i kept buying them and like i kept

644
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,680
like there was a there was a point where i had a cutoff and i said i'm not going to buy

645
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:26,280
any more until i beat all the ones i have it's crazy you one by one as i try to go back and beat

646
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:34,200
the ones i have i realize oh these suck like they mostly suck i still love final fantasy nine

647
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,720
final fantasy nine is fantastic everyone loves final fantasy that's one of the final fantasy

648
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,880
nine is one that everyone who sucks final fantasy seven's dick and just like but nine is so charming

649
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,320
well that's fine i mean i haven't played seven so i'm totally biased but like nine just like

650
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,400
tickled me in all the right way there's okay there's two different levels here like there's the

651
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:55,160
ones that i never beat that i played like five hours and gave up and thought i would do one day

652
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,000
and those are mostly the ones that i came back to later and went oh i only played five hours

653
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,120
because this game is fucking boring whereas there's other games that i actually almost beat back then

654
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:09,160
and the only reason i didn't is because of shenanigans yeah in final fantasy nine's case i adored that

655
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:16,360
game it was like the greatest game ever i made it to disc three uh and then natasha the cat has

656
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:21,080
nine lives you have to you kill her but she just disappears she appears somewhere else on the level

657
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,560
oh is she uh any stronger when she reappears no she's just the same that's kind of cool farmer

658
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,640
uh you can oh she summoned a demon oh well that's that's not good she summoned a demon

659
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:39,560
the demon oh i'm out of magic the doctor shows okay it's actually bad 1399 with hd

660
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:46,760
graph i have fucking read reviews for that shit oh no i have stars right now and has 3598 reviews

661
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,080
if it's got good reviews then it's worth it i mean if you like playing on a fucking mobile

662
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:57,960
well you know i have like a psp or something it's got to be on that i don't psp is gay i don't have

663
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:06,600
oh the psp war the lions version is i think it's better like if you just want to play it on the

664
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:11,400
computer i don't know if dude just fucking pirate it or something i guess you like to buy games so

665
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,200
well he's just worried about whether he's gonna play it on the phone or on the computer that's

666
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,480
oh well the whole thing is that like it's one of the i don't sometimes i spend more time on this

667
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:25,640
a day than i do on my computer i'm not like that so i'm slowly moving i find sitting at a desk to be

668
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:31,080
very uh limiting not even limiting just like physically uncomfortable these days yeah i don't

669
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:38,120
get one of these you'll you can't afford one of these never mind oh god you fuck well i mean this is

670
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,120
a five hundred dollar chair you're sitting in bed this isn't the first one he can't afford this isn't

671
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:48,680
the first time he said that and it won't be the last no so i just come out and check the privilege

672
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:53,720
and feel like a victim and i've been in this culture that's a good thing that's true that means i have

673
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:58,280
privilege over you and soon you'll be paying me well the point is i can sit in this chair all day

674
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,080
and it never becomes a problem i don't know like for some reason i like a couple years ago when i'd

675
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,080
sit down at my desk like all right it's work time now when i sit down at a desk i'm like this is so

676
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:12,280
gay and i just don't want to do anything well just be aware if if you're i mean the music is great

677
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,680
and if you can appreciate the game fully on your phone feel free to do so i might just wait until

678
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:21,880
like a new laptop and buy it on windows and just play it on that fair enough um which could be kind

679
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:27,400
of cool it should be given that it's it's due respect when i don't want to over hype it i mean

680
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,280
it's not perfect i'll sell my final fantasy nine yeah and why i stopped yeah i got to disc three

681
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:37,400
do you remember the part where kooja is the bad guy of course kooja captures your whole party

682
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:42,600
and he's he splits you into two let me guess you got to the place where you can't use metal weapons

683
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:49,000
or something essentially yeah you can't use magic that's right he says like i'm gonna send you to

684
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,080
this uh this castle you get to take two people all of andre the castle all of andre you pick two

685
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:04,520
people but you can't use magic yep and i didn't like process what that meant so i sent zadan and

686
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:11,320
vivi oh dear that is not a good call both useless uh that's pretty good my zadan had lots of magic

687
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:18,040
though uh and and and i was like slightly i was like one level under leveled like i'm never over

688
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,960
leveled in these games i'm always like right hang on that doesn't make any sense zadan doesn't use

689
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,400
magic we're talking about zadan yeah i mean yeah i'm just saying i always call him zadane it is

690
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,080
actually supposed to be pronounced zadan but who gives a fault air well air zadane it's supposed

691
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:37,160
to be air it's not magic so i don't know what the fuck you're talking about well does he in the game

692
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,560
they never pronounce his name i mean i'm with yon vivi that's totally true he'd be useless without

693
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:46,200
magic but zadane are you sure he doesn't use magic yes okay well maybe he has some skills

694
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,680
he has skills but i think he could still use those i don't remember i don't remember the points

695
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,560
you got fucked i got i got there the enemies were like a level higher than me yeah and i could not

696
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:02,040
do any well no it wasn't just that i couldn't do anything i literally could not progress

697
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:07,640
because there was only two rooms in this place and i kept uh i kept having to run away from

698
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,400
battles because i couldn't like fucking kill anything right so i just kept running away and

699
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,760
i kept going back and forth between these two rooms and of course i had saved the second i got

700
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,160
there and of course i didn't keep multiple save files back well i mean because i was just i would

701
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,680
have done the same thing what did i did do the same thing so i got through this for some reason

702
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,760
i would chose tiner because i wasn't done i kept going back and forth between the two rooms going

703
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,640
like what the fuck happens here and it turns out there's like a specific enemy you have to kill

704
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:38,120
to make the next area open and i literally could not kill it with the characters i had like because

705
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,920
i couldn't level up i couldn't because i wasn't strong enough to kill anything and there's no

706
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:48,520
way out you can't leave the fucking place yep so it was just like i was literally completely

707
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:54,440
fucked my save file was done well and i just didn't i didn't have the fucking wherewithal to play

708
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,000
do it i got to the last kudra fight and my memory card got corrupted i lost all my series

709
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,880
for all my games that's tragic that's tragic i've actually my memory card dies twice and it killed

710
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,760
my final fantasy nine progress and my chronocross progress well you know the ending of nine you know

711
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,000
like the good guys win i mean i never felt like great ending i feel i still feel like i've beaten

712
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,960
the game because i grinded a lot so i was crushing everything at that point so i was confident you

713
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,200
still couldn't beat oh you i never got a chance to actually fight it but you would have won i'm

714
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,200
pretty sure i would have i have a question for each of you and i suspect that for a lot of the

715
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:32,120
answer will be never but how many times have you given up on a game towards the end because you

716
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:36,360
couldn't beat a boss never because i couldn't beat a boss i don't think i've ever done that

717
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,840
why is this guy so strong holy shit you know i probably have done it once or twice i did that

718
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:45,320
with final fantasy 12 for a while but then came back and defeated it and fucking raped that game

719
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:51,160
and it was awesome i just wanted to do that but i my tism is that like at that point i'm just like

720
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:57,000
i can't let this game be better than me it's not even real yeah like that yeah and i'll just scream

721
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,920
and i'll use racial slurs and i'll snap controllers in half and i'll get so pissed but i'll eventually

722
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:06,280
do it and i won't even feel good i'll just be like i just made myself die two years earlier from

723
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:12,120
all the stress i have it i haven't made everything in some cases i give up because it would take to

724
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:17,160
like okay here's the thing about me as a kid and this is probably also why you guys are better at

725
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:23,720
games than me because i just growing up i thought side quests were just a waste of time oh you fool

726
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:28,440
like i did not think that side quests were worth doing or that there was any reason to do them i

727
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,600
was like people only do this if they're fucking like weird or something right like i just well

728
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:38,200
you're not wrong i just literally well the thing is that a lot of japanese games expect you to do

729
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:43,960
all the side quests just to beat the final boss like like okay yeah shadow hearts covenant for

730
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,120
instance is a game that i absolutely loved and i played it all the way through to the end and i got

731
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:53,000
the final dungeon was pretty hard but i was still beating everything in it yeah and then i get to

732
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,560
the final boss and he's just like curb stomping me like i can't do anything to it and i realized

733
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,080
like i i think i looked at a strategy guy there he said i had to be like it's fucking vehumet

734
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:08,280
it's fucking vehumet time all right i just happened to find an ulcer to vehumet usually you don't

735
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,480
find the god you want until you get to the ecumenical temple but here i am and i found it all right

736
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:18,600
the game's trying to turn in your favor uh what what did you do the environments change it's all

737
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,120
randomly generated it is all randomly generated but it doesn't ever look like something different

738
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,600
yeah yeah there are different regions okay i've i've just been fucking around in the early game

739
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,720
right now this is like the baseline yeah normal dungeon yeah okay now now that i'm worshiping

740
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:37,240
vehumet i just got a and a book but it's probably not anything i want because it was next to this

741
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:43,240
altar of kikubakudga it is kikubakudga's kikubakudga's disquisition on evil and the only spell it has

742
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:47,560
is pain which is garbage so i won't be drinking it should i drink from this fountain oh oh oh and

743
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:54,840
sif muna fuck that um should i drink from this fountain of sparkling water sure why not um how

744
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:59,400
do i how do i do it speaking of old there probably is an answer to sure why not but yeah

745
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,960
i didn't give it oh yeah yeah it can do terrible things to me um i had to do it anyway i'm gonna

746
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:09,560
do it anyway i just fuck how do i real man boys take risks give a yolo or two of this fucking game

747
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:13,480
i mean you're supposed to be going on this card but you can't kirk it every now and then to keep

748
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:20,440
to keep the analogy going um yeah so at the end of shadow heart's covenant yeah i looked at the

749
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:25,000
guide and it's like you should be like level 67 or something to beat this boss and i was like

750
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,120
level 59 and i was like like because again i didn't like process side quests is like an important

751
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:38,520
thing i was like so am i expected to just grind in this final dungeon for like 10 hours well no

752
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,600
yeah because what i eventually realized i mean in your situation that's what yeah well what i

753
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,880
unless you want to go on the side quest were not locked locked out in this game and it's actually

754
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,680
pretty easy to travel around because that game is uh basically you go to a bunch of different

755
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,120
cities yeah it's like each city has a dungeon in it but you could travel between the cities pretty

756
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:01,720
easily um and it takes place in the real world and in the in europe and so i was like i like

757
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,600
eventually it occurred to me oh like they expected me to have done all the side quests to get all

758
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,800
the ultimate weapons for the characters and that would make this boss a cakewalk that's my shit

759
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:17,240
but like jam i had not you know i had not done so that was like so rewarding and so i just kind

760
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:24,760
of play zeno saga yeah zeno saga was my favorite that was that game was my jam i got stuck on a boss

761
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:30,440
10 hours in and gave up dude i did i was right there on my shelf among games i will play one

762
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:36,200
game zeno saga 2 it's sitting on my shelf i never finished they changed the art style dramatically

763
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:41,640
and i got super turned off i didn't like the look of it nearly as much exactly zeno saga 2 is pretty

764
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:47,720
fucking panned by fans but three is apparently a return to form the problem is that three is i guess

765
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,320
a convoluted mess story wise because there were supposed to be six entries and spend 10 years and

766
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:56,040
they got canceled so they had to do everything it's four games worth of content in one so it's just

767
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:01,800
yeah you can't you can't fucking quaff from fountains anymore what the shit man oh you used to be

768
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:06,120
able to like mutate and stuff but you drink this like irradiated magical water but now i guess they

769
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:11,240
took it out what's a bummer they take out features sometimes so this game just got less cool because

770
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,720
the mutant was like half the intrigue well no i mean there's there's other ways to do it but yeah

771
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,200
you can no longer drink from fountains i guess they thought it was extraneous which it was but i like

772
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,520
that uh that's kind of the whole thing this phenomenon you were talking about about hitting a

773
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:32,040
wall i actually fucking love it because it gives me an excuse to go do yeah to go do all the side

774
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,720
quests that i've been putting off to that point because a lot of the time side quest those that

775
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:42,200
will i mean it depends not me anymore but it depends on the game like like okay the most recent

776
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,640
example of me giving up on a game at the very end was persona 2 eternal punishment which i played

777
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:54,600
about seems like a close to five years ago now and uh the game it's like 50 hours long you know as

778
01:07:54,600 --> 01:08:02,280
as rpg's tend to be and like i do like i love persona like shin megami tense is the the like

779
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:07,880
still how like how i got over niponichi i haven't gotten over shin megami tense even though i should

780
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:13,080
because the games are just so perfect they tell you about persona or the all of them persona and

781
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:18,600
the rest because the aesthetic is just everything i ever wanted like they look exactly what like

782
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:25,240
what i want they look how you want to look they fuck how you want to fuck but but atlas is infamous

783
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:30,520
for making extremely hard games so it's like everything about the game is what i want except

784
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,840
that it's so fucking hard yeah and like the persona games in particular i love the characters i love

785
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:38,680
this the way that you like go back to the same town and everyone has new things to say every time

786
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,400
you beat a dungeon i love that shit right so i'm playing do persona 2 and the thing is that as the

787
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,400
game goes along the story gets kind of retarded and like the second half of the game is just so

788
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:52,520
much less interesting than the first so in the first half i was doing a lot more like you know

789
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,320
like extra bullshit yeah but then as i get grew less interested in the story then it would be like

790
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:02,520
you know i just went through this grueling dungeon and did all this fucking shit and then i come back

791
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:08,200
and i get a cutscene that is not even interesting i'm like oh this fucking blue and then i have to go

792
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:13,640
to another incredibly grueling dungeon and when that happened i was like but i still want like now i

793
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,320
just feel like i want to rush through this to find out where the fuck the story is going yeah so in

794
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,400
the second half i just started yeah the second half i just started rushing did you see those fucking

795
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:27,480
orcs i just came i just came up some stairs about a bunch of orcs and an orc priest um priests are

796
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:32,280
really bad yeah it's this weird shift in proportion where it's like early in the game the story is

797
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:36,200
really interesting and the dungeons are pretty short but then later on it's like the dungeons

798
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,360
are super long and super difficult and the story is like nothing yeah so i just feel like i'm in this

799
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:45,800
endless gauntlet when game is doing a yield turn it's not cool yeah and so the final dungeon in that

800
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,920
game um i was so fucking sick of the game like i just wanted it to be over i was i've been playing

801
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:55,240
for like probably three days and i just wanted it to be done because they're like non-stop for three

802
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:00,040
days you know and i was like i gotta fucking finish this game and they're telling me like you know the

803
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:04,840
final boss if you want to beat him check this shit out what this is that altar over there is an altar

804
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:10,600
of trog the god of rage and for barbarians and stuff this moth in here is a rage moth or like

805
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:15,320
wait he's called uh yeah he's a moth of wrath so he's gonna like sprinkle his rage powder on these

806
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,720
fucking rats and send them into a berserk fury so i'm gonna get the fuck out of here get out of there

807
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:25,320
it sounds like the worst day ever it's pretty bad i mean the the rats are not particularly strong

808
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:30,440
so it's not like sounds bad it could be it could be dealt with dark souls has taught me that rats are

809
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:34,360
not to be trifled with that's true i don't want to be hard wearing bloodborne i don't want to be

810
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:41,000
trifling all right one in isolation is fine i got embarrassingly murdered by a gang of rats it

811
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,280
happens i was i was in uh in maybe you feel less bad about your failures in bloodborne if you watched

812
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:50,520
other new players because well i felt a little better i felt a little better when i watched when i

813
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,760
watched hippo's uh live stream of bloodborne where he was still dying even though he's like

814
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:59,320
mastered that game yeah all right yeah yeah i feel a little less no one just makes it through

815
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,640
you know and that's your the whole thing is like i never even talked about dark souls until

816
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,880
i started talking to you guys and the first time i heard anyone talk about dark souls was when

817
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:12,200
gib was saying i just fucking destroyed dark souls on my first time and i died like twice

818
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:17,880
i was like oh is that a weirdo exception so okay the thing is that hippo hippo played

819
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:23,640
not only extremely cautiously but he violently overleveled in his playthrough like i think i'm

820
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,680
doing that in bloodborne right now he was so unbelievably OP that he did things in his first

821
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:33,640
playthrough that i've never heard of anyone doing yeah because he did artorias in his first try yeah

822
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:39,640
but but he said that artorias he said that he was taking a drink uh like of estes and artorias

823
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:44,840
hit him and he did not stagger out of taking yeah yeah which means that is like for that to be possible

824
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:50,680
he would have to be like like 10 times the level that most people finish the game at like he was

825
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:57,320
so over leveled it's unbelievable that's crazy so yeah i grinded for like four days to get leveled

826
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:02,280
before i kept playing the game i just felt like that's a good idea it's it's so boring though grinding

827
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:07,160
that game is grinding is not great in that game it's what in dark i actually i i i saw my tweet

828
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,760
about dark souls i wrote an entire script in my head for bloodborne i was thinking of dark souls

829
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,760
you're talking about bloodborne yeah because i enjoyed grinding in bloodborne really i just

830
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:20,040
enjoyed i hate grinding in all those the act of playing bloodborne is the appeal of bloodborne

831
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:25,080
well here's the thing like bloodborne the only reason i can stand playing bloodborne is because

832
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:29,320
every time you hit something it's like having an orgasm the blood yeah exactly that's why it's

833
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,640
grinding is fun if that if that wasn't there i couldn't play this game i don't give a shit about

834
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:38,600
that shit i just want to fucking grind my exp and get up as fast as possible do things repetitively

835
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,080
over and over like that it gets numbing like the only like i had this whole like thing planned out

836
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,680
was like because i was i was comparing it's like action games i like that are hard like ninja

837
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:51,080
guide and a devil may cry it's a different kind of game completely sure like the the appeal of

838
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:56,600
devil may cry and stuff is like magic how you kill the guy and the the fun in bloodborne is if

839
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,600
you'll kill the guy that's true you don't know if you're going to be able to make it like that's

840
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,920
why you're co-incostrously and like the thrill is like when you have like less than half a life bar

841
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,200
and like you're just kind of getting by by the skin in your teeth well the thing is that you feel

842
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:13,720
like a fucking winner once you once you're great at the game it shifts to the other one because

843
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:19,720
like the way that my friends who are really into souls games play it's all about how fucking much

844
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:24,600
can i gimp myself and still beat this boss i guess you know like how can i play this game at level

845
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,560
one with only shields yes i can that's kind of that's kind of my big problem with with bloodborne

846
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:35,080
right now is that like in order to like blew it effectively you have to like treat it as a game

847
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,000
and that sounds really fucking stupid and i'm trying i've i've been like thinking about how i

848
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,120
want to make a video about this and explain this concept and i don't even know how to describe it

849
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:47,320
in words correctly yet is that like i like kind of not passively experiencing a game but like

850
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:53,000
kind of getting lost in in the the world and the idea of the game like when i played mass effect

851
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,160
like i was in space like i wasn't sitting at a computer playing a game you know with bloodborne

852
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:01,960
it's like you have to actively be aware of all the mechanics and i don't believe in immersion i i'm

853
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,200
so i believe i'm the biggest boner for immersion ever i'm not immersed i'm not having nearly as

854
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:11,080
much fun i don't believe in it i don't think it's real i've immersed many times in my life at least

855
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:16,600
i think i have and i wouldn't trade it for all your patreon bucks in the world you know oh i just i

856
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:21,480
don't get it okay i traded for a majority of patreon i don't i i wouldn't be happy about it if you

857
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:26,200
never get immersed in anything then what's the point of experiencing any story i don't i don't

858
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:31,960
get the idea like i've never had the moment where i stopped believing that this is a story no i don't

859
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,640
i don't see everything in don't believe it's a story you see it becomes so like you just forget

860
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:41,480
in it you're not thinking about anything else like um when i'm playing something like mass effect

861
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,920
like i'm not even like conscious of the fact that like there's i'm sitting in a chair and i'm

862
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,920
holding a troller it's just like you're living vicariously through those characters and those

863
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:53,080
events and so it's just like like if someone the only time you remember you're holding your

864
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,360
troll is when someone like bitches at you like oh fuck you have to pause it you know about this

865
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:03,320
forgetting shit but like uh like when when ace died in one piece that emotionally devastated me

866
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:07,720
and i couldn't do anything for a few days i mean that's getting immersed to me it's the totally

867
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:12,040
if that's what immersion means then i've been immersed but like i don't i don't i've never

868
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:17,080
forgotten that i don't think you ever think it's real when people when people talk about immersion

869
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:22,120
the way that like they mean when people say like you know i'm not even analyzing it i'm just immersed

870
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:26,600
in it like that doesn't happen to me i don't have a moment where i don't think about it i don't think

871
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:31,880
your autism never gonna let you get to that level no it's just like i mean when i'm watching a great

872
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:38,280
movie i'm constantly thinking about why it's so great i'm always thinking like oh my god this scene

873
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:43,160
is constructed so well you know i have to like i have to like flip a switch in order to go into

874
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:48,920
that mode and i feel sad sometimes because i have such a dip like there are times where i'm i'm

875
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:54,600
seeing a movie and like i feel bad that i'm thinking so much about why it's making me feel

876
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,920
emotions as opposed to just feeling the emotions someone who can flip the switch i will say that

877
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,840
when i do flip the switch and then and i like realize the flaws of something it just makes me

878
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:08,200
feel stupid for letting myself be so retarded i've had that i've had that before but i'm more

879
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:15,240
i usually am more devastated by the fact that i can't just feel something unless it is so

880
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,440
unbelievably powerful that it's like with your personality if you could do that you'd never

881
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,720
let yourself do it anyways you'd never be like well i'm just not going to analyze this because

882
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:28,360
the immersion was so great right well shit i mean you're just saving yourself a step right

883
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:33,240
this is this is sort of why your brains optimized for your fucking yeah well i keep i keep telling

884
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,840
people like uh i've had this problem that i've been talking about in the decompression chambers

885
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:42,920
and stuff that like i need a 10 like i am so desperate to watch another 10 because i've been

886
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:49,000
trapped in this world like like all of 2016 not a single anime came out that i would give

887
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:57,720
above a nine not one and all i want is a 10 because even a nine a nine to me when i watch it i'm

888
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:05,480
thinking wow this is executed so well and when i watch a 10 i'm just thinking oh my fucking god

889
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:12,120
i love everything like and that that that leap i need that like when i watched speed racer for the

890
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:17,960
first time i wasn't thinking about the like like oh my god it's a ghost of my last character

891
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:25,080
he's here with a fucking vengeance oh man that's super cool i don't think i can beat it run can

892
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,080
you just say hi maybe do you say the ghost of your own character yeah yeah the one that just

893
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:33,640
died he's i just saw it but i'm but i'm getting off forget i'm getting out of here i'm getting

894
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:38,920
the fucking that's pretty cool that's awesome as shit yeah you can like you you just will

895
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,600
eventually have like this is definitely the coolest game ever made yeah i'll say i'm gonna

896
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:48,360
fucking and now i'm gonna die because there's a fucking ant that did the the the the the what

897
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:52,520
she's like that right there that would just i don't have anything to heal with can you go back to the

898
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:59,720
other floor can you go down the stairs the ant will follow me that's so gay see it's it's important

899
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,640
you stairs he's so small take him forever take him a month to get down i'm gonna die i'm gonna

900
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:10,520
die heal i don't have anything to fucking heal with let's do something i'm dead oh there was

901
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:19,240
no there was nothing damn it i couldn't i'm sorry i'm sorry everyone i used stone gargoyle

902
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:24,600
i i feel bad that i just don't grow i just want to make it to level two i haven't even been able

903
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:29,640
to make it to the ecumenical temple shameful which is like oh my god i'm getting gang bang all at

904
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:34,280
the gate but whatever whose phone keeps fucking doing that noise mine made a noise just now i think

905
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:38,920
that sounds like an iphone sound effect so the fact that every your android phone does it is like

906
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:44,120
sending me into a frenzy it's like only me and munchie have them anyway would it really disturb

907
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:49,080
you if i had an iphone uh no i just the fact that you don't and it's making iphone noises

908
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:54,680
is kind of freaking me out that killed me that's fine nope no biggie the first encounter yep what

909
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:59,400
the fuck don't worry about the the the downsides of random generated levels there there were just

910
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,440
there were just like three dudes they're waiting for me okay i think i'm probably gonna die to

911
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:10,680
this hobgoblin too oh no oh no i made it okay sweet all right well so so so that moment that he

912
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:15,080
had just now with the other guy it's unfortunate because i wasn't playing the game and i never

913
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,640
would because i don't understand this game yeah but that was a 10 out of 10 moment for me that is

914
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:25,240
that which one which one when you find the ghost of your own self oh yeah at no point did i think

915
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:31,960
about like the possibility why why is that cool or anything like it's just it is so obviously amazing

916
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:38,040
that that is that's what i that would be immersion for me like not that uh not that i'm like lost in

917
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:42,840
the world but that like there was just a just sounds like you're so fucking jaded that you need

918
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:48,920
something exactly i am extremely fucking jaded and it takes something being like like i can't believe

919
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:53,560
this happened and i never would have expected it and it's like blowing my mind that it's real

920
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:59,560
that's what it takes to make me like feel anything that's that's not being a youtube man is this you

921
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:04,200
just that's the downside to your obsession for quantity you're just kind of like blowing through

922
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:09,480
your wow factor way too quickly it's true and it happened all at once with anime i mean why why

923
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:16,760
why would you be why would you be satisfied with anything less yeah exactly like anything less

924
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:22,440
is good but it's just not you know but the thing is that the only way i can find

925
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:27,800
i'm sorry he's looking one of his old videos the college graduation video i just got a comment

926
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,400
he's looking at a comment i saw i just had to i had to give him kudos for the music choice on that

927
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:40,120
video yeah great he learned it from watching me all right well but bonita that's not true that's true

928
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:47,800
that's true um anyway uh yeah you're right that i'm jaded but the problem is that i never find those

929
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:53,800
10 out of 10s by chance i only find them by seeking them out well and like by watching at this point

930
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:58,200
i feel like that's kind of just the nature of the beast you've become you i mean you can't watch

931
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:03,640
everything to try and find those that's digi's goal that's what i've been doing he's like he's

932
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:08,120
being audacious like the problem is that admire your drive well the problem is that the stuff that

933
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:12,840
i end up loving the most is never stuff that everyone else loves the most and so i have to go

934
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,640
find them like i can't look at a list dude you know oh my god magic rings it's made of bones

935
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:23,160
have you find it have you consider that it's finally time what to learn japanese and dive deep into

936
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:29,960
that whole other cool shit the the level of manga that i will like like i've been saying this

937
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,480
imagine all the light novels you could read that like should have been published instead of

938
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:38,920
instead of fucking sao well light novels are inherently bad like that's i'm about to disagree

939
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:44,440
that rule you're you're not necessarily writing a light novel oh i will like if it's not bad then

940
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:49,720
it's not a light well if you're defining it like that then i think our case is already complete well

941
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:56,280
well you're you're too old to be a new light novel writer they're all like 18 and shitty that is

942
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:00,760
like really depressing actually i think about it i'm an old man that can't be right why is there

943
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:05,640
like some cadre of older better writers we're like well look at these retarded kids making

944
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:11,640
bank on this shit why don't we get on it my point is that like what is considered a light novel is

945
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:16,680
like the necessary element of it is that it's a shitty novel it's just like young adult fiction

946
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:22,600
right i yeah but it's it's young adult fiction that is like deliberately of like like like you

947
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:27,320
would describe it as a light novel because it is not of the heft of a real well how different is like

948
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:32,040
a story online from like a hunger games they seem pretty comparable to me they are and hunger games

949
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:38,440
is terrible so that's exactly the same thing it's entertaining in its own way yeah so i would uh

950
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:42,760
i don't know a 30-year-old 30-something-year-old american women wrote that two years worth of

951
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,680
semen float in a blopping sound and float endlessly into opera that was not any of the

952
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,280
published versions i don't think i don't think you're gonna find a line that i don't think you

953
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,360
have to be kind of dumb to write a book like like okay or maybe i'm under arrest to make them

954
01:22:54,360 --> 01:23:00,120
i'm like the biggest i used to be like the biggest light novel guy in the world like like when i was

955
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:05,240
reading them before well because light novels before they became something that everything

956
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:10,920
in anime is yeah uh i was reading them in like the mid-2000s but nobody knew what they were uh all

957
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:15,400
that shit right there you see on that shelf that's all light novels is anything worth reading

958
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:21,800
yeah a lot of it okay well i'm i'm looking for stuff to read boogie pop boogie pop was my world

959
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,440
is that gonna turn me into you because i don't know if i want to go down that road

960
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:32,440
no i mean if you if you read if you you know you read some of my book a little bit i read a little

961
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,720
i need to read more it's it's like people who like the one the couple of people who read my book who

962
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:43,960
had read boogie pop were like you just cloned boogie pop like that's all it is okay um because

963
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:49,000
the well it's like it my book is just boogie pop meets bakano that's like and gunslinger girl like

964
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,200
if you combine those three you've got my book but uh it's not a terrible combination yeah and like

965
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:01,000
bakano okay bakano great example phenomenal anime um okay you might be explaining a point

966
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:07,720
i was just about to raise but keep going bakano is a phenomenal anime um the light novel took

967
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:12,920
four took almost 10 years to finally come stateside it came last last year uh they released it in

968
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:18,680
only in a 20 dollar hardcover because they knew how badly people wanted it so they released it only

969
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:23,560
in a 20 dollar hardcover now here's the thing what you have to understand about both manga and light

970
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:30,600
novels in japan is that they're like five dollars like a light novel is like this this little tiny

971
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:35,800
fat book that ring of protection of magic baby that they put out in like all right finally getting

972
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:42,520
stacked i i hope okay okay there's a race in this in this game that is the octopode it is literally

973
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:47,800
just a sentient octopus nice and it's cannot use like most equipment but the one thing it can do

974
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:52,520
is it can wear eight magic rings at the same time uh so if you find eight magic rings you're just

975
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:57,480
fucking you're fucking set because someone captive planet all by yourself isn't that good to get eight

976
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:04,840
rings well rings are wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait ben what ben i have a

977
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,960
question for professor sains what i can wear 10 magic rings what are you talking about the rule in

978
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:16,760
dnd and in much fantasy is that one ring per hand that's fucking gay is doesn't make any sense is the

979
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:21,720
thing in but an octopode has eight hands if you get a mutation with a new arm you can wear another

980
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:28,520
why is it just counted as one hand they're all coming from the same central appendage um stop ask

981
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:35,240
jesus two questions anyway keep going yeah so so so light novels in japan are these little five

982
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:39,960
dollar rinky dink little books that they fucking shovel out and they come out like every three months

983
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,400
like like if you're if you're reading a series speed yeah that'd be nice i mean look i have nothing

984
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:49,400
but respect for white light novel authors because they're so fast yeah but the stuff they're writing

985
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:54,600
is fucking dog shit so like like rekkie kawahara for instance you either understand about soren online

986
01:25:54,600 --> 01:26:02,680
and excel world is that each one has at minimum two books a year at minimum both series are running

987
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:08,600
at the same time two books a year usually they edge towards four books a year okay so he's writing

988
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:15,000
these like every month to three months okay these are cheap disposable fiction they are meant to be

989
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,520
things that young people can buy you know for the cheap read quickly get the next installment

990
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,760
in a couple months read a whole bunch of them and they come out like constantly the ones that get

991
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,600
made into anime are the really successful ones but there's a ton of light novels they're really

992
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:33,960
oversaturated in market so there's just shitloads of these crappy little books coming out now when

993
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,280
they release these stateside because the market for them is so small here and there's such high

994
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:42,920
demand from people who really care about them they jack the price way up so right now the average

995
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:48,120
price of a light novel is 14 dollars bakano because it was in demand for so long because it's this

996
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:52,920
niche that people have wanted it for you know all this time 20 dollar hardcover so i bought it

997
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:58,840
because i had to of course um you know and i was hoping they were gonna like only do that for the

998
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:04,120
first book and maybe release like cheaper versions later of course not you said you set the standard

999
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:09,240
on that you jumped on it oh no i drank a potion of mutation well i feel frail my feet thickened

1000
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:15,800
and deformed i feel the magical essence link to my wands what the fuck does that mean i have no

1001
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:21,800
idea what that means that's you expend magical power to strengthen your wands or whatever frail

1002
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:27,160
is terrible cloven feet is actually pretty shitty because it means i can't wear boots okay i need a

1003
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:33,000
potion of cure mutation wow that's that was that that was a good luck with this third run that's

1004
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:39,800
so good that the the real bad thing is the frailty like by the time i'm finding good boots

1005
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:45,480
it's not unlikely i'll have found a potion of cure mutation yeah um boots yeah i mean your

1006
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:49,640
goal eventually is to get kitted out with like a good piece of equipment in every one of your slots

1007
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:56,200
and then your fucking like every game ever made yeah so so anyway i only bought bakano because

1008
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:00,600
i knew i could write it off of my taxes because i'd make a video about this exact concept i'm

1009
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:06,200
talking about but um have you done that yet yeah i did uh i didn't watch it uh it was called

1010
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,880
have have manga and light novels gotten too expensive was it on after dark yeah it's on

1011
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:15,640
after dark i'm not subscribed after um if you want to be polluted with videos every single day then

1012
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:20,360
by all means that's why i'm not subscribed uh so it's too much they're all fantastic everything

1013
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:25,320
i've ever made you know anyway bakano i bought this damn book and i started reading it and

1014
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:32,120
it's it's not well written like that's my huge complaint yeah i was so fucking stoked to check out

1015
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:36,440
oh you read it too no i didn't read i haven't watched bakano another thing on my list to do um

1016
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:40,360
but like i really enjoyed no game of life and i was like oh read the light novels they're terrible

1017
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:44,680
they're so fucking i like flip through one in the store i'm like this looks like it was written

1018
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:48,920
by like a five year old yeah and i wasn't sure like is it just translation or is it like they

1019
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,840
actually written by retouch because they're written like i said in like three months but here's

1020
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:57,640
by like a 20 year here's what i don't understand okay um because i just recently read the entire

1021
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:02,680
series of animals which is it's kind it's not the same thing but those came out once a month

1022
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:08,280
there's 12 books a year but those are like okay apple gate is a beast they're smaller books but

1023
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:12,760
like the concepts in there are like fucking great like it's one of like the best like books talking

1024
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:17,800
about like the the psychological effects of war which i mean it's this probably better maybe

1025
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:24,120
exaggerate no no it's not not like okay not not like the best ever but like it's like it it treats

1026
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:28,120
it really realistically and like goes into a lot of things that you wouldn't expect for a book written

1027
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:33,080
for that like age demographic it's fucking great that's like the coolest it's the coolest thing

1028
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,160
it's i would do not regret spending 60 on all of animals all right that's cool that was well

1029
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:42,760
worth it but it's just like why why can't like a quote unquote i guess like young adult write

1030
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:47,080
something of like just it okay you have to understand as well that part of the thing with

1031
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:54,120
light novels is that they come from they're very edgy yeah a lot of the a lot of the concept behind

1032
01:29:54,120 --> 01:30:00,680
them like the people who did it in the beginning we're kind of like no no this fucking priest won't

1033
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:05,560
leave me alone like some people let's talk to you about jesus some people credit boogie pop with

1034
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:11,480
having been like yes got influence light novels to happen like as as a thing right yeah and boogie

1035
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:17,080
pop the whole idea was that the the guy who wrote it cohe kodono um his writing was too weird

1036
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:21,800
no one would publish him because his writing was too weird um he described it as boogie so he decided

1037
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:26,600
to fuse it with pop sensibility hence boogie pop yeah we've heard this a thousand times yeah yeah yeah

1038
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,920
i'm explaining to tom who doesn't watch after dark all right i think i i have heard you say this

1039
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:35,320
before well anyway that's not that important i don't think i can do it not here that he tried to

1040
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:41,560
make you know a pop just found a pizza just found a pizza in the dungeon right yeah threats most of

1041
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:48,280
what's unique about boogie pop as a book is not really like that it's a great story it's the it's

1042
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:52,760
the format of it that it's like five different characters each telling their own part of the

1043
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:58,040
story which is you know it's like there's a lot of like gimmick elements to it so it's like it's

1044
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:04,760
basically just like anime characters in an anime story but it's presented in this very obtuse

1045
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:10,040
strange way with like a sort of rambling stream of consciousness writing style interesting and

1046
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:16,280
that's what some like a lot of the early light novels all of them are like these very um outsider

1047
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:23,080
art stream of consciousness kind of shit but like you when you look back on them as an adult

1048
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:28,040
you can feel the fact that you're older than these authors were when they wrote them and you really

1049
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:36,520
feel that like they're not geniuses they are just like writers who gotta start early you know and like

1050
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:42,600
yeah like i read boogie pop now and even though i still really appreciate it and how like you know

1051
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:49,080
where it innovated and how interesting it is like the actual writing is pretty immature and that's

1052
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,920
true of like all light novels and the thing is that most of the people who are writing them were

1053
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:57,720
influenced by the old ones and there's just a degradation over time it only gets worse yeah

1054
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,280
new light novels are only worse and worse and worse than older ones so if you read a lot of

1055
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:06,920
those ones on the shelf for the original generation if you read new nicoe scene i hear the sound of

1056
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,680
rushing water that means there's a special portal on this level that'll take me to like a hear this

1057
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:15,240
game well no it says what it says i hear the sound of rushing water anyway that means i need to

1058
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:20,680
find a portal and get there because there's a secret level um that will probably have a nice

1059
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:26,680
treasures for me read but yeah if you read the writing of nicoe scene or kohe kodono or any of

1060
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:31,480
the people in foust which is those two volumes there that say foust those are like compilations

1061
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:37,000
cool and it was like it was a magazine that existed in japan that was half like mostly like

1062
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,560
light novel authors writing short stories and then they also had manga stuff in there and like

1063
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:47,720
everyone in there has like a very distinct like dark edgy kind of teenage like young adult style

1064
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:52,840
but those stories were very like even though they took a lot of influence from anime and video games

1065
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:59,400
they read more like young adult fiction like it was they took place in like you know urban areas

1066
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:05,480
and they had like real stories and some drama but then over time they like light novels just

1067
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:12,040
became anime and it just became like all the tropey bullshit and uh and now they're just garbage

1068
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:17,720
they're all fucking terrible and and it strikes me as odd that that happened why could you just

1069
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:22,280
write fiction for you know young adults and not have it devolved because they're they're they're

1070
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:27,400
being like the problem is that those guys who wrote the original ones were probably influenced by real

1071
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:32,840
books writers yeah right of course like like uh catcher in the rye they all owe a lot to to that

1072
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:36,440
you know they all owe a lot to the catcher in the rye they they even in one of the foust volumes

1073
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:41,160
there's like like a few of them nerd out about it you know really love that sure not be catcher in

1074
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:47,240
the rye is you know is something that young adults love sure you know it's written in a way that that

1075
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:52,760
audience can appreciate it but it's a real book but if you only read stuff that are influenced by

1076
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:57,960
that that's a little worse and then those people are the right you know and everyone keeps writing

1077
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:04,200
worse and worse stuff yeah and if you're writing like i want you to imagine that someone because

1078
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:08,840
this is something that happens all the time and it happened to me as a kid we probably all experienced

1079
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:15,240
this no no you watched sort art online or something like it some shitty show that was your favorite

1080
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:21,160
show and you immediately decided that you wanted to be a writer and your only influence is that one

1081
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:25,960
shitty show you watched so you try to write something exactly like that yeah and if you're

1082
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:31,000
successful at writing something exactly like that shitty successful show you also have now

1083
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,480
written a shitty successful show it's just that it strikes me as particularly strange that the

1084
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:42,280
market would come to support like shittier products instead of rewarding the what i would assume is

1085
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,520
better quality stuff you know what i have a theory on this because it's easier to make it's easier to

1086
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:50,920
make but i think we're just talking more to the who's buying it right yeah it's the same people

1087
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:55,400
the dude here's the thing we can tie this all back together it's the exact same mentality is why you

1088
01:34:55,400 --> 01:35:00,440
bought all those fucking games because the aesthetic of the book itself yeah and the number one thing

1089
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:04,280
you remember it's all marketing it's the it's the producers the most important thing to remember

1090
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:10,520
about light novels is that the writing doesn't matter the cover matter exactly because every

1091
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:15,960
novel is a two-man team it's a guy who wrote the book and then the guy who did the illustrations

1092
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:21,000
and those guys are equally important exactly they are of equal importance if not the character

1093
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,440
designers even more you know and these character designers like like whereas the the art the the

1094
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:30,680
writers are all these you know these young dudes who are probably submitting to contests like you

1095
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:34,680
know dengueki bunko probably has a contest like every month hey who's who wants to be a writer

1096
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:40,840
you know you do your story shit let's publish it and then they farm artists off of like pixiv

1097
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:44,600
you know pixiv yeah so they'll just go on there and find someone who's popular and be like let's

1098
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:50,520
hire this fucking guy makes sense super underpaying yeah exactly and slap that guy's fucking art on

1099
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:55,960
this guy's shitty book and now you've got a product and now you've got the asterisk war you know uh

1100
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:00,440
or or like like with the in the case of the asterisk war the guy had previous who did the character

1101
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:06,600
designs had previously done a series called uh what the fuck is it called is some other bullshit

1102
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:12,280
fucking shit and it wasn't shit great yeah it was a bullshit shitty show that was really popular

1103
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:17,000
because of how hot the girls were and it's like there's no reason that asterisk war would have

1104
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,280
gotten an anime if not for the fact that the same character designer did that novel and like they

1105
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:27,320
probably just like some novelists came up with the story and they said oh let's put a let's put

1106
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:32,520
this guy on it and they put that guy on it and now that novel regardless of what it is has a future

1107
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:38,280
because that artist drew two you know life is successful because she was on the cover but the

1108
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:43,320
people orchestrating all this are the people at these companies that choose to publish these books

1109
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:46,360
written by these people they're the ones who get in touch with these artists because they don't have

1110
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:50,760
to pay anybody a lot of money it's because they know they'll sell a fuckton yeah and and they see

1111
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:54,840
soulless fucking scum sucking faggots who need to be executed well they're picking out a day

1112
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:59,640
they're picking up the story as well going to japan it's daytime there it's these people we can take

1113
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:04,360
them out it's these people whose responsibility it is to support the company they work for and

1114
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:09,320
guarantee the return on investment through these books and these light novels and these artists

1115
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:15,320
and whatnot it's it's that need to produce and get a return on your investment that's really driving

1116
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:20,120
artistry out the window and bring in bullshit but here's the thing and i mean people can look at this

1117
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:25,480
and be like uh like how is it that all these bullshit things keep getting successful yeah but

1118
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:31,640
that's the thing is that only a small percentage are actually successful but they're paying for all

1119
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:36,520
the failures because like because like i said before whereas only some of these are getting

1120
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:41,880
anime adaptations there are fuckloads of light novels getting published and most of them just

1121
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:46,280
died i know nothing about this market so i don't either i've i've most sure for manga i've tried

1122
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:50,440
googling light novels constantly for manga yeah i've never gotten anything like like how many

1123
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:56,840
times have you started this in any medium how many times have you like a print something not like

1124
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:01,320
anime where it's all made at once like a season is made all in one sitting but like how many times

1125
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:06,200
have you started reading a series and then after like a few chapters it just dies it happens all

1126
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:10,200
the time you know it's tragic and that's like that's what like like light novels they're just

1127
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:15,560
constantly making them and some of them like one comes out nobody buys it it's done but the one

1128
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:20,280
that actually survives that gets the anime it pays for like yeah right exactly so they just

1129
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,320
they turn out as many as they can in the hopes that one of them is going to be the golden goose

1130
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:30,360
makes perfect sense the people are dumb enough to buy one of these right and that's why why i hate

1131
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:34,840
a one picture so much the sora online team because it's very clear because they make like

1132
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:38,760
fucking four shows a season because they're just hoping one of them is going to be the cash

1133
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,880
they're doing the same thing yeah they're doing the same thing and they just turn out constant

1134
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:46,520
shit and like you know every once in a while one of them sticks and they make a billion dollars you

1135
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:53,320
know but uh somebody has to stop your madness yeah so anybody cares the only way to stop it is

1136
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:57,320
these are just pure market forces driving the entire thing the only way to affect it is that

1137
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:02,520
there has to be the the individual people running these things have to have a guiding light within

1138
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:07,160
them that tells them artistry is what i'm here for and that's what i need to do but here's the

1139
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:11,480
question yeah where's the money come from well how do you define artistry yeah because like

1140
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:16,920
sordot online is unbelievably successful yeah which just means people like it yeah so like

1141
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:22,440
whatever people saw in it is not what you know what we saw in it and the only real way like

1142
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:27,880
the reason that people like us like critics have any importance at all yeah is i mean this is

1143
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:33,800
self-serving but we can affect the way people perceive these things that like i have convinced

1144
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:38,120
hundreds of thousands of people that they don't like sordot online and shouldn't support it

1145
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:43,320
you know and like that's the only way thing you've ever done in your life yeah like how else am i going

1146
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:47,880
to affect the market to make less people want sordot online and more people want log horizon

1147
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:52,840
other than to like convince them that they want one and not the other yeah right and uh and if it

1148
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:58,680
works if enough people like me say it then like it might change something but yep that's what my

1149
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:03,080
hope to do to convince people to do things that are better than what they're doing right now yeah

1150
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:07,000
by your standards by but yeah and i would never say that it's anything other than my personal

1151
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:12,680
our job is the most self-serving in the world in that regard yeah that's entirely true oh god it's

1152
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:18,520
a fucking centaur oh my fuck our centaur is being in tough he'll kill me he'll shoot me full of arrows

1153
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:22,760
and i'll die what the fuck got us on this light novel tangent is there something else eventually

1154
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:27,960
planning to loop back to that i forgot probably but who knows yeah no game no life i haven't bought

1155
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:32,440
specifically because the volumes are 14 dollars a piece i'm just so depressed because i want to

1156
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:36,280
know where it goes it's so it's so interesting because like here like in the top side of the

1157
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:40,840
books are shit though right they they i've only read like one half of the page but it was enough

1158
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:45,880
to tell me that that's even if there's shit like because that's the thing like no game no life might

1159
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:49,800
never get a second season and there were only like i thought it was getting something it's getting an

1160
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:54,040
ova it's been a while that hasn't been here isn't it i thought it was maybe i thought i heard something

1161
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:58,760
about that well the thing is that the the anime like the really popular too wasn't it yeah but the

1162
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:03,480
novels were very new at the time so like there was only four when the anime came out it only adapted

1163
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:08,680
three or it adapted three out of the four so there was there was not enough material for another season

1164
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:13,560
and it was publishing slower than most light novels but uh but yeah that's one of the good ones

1165
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,320
when volume four came out in the u.s i was like i kind of really want to know where this goes but

1166
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:23,800
i'm not going to pay 14 dollars for what i know is going to be dog shit writing you know it's not

1167
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:29,880
going to be eloquently written gotta get the uh pdf rip from oh no no no no but so many i'm fucking

1168
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:35,320
bees i love the bees and a demon but that was where you're playing nick cage yeah the swarm of bees

1169
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:41,400
and a demon but that is what i was faced with oh well if you're wondering at all ramp if you're

1170
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:46,120
wondering at all why i'm still behind no the bees are fast and worse please inform and lighten me

1171
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:50,760
because i don't know because the one great thing about light novels is that not unlike this game

1172
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:57,880
crazy fucking ideas get into them like even though the the writing is dog shit like okay a certain

1173
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:02,840
reason i like animorphs there's a lot of cool shit going on yeah a certain magical index is the

1174
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:07,800
perfect example of a series that's like it's full of dumb tropey bullshit just just drink a potion

1175
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:14,600
that permanently made me um weak stupid and clumsy now you know it's like to be me

1176
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:23,320
oh so a certain magical index yeah nothing but like dumb tropey anime bullshit yes it is

1177
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:30,280
it's only sales are driven entirely by waifus right because misaka for some reason is the most

1178
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:36,840
popular waifu of all time and i don't know she's she still wins best girl contests like on both

1179
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:41,800
reddit and on like in japan it's this it's the spats dude it's gotta be this bad it's this girl

1180
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:46,920
named misaka also known as rail gun and her power is that she's like one of the strongest uh espers

1181
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:51,720
in the city and it's there's an academy city it's a city that's all schools that teach people how to

1182
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:57,800
use espers magic and she uses she controls lightning uh and she her thing is that she'll take like a

1183
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:03,800
coin and flick it and it fires like a rail gun and so they call it pretty cool it is cool and she's

1184
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:08,680
just kind of like a sundae girl or whatever who has like she's really strong but for whatever reason

1185
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:13,960
people fucking love her like she's like one of the most popular characters ever and i don't know

1186
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:19,080
why i don't get it either that's special the public continues to baffle me i mean i like her i don't

1187
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:24,760
dislike her i just don't understand the she know i want to just like saber like what yeah i don't

1188
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:30,520
get that even better character design but i don't get the overwhelming love for saber it's just

1189
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:34,440
because i don't know man strong women think about this dude we can't even sit here and complain

1190
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:38,840
about them we just faffed to uh fucking to be downstairs and she has no person i other than

1191
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:44,360
like we can see up her to be is way more interesting inherently than i have any players like you have

1192
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:49,000
some connection i guess but that doesn't do much for me in terms of endearing me to a character

1193
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,480
like i don't like my bloodborne guy at all look to to be is in a whole new world there's time to

1194
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:57,240
explore whatever it doesn't we'll find out if she's interesting with the game yeah we'll find out

1195
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:01,400
we'll find out but like i feel like she's going to be a stereotypical i'd have no emotions and by

1196
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:05,160
the end she'll have some sort of like emotional i don't know i don't know i don't know you have to

1197
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:11,240
understand near as off the rails off the rails it could be anything well i would love to be mistaken

1198
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:15,000
because i really like everything else the game so i can't wait to play that fucking game because the

1199
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:20,600
twists are going to be legit but yeah the guy who makes the the near and draken guard games is a

1200
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:25,400
psychopath and his games are full of weird off the wall wait speaking of psychopaths did you

1201
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:29,640
did i haven't talked to you about the fucking godzilla movie coming out this year have i

1202
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:35,400
no but i'm excited you know of course you're fucking oh my god i'm so ah it's like two of the

1203
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:40,680
coolest things yeah uh i've wanted a godzilla animated movie forever before we go down to godzilla

1204
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:45,640
let me finish my point about that i just i'll put my boat away for just that just that index it's

1205
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:51,720
waifu driven it's full of you know anime cliches and dumb bullshit is it worth reading no it is

1206
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:59,800
because it is it is so fucking unhinged with ideas like index has the most detailed

1207
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:05,320
like series of rules and like like things go like every book basically is just to introduce

1208
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:09,000
as many concepts as the author can think it's super interesting when like things like that

1209
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,720
happen because like you can it's very interesting when you find pieces of media that are doing so

1210
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:19,080
many extraneous things just to like you know like the author or whatever has like one specific

1211
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:22,440
goal they want to do like this is what they actually care about yeah but you can't just do

1212
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:26,920
that no it's like i can't just make up rules and publish them online and people yeah the man i mean

1213
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:32,200
it's basically a wiki the book is like a wikipedia like like you know if someone just wrote a wiki

1214
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:37,160
for a show and then just like loosely turned that into a book that's kind of what it is i do enjoy

1215
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:43,400
those it's it's just and he never stops coming up with shit and it can lead to amazing shit like

1216
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:50,200
for instance um accelerator is a crazy dude yeah no like the concept of the story is that like

1217
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:54,600
there's there's the academy city which is built built around science and they have to teach people

1218
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:59,880
to like use powers so it's kind of an x-men city like like it's all young people learning how to use

1219
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:04,600
superpowers and they only believe in science but then in like in the beginning of the story the main

1220
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:09,800
character meets this girl named index who is with who works for the church and the church is entirely

1221
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:14,920
governed by magic and it's but it's a secret world it's a whole secret world of magic so basically

1222
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:19,560
the story is about this secret world of magic colliding with the city of science which both

1223
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:25,320
have totally different series of rules like the way that science works is really deep and complicated

1224
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:29,800
and has tons of rules and the same is true of the church and magic but they're totally different

1225
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:35,960
from each other it is cool but meanwhile the main character his only power is that his hand can cancel

1226
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:41,400
anything it can cancel all magic it can cancel all science and it constantly cancels his own luck

1227
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:46,440
it can cancel all science so everything for like anything he touches everything will go wrong for

1228
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:51,880
it of course the first thing this is used for is uh the the girl index i'm wearing a protective

1229
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:58,040
magical garment but it's but it's genius how it's done it is because because index her outfit is the

1230
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:03,000
walking church right and it protects her from all magic and she she like brags about it it's like

1231
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:07,240
super powerful or something yeah it's like the most powerful armor in the magic universe and he

1232
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:13,000
touches it and it explodes off of her immediately lol naked yes but but it is a clever it works no

1233
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,720
it works in terms of like it totally works totally objectifying the female lead that's one of the

1234
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:23,240
better ways i've heard she's garbage anyway she gives a part she's a retard yeah a literal retard

1235
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:28,200
and she doesn't matter after the first book uh but i got my tits in the first book you're all

1236
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:33,880
fucking yes she's a she's a lol yeah but uh well this for people like but that's the thing about

1237
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:39,800
index is that like the like the what happens in the story is just dumb tropey anime bullshit but

1238
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:45,560
how and why it's happening is this really bizarre series of crazy i really wish we could get something

1239
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:49,560
like one punch man for these books like someone just like this is good ideas i'm gonna make it not

1240
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:55,080
below dick well the best okay here's i'll give you one example because this is something i was

1241
01:47:55,080 --> 01:48:00,040
watching season two of index and like the first arc of season two was kind of boring up until it

1242
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:05,560
got to this point where like there's there's all these combat nuns right like like that show up

1243
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:08,920
and they're having this huge battle oh i did it and there's and they're fucking did it what did you

01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:29,000
floors deep all right well done level two or level one well this is this is the first zone

1248
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,680
okay i just saw a lot of trees are you going down floors or up floors down you gotta go down

1249
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:38,200
okay you're going deeper into the abyss i wasn't sure if you're already in the ow are you getting

1250
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:43,160
yes i'm being harmed i just like the screen is flashing i'm like usually that's a sign oh god

1251
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:50,360
was a fucking iguana oh my god why is it you defeated i can't deal with this shit

1252
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:55,480
i really don't understand okay i think i can get away ramp up yeah it looks like at all

1253
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:01,560
oh thank fucking thank thank guanas do thank mock lab

1254
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:09,960
so anyways there's all these combat nuns and they're fighting on the roof of this building

1255
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:13,960
and like there's just one girl this game is a fucking clusterfuck i'm getting like i'm having to

1256
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:17,960
like flee every floor like back and forth because there's all these things that i don't want to deal

1257
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:21,400
with but then they keep pushing me back you can't keep running away from your problems then there's

1258
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:27,080
just no end to the stupid shit look that's life okay well i have to run away from my house in six

1259
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:32,280
months well sure okay okay okay combat nuns yeah all on the roof finish your thought fighting fighting

1260
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:36,040
this building and like there's all these people running around with all these different fucking

1261
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:40,040
powers and there and all the combat nuns have different weapons everyone's got something unique

1262
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:44,600
every fucking character's got some completely different crazy shit with its own rules and

1263
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:50,120
there's one character who's like singing this uh this hymn and like it's like permeating through

1264
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:54,520
this this whole area and like it makes it so people can't use like certain attacks when

1265
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:59,960
there's this hym's going and they really need to use those attacks so all the nuns pull out chopsticks

1266
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:05,000
and just stab themselves in the ears so they can no longer hear the hymn and it won't disrupt their

1267
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,800
magic and so they go in and start fighting and i was like like when you see something like that it's

1268
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:15,160
just like everything's justified all the dumb bullshit is justified because that was awesome

1269
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:20,120
it is pretty awesome we need we need some lots of stuff like that they just someone who rents

1270
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:23,880
do you know how they make a bajillion dollars it's super edgy by the way one of these light

1271
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:28,520
well there's a lot of fun well the thing about index is that it has edgy moments but it's really

1272
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:33,800
goofy like i've seen a bunch especially like the anime i mean the anime is goofy itself but the

1273
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:39,560
narration of the book is really like sarcastic and silly and like doesn't take itself seriously at

1274
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:43,640
all like you can tell that it's which is what i like about it it's not that it's well written

1275
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:49,080
but it's very silly it doesn't take itself seriously and it's fun to read and uh and there's lots of

1276
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:52,520
there's just so many like random comments like the main character will be running down a hallway

1277
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:57,000
and he'll like there'll be talismans all over the walls like because of some you know something to do

1278
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,560
with some magic and then he'll like make an observation about like hmm and i noticed that

1279
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:06,040
like it says this thing which means this and like um oh yeah that's why those are there and i'm just

1280
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:11,720
like there's this is so much like it's so much shit um and did you remember when we bought those

1281
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:18,440
rambutans yes i just found some rambutans yes this game is why i know about rambutans although they've

1282
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:22,840
they've generousized the fruits into just being fruits but they used to be you could find like

1283
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:28,920
black currents or like lentils or stuff or just just like okay i found an artifact robe

1284
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:33,160
it's gonna be wait i'm gonna identify it just for fun oh before i put it on every time you do

1285
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:39,560
something it is a plus two robe a tuam oh it prevents me from casting but it's really good

1286
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:49,240
oh you have to cast spells this is it oh my no it's so fucking good but it prevents spell casting

1287
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:54,120
that's the worst possible so fucking good that's good if you need to fucking run away from something

1288
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:58,440
because you're not going to be casting you can buff yourself you'll have it the thing is it takes

1289
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:04,440
it's the robe of ben sainth kind of the thing is it takes a pseudo realistic amount of time to put

1290
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:10,120
on things it doesn't just take one blip it takes like several rounds to put that is that is the worst

1291
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:14,520
thing i've ever heard maybe here's that here's that secret here's that secret entrance i was

1292
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,960
looking for before but it's long since rusted over oh yeah it did not work out that's okay it's

1293
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:25,640
just the sewers fuck the sewers no i was i was saying like what if they want to like make a bajillion

1294
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:28,840
dollars they need to one of these companies who publishes all these light novels they need to

1295
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:34,280
just get that one successful thing we get like a trillion dollars and use like

1296
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:40,200
half of it just like we're gonna hire a team of one get like all the gay step one get like a trillion

1297
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:45,320
dollars well i'm clearly it's not that hard i'm sure these books have editors they're just very

1298
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:51,240
lax they need they need better editors editing editing is is the thing but yeah like like

1299
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:58,040
but the sad thing about all this is that like like something like index um is probably like at

1300
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:03,000
best a six out of ten and it's still one of the better light novels well here's here's the thing

1301
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:09,240
i can just hear you describe that i'm thinking like what if um jeez what if they just like decided

1302
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:13,000
just cut the bullshit and they just just they wrote the book like you just described it's super

1303
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,800
conversational so you're not even reading it with the expectation of reading a book it's just

1304
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:22,040
like i want to hear some guy tell me what's cool of shit that would be great and some of them are

1305
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:26,840
borderline that i mean that would be so i would be so much more down to read something like that

1306
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:31,000
than someone attempted to do pros badly oh yeah i mean like that's every time i get stuck writing

1307
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,360
s l i literally just turn into a valley girl and i'm like and then like they did this thing and it

1308
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:41,000
just it comes out so much easier you don't have to like that's dude for years i was considering um

1309
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:47,000
like abandoning writing books and just writing wikipedia's like i was just going to write wikis

1310
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:52,440
for my stories because though they existed but not actually write the stories and so i mean i

1311
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:56,280
don't know how i'd monetize that but i just like it was the only way i could think to just get the

1312
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:02,760
fucking ideas out there without having to write shitty like like because the uh the the index guy

1313
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:07,000
that's what he should have done that's what he wanted to do yeah well he he just works out well

1314
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:12,920
yeah he's extremely famous no i'm talking i'm talking from a and also puts out integrity standpoint

1315
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:17,720
and also has put out four books a year for 15 years by the way impressive work it is pretty

1316
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:22,760
i will i will not and he runs like several extremely successful series want to do there is

1317
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:30,040
impressive no matter how bad it actually is there is a quote inconspicuous book over right here that

1318
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:35,480
sounds incredibly such incredibly conspicuous um so i but i need to be able to fly to get to it so

1319
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:41,480
oh wait wait wait i have one i have a potion of flight well so i'm just gonna touch this clearly

1320
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:47,160
fuck me in the butthole thing it is a sif moon is compendium of the frostbite uh which is honestly

1321
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:55,480
not that useful so whatever it's a shame oh well that's fine yeah uh god the guy who writes index

1322
01:54:55,480 --> 01:55:02,120
he also writes heavy object which also got an anime adaptation last year and like several other

1323
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:09,160
like he'll he will have years go by where he has written installments into like five different series

1324
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:12,840
and multiples of some of those how do you even keep your brain organized like that

1325
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:19,160
clearly he just doesn't he just needs to have a mental like orgasm every now and then just get

1326
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:23,320
these ideas out of him i mean he's just he's he's one of those guys who's described as like you

1327
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:28,120
know i don't want to do anything but be writing you know like a steven thing or something yeah

1328
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:33,640
nissi always seen is also i gotta get to that point um and he's fucking unbelievably successful

1329
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:39,400
but nissi always seen is another one where it's like in his case it's that he writes such his

1330
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:45,480
okay i would describe his dialogue as so stilted and awkward that it's its own style and it's awesome

1331
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:50,600
like it's it's it's full circle i'll give you the better have you ever seen any of bakemonogatari

1332
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:57,880
or katana gattari or any anything with the gattari in the title oh yeah um

1333
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:04,760
yeah he's known for those and and for some other stuff but his his like his characters all just

1334
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:11,480
have the most bizarre like thought processes and like reasons for thinking what they think

1335
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:15,800
and they just talk that's all they do his novels are just non-stop dialogue yeah it's really

1336
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:20,440
none of which is natural at all but it's so fucking weird that it's really my books

1337
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:26,280
are nothing but dialogue but it's done well not to to my own horn no no go ahead to your own horn

1338
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:31,800
i mean nissi always seen is famous for amazing dialogue it's just that it's it's like amazing

1339
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:39,320
in that it is so out there that it's really amazingly confusing um it's it's so interesting

1340
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:42,280
because like this whole discussion we've been having like this entire time it's basically

1341
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:47,480
saying like we live in like the post-talent era like you don't need to be terrified to be successful

1342
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:54,200
why do i stress myself out so much about being good and yet and yet like like i i it freezes me

1343
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:57,640
in place not be able to do anything because like it's not good enough but clearly being good

1344
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:02,280
is does not matter anymore no well it's not the primer i don't think it ever mattered it's i don't

1345
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:07,240
think it ever mattered well i think it matters significantly less now just because like the

1346
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:12,600
volume of stuff can be done oh dude i found a store well i don't i don't think being good was ever a

1347
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:18,520
thing i think it's just that there was a taste that that was that was calm you know i kind of i

1348
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:22,120
kind of agree with you just because like shakespeare is so renowned and he's basically just like

1349
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:27,960
trash back in his day well like it's just that like the reason taste gets made is like let's say

1350
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:34,200
there's only let's say we're back in the day and you can only publish one book a year like you just

1351
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:39,240
don't have the technology to publish more than one book a year you publish that book everyone reads

1352
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:45,640
that book it's everyone's first exposure to art so their taste is that book it's true now if you

1353
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:50,920
write another book that's nothing like that book people are going to go well that book was good

1354
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:55,880
this is something different i don't like it as much this is bad and then if you write something

1355
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:59,800
that's exactly like the previous book but you know a little different that people go oh this is like

1356
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:04,280
that this is what good is you know and then everyone just takes influence from the same book

1357
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:09,160
and that's what good is and then eventually there's people out there it's a gross simplification but

1358
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:13,800
then there's i can't argue but there's some people who read that book and they go well i hate this

1359
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:19,480
i'm gonna write my own thing yeah and i'm gonna write my own thing and then they write their own

1360
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:26,280
thing and nobody cares about it because it's not good you know to them but then sometime in the

1361
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:32,600
future we now have the internet and you can publish that you can publish that thing and

1362
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:38,440
everyone goes uh like everyone's like well this isn't good until that one guy finds it who's like

1363
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:44,200
this is exactly what i wanted and it used to be that you could only show whatever book you wrote

1364
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:49,640
to the people in your village or to some publisher who doesn't want it right but now i can go like

1365
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:54,440
like imagine your village is the entire world yeah your village is everywhere and like as long as you

1366
01:58:54,440 --> 01:59:00,120
can just get it into the hands of those people who want it then you're good and that's the hardest

1367
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:03,800
part that's the entire struggle of publishing on the internet it's not about being good it's not

1368
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:08,840
about anything it's about finding the people yeah finding your tribe exactly exactly what it is and

1369
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:13,640
it's like where is my tribe are they on reddit are they on fourchan are they over here are they over

1370
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:18,440
there i just gotta spam it are they on tumblr please tell me they're somewhere you know is it the guy

1371
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:23,320
who inspired me is he going to like my stuff as much as i like his stuff let me send it to him

1372
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:27,720
maybe he'll post it on his twitter you know like that's you're desperately trying to find your

1373
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:31,720
tribe it is a struggle for sure this makes me wonder what the end goal of all this is

1374
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:36,280
what's it what's what are we all getting at with this are we talking about humanity oh no

1375
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:42,280
no you got this barely survived all right well barely survived that fucking centaur what are you

1376
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:47,000
talking about the point of like of the creative struggle yeah the point of art in general why

1377
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:51,880
it's consumed i think it's i think the why really why we should give a shit but the point i don't

1378
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:56,120
think anyone needs to give a shit i think the only people that give a shit are the person making it

1379
01:59:56,120 --> 02:00:02,040
for themselves i think i like making it and i need to justify why well to me the purpose of art

1380
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:07,640
is to let people contextualize themselves and the world around them people don't like when you when

1381
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:12,760
you are just like let's say you're just working all the time yeah all you do is work and at some

1382
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:18,840
point you take a step back and realize i don't even like doing this why the fuck am i doing this

1383
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:26,680
why is living a thing why am i alive why would i be doing this and then you read a book and you go

1384
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:34,680
oh that's why that's why that's why it's this thing this makes sense now and then you're like

1385
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:41,240
i i want another and then you read another one and you go and this is how people sustain themselves

1386
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:47,080
through working these like to me the most important thing my videos do is make it so someone who can't

1387
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:53,800
do what i do uh and is working some shit job somewhere doesn't kill themselves today you know

1388
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:58,520
like if my video sounds melodramatic but it actually is i've got lots of comments to this

1389
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:04,680
effect in the past that like you know uh like your video came out today i felt like dog shit and

1390
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:09,160
wanted to die and then i watched the video and now i feel okay like that's the most important thing

1391
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:14,600
my videos can do is make people not want to kill themselves because the simple act of living sucks

1392
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:23,800
you know um yikes something feels off about that like why what is their justification for not

1393
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:29,720
killing themselves by being entertained just feeling just feeling like someone like whatever

1394
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:35,080
you've never been working at your job and just being like this fucking blows balls imagine if

1395
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:40,440
you'd went and worked at your job no i know i came home and did nothing but like stared a wall

1396
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:45,640
and jerk off yeah you just didn't have the artistic spark but what but what am i giving that that you

1397
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:51,240
can't like i think what you're asking is more philosophical it like like okay um why don't

1398
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:55,640
you give an answer here's here's a great what do you think it is i think he's trying to figure it out

1399
02:01:55,640 --> 02:02:00,600
here's a great example from uh from how i have an answer how i've kind of understand this from a

1400
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:05,720
lot of people like um you know i spend a lot of time on forums in the mid-2000s yeah and i would

1401
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:11,320
continually see people uh like like uh this one forum called otaku boards obviously an anime board

1402
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:16,920
and there there'd be threads about like why you're on this board oh god it's prince fucking ribbit

1403
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:21,720
it's fucking prince ribbit guys it's the ultimate frog man he is the ultimate frog there would be

1404
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:27,080
people who say things like you know in my town which is small town bumfuck know where you say

1405
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:33,160
real bad um like i would get beat up for even saying i like anime like like because it's just

1406
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:37,640
not something that anyone else in the community wants any part of and they think it's devil worship

1407
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:42,520
and faggotry and you get beat up for being well they're not wrong now now let's say let's say you

1408
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:47,720
live in the middle of bumfuck know where and you're gay right no one around you understands

1409
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:52,520
and no one around you to talk to and you don't understand anything and then you watch a show

1410
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:58,200
about being gay or that speaks to you even it's not even about being gay but it's the same kind of

1411
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:04,360
thing right and you watch it and you realize oh like this is a thing this is not i'm not a fucking

1412
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:12,040
demon i'm not a literal devil i'm not going to hell uh god isn't real but art is you know and then

1413
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:17,880
you you you find something to to like to connect with and be like oh i'm a fucking human other

1414
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:24,360
people feel this way you know but then you can't talk to it about talk about it with anybody in

1415
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:28,280
your town because they still don't understand you so then you find the internet and you go wait a

1416
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:33,080
minute there's a bunch of people watching this shit and there's there's gay people everywhere

1417
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:38,440
i'm going to be gay with them and then and then you watch my analysis video so you can be gay with

1418
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:42,920
me you know i see the point you're making and that is interesting and i do see a value in that

1419
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:47,960
but you know what's funny is that the way that i think about my videos is they're kind of constructed

1420
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:53,720
with an inherent assumption that of course anime can have intellectual content that is valuable and

1421
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:58,760
should just be accepted but you know what's really fascinating is that my some of my closest friends

1422
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:05,240
in life uh the guys i went to college with um even just recently i was talking with them about just

1423
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:10,040
you know like gurrenlog and just because they watch have seen my videos and stuff and they just

1424
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:16,040
do not accept that initial premise that there is anything good about anime and that there can be

1425
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:21,320
intellectual content with it they don't even get past that and this shocked me i wasn't even able to

1426
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:25,400
process it well you need to remember that was that was the nature of our entire disagreement about

1427
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:30,040
why i even like the show in the first place they just don't understand that remember how it was

1428
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:34,680
when we were all my little pony guys yes the same thing i mean it's the same thing we still to this

1429
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:41,240
day we have people in the pcp oh my god will not acknowledge that like like like like jeff and monkey

1430
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:47,400
both of them anytime pony comes up like they don't seem to like actually think that the show is

1431
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:52,200
like probably any good you might like they really think we're all just fucking crazy yeah they're

1432
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:56,920
like well that show is obviously gay and we tie him up at night and we force him to watch

1433
02:04:56,920 --> 02:05:02,520
i think monkey is in the place that i was before i watched the show and realized that there it really

1434
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:07,560
can't be good oh god it's a bear it's a fucking bear guys for the record i don't think monkey would

1435
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:11,640
like the show oh he gone berserk don't think it would be we need we need to have money watch the

1436
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:16,680
japanese i just don't know then you can appreciate you'd appreciate that more yeah i'm honestly

1437
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:21,240
surprised he has not done i'm honestly surprised he has not done an anime review of my little pony

1438
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:27,480
like before i mean he's planning to do that would be fucking hilarious it seems like an obvious choice

1439
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:32,600
he's he's planning to get bigger plans i think the next fucking uh what's it called anime spectrum

1440
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:37,240
podcast is supposed to be about it really i don't know what to say like you know there's like 17

1441
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:44,120
documentaries so i don't bother going down that route but like yeah like i don't think in in his

1442
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:50,440
or jeff's mind like they even process the idea that it's possible that that show is actually

1443
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:55,720
as good as one of their favorite shows like i don't think they even think that that is a possibility

1444
02:05:55,720 --> 02:06:00,280
i wouldn't you know i guess that just shows that people we really do have barriers within ourselves

1445
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:04,520
that a lot of us have to overcome everybody does i mean i we all had to kind of get through that

1446
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:08,520
to different degrees before i saw the my little pony show i thought it was bullshit

1447
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:12,840
and soon it was terrible you know because like i i had to watch all the old ones with my little

1448
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:17,320
sister because she was like five and i was like this is the gayest shit in the world so it was i

1449
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:21,480
just think it was totally there's nothing that baffles me more and this is this is also true

1450
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:26,360
of stuff like kaon and other stuff i like that people anything people treat this way what baffles

1451
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:34,040
me is what you're about to make people will say things like digi bro you you seem like a smart guy

1452
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:39,560
how can you like this thing and my response is shouldn't you shouldn't you reverse engineer that

1453
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:46,040
and think that because i'm a smart guy the things i like probably have something going on you know

1454
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:52,680
what do you think i just like lapse into insanity every day you watch my little pony for no reason

1455
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:55,560
and this is like the thought process that inevitably got me to watch a show and like

1456
02:06:55,560 --> 02:07:01,000
anything else that initially was hesitant about was that it's like here's like the

1457
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,640
primacy that happens i can either continue to assume that this thing is bullshit or i can

1458
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:09,480
actually give it a shot and i can either a be completely justified in my hatred and nothing's

1459
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:15,480
changed or b i've opened myself up to something new that i like i want more things in my life

1460
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:20,040
to like well you know my friends this was the exact point i raised to my friends and i said well

1461
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:24,680
how do you how do you rationalize the fact that i like the show and get all these things out of

1462
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:29,720
that i have explained in this massive long video that you have seen how do you rationalize that

1463
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:33,800
and their answer was very simple they say nate we think you are just projecting what you want

1464
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:38,120
onto the show and that it doesn't actually exist i don't understand how anyone can think that it

1465
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:42,760
doesn't make sense i don't get it all it is is people who don't make they're giving me so they

1466
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:48,280
don't make art and they don't understand art we went over this in the fucking in the uh the the

1467
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:54,200
intentions of the artist podcast that like everything that's in something had to be put there

1468
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:59,160
you can't just like there's nothing i killed prince ribbit i am the champion of the dungeon

1469
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:04,920
speaking of art art has just been created but wait dead frogs corpse but wait no but but but low

1470
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:10,840
dear viewer look at this it is a human corpse that was left behind by prince he was a human prince

1471
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:16,600
transformed into a blink frog oh my god just kiss him eat him anyway eat him anyway why didn't he just

1472
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:21,880
ask me god you know i guess i guess he can only croak you know he's croaked the dungeon the dungeon

1473
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:28,920
just corrodes our social functions and turns us into monsters well the real monster that's an

1474
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:35,080
interesting point though yeah now i really it's well i okay i kind of want to play devils advocate

1475
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:41,000
in the fact that i think you can project some things well sure it is possible you can project

1476
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,240
but like but there's some stuff to there have to be degrees there's definitely there's definitely

1477
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:51,720
agree you know okay for instance in uh in kill luck hill yeah like um some people have said like

1478
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:56,280
what makes you think that like all the like there's all these themes that are that are supposedly

1479
02:08:56,280 --> 02:09:02,360
there about like um like japan versus the west and like how things went after world war two

1480
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:06,360
sure and people will say like aren't you just projecting what you want to see onto the show

1481
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:13,240
and it's like why would they choose to like recreate the exact three cities that obu no

1482
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:18,760
odonobu naga went to on his conquest and have the like parts of the show take place there why would

1483
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:24,120
they have like these certain names that refer to all these ancient gods who stand for all these

1484
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:29,240
certain things and like like there's all this symbolism in the show that is that is objectively

1485
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:35,080
there like those things are in the show and like you can very clearly extrapolate that these things

1486
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:39,640
symbolize these other things and like people will say like how can you think that it's like

1487
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:44,760
because none of this is here by accident they didn't they didn't just happen to write you know

1488
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:49,480
the same cities and the same gods into the show and it knows not much more of a stretch not to

1489
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:55,400
diminish the artistic integrity of of doing that but like it's easy to think like oh there's no way

1490
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:59,480
they could have planned all this from like a viewer's perspective but when you're writing something

1491
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:04,280
and you just have to you're inspired by things then it just it just gets in there people who create

1492
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:08,680
or people who don't like think about art have a hard time realizing yeah because that everything

1493
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:14,520
is intentional yeah you know it's just like every word is intention i could explain every single frame

1494
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:19,480
of every video i've ever made and exactly why i chose to put it the way it was you know and in

1495
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:24,760
another thing oh boy and this might this this might i don't know if you guys will agree with this yeah

1496
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:32,440
but i think that the creative part is and like the ideas is by far the easy part like i could i

1497
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:38,040
can make a show and stuff it with every fucking metaphor in the world the hard part is making that

1498
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:44,440
work agree you know like writing that oh organizing the ideas yeah like like like i mean we could

1499
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:49,400
right now i could just ideas i mean i think this is a great example ideas being easy and structure

1500
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:55,320
being like look i could just pick up this can and be like all right this strawberry to can uh in in

1501
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:59,800
this i'm gonna make a short film where i drink the strawberry to can and i place it on the back of

1502
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:05,960
this couch and the couch symbolizes all of society and the strawberry to can symbolizes the atomic

1503
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:10,440
bomb and i'm donald trump and this is what i'm gonna do to the world you know and i'll wear like

1504
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:14,520
i'll wear like a trump mask and all this will be very obvious when when it comes out you know

1505
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:18,520
so i'll just take a drink of the can and i'll say like fuck the world and i'll put it on the couch

1506
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:23,000
and it blows up the world and you all understand right and like like i just came up that's all

1507
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,280
stream of consciousness that's how a lot of creativity is like the actual ideas is just oh and

1508
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:32,440
then this happens and this happens and this happens and yeah and then like actually making

1509
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:37,800
that into a coherent a coherent narrative that anyone would get that's the hard part yo check

1510
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:42,680
yo check this out check this out i got this sick ass spell called lee's rapid deconstruction and

1511
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:49,720
it refers to the fact that it rapidly pulls apart ie explodes rocks and so it lets you deconstruct

1512
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:54,680
walls so i'm gonna i'm gonna tear a hole in this wall to get at to get at that altar of vehuma

1513
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:59,800
and pray to my the god that i want however another thing you can do with it is you can use petrify

1514
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:05,480
which i also have i haven't done this yet but i may do it you use petrify and then explode them

1515
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:11,320
but so because it's re it deconstructs rocks right petrify an enemy and then explode the stone

1516
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:15,240
statue also it like does shrapnel damage to everything around it hey that's pretty cool i'm

1517
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:18,920
gonna try and use this more because i'm finally getting to a level of spell casting you're turning

1518
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:22,760
into a cool guy i'm finally getting to a level of spell casting that the spell isn't gonna be

1519
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:27,400
misfiring and contaminating me with mutagenic energies every time i tried to do it only several

1520
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:33,720
times but oh yeah only only maybe 10 percent of the time which is acceptable we're gonna be 10

1521
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:37,800
percent muted instead of 40 yeah i've got a line for you that you should that you should have used

1522
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:43,960
on your friends and could use in the future let's hear it it's it's just simply why do you think that

1523
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:48,360
i'm smarter than the people who made this show that's exactly what i was thinking when we were talking

1524
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:52,200
about this why would you think why would you think that i can get all this out of the show

1525
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:56,840
but they can't i was going to say that's giving me a ton of credit yeah like that i just like i

1526
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:02,920
just really am the best guy yeah i just creatively made up all this crazy stuff that the show can

1527
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:08,040
symbolize just because i'm writing for tv yeah clearly yeah like if i'm if i'm projecting all

1528
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:13,720
this i'm clearly a fucking genius and i have great ideas and i should have written this story myself

1529
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:18,680
well okay i'm gonna i'm gonna say something else and and i agree with your statement completely

1530
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:23,000
and i'm not gonna try i'm gonna try and like add an addendum onto it even if you come up with an

1531
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:30,520
interpretation that wasn't uh supposed to be there i don't think that invalidates it no no at all

1532
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:35,800
like there was an interesting uh there was an interesting uh interview with um uh jeff smith who

1533
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:40,360
made the comic bone yeah sure yeah and he was talking about like because they one of they asked him

1534
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:43,560
like like anything like that's like crazy thing that happened with bone like one of the weirdest

1535
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:47,880
experiences you had with like interacting with people who read bone and he was describing experience

1536
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:53,000
where uh there's the the whole like end like end of the story they're going to the series this um

1537
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:58,360
this city called athea and they're they're trying to get there and they need to get some shit it's

1538
02:13:58,360 --> 02:14:02,120
been a while since i don't remember those specific i just remember they need to go to athea and um

1539
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:06,760
they're traveling to get there and this guy comes up to him at a convention and they're talking he's

1540
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:11,640
like gets the book signed he's like i really was fascinated by athea and like the way that you kind

1541
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:18,680
of um because like athea meant atheism right so the whole thing is a metaphor for like the the

1542
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:24,120
crumbling of like religion and going for like humanistic interpretations of things and and he's

1543
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:29,400
just like what the fuck what the fuck just happened what the fuck just happened what do you mean

1544
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:37,800
just like 50 turns past and i died uh did i sit on yes you fucking sat on the keyboard and killed me

1545
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:46,680
i'm sorry wait how did that work though there's a button there's a button what button

1546
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:52,440
s or space or whatever the space bar then that sucks too the f for the fuck you button it was an

1547
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:58,440
accident oh my god i was gonna make it that time i was gonna make it to the ecumenical temple

1548
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:07,400
all right pee break i'm sorry i'm gonna piss away my tears oh my that's that's terrible um i'm

1549
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:11,560
i'm embarrassed that i'm not making it further on these runs but yeah the reason that was at your

1550
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:15,720
fault the reason he called the city of thea is because it was just a play on the gold on

1551
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:22,600
the reason he called the city athea it was just like he just like took athena it took out a letter

1552
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:27,000
athena it sounded cool yeah but like this guy took it and totally ran with that but like

1553
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:33,080
that doesn't technically make it like invalid like it's because like here's the thing how you've

1554
02:15:33,080 --> 02:15:38,680
never talked to the guy who made it yep so how do you know what he was thinking yeah you can only

1555
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:43,640
infer you can only infer so varying degrees of even if it's like super obvious like maybe it wasn't

1556
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:49,560
like maybe this guy like clearly like that was i mean as long as he doesn't like like okay there's

1557
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:53,560
a difference between saying i got this out of it and saying like this is what it means yeah yeah right

1558
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:59,640
the story is not about that but you can have that interesting take on it sure like like how i

1559
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:05,800
have like made sordot online better for myself by believing that kirito is a new type and like

1560
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:11,640
like to me that's canon and i know it's oh well i don't know that it's not intentional but to me

1561
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:17,160
it's canon and it makes the story better and as far as i'm concerned it's true does anyone want a beer

1562
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:22,120
we have some right here yeah this um yeah with this pass oh you brought it up okay

1563
02:16:22,120 --> 02:16:26,920
yeah i was gonna i will take one i'll take my actually i won't i don't know why i want

1564
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:34,440
i have my cup of water not sitting right there i'm too late for beer

1565
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:43,320
yeah a little bit it's too late i can't i can't fucking believe this dude i was on level seven

1566
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:51,320
i was doing so good ah yeah drow new sorrows it's all my fault you can punish me with your

1567
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:52,520
pee pee

1568
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:02,680
dear viewers apparently did you saying i'm gay over and over is this is a new verbal tick

1569
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:08,840
that's the meme well it's it's the best it's the best meme me and ben have both been doing

1570
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:13,000
i've just been doing it more excessively we've been we've been subject to it since we got here

1571
02:17:13,560 --> 02:17:18,680
and uh when you guys like okay like me and ben just walk around the house like looking at each other

1572
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:25,080
and going i'm gay dude me too man yeah i'm so gay yeah have you seen how gay i am

1573
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:30,600
and the answer is always yes not to be funny it's just fine we admit it it's just i guess we've

1574
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:34,680
been admitting it where have you been we feel a certain camaraderie i'm sitting in general

1575
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:40,600
by by sharing our gayness that's good that's good it's healthy yeah you know it's grow and live

1576
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:45,240
together this is the coming out cast yeah so i think the reason we live together but not in a

1577
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:50,040
gay way they're not yet i'm sure you guys feel the same but the reason i'm so adamant about this

1578
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:55,080
whole thing of like everything in there matters is because i know that there are a million things

1579
02:17:55,080 --> 02:18:01,000
that everything i make means that no one picks up on and that are like like yeah way more thought

1580
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:06,680
was put into this than anyone realizes you know i'm making making something you know making a story

1581
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:11,640
is it's a lot of fucking work and a lot of things have to go into that i don't feel like a lot of

1582
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:16,440
people miss the things i put in then i tend to make things pretty obvious i guess i don't know i mean

1583
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:22,520
my videos have too fucking many things i disagree in my videos not much is missed other than like

1584
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:29,240
references that nobody would get or like just weird personal in jokes that i like like for instance

1585
02:18:29,240 --> 02:18:35,320
the phrase it's all a rich tapestry i work i'll work in the phrase rich tapestry all the time

1586
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:39,000
because it's something that an anime blogger i was a big fan of was like his catchphrase

1587
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:43,720
this guy called anime critique and he would always say it's all a rich tapestry and like

1588
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:49,320
so any excuse i can get to work that into a script i will and like it just sounds like a it's it's a

1589
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:54,200
pretty normal phrase it's pretty innocuous on its own it's only when you realize that i've used it in

1590
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:59,960
so many fucking videos that you'd go that's weird people don't say that all the time yeah yeah but

1591
02:18:59,960 --> 02:19:06,440
like but for me it's this in joke that i'm making like this reference to this this anime guy who's

1592
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:12,040
not even around anymore for the past five he might actually be dead he was he was in like thailand and

1593
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:17,480
there was like he disappeared during a time of political upheaval in thailand oh dear nobody's

1594
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:21,720
heard from him since he was killed on the australian brush fire i really hope not he was one of the

1595
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:27,080
coolest fucking guys on the internet man it will be a real shame if he's gone but hopefully he's

1596
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:32,840
just been in the gulags for a while yeah uh but anyways you know there's there's lots of stuff like

1597
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:37,800
that and then the rap lyrics like the reason i did the whole three hour analyzing my own

1598
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:43,960
raps video it's just because like almost every line it means more than first appears but sometimes

1599
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:49,800
it's just a fucking like the the first word that came to mind that rhymed with the last word is why

1600
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:54,280
that line is there it's interesting how like your creativity has like it has peaks and valleys in

1601
02:19:54,280 --> 02:20:00,680
terms of like how invested you were in things well it's just that like i i really enjoy serendipitous

1602
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:05,960
connections i say this all the time like i really enjoy when something just happens to work out and

1603
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:12,760
it is perfect more so than when i really set out to make it perfect like i find a lot of joy and if

1604
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:19,000
i can if i can write lines that just spiral into one another and it brings me to somewhere cool i want

1605
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:24,840
to carve out my fucking victories from the block of marvel in which they're in case i have found

1606
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:33,000
i am trying to become more i go first but it was gonna say in in art i feel like learning to just

1607
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:38,120
not learning to just kind of draw whatever and just sort of deal with it like like i used to save

1608
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:42,440
all my late i used to save everything on different layers and now i'm a lot more as i

1609
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:46,680
combine layers just put it all in one layer if it doesn't work out they're just like i'll you know

1610
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:51,880
i'll correct it yeah i think it's a more healthy way to do it because it is less sacred and you

1611
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:57,240
get more loose and the other thing is like like okay the one of the reason that champion has taken

1612
02:20:57,240 --> 02:21:03,480
so long is i had a real shitty um work method before where i i sketched all the it's normal to

1613
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:07,640
sketch all the pages and then you go back and ink them but i've been doing nothing but inking pages

1614
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:12,760
that have been sketched for like months now and i've like i'm right i'm right on the cusp of

1615
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:17,240
finishing that and after it's done i'm never gonna do it again i'm never gonna pre-sketch i'm always

1616
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:20,680
just gonna just draw it as i go because that's how i do with brunswick and it was great yeah and i'm

1617
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:26,520
gonna just just not fucking just just not fucking i'm just well it's not that i'm not gonna sketch

1618
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:32,520
it's that i'm gonna sketch and finish all the same in one go um and and just do a video on how you do

1619
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:36,600
that so i can just you have to figure it out maybe i will actually maybe i will actually that will make

1620
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:42,680
for better fucking uh speed draws because you'll be able to see the entire process yeah okay just

1621
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:48,520
give me the the not speed draw version because i have just watching for like six hours i would do

1622
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:54,280
it too that's how i absorb information slowly hence my whole problem that's why i'm still done

1623
02:21:55,080 --> 02:22:01,720
all right um anyway so yeah a fucking fucking whatever let the chips fall where they may that's

1624
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:07,080
all that's what i'm saying the way i write raps is the ultimate in the serendipitous stuff because

1625
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:13,720
i go into every rap with literally no plan i write the first line and like let's say for instance

1626
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:18,840
well here's the one i had like the most plan for was uh i'm mortal and like i was listening

1627
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:23,400
to the beat and it kind of reminded me of chrono trigger and then i thought about how

1628
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:29,800
like in a game like chrono trigger you beat the final boss but ultimately a thousand years later

1629
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:33,960
they're just gonna come back and and all the people you're saving are just gonna die anyways

1630
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:39,080
everyone dies like saving the world is really just prolonging the inevitable for everybody in it

1631
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:45,080
the only way to actually save the world is by creating the singularity and we live forever

1632
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:49,800
you know so yeah everyone else is just a temporary bad guy look at this fucking shit this is an

1633
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:54,600
altar of vehumet right here surrounded by a matrix of fucking spontaneous fireballs well that's

1634
02:22:54,600 --> 02:23:00,440
annoying it's it's a bit i'm vex i'm feeling a bit vexed right now but i want it really bad

1635
02:23:00,440 --> 02:23:07,400
i'm gonna brave this fucking fire you made it i could die any second oh god oh god i'm all right

1636
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:11,960
let's just i want this okay vehumet welcomes you now let's see if his holy fire eviscerates me

1637
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:18,920
before i go yeah you made it thanks no it looks like i was i'm i'm i'm chosen i was i was chosen

1638
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:23,160
by he something i wanted to i wanted to mention about like like creative process and stuff because

1639
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:28,200
i'm becoming more comfortable with the fact that like pain is right and not wrong yeah because like

1640
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:32,920
i like punished myself for not having it come easily where like yeah if you like want to fucking

1641
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:36,920
kill yourself that means you're on the right track and not on the wrong track well let me sort of

1642
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:41,080
it's sort of well depending i mean the whole thing is that like it's not it's not gonna look

1643
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:44,760
just like usually like you said it's carving it out of the marble you don't you don't just look at it

1644
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:49,240
and it appears you know one of my favorite lines guys is uh i forget which bodybuilder said it but

1645
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:57,160
nothing but a peanut yeah ain't nothing but a peanut ronnie colman ronnie colman the classic

1646
02:23:57,160 --> 02:24:01,720
it was uh this is it's about weightlifting but it applies to art in general i think it's um

1647
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:08,120
man is both artist and canvas and he has to chip himself out of the marble in which

1648
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:13,000
is created to sculpt you know whatever you get the idea it's a good line it's a good line yeah so

1649
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:18,520
so anyways that i'm mortal song so that that whole concept i had i came up with the first

1650
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:23,720
three lines based on that concept i would love to save the world but i know every everything dies

1651
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:29,160
we know the cycle never ends but we continue to try if i miss the singularity within my life i'm

1652
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:35,720
fucked and so i wrote the rhyme scheme so then it was just what rhymes with fucked oh no oh jeez oh jeez

1653
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:42,360
so perfect so getting cut by the universe my favorite line in the whole song just because

1654
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:45,880
fucked rhymes with cuck so if i miss the singularity in my full life i'm fucked getting

1655
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:52,120
cucked by the universe now what rhymes with universe verse uh uh it's a little a little

1656
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:57,400
cheap but okay sure yeah well i also do lots of internal rhymes in my songs so i usually am not

1657
02:24:57,400 --> 02:25:02,840
as worried about the end and end rhyme but um what if i pull a sing about me and get shot by the

1658
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:07,400
end of the verse which sing about me is a song by kendrick lemar where a character gets shot in the

1659
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:12,760
middle of a verse it's super dramatic and it makes me cry every fucking time i hear it because he's

1660
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:19,560
he's saying like uh he's like um and if and if this meets you for your album or if i die before

1661
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:24,680
your album drops i hope you and then you hear cucko co and it just stops fucking i never understood

1662
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:29,240
what the hell is going on there but now he's he's like kendrick's reading a letter like the whole

1663
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:33,480
concept of that song is he's reading letters from people from the ghetto who are who are still there

1664
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:37,960
like talking about his music and what it means to them so the one guy's like really you know like

1665
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:41,480
yeah man you really got out there and you're saying something that means something you know i hope that

1666
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:46,840
one day i can make it out but as he's saying that he gets shot and dies it's brutal it's really

1667
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:53,560
fucking horrific um anyways so i'll pull a sing about me and get shot by the end of the verse

1668
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:59,000
the real curse is not knowing yet feeling the need for their goal towards which to continue growing

1669
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:03,880
and never slowing even when it hurts and it's just me thinking like what word rhymes with slowing

1670
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:09,560
and how does that relate to this theme and then i just keep building more rhymes on yeah there's no

1671
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:15,160
fucking plan and any of them all of them are written very fast and uh and i feel bad about it

1672
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:20,520
because my rhymes are the weakest part of my songs is that they're they're not creative they're all

1673
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:25,640
just like the first word that came to mind that i could work into fitting the theme somehow but as

1674
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:32,760
a result that's how i do it too i have like four or five songs where i have the lines um uh uh uh

1675
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:41,880
stacks tax uh like i keep rhyming tax and stacks and health and wealth like i'm always talking about

1676
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:46,440
how i'm trying like like all i really care about is my health and wealth and so i keep bringing it up

1677
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:51,080
over and over again throughout the album because it's such an easy rhyme yes it is that uh that it

1678
02:26:51,080 --> 02:26:59,480
just always comes up but yeah i like that that kind of uh just just run at it as hard as you can

1679
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:05,400
and let make things come out of it out of the uh out of the out of the bullshit i've been in awe

1680
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:13,480
recently being around jesse again it his is almost uh unbelievable ability to spontaneously rhyme on

1681
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:19,880
command yeah it's it's uh it's above what your average human being is capable of it really seems

1682
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:26,360
to me everything that's good about jesse's art comes from a place of just being a literal artistic

1683
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:32,280
genius and like that one certainly seems that way at the very least i i feel like most of what's good

1684
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:38,120
about him has less to do with forethought and more to do with just raw ability to come up with shit

1685
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:42,920
yeah off the top of his head out of nowhere he has good he has good creative it's it's so interesting

1686
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:48,040
for me to be around that it's like a you know it's like a stat balance thing right yeah like he has

1687
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:53,240
all of his points taken out of competence at basic human function and all put into creative ability

1688
02:27:53,240 --> 02:28:00,120
yeah um that's the only that's true i mean when you i want you when you look at jesse if you ever

1689
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:04,920
feel jealous about his creative ability just consider what cost it has come at and ask yourself

1690
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:10,680
if you want to live that life yeah that's true that's true do you want to live that life remember

1691
02:28:11,480 --> 02:28:16,440
just remember what it took to get him here remember you know another remember how he

1692
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:21,960
actually feels about his own life which is pure misery and ask yourself if you want if you want

1693
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:28,520
the talent at that cost and it's also important to reflect on how capable is this person of enjoying

1694
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:33,080
the spoils right which is really not at all what you're saying and then no matter how much

1695
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:38,280
he makes on patreon it doesn't matter because he hates his job you know because he'll just never

1696
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:43,480
forget that girl in high school he knew who i don't even know but something happened and it'll

1697
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:49,400
never forget it well apparently he's now uh like he's now officially i won't talk about this on the

1698
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:56,440
show but i'm curious well talk to him later no i hate it well he's he may or may not be actually

1699
02:28:56,440 --> 02:29:00,920
like hooking up with boozy flusie she might be his real girlfriend she is his real girlfriend is

1700
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:05,160
that a fact well you know i i didn't want to get into that i was just saying they're gonna get a

1701
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:10,040
place together and everything whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa well he's busy moving out of the basement

1702
02:29:10,040 --> 02:29:13,960
i think so i think we're gonna get a place together up there in michigan i'm actually like

1703
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:19,800
really happy to hear that yeah it sounds cool pot potentially positive positive thing uh but

1704
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:24,520
anyways yeah he can't be happy because he hates youtube and he doesn't respect the medium at all

1705
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:32,040
yeah uh but it's also where he makes his money yeah the problem is i hate everything i do yeah so

1706
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:38,680
that's that's not fun that's a challenge it is mentally let's let's go get him he's downstairs

1707
02:29:38,680 --> 02:29:43,880
he's sleeping he's vulnerable let's fucking get him guys like like like kill him yeah yeah like kill

1708
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:48,440
him you know what's our motivation again i don't i don't know okay whatever he's finally started to

1709
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:54,040
be happy we can't why are you asking me about motivation it's time for action question good

1710
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:59,000
boy good boy this is this could be our only chance to do something we gotta find out if you're

1711
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:05,080
killing artists you gain his powers oh god it's segment i don't i don't know if i want if i only

1712
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:10,680
get the powers it's only the powers yeah the rule states the powers not the deficiencies yeah that

1713
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:14,280
just wouldn't be fair that would be nice because you you because that wouldn't be fair because you

1714
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:19,000
only know his powers and you don't really know persons deficiencies i know jesse's deficiencies

1715
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:23,800
well you do i experience jesse's deficiencies all the time such as when i'm trying to get him to

1716
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:29,480
radcon and he hasn't bought a fucking plane ticket until two days into radcon yep yeah it was a very

1717
02:30:29,480 --> 02:30:33,960
port city and is what i would consider a deficiency i i wouldn't argue that fact

1718
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:42,200
i'm gonna fucking have an ulcer oh i have one i don't recommend it oh no i think things will

1719
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:47,720

1720
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:54,760
hospital seven times in the last six months because of stress jeez that sucks yeah good times oh no

1721
02:30:54,760 --> 02:31:01,320
have you considered taking a chill pill um well good idea good idea i've there they

1722
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:05,640
i've talked to three therapists they've all said you probably should be partially committed that's

1723
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:11,800
how fucked up you are i'm just like no oh dear fuck that that is scary so scroll teleportation

1724
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:16,680
oh please activate is there a way to be partially committed there we go it's you do like a nine to

1725
02:31:16,680 --> 02:31:21,560
three thing on weekdays and you just go there they try like a full-time job how do you make money if

1726
02:31:21,560 --> 02:31:26,200
you uh how do you survive you don't do you get welfare if you're partially committed no you do

1727
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:30,680
well then what the fuck why would they yeah what a shitty recommendation it's a week long program

1728
02:31:30,680 --> 02:31:36,440
i guess only do it for one well i guess that's not the end of the world i work on weekend so it

1729
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:42,200
wouldn't fuck with me well why not go for it is it expensive i have no idea i never as soon as as

1730
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:47,480
i said i'm like well i'm not talking to you anymore i'm fucked we're not that fucked i refuse to

1731
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:52,360
admit to myself that i'm that bad well that sounds like a healthy way to go if i had if i if i have

1732
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:57,480
any problem at all i'm gonna go seek help that's my current policy even like if i stub my toe and

1733
02:31:57,480 --> 02:32:01,720
it hurts for more than an hour i'm going to the hospital that's that's i mean my problem is like

1734
02:32:01,720 --> 02:32:05,880
i'm like a hypochondriac so like already like freaked out about medical things too much already

1735
02:32:06,680 --> 02:32:11,000
yeah but they told you to go do it well it's not like you're just making this up in your own mind

1736
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:15,800
that's true i guess i guess part of my anxiety and depression is feeling anxious about my anxiety

1737
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:23,400
so it's just it's a fun little like stacking effect yeah synergy anxiety is uh is synergy yeah

1738
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:28,280
it's pretty bad it wouldn't recommend it you know how a black hole like splits you in half over and

1739
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:34,760
over and over again forever is that true uh well it's a theory if you get sucked into a black hole

1740
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:40,040
it keeps dividing you in half over and over forever wait along what line i don't know about that man

1741
02:32:40,040 --> 02:32:46,200
what does that mean okay whatever all right sounds cool i like it i heard it in a thing one it compresses

1742
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:53,160
you into an infill i think it might happen in a junji ito but oh yeah all right that's about right

1743
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:58,760
no i think throw that out the window i have heard it in something but it was sci-fi so i don't know

1744
02:32:58,760 --> 02:33:03,640
yeah all right how true it is i don't think i don't think that's true um well i don't think we

1745
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:09,800
we're going to assume it's true and that it's a metaphor for anxiety all right that's good so like

1746
02:33:09,800 --> 02:33:15,240
like an intentional one i'll accept it i'm in a black hole of emotions right now that sounds

1747
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:20,920
fucking emo every every every everything you're anxious about like doubles it does it creates a

1748
02:33:20,920 --> 02:33:26,280
second anxiety it's really fucking annoying and you can't really do anything about it well you

1749
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:31,720
can't really do anything about it right i can do something about it well i'm glad you're better

1750
02:33:31,720 --> 02:33:36,120
me in that way too i guess uh you just have to now i feel anxious about being inferior to you

1751
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:43,000
oh no way well i i just like when i hate when people say you when they mean themselves

1752
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:52,200
because it's like like it this is everyone does it all the time but you know people people people

1753
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:56,440
people say like like when someone's telling a story about something that happened to them

1754
02:33:56,440 --> 02:34:00,760
and they keep saying you like like they're describing that they walked into a club and

1755
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:05,560
saw like these like like a beautiful light and that's like and you walk in and there's this beautiful

1756
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:10,120
light and you're just like oh my god and i'm like no none of that happened to me this is your story

1757
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:16,200
this happened to you you know do people tell first person accounts in yeah all the time i've never

1758
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:21,480
personally done that if you if you listen to enough people talk you're gonna start now now that i've

1759
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:25,480
i gotta i gotta say did you this is not something i've experienced you've just you've just ruined

1760
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:29,800
conversation now that i've put it in your mind you'll notice it forever i did i did i told my mom

1761
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:34,040
this problem and like it suddenly bothered her more than anything in the world for years that

1762
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:39,160
she i feel like as long as you like frame this with like picture this that would solve the whole

1763
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:45,160
problem i mean oh god it's my ghost it's my fucking ghost he's back he's back with my dad like that

1764
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:50,440
that exact example i used of walking into the club is one that i remember my dad that is so weird

1765
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:54,840
i've never heard anyone tell you know what maybe you probably have dude it's probably the first

1766
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:59,320
time it happens i'm gonna call you up and just say faggot and then hang up your phone and you'll

1767
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:12,360
know why this is so terrible i'm fucked i'm gay i'm just gonna drink all my potions pray for the

1768
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:17,800
best and and hope something good happens read all my scrolls scroll of identify really helpful

1769
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:24,280
the worst part about what i just described is that i also say you when i mean me sometimes uh and yet

1770
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:29,480
i complain to other people when they do it well we're all hypocrites but because i especially the

1771
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:33,640
fact that i put it in my mom's head anytime i do it around her she immediately correct me

1772
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:38,120
i'm just like uh but but she my mom's passive aggressive and never just says what she means

1773
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:43,640
like so i'll be telling that and she'll just start going you yeah and i'll be like what what do you

1774
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:49,720
what do you fucking mean you she's like you like well at some point i have to like realize oh i must

1775
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:56,760
have said you and that meant me yeah i gotta have a twist the knife a little bit on that

1776
02:35:56,760 --> 02:36:03,000
she's she's i'm gonna be okay i'm gonna get away my mom has an interesting way of communicating

1777
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:06,920
which is i'm gonna shoot him before i go it didn't work say things that make sense to her without

1778
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:10,040
consideration for whether they make sense to you in the moment

1779
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:22,840
oh god i'm so gay so gay what time is it it is like four or five in the morning oh my god

1781
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:35,000
wide ranging it's it's it covered a lot of bases everyone except ben said a lot but ben

1782
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:39,880
i've been having a great time over here ben ben said the most emotionally charged things

1783
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:43,800
is a good way every time ben freaks out and dies we need to put a mid roll add in

1784
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:52,200
that's actually a great idea why not i ask you this is the segment this is the ultimate

1785
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:57,320
decompression chamber i'm just gonna call this like the procrastinators decompression chamber

1786
02:36:57,320 --> 02:37:02,360
it's everything works for me this is why we all need to be in the vicinity so we can do

1787
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:08,680
shit like this all the time yeah this is exactly what i want everyone patreon.com slash all of us

1788
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:15,480
fix this problem this could be a bi-weekly series if you people got off your ass no it's more ghosts

1789
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:19,880
it's more ghosts ben because that you buy this ghost constantly that's those are the only ghosts

1790
02:37:19,880 --> 02:37:25,960
the only ghosts are you that's enough that's deep man granted like 50 percent of everything i said

1791
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:30,040
is stuff i've also said elsewhere that people probably be like yeah we know yeah we hear you

1792
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:32,920
say this every other week don't assume that everybody

1793
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:42,200
that's why that's why it's good that like yeah like you know i i personally hear myself talk so

1794
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:47,000
much that i get really paranoid about telling the same stories all the time and it drives me crazy

1795
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:54,120
because through the process of having made 1600 videos yeah everything i have to say has been

1796
02:37:54,120 --> 02:37:58,040
something interesting like i've been i've been just looking at stuff in journal like blogging

1797
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:03,160
and vlogging and stuff and people recycle content constantly yeah it's a good strategy well the thing

1798
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:10,280
is i think the problem with me is that most people recycle because they don't remember like like i've

1799
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:15,560
seen yeah really like i don't know okay there's definitely an intentional recycling of content

1800
02:38:15,560 --> 02:38:20,520
for some some people are like uh like almost like bernie sanders i have this i have a problem with

1801
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:26,120
bernie sanders which is that one time i decided to actually watch him talk and then i did another

1802
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:30,040
time and he said all the he said the exact same thing he has like two thousand points the entire

1803
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:34,040
which is both the strength and a massive weakness yeah and well it just makes it it makes it so as

1804
02:38:34,040 --> 02:38:37,640
soon as i've seen one of the sauce like oh i'll never watch him again yeah the only thing the only

1805
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:41,800
reason it worked is because the two things he was saying nobody was talking about yeah well there's

1806
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:47,160
some there are some like internet personalities who are like really hammering this one point

1807
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:53,080
that they want like everyone to accept and all their stuff is about that like the guy who does the

1808
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:59,000
the ten universes theory he's got like fucking a hundred fucking videos on his channel all just

1809
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:04,120
explaining the same theory like more and more in depth uh i mean i think he's probably on some

1810
02:39:04,120 --> 02:39:08,440
level insane yeah probably but like there's a lot of people like that but then there's

1811
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:14,120
ones like dan avidan from uh game grumps where he'll tell the same stories like over and over

1812
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:19,160
because he just has a shit memory and doesn't realize he's told them before and erin who's too

1813
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:24,040
busy playing video games doesn't stop him yeah you know uh or kasey nice that in the process of

1814
02:39:24,040 --> 02:39:29,640
watching all his vlogs i've heard him explain certain things like dozens of times just because

1815
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:34,360
he obviously doesn't remember everything he said in a vlog yep uh but i remember everything i've

1816
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:39,720
said so like i start telling a story and i immediately know i know i've said this before

1817
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:44,280
and i'll i'll say it often in the chagas i know i've explained this before but but there's only

1818
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:49,720
like two people who've actually heard me explain everything yeah i'm sure that's true like i think

1819
02:39:49,720 --> 02:39:54,920
if i could help explain whatever you're doing at that time or even if it's just if it's pertinent

1820
02:39:54,920 --> 02:40:00,200
to the topic at hand it's worth repeating if it's especially when you have a cajillion subscribers

1821
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:06,280
like you do well most i mean like if this was a main channel content i wouldn't count on those

1822
02:40:06,280 --> 02:40:10,760
people having heard anything i've said yeah because the only people who i really think of as my audience

1823
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:15,640
are the people who watch all the other shit the procrastinators is a fucking cult and we know

1824
02:40:15,640 --> 02:40:20,520
that you all suck our dick i like i almost i'm at a point right now just suck our patreon

1825
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:24,520
dicks a little bit harder and you'll be even cooler i'm honestly at a point where i really

1826
02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:31,640
don't think of digi bro as like my channel it's just like a repository for my high effort content

1827
02:40:31,640 --> 02:40:36,760
yeah like like the stuff on the digi bro channel sounds like you're a brand now dude well like

1828
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:42,440
pretty scary the procrastinators channel and digi bro after dark ink oh no like like digi

1829
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:48,520
bro to dark and procrastinators these are channels that i manage like out of like a personal need

1830
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:54,360
to make this kind of content and to and to have a conversation with this audience like like the

1831
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:59,240
people who are watching this stuff i'm expecting them to be watching like a lot of shit that i make

1832
02:40:59,240 --> 02:41:05,000
and to be like following this ongoing narrative of who i am and the people watching digi bro like

1833
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:10,520
those are just videos that are constructed to be like a piece of information that i want to share

1834
02:41:10,520 --> 02:41:14,840
and those people like anyone who's not also following all the other shit i don't expect them

1835
02:41:14,840 --> 02:41:20,120
to know anything about me you know so like the presentation of videos on the digi bro channel

1836
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:26,520
is in a vacuum each video is presented as though the others don't really exist whereas the videos on

1837
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:31,080
the videos on after dark and procrastinators are presented assuming that you know literally

1838
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:36,600
everything about me if you're watching on digi bro you're a fucking normie if you're if you're at

1839
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:41,000
the procrastinators level you're now a cult member yeah i mean to start selling robes because the

1840
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:45,720
problem by him this channel like i think one of the weaknesses of this channel in terms of growth

1841
02:41:45,720 --> 02:41:52,040
is that it's very assumptive because it totally we all assume you know all nine of us you know

1842
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:56,040
there's nine members and we just work from the assumption that you're familiar with all of our

1843
02:41:56,440 --> 02:41:59,640
because we it's not even like if you're in a niche you know all of us we're all scared you know

1844
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:04,040
it's not like the horse days when we all kind of did the same yeah we're all over the math now

1845
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:10,360
like i mean here's a sentence that comes up in nearly every procrastinators is in my video that

1846
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:15,800
came out today it's very and and like we say it all like like like if we're talking about the lucifer

1847
02:42:15,800 --> 02:42:20,200
in the biscuit hammered video you'll say something like you know well this video i just put out the

1848
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:26,920
lucifer one you know and like if you know anyone who doesn't follow your channel or hasn't seen that

1849
02:42:26,920 --> 02:42:31,880
video has no fucking idea what you're talking about and if they're listening to it like 20 weeks later

1850
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:37,960
in another videos out then it's no longer your latest video and so like yeah every like we do this

1851
02:42:37,960 --> 02:42:44,120
constantly on the show yeah we always talk about using like cards or something to start like back

1852
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:52,040
linking to yeah i mean that takes effort it does like we'll do stuff like like make a like a joke

1853
02:42:52,040 --> 02:43:00,600
reference to something that happened in an episode of a monkey jones let's play yeah and we will all

1854
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:05,640
laugh like because we all think it's funny as shit and it's like how many audience members

1855
02:43:05,640 --> 02:43:10,440
have watched a monkey jones let's play at the same time though would we really want to make

1856
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:15,560
professionalism or anything else we would not want to dumb it down no yeah we have to like the goal

1857
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:20,680
is to suck more people in to make them watch all this shit we want we want you to be cult members

1858
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:25,160
that's really the if you feel like you don't know what you're doing that's your fault i mean we have

1859
02:43:25,160 --> 02:43:30,920
to just be here yet format changes have come up about ways to make the content more appealing to

1860
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:35,560
wider audiences i don't know how to solve this particular problem here well like we hope that

1861
02:43:35,560 --> 02:43:39,720
people will eventually love us more if they just watched all of us it wouldn't be a problem so

1862
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:45,640
just do that i mean but like when we make because some of this stuff like horseshoe heaven yeah that's

1863
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:50,280
got like a hundred subscribers like a couple hundred and it's my fucking it's my favorite of

1864
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:55,240
jessie jessie's channel of course it is the one that i would unsubscribe last if i had to cut all

1865
02:43:55,240 --> 02:44:02,280
my channels if i am speaking correctly the only way to find out about horseshoe heaven yeah was like

1866
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:07,880
like hey it was a secret link it was a hidden link in a video yeah and the channel it actually

1867
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:12,760
has like 300 subs i think well i think it has like 700 or something yeah it had made a hole to do

1868
02:44:12,760 --> 02:44:18,600
about passing it has like 500 i think yeah yeah but like it was literally a hidden link on one

1869
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:24,520
endless jess video yeah so if you haven't watched that one video and found the hidden link and

1870
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:30,440
actually sat through yeah all of horseshoe heaven then you probably don't know what alien boy is

1871
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:36,280
that's true and so when we all start laughing about alien boy or making a reference to like

1872
02:44:36,280 --> 02:44:43,800
kid i be in this video like these are all jokes that no one gets no one knows what we're talking about

1873
02:44:43,800 --> 02:44:49,800
we must sound like mad men but we're not you're the mad man for not being cool enough yet yeah

1874
02:44:49,800 --> 02:44:55,080
but like like even if we just said like go watch all of our videos on all of our channels like that

1875
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:59,160
still is not gonna lead you to horseshoe heaven no it won't think about this though how fucking

1876
02:44:59,800 --> 02:45:05,400
mind-blowing would it be is say like two years from now we go to like some random convention or

1877
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:10,840
something yeah and people come who are like fucking on our level and just like die we can talk to them

1878
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:15,560
like we know them i mean there's people that would be like eerie that would be interesting that would

1879
02:45:15,560 --> 02:45:20,600
be that'd be really fucking i don't know if i'd like it that's really famous i think i would think

1880
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:26,520
it was cool if people i think there's people i can like lachlan still uh who's a frequent commenter

1881
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:33,400
like he knows like i have never really spoken to him but he knows literally everything you know

1882
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:39,640
this means some people's tizm is us yeah it's interesting like lachlan lachlan i mean he makes

1883
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:45,640
his own videos now too but he knows yeah he's he's watched everything i've ever made and everything

1884
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:51,400
anyone in the pcp has ever made and most of what we've ever made reference to and like like you know

1885
02:45:51,400 --> 02:45:55,720
if you want to cheat i mean it's not just us he follows a lot of people but like he knows

1886
02:45:55,720 --> 02:46:00,120
everything there is to know about us and he can come into like a thread like like on my Reddit

1887
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:06,280
and just like say some shit and i like to me it's like yeah like i don't even i don't even stop and

1888
02:46:06,280 --> 02:46:10,360
think i've never talked to this guy because just knowing that he's seen all my videos i already

1889
02:46:10,360 --> 02:46:15,320
have an understanding that like this dude knows me yeah there's nothing that i could say you want

1890
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:21,240
to show cuts getting on this level the reddit is like a very well updated compilation of everything

1891
02:46:21,240 --> 02:46:25,080
we do in reverse chrono it all gets posted there and one that we've been kind of meaning to like

1892
02:46:25,080 --> 02:46:29,960
make a bigger deal out of we kind of should i guess it doesn't have many subs i just i just i never

1893
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:36,360
read it i don't read it any that's on you guys i go on this the procrastinator subreddit just to

1894
02:46:36,360 --> 02:46:40,760
see what you guys have been posting oh really yeah i don't check your individual i just subscribed

1895
02:46:40,760 --> 02:46:45,320
everyone i need a good reason to use reddit i haven't found one yet someone made me a reddit for

1896
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:49,400
rebel pixels and i've touched it like twice and i feel like the biggest shit lord who ever lived

1897
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:54,120
because that was like such a nice gesture and i'm just like well i don't fucking know what to do

1898
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:59,160
with it i don't i don't think i don't think like all of my stuff gets posted that channel but all

1899
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:04,120
of it's it's posted to my personal subreddit for sure yeah yeah well i mean there would be like

1900
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:08,920
three times as many posts and no one can find any of it my subreddit is like shockingly very

1901
02:47:08,920 --> 02:47:13,960
active like like not just with my content like people post like there's there's like a whole

1902
02:47:13,960 --> 02:47:20,920
community on my subreddit that's cool yeah um just of people who i don't know will be asking

1903
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:25,400
something or other or just talking to one of like some people come in there because they hate our

1904
02:47:25,400 --> 02:47:30,200
anime so much that they will just have conversations about shows on my subreddit because it's like

1905
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:34,760
people who are kind of like isn't that nice you know that's i mean that's what you need you just

1906
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:40,600
need wouldn't it be great to be the our anime alternative one day i would i would love to

1907
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:46,360
have an all our anime alternative not necessarily for it to be my board because we do like me and

1908
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:51,800
Lachlan who's the mod we do remove like stuff that's not at all relevant to me okay but we'll

1909
02:47:51,800 --> 02:47:57,000
leave up like if it's a discussion of like a show that everyone knows i love then like yeah we can

1910
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:01,160
discuss that here you know yeah obviously i'll have something to say that is a tough balancing

1911
02:48:01,160 --> 02:48:07,560
act for sure because if you let it go too unfiltered it the original purpose yeah i'm fairly strict

1912
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:12,600
about that i don't want people posting bullshit because yeah it does it gets out of hand immediately

1913
02:48:12,600 --> 02:48:18,040
if you let it happen right so it's it's not a good not a good short leash um but i think the the

1914
02:48:18,040 --> 02:48:22,840
procrastinator subreddit like the problem is that none of us go on there so no one feels an

1915
02:48:22,840 --> 02:48:28,600
incentive to like yeah like i don't i don't know who's reading it it's well updated because rival

1916
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:34,600
steven is fucking you know always post all our shit there and uh and duvou has at some points

1917
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:39,720
paid him to continue doing so really has he wow he's like he's like just thrown him like

1918
02:48:40,360 --> 02:48:44,680
ten fifteen dollars just like as a kudos saying like hey well that's nice okay that's that's

1919
02:48:44,680 --> 02:48:48,200
different than saying like please keep updating this i'll pay you that's that's how i interpreted

1920
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:53,320
that statement that's on him though i do not endorse that activity no do do it for the love not for

1921
02:48:53,320 --> 02:48:59,880
the cash i mean patreon i mean i won't that that guy is pretty dedicated i mean to do it at all

1922
02:48:59,880 --> 02:49:04,920
even you know it's super cool yeah he's some he's one of the people who sometimes there's like

1923
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:09,400
there's like a small cabal of people who post all my stuff to my sub because i don't post anything to

1924
02:49:09,400 --> 02:49:13,800
my sub it's all my i just don't want to get into any territory we're expected to be paid for this

1925
02:49:13,800 --> 02:49:18,840
sort of thing you know absolutely i don't think it would be that way yeah all right uh so i mean

1926
02:49:18,840 --> 02:49:23,160
my personal subreddit there there was a guy oh shit i just remembered there was a guy who was

1927
02:49:23,160 --> 02:49:27,480
posting all my stuff to my personal subreddit yeah and then he was like i can't do it anymore i was

1928
02:49:27,480 --> 02:49:32,360
like cool no problem but then like a week ago or two weeks ago he even he messaged me and was like

1929
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:36,920
i can start it again and i just forgot to ever reply so i should probably tell him yeah i'll

1930
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:42,840
make you a mod again because that was fine i mean i was i had been letting it lie completely

1931
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:49,880
i am in a constant state of feeling bad about people i ignore it is the worst yeah you can't

1932
02:49:49,880 --> 02:49:54,280
you can't you can't communicate with everyone that wants to talk to you when you're when you're

1933
02:49:54,280 --> 02:49:58,760
this fucking popular bro you can't you can't please everyone you know what i'm saying like it's

1934
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:02,920
not even just everyone who wants to hear from me there's a lot of people i legitimately feel like

1935
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:08,280
i like if i respond to this person i will be happier for having done so and i just don't get

1936
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:13,640
around there's too many fucking people and eventually if like like you sometimes if you

1937
02:50:13,640 --> 02:50:16,760
ignore someone enough time is there and they're just gonna stop yeah you're gonna take it the

1938
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:22,680
wrong way yep it's true like we should just make a statement right now it's like at least 70% of

1939
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:28,920
the time i made it i made it to the fucking ecumenical temple you did it ben you did it oh my god

1940
02:50:29,480 --> 02:50:35,000
it's level two well it's green not really all it is is just a place where all the gods have altars

1941
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:39,480
except for the one if your life really sucked you didn't find this is actually every single god of

1942
02:50:39,480 --> 02:50:44,120
the ready excluded uh actually yeah the ones that aren't here are the ones that are in other places

1943
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:48,040
in the dungeon such as behemoth the one that i wanted which i already found so this is totally

1944
02:50:48,040 --> 02:50:54,120
pointless and just symbolic that i'm making progress but how are you at level two yet there

1945
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:59,000
isn't a level two there's only a second area no i'm still in the original area okay would flurry

1946
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:03,640
one of the ecumenical temple is debatably a second area but like there's very little actually there

1947
02:51:03,640 --> 02:51:08,520
yeah are there any like actual dividers or just all kind of yeah there yeah there is there's like

1948
02:51:08,520 --> 02:51:14,120
special portals that lead to different regions and different regions have later regions will

1949
02:51:14,120 --> 02:51:20,920
like each have a rune in them right yeah so you should alter to an unknown god oh

1950
02:51:22,840 --> 02:51:27,720
you cannot you cannot tell which altar this god belongs to convert to them anyway

1951
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:33,080
actually you know what i just realized i'm glad like i was getting worried because the problem

1952
02:51:33,080 --> 02:51:38,840
that i've been having at rad con so far and have had in the past uh with everyone forever

1953
02:51:39,560 --> 02:51:45,480
including me and ben working out is that uh it's really hard to schedule around people who

1954
02:51:45,480 --> 02:51:50,520
sleep at different times yes like because you're thinking of it as like we'll do this tomorrow

1955
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:54,360
but my tomorrow is very different from your tomorrow and for a second here i was worried

1956
02:51:54,360 --> 02:51:58,280
because i was like oh fuck it's already like uh it's already like five in the morning i'm

1957
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:02,520
gonna wake up so late but then i remembered that the main people i'm watching with tomorrow

1958
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:07,480
are you two so it's perfectly fine oh is that true okay yes i'm mostly scheduled around you guys

1959
02:52:07,480 --> 02:52:12,520
like like i gotta do that one fucking movie with jeff right and jesse and then i'm gonna watch a show

1960
02:52:12,520 --> 02:52:16,600
with you and then i'm gonna do some of you know i've got you for two episodes as well yeah okay

1961
02:52:17,960 --> 02:52:23,080
i feel a little bad when when jeff when you and jeff came in and were like everybody quiet down

1962
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:27,960
i i don't know i didn't like jeff's tone and i kind of gave him like a scathing look uh i feel

1963
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:32,360
like maybe i just don't know the guy and didn't read his tone the way he meant to be read i felt

1964
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:38,520
like he was being a real dick but i don't know i don't tend to be funny what okay well it did

1965
02:52:38,520 --> 02:52:44,280
not come considering he said hey fuck heads shut up for a second we gotta take this show maybe i

1966
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:49,880
should have just assumed it was a joke when you when you get when you get cross like maybe you

1967
02:52:49,880 --> 02:52:54,280
should say something just to clear the air well i didn't i didn't like say anything i just looked

1968
02:52:54,280 --> 02:53:01,880
at him like what is your deal man i don't know well i should have us i don't know i'm being i'm

1969
02:53:01,880 --> 02:53:07,560
being cool i i had told him to go like i said uh we gotta like i said we gotta go make those guys

1970
02:53:07,560 --> 02:53:13,000
shut up so we could do this show yeah so don't worry i'll take care of it it was did you tell

1971
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:18,200
you to shut up be a he was he was probably just joking and i just like wasn't in the mood to hear

1972
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:24,920
he might he might be overestimating the uh how impressed we are by his uh by his presence um

1973
02:53:27,320 --> 02:53:32,360
he is a famous youtube guy you know he's he's quite active on the youtube he does quite well

1974
02:53:35,640 --> 02:53:42,760
be on that point and yet you're still making videos make your novel i don't it's not that i

1975
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:47,720
don't care about youtube i'm saying i don't care about youtuber oh yeah no i do care about youtube

1976
02:53:47,720 --> 02:53:52,040
it's uh i thought you were done with youtube i i make a bunch of videos about that you were

1977
02:53:52,040 --> 02:53:58,600
done with youtube i make a bunch of i'd say a lot of things that i know i see i actually it's funny

1978
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:05,880
i just recorded a um a sort of solo uh decompression video it's all about my inability to make choices

1979
02:54:06,440 --> 02:54:12,360
is it for rumble pixels it was going to be for procrastinators okay i did it last night

1980
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:17,400
everyone's just done this but like yeah i i'm still resistant to doing it you don't have to do it

1981
02:54:17,400 --> 02:54:21,640
i would rather put a video like that on my own channel feel free to i don't know if i'm going

1982
02:54:21,640 --> 02:54:26,280
to post it at all because i did it when i was like still like really not feeling well so i'm not like

1983
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:31,000
super energized about it it's just really funny and it might just be like super fucking gay just

1984
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:36,680
like it's weird because when i made the decompression chamber i expected it to be a video

1985
02:54:36,680 --> 02:54:41,240
that none of you guys would watch yeah because it's it's totally very similar to my afterdark

1986
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:46,360
videos that most of you guys don't pay attention to but weirdly everyone seems to be into them

1987
02:54:46,360 --> 02:54:51,080
and like everyone seems to listen to them it's it's the it might be because it's on procrastinators

1988
02:54:51,080 --> 02:54:55,960
i can absolutely explain why this is happening it's because when you go to afterdark you're

1989
02:54:55,960 --> 02:54:59,400
presented with so much fucking shit you feel overwhelmed that's just the way the human mind

1990
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:03,480
if it's just one video a week where it's just like i'm going to be a faggot now

1991
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:08,120
yeah we can we can deal with one one dose of fagotry but if you just like literally take

1992
02:55:08,120 --> 02:55:13,720
a shit on the channel constantly i mean like it wasn't it wasn't too surprising that ben listened

1993
02:55:13,720 --> 02:55:19,160
to just just so everyone knows i have butchered a human and am currently eating them good good

1994
02:55:19,160 --> 02:55:25,160
to know that's all i wanted out of this we've crossed the threshold like i wasn't survival mandates

1995
02:55:25,160 --> 02:55:31,160
certain uh extremes uh wait wait wait wait wait look uh yes this uh this raw flesh tastes terrible

1996
02:55:31,160 --> 02:55:38,520
it says well you know yeah it's it's you it always tastes terrible it's hard to eat raw meat you can

1997
02:55:38,520 --> 02:55:42,760
only eat raw butchered meat when you're really hungry unless you find an amulet of the gormand

1998
02:55:42,760 --> 02:55:46,600
which lets you just fucking stuff yourself on everyone's carcasses until you're like

1999
02:55:46,600 --> 02:55:53,160
you're actually a really good item because spell use casting spells like takes food energy

2000
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:59,320
okay how do you how do you prepare cooked items you can't cook them you you can i you either you

2001
02:55:59,320 --> 02:56:03,880
find like permanent prepared food that lasts forever or you just eat raw food there's no cooking

2002
02:56:05,800 --> 02:56:11,400
this has brought me to an interesting thought uh which is that there's a big difference between

2003
02:56:12,360 --> 02:56:18,440
consuming and engaging with content right yeah for sure and and it's interesting to me because i

2004
02:56:18,440 --> 02:56:23,960
when i think of people who watch all my videos i think of like people like lachlan again who

2005
02:56:23,960 --> 02:56:28,680
who know everything about me and know all this history but there's plenty of people who do watch

2006
02:56:28,680 --> 02:56:36,280
all my videos and just don't care that much and ben is one of them because uh well i mean i care

2007
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:41,160
you care sometimes why would you leave a comment when you could just go upstairs like that video

2008
02:56:41,160 --> 02:56:46,920
was gay and just go back well i mean it was before that ben ben consumes a lot of my content while

2009
02:56:46,920 --> 02:56:52,200
like drawing yeah just like having it on in the background and like i mean you watch like most of

2010
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:59,960
the after dark stuff right i not recently but in the past i have and like like victor watches

2011
02:56:59,960 --> 02:57:04,760
everything i put out just because he's bored and sits on the couch but he plays 3ds do the whole

2012
02:57:04,760 --> 02:57:10,680
thing so he like kind of vaguely like victor's response to the vast majority of my videos forever

2013
02:57:10,680 --> 02:57:16,520
has always been well i hear you talk about this stuff all the time in real life so uh so it doesn't

2014
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:23,560
that's a fair point so um so so like on the one hand you've got like davoo who will you know who's

2015
02:57:23,560 --> 02:57:28,600
actually way behind on my videos and has not listened has not listened to most of the after

2016
02:57:28,600 --> 02:57:32,360
dark or decompression stuff he basically doesn't watch youtube at all anymore like all he does he's

2017
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:38,120
too busy working i guess all he does is watch anime and edit yeah um i mean like he's dedicated

2018
02:57:38,120 --> 02:57:43,000
dedicated himself to the cause the way it's it's really interesting to me because he thinks of

2019
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:48,040
watching anime as work yeah like he thinks of it as i have to watch this i feel like my comment

2020
02:57:48,040 --> 02:57:53,240
in response to that guy who told you that you watching anime can't be work was very yeah that

2021
02:57:53,240 --> 02:57:58,200
that summed up all my thoughts on but but it's funny because like i don't think of watching anime

2022
02:57:58,200 --> 02:58:02,360
as work even though it's like it contributes to it because to me it only becomes work when it's

2023
02:58:02,360 --> 02:58:08,040
directly contributing to a video whereas davoo thinks that all anime he's watching is work and

2024
02:58:08,120 --> 02:58:14,840
therefore he yeah he has mentioned on many occasions how he wants to see every anime so

2025
02:58:14,840 --> 02:58:19,160
that he is more capable of making these videos fast but but in the way that like you and i've

2026
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:23,880
been watching for a long time how dedicated he is to that because yeah all the time that he's not

2027
02:58:23,880 --> 02:58:28,600
editing for me he just watches anime well you know you know what that's because we live that's

2028
02:58:28,600 --> 02:58:32,280
because we haven't made the big move to the city yet and we're all still fucking we're all we're all

2029
02:58:32,360 --> 02:58:38,200
boring here and there's nothing else to do well because he gets part of it he he sees it it's like

2030
02:58:38,200 --> 02:58:43,960
i'm not like okay um he has all these other things he wants to work on video games and the reason he's

2031
02:58:43,960 --> 02:58:49,000
not working on them is because he's working by watching anime sounds like procrastination

2032
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:54,280
to me it seems that way but he doesn't treat it that way like he thinks like watching anime is more

2033
02:58:54,280 --> 02:58:59,400
important to his career than doing those other things and then like doing those would be procrastination

2034
02:58:59,400 --> 02:59:06,200
realign your uh your interests and your priorities yeah i'm not the one to say that but i mean he's

2035
02:59:06,200 --> 02:59:11,000
doing good work he's he's he's doing great because like because the thing is that like uh close to a

2036
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:16,280
year ago i gave him like a google doc of like every show i thought there was a chance i would talk about

2037
02:59:16,280 --> 02:59:20,600
at any point in the near future it was like probably a hundred shows and he's most of the

2038
02:59:20,600 --> 02:59:24,520
way through that list and he's made it out like you know i'll stop watching anime constantly

2039
02:59:24,520 --> 02:59:30,680
when i've broken this list uh with the the ironic part is that i actually he didn't even notice this

2040
02:59:30,680 --> 02:59:36,600
and i forgot until like like a couple weeks ago that uh it was an alphabetical list and it just

2041
02:59:36,600 --> 02:59:41,240
stops in the middle of the letter s because i just got tired of making it and never got back to it

2042
02:59:41,240 --> 02:59:44,600
so he's been like watching all these shows all this time and i looked at it and i was like

2043
02:59:44,600 --> 02:59:49,240
devu this list could be like you know like this is like two-thirds of what would be the list you

2044
02:59:49,240 --> 02:59:54,200
know so uh you know i can't i don't know if he wants me to write out the rest or if he'll just

2045
02:59:54,200 --> 02:59:58,840
be like well you know you gave me the list i'm gonna do that list if his goals have a thorough

2046
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:03,960
understanding of anime in general watching a hundred shows or so is a very good start so he's

2047
03:00:03,960 --> 03:00:09,320
probably watched over 150 in the last six months you know what his secret plan is he's just training

2048
03:00:09,320 --> 03:00:13,480
under you right now and then like this time next year he's gonna start digivoo and just fucking

2049
03:00:14,440 --> 03:00:21,400
uh i've offered to have him put videos on my channel in the past yeah like to just do his

2050
03:00:21,400 --> 03:00:26,840
anime videos there um make sense try to remember why i was talking oh yeah the engagement thing

2051
03:00:26,840 --> 03:00:33,000
right that like devu's way behind on my content but when he watches that he's extremely engaged

2052
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:38,360
like he soaks in every detail of it that's the most valuable thing you can whereas like like

2053
03:00:38,360 --> 03:00:44,600
ben watches most of my stuff hippo watches almost all of the stuff i put out like he always has

2054
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:50,520
consumed like just about every single thing i put out but doesn't really care about much of it like he

2055
03:00:50,520 --> 03:00:54,600
doesn't really care about the things i'm talking about so like he just kind of goes in one ear

2056
03:00:54,600 --> 03:00:58,200
not the other and like every once in a while he picks up some intriguing things victor watches

2057
03:00:58,200 --> 03:01:04,120
all of it doesn't care but like but with the decompression chambers it's like everyone seems

2058
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:09,000
to be listening to it and like uh you know why you know why because i live with you and i hear

2059
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:17,800
yeah it's because we might hear about ourselves that's a big element i've never gone in thinking

2060
03:01:17,800 --> 03:01:23,080
i'd be talked about i've definitely done it all the time it's just weird because i definitely

2061
03:01:23,080 --> 03:01:29,720
watched the pcp to hear myself how fucking dumb i did or i'm so used to nobody being engaged or

2062
03:01:29,720 --> 03:01:34,600
really caring and then like i've been like people keep talking to me about the decompression chambers

2063
03:01:34,600 --> 03:01:39,400
and being like oh yeah what you talked about in this one and i'm like wait you listened to me

2064
03:01:39,400 --> 03:01:44,520
for an hour and a half i'm the boring like i think of myself as the boring guy in the pcp

2065
03:01:44,520 --> 03:01:50,120
really really because i'm not funny everyone else is funny i'm not funny i'm the boring guy at all

2066
03:01:50,120 --> 03:01:55,240
i mean i don't know man i mean you're not ha ha funny my main channel content in particular is

2067
03:01:55,240 --> 03:02:02,280
not funny well yeah like like like like you guys all like you and nate jesse and hippo who are like

2068
03:02:02,280 --> 03:02:08,280
the trifecta of extremely funny people like i feel like you guys really value a video being funny

2069
03:02:08,280 --> 03:02:13,960
true and my videos aren't funny so they are not valuable you know like my videos have always been

2070
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:19,080
like i feel like everyone kind of thinks like yeah his don't really matter they're just fucking his

2071
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:23,240
random thoughts that he puts out there i don't know so people tell me like i listened to an hour

2072
03:02:23,240 --> 03:02:29,400
and a half of you just literally talking about yourself usually like this strange mix of self

2073
03:02:29,400 --> 03:02:38,360
aggrandizement and self peril uh i'm like what you listened to that twice like you know like

2074
03:02:38,360 --> 03:02:43,080
more like more than one episode yeah and then everyone just started making their own and and

2075
03:02:43,080 --> 03:02:48,360
like i guess we all liked it like did it it's interesting because like my my channel like

2076
03:02:48,360 --> 03:02:53,080
talk about engagement is that like i did all these like videos on reviewing tablets i was like

2077
03:02:53,800 --> 03:02:57,240
there's people telling me free stuff why would i not do it yeah yeah but like the channel is

2078
03:02:57,240 --> 03:03:03,640
written is on to be just like art sucks and this is why like don't do this and like and those are

2079
03:03:03,640 --> 03:03:07,560
the ones that get way more engagement i'm just like they don't get a lot of views but everybody who

2080
03:03:07,560 --> 03:03:12,200
watches them gets something really like important out of it yeah so i'm just like they're very personal

2081
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:15,880
for people they're so hard to make though because i feel like i'm just a bitch every time i make

2082
03:03:16,200 --> 03:03:21,400
i can't do that it's so hard i gotta tell you what what your channel reminds me of more than

2083
03:03:21,400 --> 03:03:27,400
anything um i know we've talked about this scene before and welcome to the nhk it's one of my favorite

2084
03:03:27,400 --> 03:03:31,800
scenes which is have you seen welcome to the nhk i've seen the first two episodes watch the whole

2085
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:37,320
thing you know the general concept it's about a hikikomori uh you know and there's a part later

2086
03:03:37,320 --> 03:03:42,360
in the show there's this one arc where he meets another hikikomori yeah and it's like through

2087
03:03:42,360 --> 03:03:46,520
like it was like a girl what was his connection to that girl how did he know her she was i believe

2088
03:03:46,520 --> 03:03:50,840
a classmate who he met again later like it's like a classmate that he that he had in high school

2089
03:03:50,840 --> 03:03:55,080
and she's become like a part of a pyramid scheme she tries to like rope them in and then you find

2090
03:03:55,080 --> 03:04:00,920
out that the reason is she's she was the class rep i think yeah whatever she's trying to make money

2091
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:04,760
like because she has to take care of her brother because her brother's a fucking shut in and is

2092
03:04:04,760 --> 03:04:11,400
and is a hikikomori in her room and um there's a scene where they go up to the brother's room

2093
03:04:11,400 --> 03:04:19,480
and he's like saying like there's no way out of this and he says i've read every self-help book

2094
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:25,640
there is you can see them all on the shelves i could write one but i can't get out of it

2095
03:04:26,200 --> 03:04:32,200
and that's what your channel is to me it's a man who has read every self-help book knows all the

2096
03:04:32,200 --> 03:04:37,640
advice and is literally giving it to other people in spite of the fact that you cannot follow it

2097
03:04:37,640 --> 03:04:44,280
yourself and are dying yeah i mean no i'm like literally dying yeah he is literally dying he has

2098
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:51,960
an ulcer in his fucking stomach and he's dying yeah uh out of just stress from art from this

2099
03:04:51,960 --> 03:04:57,160
exact thing there's nothing physically wrong with me and your channel is like here's how to get out

2100
03:04:57,160 --> 03:05:03,240
of that even though you are not out of that but it is all the right advice it's all the correct

2101
03:05:04,200 --> 03:05:07,960
the idea behind the channel right now and like what i want to kind of do more than if i can stop

2102
03:05:07,960 --> 03:05:13,240
being a little baby about it is that i don't want i wanted to be like being very honest in my

2103
03:05:13,240 --> 03:05:17,560
presentation like i'm going to give you advice i'm not the best artist in the world in fact i'm

2104
03:05:17,560 --> 03:05:23,640
probably like the lower like 25 percent if i'm going to be realistic true and that you're definitely

2105
03:05:23,640 --> 03:05:29,880
wrong being being publishable puts you in the upper 25 for like the the highest 25 i mean you

2106
03:05:30,280 --> 03:05:36,760
people have paid for your art that puts you in the upper 25 percent people paid for Reki Kawahara's

2107
03:05:36,760 --> 03:05:41,240
work would you put him in the upper 25 and all these ways to lower your value people aren't

2108
03:05:41,240 --> 03:05:45,800
really paying for Reki Kawahara they're paying for abec's character design that's true that guy is

2109
03:05:45,800 --> 03:05:50,360
the brother of the woman who designed kaon which means he has royal blood in his veins

2110
03:05:52,840 --> 03:05:57,320
no but like the idea is like i'm not well put together and like i wanted to kind of be like

2111
03:05:58,280 --> 03:06:03,880
you don't have to be a dude with like a bajillion subscribers and like supremely like god gifted

2112
03:06:03,880 --> 03:06:10,200
talent like that's just like emanates from everything you do right in order to to be successful

2113
03:06:10,200 --> 03:06:15,880
yeah it's amazing to me that you understand that what you cannot make yourself that's the whole

2114
03:06:15,880 --> 03:06:20,760
thing is like it's like everything i understand logically exactly what i need to do and how to

2115
03:06:20,760 --> 03:06:25,800
do it but like it's an emotional reaction that's beyond my control right so i literally like

2116
03:06:25,800 --> 03:06:29,640
with people like oh you need to need to just like get better like i go to therapists like well

2117
03:06:29,640 --> 03:06:33,240
you understand all these things i'm like yeah but like that doesn't look you just need to start

2118
03:06:33,240 --> 03:06:37,800
thinking more positively i'm like i have the same conversation with my therapist every week for like

2119
03:06:37,800 --> 03:06:42,200
two months like you just need to start thinking more pros like i get that yeah but i you you

2120
03:06:42,200 --> 03:06:46,760
you have clearly shown that you understand how to fix these problems because all the advice you

2121
03:06:46,760 --> 03:06:51,880
give is great yeah like the rebel pixels channel i've shared those videos and been like everyone

2122
03:06:51,880 --> 03:06:57,800
should do this you know you just haven't done it i just need a partial lobotomy and then i'll be fine

2123
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:05,400
that might actually be true you know i mean i i felt when like that that what inspired me so much

2124
03:07:05,400 --> 03:07:10,760
about that particular chapter and like what happens in that the only way he gets out of it is that

2125
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:15,560
eventually his sister just fucking leaves him and like he literally can't survive in his room anymore

2126
03:07:15,560 --> 03:07:19,960
dude so he has to get a job so funny because i did the video i just made about the decompressed

2127
03:07:19,960 --> 03:07:24,600
thing about choices saying how like it started like a i had like a self-help book i talked about

2128
03:07:24,600 --> 03:07:30,040
how people are more happy when they feel they're in control even if they're not because they did

2129
03:07:30,040 --> 03:07:35,080
the psychology experiment where um they they designed the most mundane game possible and brought

2130
03:07:35,080 --> 03:07:39,240
a bunch of people into play it was basically a number between one and ten would come up and they

2131
03:07:39,240 --> 03:07:43,560
had to guess would be greater or lower than five that was the entire game they had to do it for

2132
03:07:43,560 --> 03:07:49,480
like three hours and they found um that they would test it in two ways the first way was that you

2133
03:07:49,480 --> 03:07:55,480
hit a button for a higher or lower and then the second test would be a computer would decide for

2134
03:07:55,480 --> 03:07:59,960
you so you would they would the computer would pick one of the buttons and they found that

2135
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:04,920
when you chose it you're were more excited you're more invested and when you the computer did you

2136
03:08:04,920 --> 03:08:09,080
were fucking bored sure then and they they the people were told they were being tested for

2137
03:08:09,080 --> 03:08:14,200
accuracy so like you're going to find out how good you are at this then they stopped they

2138
03:08:14,200 --> 03:08:19,960
touted the results and they told everybody who participated we lied to you everyone got the

2139
03:08:19,960 --> 03:08:24,440
exact same pattern of right and wrong there was no way you could beat this pattern and then they

2140
03:08:24,440 --> 03:08:30,040
sat them down and did it again and they still got more excited having the choice even though they knew

2141
03:08:30,040 --> 03:08:36,360
it was total bullshit their primitive dumb fucking animal brain got fucking psyched over like the

2142
03:08:36,360 --> 03:08:41,480
possibility of being right like having that control over the situation even though there was none and

2143
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:45,720
so that was like the thing it's just like people are fucking stupid and you have to make choices

2144
03:08:45,720 --> 03:08:51,320
and then i go into like i don't make any choices like i'm so reactionary at this point because

2145
03:08:51,320 --> 03:08:56,440
i'm like a people pleaser that i don't do any of that like every time i even make a choice i just

2146
03:08:56,440 --> 03:09:00,920
like caught myself like did i make the right choice and then it's like i'm like thinking like i need

2147
03:09:00,920 --> 03:09:04,600
to i'm getting kicked out of my house now and i feel like maybe i secretly wanted to get kicked out

2148
03:09:04,600 --> 03:09:09,640
for years because then i have to start doing exactly what happens to the character he i'm literally

2149
03:09:09,640 --> 03:09:15,000
an anime by a way of getting by way of his fucking sister just like being like i'm sick of this and

2150
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:19,720
abandoning him like one day because he would like bang on the floor to get her to bring food and like

2151
03:09:19,720 --> 03:09:24,040
he's begging on the floor and she's not coming and like a whole day passes and he's just like

2152
03:09:24,040 --> 03:09:29,800
i'm gonna die if i don't leave my room and i'll get food and so he leaves and he gets a part time

2153
03:09:29,800 --> 03:09:36,600
job and it's implied that he uh is happier having done that um but like for me that was a huge eye

2154
03:09:36,600 --> 03:09:40,520
opener because i watched that show when i was in the middle of you know fucking half a decade of

2155
03:09:40,520 --> 03:09:48,040
depression and i was like fuck me like what's clear like what became clear to me at the tail end of

2156
03:09:48,040 --> 03:09:54,040
being depressed was like again i read all the self-help books i heard all the advice and none of it

2157
03:09:54,040 --> 03:10:02,200
was working so i i told to my parents like i need medication because i i like my dad is the type

2158
03:10:02,200 --> 03:10:05,160
of person if you tell me you're depressed he's like well if you just gotta think of it this way

2159
03:10:05,160 --> 03:10:10,920
you just gotta do this i'm like i know i know i did the research i went online i typed how do you

2160
03:10:10,920 --> 03:10:17,240
cure depression none of that worked so clearly there's gotta be something else here like there's

2161
03:10:17,240 --> 03:10:22,920
i'm i'm fighting as hard as i can i'm doing all the things you're telling me and it's not working

2162
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:28,040
so we need to kick this up a notch you know this needs to be different and maybe getting kicked out

2163
03:10:28,040 --> 03:10:32,200
would have worked for me i mean it wouldn't have put me in this situation for sure so i'm very

2164
03:10:32,200 --> 03:10:39,400
glad it didn't happen uh but like you know like i eventually they took me to a psychologist i got

2165
03:10:39,400 --> 03:10:44,840
medicated i got better you know like that's kind of what all the fucking people are saying to me too

2166
03:10:44,840 --> 03:10:49,880
just like your brain could just legitimately be fucked up yeah like and i mean i'm i'm lucky that

2167
03:10:49,880 --> 03:10:54,440
it worked for me because like victor who went through you know the same kind of depression

2168
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:58,760
went through like six different medications and none of them worked some of them made him way worse

2169
03:10:58,840 --> 03:11:02,760
and he eventually just gave up and said i'm just gonna be depressed for the rest of my life

2170
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:10,360
you know uh and his depression only finally stopped being like a constant force when he hooked up

2171
03:11:10,360 --> 03:11:16,120
with his current girlfriend and now he's like like the first time i've ever seen him legitimately

2172
03:11:16,120 --> 03:11:22,440
happy um he used to be so angry like he was angry all the time he would snap on you for anything

2173
03:11:22,440 --> 03:11:26,840
and ever since he started dating he's just been like fucking blissed out all the time i guess when

2174
03:11:26,840 --> 03:11:32,120
they just say you need to get laid it's totally true that's more than that it's i mean he was in

2175
03:11:32,120 --> 03:11:38,600
love with joke mate he was obsessed with her for a long time he has uh victor was telling us about

2176
03:11:38,600 --> 03:11:44,440
this uh this amazing book idea he has and i want it's so good it's so fucking good really his book

2177
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:50,280
idea ever which is just the title it's a coffee table book that folds out into a coffee table

2178
03:11:50,520 --> 03:11:58,760
the book the book is called um how to find the love of your life in seven easy years no it's how

2179
03:11:58,760 --> 03:12:03,480
to get out of the friend zone in seven easy years right either way that's a very clickbaity titling

2180
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:09,560
i love it that is that is like a buzz people are gonna like that shit seven easy years though

2181
03:12:09,560 --> 03:12:13,880
yeah no that's great that's a great title because that's how long it took him to get out of the

2182
03:12:13,880 --> 03:12:20,520
friends i i imagine all right all right everyone update update i am being i am being rampaged upon

2183
03:12:20,520 --> 03:12:26,920

2188
03:12:54,680 --> 03:13:00,040
some tough some feelings similar to this at one point uh when i had when i had finished my four

2189
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:07,960
years at school and i was back home and was doing these shitty media labor jobs while uh just like

2190
03:13:08,120 --> 03:13:13,240
taking like one class a semester and dreaming of one day finishing my degree and leaving i would

2191
03:13:13,240 --> 03:13:18,200
kind of like antagonize my parents every once in a while i really think i was trying to get them

2192
03:13:18,200 --> 03:13:23,480
to kick me out and like occasionally i would say that like if i'm fucking up so bad why just kick

2193
03:13:23,480 --> 03:13:28,920
me out and uh i think i was it was a cry for help i cannot imagine you saying that at all

2194
03:13:29,480 --> 03:13:35,160
that seems really weird you can ask dad i i like i would bring it up sometimes about like well maybe

2195
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:40,600
if you kicked me out it wouldn't be a big problem uh but of course i was terrified of that notion

2196
03:13:40,600 --> 03:13:45,320
because i've never done anything by myself in my entire life i'm like half freak out mode half

2197
03:13:45,320 --> 03:13:50,360
like just whatever complacency i think is the biggest problem for our generation it's horrible

2198
03:13:50,360 --> 03:13:55,720
and like that's it's exactly why i talked about this in the decompression chamber that's why the

2199
03:13:55,720 --> 03:14:02,040
decompression chamber exists is because like i i hate the idea of like my content always being

2200
03:14:02,040 --> 03:14:06,440
the same yeah because the second i fall into a cycle of doing the same thing all the time

2201
03:14:06,440 --> 03:14:11,800
everything falls apart like mentally that's when i because i just become like i'm not even making

2202
03:14:11,800 --> 03:14:18,920
progress and it's so easy it's so easy to just be like well this makes me a baseline amount of money

2203
03:14:18,920 --> 03:14:24,040
so let's just keep doing that forever and then like nothing improves that's how everything gets

2204
03:14:24,040 --> 03:14:28,040
shit you know that's literally how everything gets shit like i feel like i have to constantly

2205
03:14:28,040 --> 03:14:32,840
challenge myself to come up with something new and it always pays off like you know the only way

2206
03:14:32,840 --> 03:14:38,600
to make something like grow is to like if things aren't getting any better at like they're just

2207
03:14:38,600 --> 03:14:42,760
staying the same and you want them to get better something has to change you know you can't just

2208
03:14:42,760 --> 03:14:47,400
do the same thing forever and hope that it's gonna change by itself you know it just feels like like

2209
03:14:47,400 --> 03:14:53,400
to me i don't know how often i talk about it but it's just whatever i think about how in like like

2210
03:14:53,400 --> 03:14:58,760
three years ago when i started doing the thing that actually interests me making videos i just

2211
03:14:58,760 --> 03:15:05,160
found this well within myself of an ability to do shit that i had never had before in my entire life

2212
03:15:05,160 --> 03:15:11,560
and an incredible drive to do it that i had never experienced before and i feel like that was me

2213
03:15:11,560 --> 03:15:17,080
finally being a real person for the first time like i always had an ability and i just you know

2214
03:15:17,080 --> 03:15:22,120
there it was i just needed something to do that hill giant could very easily have just killed it

2215
03:15:22,120 --> 03:15:28,360
truly was a hill giant in my life that i put against such eloquent terms what what are we talking

2216
03:15:28,360 --> 03:15:35,880
about i know the feeling just because like you know i've said i've said everything before yeah but

2217
03:15:35,880 --> 03:15:43,000
uh like for for so long i thought i was going to be either a filmmaker or a writer or all these other

2218
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:48,680
things that like that like i that i wanted to do and the reason i'm not those is because i just didn't

2219
03:15:48,680 --> 03:15:55,720
do them yeah i would talk about them all the time i'd said like every single day i would like give

2220
03:15:55,720 --> 03:15:59,720
myself a pep talk about how i was gonna be a director and how i was gonna like run away from

2221
03:15:59,720 --> 03:16:07,320
home and make movies and like become this renegade director homeless man i guess and like like i talked

2222
03:16:07,320 --> 03:16:14,520
about it constantly and i directed nothing yeah i never made a fucking movie you know and like

2223
03:16:14,520 --> 03:16:20,120
quentin tarantino and fucking uh what's his name robert rodriguez had like this book or um well

2224
03:16:20,120 --> 03:16:24,200
robert rodriguez had a book about this but tarantino and him talked about this at a panel somewhere

2225
03:16:24,200 --> 03:16:29,800
yeah where they were like tarantino like very clearly laid out these rules for how to become a

2226
03:16:29,800 --> 03:16:36,200
director he said every day of the week i'm on fire every day of the week write scripts and on the

2227
03:16:36,200 --> 03:16:42,280
weekend shoot the scripts that's it that's all you have to do right every day and on the weekend

2228
03:16:42,280 --> 03:16:47,240
shoot the scripts you just wrote you're done you're a director just do that for several years you'll

2229
03:16:47,240 --> 03:16:52,760
be great you'll eventually get great right and i read that and i was like yeah wrote no scripts

2230
03:16:52,760 --> 03:16:59,400
directed no movies continued to talk about it for years yeah um you know and i did write a novel

2231
03:16:59,400 --> 03:17:04,120
but i immediately abandoned it when i realized that editing it would be a chore um so like that's

2232
03:17:04,120 --> 03:17:07,560
funny because editing is my favorite part of writing that's when you you're gonna be a successful

2233
03:17:07,560 --> 03:17:13,160
writer congratulations you take something that sucks and you make it less sucky i wrote my novel

2234
03:17:13,160 --> 03:17:17,320
in a month and then i never looked at it again the best part is when you find a sense like i can make

2235
03:17:17,320 --> 03:17:22,360
it better by doing this and then you get instantly erect and it's like i know i love that in my analysis

2236
03:17:22,360 --> 03:17:26,920
writing and that's the thing like like all this time the whole we are completely opposite about

2237
03:17:26,920 --> 03:17:31,800
writing because every time i write a script i do like one pass i'm like meh it's fine the whole

2238
03:17:31,800 --> 03:17:36,760
the entire time that i was talking about being a director that saw him up being a writer that whole

2239
03:17:36,760 --> 03:17:41,720
time i was writing an anime blog in the background just because i wanted to do it yeah right just for

2240
03:17:41,720 --> 03:17:46,200
fun didn't think it was going anywhere just hey yeah oh i watched the shot let's talk about that

2241
03:17:46,200 --> 03:17:50,280
it'll be funny i think about this all the time because all the time just like because i'm like

2242
03:17:50,280 --> 03:17:54,200
i really want to just write i want to just tell stories i wanted to be a son of a little kid

2243
03:17:54,200 --> 03:17:57,480
and like i've just everything has been like what medium do i want to do it in because like i've

2244
03:17:57,480 --> 03:18:00,920
still written it's like i'm gonna make fucking video games and that didn't work because i was

2245
03:18:00,920 --> 03:18:05,320
fucking complicated so it's like i'll do animation and like i don't like that and then like it's i've

2246
03:18:05,320 --> 03:18:10,520
been going lower and lower and lower down to writing and like my mind has always been like i

2247
03:18:10,520 --> 03:18:15,800
can write easily so that clearly that means it's not hard it doesn't doesn't count it's a lesser form

2248
03:18:15,800 --> 03:18:20,600
that is the absolute worst way you could have interpreted exactly because i'm fucking retarded

2249
03:18:20,600 --> 03:18:25,880
so even now i feel like i'm not living up to my potential by just writing um which is dumb cut that

2250
03:18:25,880 --> 03:18:32,520
shit out because i personally i like i feel like i have more core respect for writing than anything

2251
03:18:32,840 --> 03:18:37,080
i do too because like all the other like even if you're your favorite fucking like tv show or

2252
03:18:37,080 --> 03:18:40,680
video game would suck dick if the writer didn't show up because it's like look at these pretty

2253
03:18:40,680 --> 03:18:47,320
graphics sitting there like jerking off got them i mean i think like i think that uh like you know

2254
03:18:48,200 --> 03:18:54,520
a just an image can convey an incredible amount of storytelling and like or just an animation

2255
03:18:54,520 --> 03:19:03,640
could um but like the level at which you're like doing a 22 episode animation uh 12 times right

2256
03:19:03,640 --> 03:19:09,400
like yeah you need something like like like the only way that's gonna have a deep meaningful thing

2257
03:19:09,400 --> 03:19:16,040
to it is if someone spends forever making those images perfect the thing that like to change my

2258
03:19:16,040 --> 03:19:19,880
my mind said like i think i just need to write is that every because i would do comics and stuff

2259
03:19:19,880 --> 03:19:25,320
and i would sit down i'd write the script in like two or three weeks tops it'd be super because

2260
03:19:25,320 --> 03:19:28,440
there's not a lot to it it's just like this is the picture i want and this is what i want them to

2261
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:33,000
say it's basically what i mean i mean i'm not gonna not to say that that's easy but like the writing

2262
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:36,920
part always came easy to me and then like it'd be like three months of drawing it and the entire

2263
03:19:36,920 --> 03:19:40,360
time i feel like i'm not doing anything it's just like well i already know what's supposed to happen

2264
03:19:40,360 --> 03:19:44,200
yeah that's that's how it feels when i'm just inking in the pages i've already sketched i don't

2265
03:19:44,200 --> 03:19:48,920
feel creative at all doing it it just feels like busy work and a fucking chore i actually really

2266
03:19:48,920 --> 03:19:52,440
enjoy inking just because again it's the same thing with editing it's like it's taking the shitty

2267
03:19:52,440 --> 03:19:56,760
drawing and making it look fucking cool hey but ben's stuff it's satisfying in a way but ben's

2268
03:19:56,760 --> 03:20:00,680
actually a good artist so miss sketches don't look like a mess of retarded no my sketches look

2269
03:20:00,680 --> 03:20:05,880
horrible my sketches are like garbage well the thing about ben's inking is that he basically

2270
03:20:05,880 --> 03:20:11,560
just redraws it he does you can you pretty much just like completely redraws do it all in black

2271
03:20:11,560 --> 03:20:16,520
yeah that's what i that's what it's it's not my my sketches are just like like literally like

2272
03:20:16,520 --> 03:20:20,280
everywhere and then i just take it and i take that mess and just make it one nice clean line

2273
03:20:20,280 --> 03:20:25,800
and then he gets me nice and nice and tighten the pants because it's fucking it looks cool yeah i

2274
03:20:25,800 --> 03:20:29,560
i guess i do something like that but the the penciling's the worst because i have no like

2275
03:20:29,560 --> 03:20:32,840
understanding of like perspective or form so i just sit there and just like

2276
03:20:34,600 --> 03:20:38,680
i just want to have the hand out what the fuck they're selling me some books dude they're selling

2277
03:20:38,680 --> 03:20:43,480
me some fucking books is my book there is in the future no is your is yours book the fen folio

2278
03:20:44,200 --> 03:20:47,560
that was the sequel is it perhaps the papyrus of beguiling

2279
03:20:47,560 --> 03:20:53,880
uh well i really there was this one undertale thick i wrote all right i got it i want magma

2280
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:58,760
bolt i'm gonna see if i'm gonna have to fucking consult the way for you undertale thick no it said

2281
03:20:58,760 --> 03:21:10,360
papyrus i wasn't sure no uh anyway for me writing an analysis video like the only analog for it

2282
03:21:10,440 --> 03:21:16,600
for me it is literally the same feeling as jacking off and then just like arnold described

2283
03:21:17,640 --> 03:21:23,320
for me it is exactly like what arnold described with the pump is one to one how i feel writing

2284
03:21:23,320 --> 03:21:28,920
an analysis script and it's really easy for well i will make a comparison sort of like that when i'm

2285
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:34,520
editing a nuzlocke specifically i feel exactly the same as if i'm just sitting there passively

2286
03:21:34,520 --> 03:21:40,680
consuming a video like editing a video that i made to me just feels like sitting and listening to

2287
03:21:40,680 --> 03:21:47,000
my video over and over again which is something i love to do is listening to my own videos and looking

2288
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:52,520
at my own drawings is like my favorite activity that stimulates me more than anything else it is a

2289
03:21:52,520 --> 03:21:58,280
lot of that's how i feel about all my vlogs like i make i make it and it's like it's kind of fun

2290
03:21:58,280 --> 03:22:02,840
and then i watch it back and it's like yeah okay that's a fun video i'd watch it if somebody else

2291
03:22:02,840 --> 03:22:08,280
made it you know and uh i did yeah and i watch it like six more times because i feel like it uh

2292
03:22:08,280 --> 03:22:13,080
and then forget about it forever but like with with writing the like and i guess this is why

2293
03:22:13,080 --> 03:22:18,040
because it so something i've been struggling with lately is the idea that my main channel

2294
03:22:18,040 --> 03:22:24,440
content is not really worth more than my vlogs like in terms of like people are getting almost as

2295
03:22:24,440 --> 03:22:29,800
much out of some not all of them some of the blogs are fucking retarded but like i need to

2296
03:22:30,360 --> 03:22:34,120
there are certain videos i've made that like and i get people telling me this all the time like

2297
03:22:34,120 --> 03:22:38,360
people come onto my reddit and are always like did you write to dark is your real main channel

2298
03:22:38,360 --> 03:22:43,240
like i care way more about the content on there than the main channel because it's way more videos

2299
03:22:43,240 --> 03:22:48,680
covering way broader subject matter and i've gotten out like so many fucking opinions on what you're

2300
03:22:48,680 --> 03:22:54,360
doing right now is you're basically doing a sales funnel with free content yeah it's yeah exactly i'm

2301
03:22:54,360 --> 03:22:59,720
just like i'm just fucking throwing it out like all the stuff that could be i'm making like ten

2302
03:22:59,720 --> 03:23:05,160
dollars a piece on these and they could be like uh every week i could just have a patreon post that's

2303
03:23:05,160 --> 03:23:09,560
just a compilation of a bunch of logs and i don't know if people would value it any less than the

2304
03:23:09,560 --> 03:23:14,600
main channel content you know the thing is like like people don't want to lose like whenever i bring

2305
03:23:14,600 --> 03:23:18,600
this up people are like well i don't want to lose the main channel content because i still value it

2306
03:23:18,600 --> 03:23:24,040
but that doesn't mean that i don't also value these as much well i think like you have to understand

2307
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:29,160
like the levels of people like uh your your your top level is you have digi bro yes that's like your

2308
03:23:29,160 --> 03:23:38,280
267 000 retards you follow yeah and they're that's them well that's that's that's like the the most

2309
03:23:38,280 --> 03:23:43,000
easy to find shit like that's why it's so successful is because it's it's searchable it's you're playing

2310
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:47,160
the game like we've talked about this before and then you have after dark which is like people want

2311
03:23:47,160 --> 03:23:51,880
to go a little bit deeper and then but like the people who are like the most hardcore yeah are

2312
03:23:51,880 --> 03:23:55,640
patrons yeah exactly they are the ones who give the most of a fuck because they're giving me money

2313
03:23:55,640 --> 03:24:02,840
i only have like 500 patrons like you should be 250 000 subscribers right 500 those are the

2314
03:24:02,840 --> 03:24:07,640
people's dicks you want to suck yeah and and none of them well i don't think i don't necessarily

2315
03:24:07,640 --> 03:24:13,160
agree with that i don't i don't think it's good to only appeal to your core no i'm not saying only

2316
03:24:13,160 --> 03:24:18,840
appeal to them or i don't i don't think it's good to to to to i mean prioritize them a little but

2317
03:24:18,840 --> 03:24:25,320
yeah not well i mean like like jesse makes as much money as i do on patreon practically like well

2318
03:24:25,320 --> 03:24:32,840
okay no never mind please forgive what i just said that was true once i make i make a lot more now

2319
03:24:32,840 --> 03:24:39,400
than he does but but only because i mean because he's still charging weekly no i charge per video

2320
03:24:39,400 --> 03:24:44,920
like oh my god you must make a killing i change everything monthly i only put out like three

2321
03:24:45,880 --> 03:24:50,280
four videos a month and then sometimes like a fifth bonus thing i feel like anyone starting

2322
03:24:50,280 --> 03:24:55,640
patreon now you can't do that anymore uh i don't know about that man i don't like i don't know about

2323
03:24:55,640 --> 03:24:59,640
that attitude because like patreon had already been going for a while when we jumped in everybody

2324
03:24:59,640 --> 03:25:04,280
who's no because when we uh when we all started you couldn't do monthly things yeah you could

2325
03:25:04,280 --> 03:25:09,160
not not in the beginning it was always there no it was not really no when i made it i don't remember

2326
03:25:09,160 --> 03:25:14,040
monthly it was only per creation that was added later oh i hear a distance snort that means there's

2327
03:25:14,040 --> 03:25:20,040
a labyrinth here with a minotaur and the uh the thing is everybody's doing monthly and that's what

2328
03:25:20,040 --> 03:25:25,000
they expect like all the big channels that run patreon i despise monthly because to me and monthly's

2329
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:30,920
games fuck to me like never to me the whole point of it is that i have to make videos agree you know

2330
03:25:30,920 --> 03:25:35,560
and i have i get paid for exactly how much work i do and that's like what incentivizes me to make

2331
03:25:35,560 --> 03:25:40,360
more the problem i'm gonna die people get scared when it's per video because i don't know how much

2332
03:25:40,440 --> 03:25:43,960
they're gonna pay for and then you have to put that bigger shoes not gonna put you can put a cap

2333
03:25:43,960 --> 03:25:49,080
and blah blah but if you say month it's like oh i'm making 12 payments a year i'm extremely careful

2334
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:55,880
and i'm very clear about what you're gonna get if you pay for per video you know but like um i think

2335
03:25:55,880 --> 03:26:02,440
but at the same time i feel like that's like kind of in some ways i'm throwing like i make these posts

2336
03:26:02,440 --> 03:26:07,400
at the end of like every other month where it's like all the unpatroned videos in one post and

2337
03:26:07,400 --> 03:26:14,680
it's like 40 videos that i'm putting in one post some of which are my favorite videos i made that

2338
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:21,080
that month you know and i'm like am i really like considering this like all like all 40 of these

2339
03:26:21,080 --> 03:26:26,120
are only worth as much as one main channel videos some of which are like six minutes long and not

2340
03:26:26,120 --> 03:26:30,760
that interesting you know compared to some of these blogs it's really dumb but but the reason

2341
03:26:30,760 --> 03:26:37,400
i feel that way the reason this distinction exists is because the vlogs i like i make it and it's

2342
03:26:37,400 --> 03:26:43,880
just like yeah that was fun and the videos are literally masturbating it's like this is this

2343
03:26:43,880 --> 03:26:50,120
is oh no this is what i want my life to be you know snorke snorke killed me while i was trying to

2344
03:26:50,120 --> 03:26:57,320
run up the stairs to get away from him what it sucks oh that was really dumb i thought i could

2345
03:26:57,320 --> 03:27:02,040
take i had been i had been i had been wrecking shit because i got a ring of magic power that

2346
03:27:02,040 --> 03:27:06,120
gave me extra mp and i had finally gotten enough piety with that who met that he had started to

2347
03:27:06,120 --> 03:27:11,480
do the best thing he does which is restore your mp every time you kill something with magic so you

2348
03:27:11,480 --> 03:27:17,240
can just kill kill kill kill and it all just it all just you'd become like a steamroller of

2349
03:27:17,240 --> 03:27:22,200
magical death so i had i had kind of been having that going for a while but i got overconfident

2350
03:27:22,200 --> 03:27:28,280
and i find snorke fucking snorke man what a dick yeah he's someone draw a fan out of snorke

2351
03:27:28,280 --> 03:27:32,600
he's just like a really he's just like a really strong troll and he's also really fat and ugly

2352
03:27:32,600 --> 03:27:36,520
he's particularly ugly i think that's in his description he must go on youtube

2353
03:27:37,960 --> 03:27:46,200
yeah but yeah uh i guess i guess the long and short of what i'm describing is that i am making

2354
03:27:46,200 --> 03:27:54,280
the mistake of putting like like basing how much my content is valued like like what value i'm

2355
03:27:54,280 --> 03:27:59,720
putting on it in a public sense of like what people are charging me based on how much i value my

2356
03:27:59,720 --> 03:28:04,840
content and that's the mistake i'm making yeah it's not i'm not basing it on how much my content

2357
03:28:04,840 --> 03:28:11,480
is valued by other people but just strictly like i think writing a post is fun and the feelings it

2358
03:28:11,480 --> 03:28:16,040
gives me are like i've accomplished something right you know like if i write if i write something

2359
03:28:16,040 --> 03:28:20,600
like that that flying witch video which is like you know six and a half minutes and i wrote it all

2360
03:28:20,600 --> 03:28:24,840
at once like in one night it's not a thought i'd ever really had before and i just came up with it

2361
03:28:24,840 --> 03:28:31,080
all but the process of writing it was like oh yeah i'm fucking coming and then it's like yeah

2362
03:28:31,080 --> 03:28:36,200
that's a patron video whereas there's like vlogs i have where i'm like summarizing the whole fucking

2363
03:28:36,280 --> 03:28:41,800
universe and like all of anime history and it's like this is life changing for some people

2364
03:28:42,520 --> 03:28:47,080
and and i'm like yeah throw it into the the fucking pile with the 40 other vlogs you know

2365
03:28:47,080 --> 03:28:52,680
well would you want to improve the production values on the vlogs of vlog type content if you

2366
03:28:52,680 --> 03:28:56,440
were going to make it a main channel thing i definitely am going to do that but i don't think

2367
03:28:56,440 --> 03:29:01,480
i'll ever i don't know if i'll ever be able to bring myself to patron it you know like like maybe

2368
03:29:01,480 --> 03:29:05,400
the yuri on ice video that me and victor recorded which is going on the main channel

2369
03:29:05,400 --> 03:29:09,880
it's basically like a plebeian the lead discussion it's me and him sitting chairs we discuss yuri

2370
03:29:09,880 --> 03:29:15,000
on ice uh i'm even gonna have devout edit it and put a bunch of footage in so it should be

2371
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:20,840
patronable but even then i'm just like but it's not written you know like what value could there

2372
03:29:20,840 --> 03:29:28,920
possibly be in something i didn't write there's a few moments where i say um in this like how

2373
03:29:28,920 --> 03:29:33,560
could anyone pay money for something where i say the weirdest fucking comment and it blew my mind

2374
03:29:33,560 --> 03:29:37,960
and i was just like it changed the way i'm gonna do videos on rebel pixels and because i got a

2375
03:29:37,960 --> 03:29:43,960
bunch of thumbs up too because i i did these last two videos that are about um why i think you like

2376
03:29:43,960 --> 03:29:49,160
youtube is a symptom of a bigger problem and shit yeah yeah that was a great yeah and and someone

2377
03:29:49,160 --> 03:29:53,560
said to me i really like this video but i can't get into it because it's scripted i hate your

2378
03:29:53,560 --> 03:29:59,000
scripting voice it sounds super unnatural i'd rather you just talk and like it got like 15

2379
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:05,640
thumb ups like we were just like weird well i mean i i do understand that like i can there are there

2380
03:30:05,640 --> 03:30:13,240
are normies the idea normies want you to be a normie uh yeah and sometimes you have to appease

2381
03:30:13,240 --> 03:30:18,360
them i guess it's so weird like all the videos that get the best responses in terms of engagement

2382
03:30:18,360 --> 03:30:24,600
not in views but engagement are always the ones where i'm just like uh i mean fucking i guess like

2383
03:30:25,400 --> 03:30:30,120
dick sucking sure like that's that's the kind of language that people seem to really resonate

2384
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:35,160
i mean i mean if that's if they knew what my dick looked like they'd want to suck it for sure

2385
03:30:35,160 --> 03:30:40,360
if that's the truth then i guess it makes sense to go for that kind of content because like i think

2386
03:30:40,360 --> 03:30:44,680
on rebel pixels this year i'm not gonna script anything real real quick can we all appreciate

2387
03:30:44,680 --> 03:30:51,320
that for like how long has this been going three three and a half hours now tom has been non-stop

2388
03:30:51,320 --> 03:30:56,920
shitting on his appearance and abilities but when it came to his dick he was like i mean if they saw

2389
03:30:56,920 --> 03:31:02,600
my dick they would definitely want to suck it so i think this man must be a monster i think yeah i

2390
03:31:02,600 --> 03:31:07,880
think we can say that tom has something to be confident about i just have the opinions of other

2391
03:31:07,880 --> 03:31:15,080
people who are very clear yeah see that's exactly the kind of thing you'd say if you had a fucking nine

2392
03:31:15,080 --> 03:31:24,120
inch dick i don't know put your hand up to mine for a second oh my god it's a pretty big hand it's a

2393
03:31:24,120 --> 03:31:34,600
pretty big hand it's a huge hand i don't i don't know well that was a diversion it sure was sorry

2394
03:31:34,680 --> 03:31:39,320
what were you saying tom um before i got out i was i was saying did you hear what i said when you

2395
03:31:39,320 --> 03:31:46,040
left yeah youtube uh sucks so the value to i gotta tell you that people want your your something about

2396
03:31:46,040 --> 03:31:50,680
the owl something about the owl i've gotten the same thing i've gotten the same thing that people

2397
03:31:50,680 --> 03:31:54,600
people tell me all the time like i really need your unscripted content because it feels like

2398
03:31:54,600 --> 03:31:59,240
i'm having a conversation with somebody you know but do you think about that that's the entire

2399
03:31:59,240 --> 03:32:03,720
fucking reason youtube took off in the first place because it wasn't all like this fucking production

2400
03:32:04,680 --> 03:32:09,400
and like we kind of are forgetting that because we want to be cool all the big guys are vloggers

2401
03:32:09,400 --> 03:32:14,920
all the biggest youtubers are fucking vloggers that doesn't mean well i mean what about guys like

2402
03:32:15,800 --> 03:32:20,920
PewDiePie vlogger now i'm not talking about doesn't play video games anymore just vlogs that's true i

2403
03:32:20,920 --> 03:32:26,840
meant guys like uh best guy ever dammit i can't remember the fucking name of these guys what's

2404
03:32:26,840 --> 03:32:31,800
the guy who made the the thing about the politics videos about the animal kingdom that guy cgp

2405
03:32:31,960 --> 03:32:37,400
like cgp gray's content i think is really good generally and it's scripted and i'm just saying

2406
03:32:37,400 --> 03:32:41,720
that there is a market no there's absolutely a market but i i think there are lots of people

2407
03:32:41,720 --> 03:32:45,880
out there who appreciate shit like we're doing right now i guess so i think here's the thing

2408
03:32:45,880 --> 03:32:53,000
about cgp gray though like his main channel content which is phenomenal yeah and is very

2409
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:59,800
successful um but like i don't think he'd have a patreon that's as successful as he did if not for

2410
03:32:59,800 --> 03:33:06,360
the hello internet podcast because people know him damn like that's a good point yeah like i don't

2411
03:33:06,360 --> 03:33:11,640
know the history of that but you could be right he i mean he uh well it's hard to like put dates on

2412
03:33:11,640 --> 03:33:16,040
this without looking into it but like you know he was running that channel for a long time and i

2413
03:33:16,040 --> 03:33:21,080
always just thought of it as like a guy who makes really informative videos and then i listen to

2414
03:33:21,080 --> 03:33:25,800
hello internet and he's a fascinating character like he has a really interesting personality

2415
03:33:25,800 --> 03:33:30,040
and i love him and it's him and uh and brady from numberphile and they have great chemistry

2416
03:33:30,040 --> 03:33:34,520
and it's a good podcast it's the first podcast i ever really listened to actually yeah never was

2417
03:33:34,520 --> 03:33:39,720
never big in a podcast until recently i'm getting big in a podcast now too yeah and now and that's

2418
03:33:39,720 --> 03:33:45,640
that's a thing like the pcp kind of came about like none of us were into podcasts yeah like when

2419
03:33:45,640 --> 03:33:49,960
the pcp came about that's not that's not i have way more that's not true i was not gonna lie i have

2420
03:33:49,960 --> 03:33:55,080
way more fun doing pcp i was then i do making my videos i was hugely into this is the most fun

2421
03:33:55,160 --> 03:33:59,400
i've had making anything like in the last like three months i was i was hugely into the ricky

2422
03:33:59,400 --> 03:34:05,240
jervais show which is um which is based on the ricky jervais podcast so that was like i was actually

2423
03:34:05,240 --> 03:34:10,280
a huge influence on t-bap and like the way that the t-bap was presented t-bap is pretty podcast

2424
03:34:10,280 --> 03:34:14,680
pretty much a podcast yeah yeah like the true it always was in the in like the later episodes the

2425
03:34:14,680 --> 03:34:18,840
reason i drew them sitting at a table is because that's how they are in the ricky jervais really

2426
03:34:18,840 --> 03:34:23,480
even i didn't know that i i well i feel like i definitely mentioned okay maybe i just forgot

2427
03:34:23,480 --> 03:34:30,120
yeah fair enough i mean like back when me and tom and jessie first started talking we were all

2428
03:34:30,120 --> 03:34:36,360
like pretty harsh on the idea of like podcasts and unedited content like we all thought it was

2429
03:34:36,360 --> 03:34:42,440
total bullshit and that like no one would care about it and like like when fucking poor neil x

2430
03:34:42,440 --> 03:34:47,000
who like at the time that he made elements of brony like we all thought this will never take

2431
03:34:47,000 --> 03:34:51,800
off unless it's a super highly edited thing because they're so long yeah and so we put so

2432
03:34:51,880 --> 03:34:58,680
much if that came out now it could just be like and i told him this over time like you

2433
03:34:58,680 --> 03:35:03,640
should like like like once it got to the point where like this is now what kind of contents

2434
03:35:03,640 --> 03:35:08,440
popular on youtube and in his series was just the visionary i've told him a bunch of times like

2435
03:35:08,440 --> 03:35:12,840
dude just put out parts five and six as podcasts because in the current state of youtube it will

2436
03:35:12,840 --> 03:35:18,600
be exactly as accessible it might be more successful because then you can just put that on behind

2437
03:35:18,600 --> 03:35:22,760
something else yeah as opposed to having to look at it for two fucking hours yeah and like

2438
03:35:23,320 --> 03:35:29,800
it's such a shame but like we were all super anti-podcast until like literally up until

2439
03:35:29,800 --> 03:35:37,400
we started like um like biggest problem in the universe convinced me and jessie like oh my god

2440
03:35:37,400 --> 03:35:41,640
podcasts are cool i could have fucking escaped that last life if i'd remember that i had fucking

2441
03:35:41,720 --> 03:35:47,800
past wall i always forget about past wall the best spell in the universe it just it just

2442
03:35:47,800 --> 03:35:52,040
sends you through a wall and nothing can fucking fall you did they fail the one time you tried to

2443
03:35:52,040 --> 03:35:56,680
use it well it failed because i use it in the it's because i use it on the wrong spot you can only

2444
03:35:56,680 --> 03:36:01,960
go through like the wall the wall can't extend into infinity yeah okay like you can only move

2445
03:36:01,960 --> 03:36:06,760
through relatively thin move through one square essentially uh so there's some there's some limit

2446
03:36:07,320 --> 03:36:11,480
forget how it's determined anyway seems like something you might want to figure out anyway yeah

2447
03:36:11,480 --> 03:36:18,120
we were all like oh no we were all pretty i mean even before that like we were fairly anti let's play

2448
03:36:18,120 --> 03:36:22,680
until we got into game grumps and then we were fairly anti-podcast and then we got anti let's play

2449
03:36:22,680 --> 03:36:27,640
again i'm still trying to do it i never i'm doing a let's play right now oh no ben's doing a let's

2450
03:36:27,640 --> 03:36:31,720
you know what i guess i guess that's technically true it feels more like a podcast if i was playing

2451
03:36:31,720 --> 03:36:36,760
the game i'd be really mad that's that's why we got like because the re like i had this perception

2452
03:36:36,760 --> 03:36:43,240
that let's play meant like you know something shit yeah until i found actually you know it wasn't

2453
03:36:43,240 --> 03:36:47,800
okay i was into game grumps for a long time but what got me into the idea of doing let's plays

2454
03:36:47,800 --> 03:36:54,440
and podcasts was uh yacht sees one uh let's try it out oh yes and like just like realizing that you

2455
03:36:54,440 --> 03:36:59,720
could just have a video game just be there while you just talked about whatever it was like oh

2456
03:36:59,720 --> 03:37:04,760
this can be a let's play or podcast i guess i guess that's and that's where digi bros came from

2457
03:37:04,760 --> 03:37:11,080
you know maybe i'm still just in like 2010 i mean have you ever watched digi bros it's just a podcast

2458
03:37:11,080 --> 03:37:16,120
we don't even talk about the game i never watched digi bros never really i don't think i well maybe

2459
03:37:16,120 --> 03:37:22,040
i watched like one or two but i i just my stigma for let's plays runs deep a lot of people's does and

2460
03:37:22,040 --> 03:37:26,200
i think that's the only reason that channel's never gotten bigger because it's it we were talking

2461
03:37:26,200 --> 03:37:29,800
about this on a lot of you changed the name to something that said it was just like this really

2462
03:37:29,800 --> 03:37:33,400
doesn't have anything to do with let's plays well i've been meaning to like we've been talking a lot

2463
03:37:33,400 --> 03:37:37,800
about this because for the longest time we were putting no effort into it deliberately because

2464
03:37:37,800 --> 03:37:44,520
it was just for fun but like it started to really baffle me that for money well like digi bros was

2465
03:37:44,520 --> 03:37:49,800
started before i had like before after dark became a vlogging channel that's posting all the time

2466
03:37:49,880 --> 03:37:55,640
right and then it slowly became really weird to me that like my vlogging channel has like people

2467
03:37:55,640 --> 03:38:00,920
who watch all these fucking videos like they'll get like 10 000 views per video you know and it

2468
03:38:00,920 --> 03:38:07,400
could be the most inane weird random shit and yet the digi bros channel which is the same content

2469
03:38:07,400 --> 03:38:12,680
just with a video game overlaid which to my mind makes it better there's something to watch other

2470
03:38:12,680 --> 03:38:18,520
than me half shaded in darkness gets no views and i'm like the only reason this is is that people

2471
03:38:18,520 --> 03:38:24,680
think it's a let's play yeah it's really not it's just a podcast it's no different from the pcp

2472
03:38:24,680 --> 03:38:29,080
or my vlogs when i think let's play i think some really obnoxious motherfuckers screaming at a game

2473
03:38:29,080 --> 03:38:34,200
right yeah even though you know it's me and i would maybe you're sitting at the game maybe you

2474
03:38:34,200 --> 03:38:39,160
finally sold out it's always victor who plays the games well that makes it better off this right

2475
03:38:39,160 --> 03:38:46,840
off the bat um i am incompetent at video games so it would be unwatchable if i play victor's

2476
03:38:46,840 --> 03:38:52,280
barely competent but at least he can play and talk at the same time and i can't uh i can't do that

2477
03:38:52,280 --> 03:38:58,600
either but yeah i can never stream streaming is something i'm gonna be able to do but yeah it's

2478
03:38:58,600 --> 03:39:04,040
really funny to me how like how we can go through these phases of like thinking it's thinking podcasting

2479
03:39:04,040 --> 03:39:08,840
is totally lame until any of us heard one podcast that we liked and immediately wanted to do that

2480
03:39:08,840 --> 03:39:12,760
seems weird but it doesn't seem weird at all like if you see nothing but shit about a format it's like

2481
03:39:12,760 --> 03:39:17,560
oh this format shit and they seem to go it's like oh it can be that i felt like what i felt that way

2482
03:39:17,560 --> 03:39:24,840
about vlogs until uh until i start nice dad or something no um max landis a plus three oh yeah

2483
03:39:24,840 --> 03:39:29,560
these vlogs yeah those are pretty great yeah and like what inspired me to start doing all the vlogs

2484
03:39:29,560 --> 03:39:35,400
in digital after dark was how shit max landis's quality is so shit and yet decent quality i would

2485
03:39:35,400 --> 03:39:39,480
be watched like like like my what do you mean so shit me a decent quality well like he feels like

2486
03:39:39,480 --> 03:39:45,720
a laptop yeah like the actual quality of the microphone audio and video is more respect than

2487
03:39:45,720 --> 03:39:51,000
that he writes movies he doesn't you know make doesn't he care about the fucking cinema well

2488
03:39:51,000 --> 03:39:54,040
that's the point it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that's the whole point here well yeah that's

2489
03:39:54,040 --> 03:39:58,840
the thing like i for the longest time my policy has always been i won't make a video i wouldn't

2490
03:39:58,840 --> 03:40:04,920
watch and then like i always thought i won't watch stuff with shit video and audio quality

2491
03:40:04,920 --> 03:40:09,640
but i start following max landis and he has videos where it's like he's you know traveling

2492
03:40:09,640 --> 03:40:14,840
and he's like in a hotel room and he just like clearly whipped open a laptop and hit record and

2493
03:40:14,840 --> 03:40:21,000
started talking into like the shittiest camera ever but what he's saying is interesting so i was

2494
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:26,120
watching these and i started watching and i'm like wait i'm willing to watch this i could make this

2495
03:40:26,840 --> 03:40:31,720
like in 10 seconds i could flip on my phone and have better image and audio quality there's a lot

2496
03:40:31,720 --> 03:40:35,720
of videos that ideas have that fall through the cracks so i'm just like i'm not willing to just do

2497
03:40:35,720 --> 03:40:42,440
this yeah and well i bought a gorilla pod buddy so that's how you do that no no no what happened

2498
03:40:42,440 --> 03:40:49,640
i had a fucking ring of wizardry from the first room and i fucking died well man well that

2499
03:40:49,640 --> 03:40:55,480
you're a wizard i would have made all the fucking difference that's so good to get early because

2500
03:40:55,480 --> 03:40:59,240
suddenly you don't have you barely even have to level up before you can cast your dang spells

2501
03:40:59,240 --> 03:41:03,000
just cast them right off the bat because it's fucking your aptitudes through the roof

2502
03:41:03,000 --> 03:41:07,880
incidentally here's here's my advice on how to get into lower quality content how to get into it okay

2503
03:41:07,880 --> 03:41:12,200
how to get into making like like lower quality making that's real i'm always looking to make

2504
03:41:12,200 --> 03:41:17,000
low quality content did you tell me more how to get yourself low production value how to get

2505
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:23,880
yourself mentally into the idea of making lower quality content all right is to belt out a ton of

2506
03:41:23,880 --> 03:41:29,640
it all at once like what got me like what i did do that one time and it was great what launched the

2507
03:41:29,640 --> 03:41:36,520
digi bro after dark vlogging like thing like this this happened just all at once because you know

2508
03:41:36,520 --> 03:41:40,760
we're talking about this channel's been around for years yeah it's been around for like three years

2509
03:41:40,760 --> 03:41:46,360
and it's uploads at like maybe once a month maybe twice a month sometimes a vlog sometimes a podcast

2510
03:41:46,360 --> 03:41:53,080
like whatever was like something that didn't have a place right in one day i put out three vlogs

2511
03:41:53,080 --> 03:41:58,200
like like filmed back to back and just released them as soon as they were done and then it was just

2512
03:41:58,200 --> 03:42:03,320
like this is now a channel where this can happen and therefore and like i didn't stop all week i put

2513
03:42:03,320 --> 03:42:08,200
out a video every day or two videos a day all week and people were like digi's lost his fucking mind

2514
03:42:08,200 --> 03:42:13,320
what's happening but but then also people were like this is epic this needs to be my life now

2515
03:42:13,320 --> 03:42:19,320
and i was like this will be your life and then i didn't stop for six months and this is where we are

2516
03:42:19,320 --> 03:42:26,280
now um yep yep the three videos i did that day the first one was called losing my mind in a room

2517
03:42:26,280 --> 03:42:31,800
full of naked anime girls and it was it was just about how when i look at these posters all i see

2518
03:42:31,800 --> 03:42:36,440
is their flaws because i look at them so often that all i can see is like how shit the art is

2519
03:42:36,440 --> 03:42:40,360
in almost all of these and i'm just like running around my room with a camera pointing at posters

2520
03:42:40,360 --> 03:42:45,080
and going look at how her neck does this thing it's so fucking weird i hate it look at this one

2521
03:42:45,080 --> 03:42:49,240
her crotch is in the wrong place and i'm just like going around screaming at the camera

2522
03:42:49,240 --> 03:42:55,640
losing my mind literally and uh and that started it all and now it seems like such a fitting way

2523
03:42:55,640 --> 03:42:58,200
of thinking it looks like we are now it was beautiful

2524
03:43:02,040 --> 03:43:06,280
there's a lot of a lot of my vlogs i should be running around my room pointing at posters

2525
03:43:06,280 --> 03:43:12,600
and those are my favorite ones we should all just resolve to just make shit i have been meaning

2526
03:43:12,840 --> 03:43:18,760
i have been meaning to make more of the of the you know those two like essay videos i did i just

2527
03:43:18,760 --> 03:43:23,320
i just don't fucking i just it's just thinking of those are really good you should definitely make

2528
03:43:23,320 --> 03:43:28,440
more of that i do i like them it's just thinking of like what do i want to talk about i just want

2529
03:43:28,440 --> 03:43:33,640
i want my video comment i would recommend just just effort as possible try to consume the media

2530
03:43:33,640 --> 03:43:38,280
that you want to make videos about in general i guess i think it'll just ideas will just come

2531
03:43:38,360 --> 03:43:43,080
another way to get yourself into the mindset of like making worse content is just think about

2532
03:43:43,080 --> 03:43:48,760
how much of it you like like for me it was that maxland is thing but we are all no fans of the

2533
03:43:48,760 --> 03:43:55,560
gibbon take channel sure which is just random bullshit like weird fucking esoteric ideas that

2534
03:43:55,560 --> 03:44:00,200
just spawn out of the ether and i enjoy that channel no no no the only thing about those it's

2535
03:44:00,200 --> 03:44:05,160
not that i have anything against the idea of putting out low low quality low effort content

2536
03:44:05,160 --> 03:44:09,880
it's just that i don't i don't have ideas for like things i actually want to talk about fair well

2537
03:44:09,880 --> 03:44:14,920
that's there's a difference between you and nate i think nate is just a verse to the idea of making

2538
03:44:14,920 --> 03:44:24,120
something he's a paragon that has no like i've thought about it and i i can't do you do it on

2539
03:44:24,120 --> 03:44:28,520
fucking bestie boy bestie boy you fucking do it right so what are you talking about that's fine

2540
03:44:28,520 --> 03:44:33,240
the point is that it's not bad content you're thinking of it wrong like would any of us accuse

2541
03:44:33,320 --> 03:44:39,080
jump cut jack of being a bad video i love jump cut jack it's an amazing video and it probably took

2542
03:44:39,080 --> 03:44:45,000
15 minutes to make probably like i haven't seen jump cut jack why it's like it's like 30 seconds long

2543
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:51,560
and it's wonderful four mags in size hey guys welcome to another fucking video yeah that's it

2544
03:44:51,560 --> 03:44:56,680
it's that's it that's it just given saying hey guys welcome to another fucking video but it's

2545
03:44:56,680 --> 03:45:01,320
through constant like every letter is him in a different position in the room it's magical he

2546
03:45:01,320 --> 03:45:05,640
just turned on a camera and stood in like he stood in somewhere in the room and said the whole

2547
03:45:05,640 --> 03:45:09,240
line then stood somewhere else and said the whole line and then he just edited together so that he's

2548
03:45:09,240 --> 03:45:14,200
teleporting everywhere constantly while saying this one look look i thought about 15 minutes

2549
03:45:14,200 --> 03:45:19,800
give me such a low key genius i can't i'm trying to fix my problem and i've already got it starting

2550
03:45:19,800 --> 03:45:24,440
got it started while i was making the lucifer one i had another one that was being edited by this

2551
03:45:24,440 --> 03:45:30,520
other guy that's like a similar scope to the one punch man one which only took a long time to get

2552
03:45:30,520 --> 03:45:34,680
done because the editor guys are fucking incompetent piece of shit that is the problem when you

2553
03:45:34,680 --> 03:45:43,000
upload the videos yeah outsourced is no fuck you buddy you piece of shit i hit two rings you gotta

2554
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:48,440
find yourself a divu i i do we all need a divu this guy is not my divu the key to do to having a

2555
03:45:48,440 --> 03:45:54,360
divu is to have somebody who's just so in love with your content that they would they would die for

2556
03:45:55,160 --> 03:45:59,640
i get people who tell me that they love it and some of them are content creators the problem is

2557
03:45:59,640 --> 03:46:04,920
you need to find someone who's actually good this is fucking the guy i work with is good but he's a

2558
03:46:04,920 --> 03:46:09,960
little bit unreliable and he's got other things going on that's a cardinal sin it's a cardinal sin

2559
03:46:09,960 --> 03:46:17,080
yeah when is the divu collective actually gonna be a collective so we all get one yeah that'd be

2560
03:46:17,080 --> 03:46:23,480
nice that's an important question it's such a shame divu does not like that meme and doesn't

2561
03:46:23,560 --> 03:46:29,000
understand why it's great it's hilarious wait it seems pretty innocuous it's just

2562
03:46:31,160 --> 03:46:37,160
i thought that was his idea no jesse came up with it oh what like there was one episode he needs to

2563
03:46:37,160 --> 03:46:43,240
embrace it there was one podcast where jesse and divu got into an argument about something yeah and

2564
03:46:43,240 --> 03:46:48,920
jesse felt that he had been steamrolled in his argument so he edited in segments into the video

2565
03:46:48,920 --> 03:46:55,080
where he argues with a straw man of divu that is the divu collective just trying to assimilate him

2566
03:46:55,080 --> 03:47:01,640
and change his opinions to match its own and it was fucking hilarious it was amazing and we all

2567
03:47:01,640 --> 03:47:06,280
like everyone immediately wanted it to be a meme and like divu was like you know i'm not he was like

2568
03:47:06,920 --> 03:47:12,920
he said uh he was like i i don't get it and i don't think it's funny and like i don't care for it

2569
03:47:12,920 --> 03:47:18,280
but i'm not gonna stop it because like you know you can't control these things yeah like it's just

2570
03:47:18,280 --> 03:47:22,760
what you're it's a thing revolving around me now i think he just doesn't like the association he has

2571
03:47:22,760 --> 03:47:28,040
with someone he didn't even like at the time the fact that jesse kind of like went behind his back

2572
03:47:28,040 --> 03:47:34,200
and edited in like an argument but like it well yeah we should just strike back he should he should

2573
03:47:34,200 --> 03:47:38,920
strike back in a new in a new video or so in the next pc page he should argue with jesse about

2574
03:47:38,920 --> 03:47:43,320
something right he should just become the divu collective they already have our own horrible

2575
03:47:43,320 --> 03:47:49,080
jesse meme he doesn't approve that's true that's true we all we all need to we all need to drive

2576
03:47:49,080 --> 03:47:55,800
a stave through jesse's heart in some way only then we hate us all equally you know you know about

2577
03:47:55,800 --> 03:48:00,360
his revenge plan have you heard about that i did hear about that yeah that he has like a really

2578
03:48:00,360 --> 03:48:06,200
elaborate like he as he put it because he was like this isn't because someone was like why don't

2579
03:48:06,200 --> 03:48:10,600
you just like explain it to someone he's like it's not like that he's like it's not like a video

2580
03:48:10,680 --> 03:48:16,040
revenge plan it's like something i would have to actually spend like years staging like this is

2581
03:48:16,040 --> 03:48:22,280
like a really elaborate like a film like like a movie idea plan for all we know boozy floozy is step

2582
03:48:22,280 --> 03:48:28,600
one of this plan it's very possible well he said he said that he had relented for now that these

2583
03:48:28,600 --> 03:48:33,160
plans should never see the light isn't that exactly what he would say if he was trying to get us you

2584
03:48:33,720 --> 03:48:38,520
i don't i don't know if i can it won't work we're gonna betray him tomorrow i'm ready to betray

2585
03:48:38,520 --> 03:48:44,600
anyone at a moment so when jesse's video steps into the ring we're all dead

2586
03:48:50,360 --> 03:48:55,480
speaking of when should we wrap this up i don't know i guess i don't think i can i don't think i

2587
03:48:55,480 --> 03:49:00,040
can play anymore in this fucking game all right well we've got four hours recorded i don't have a

2588
03:49:00,120 --> 03:49:04,680
lot of space left i don't think we have enough i don't think it's enough and we should all go to

2589
03:49:04,680 --> 03:49:10,040
sleep so we can actually make sure there are things to be done tomorrow it's true i'm kind of awake

2590
03:49:10,040 --> 03:49:15,000
now though that's okay i hope you all enjoyed the ultimate procrastinator's decompression chamber
