00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of Rikstie Minutes. It's me, I'm Best, I'm Best, and we got Dig.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't give a fuck, bitch, doing this show the only way that you should, which is under the influence of alcohol.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good, good. I'm keeping it sober, I'm keeping a clean cut over here, because that's just the kind of fucking dude I am. What can I say?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So what do you think of this episode here, Digi?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's alright. I like the concept, and there were a couple of lines of dialogue that were rewarding to me on a meta level, more so than perhaps much of the episode.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I feel like while I like this as an episode idea, it's weird that they framed this as a replacement for dimensional cable, because I don't think it was really that similar.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Maybe they just did that to assure us that they weren't going to do one this season.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I suppose so.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Because I was expecting, because in season two when they did it, Rik did a fourth wall break and said we're doing it again because everyone loved it last time.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I didn't think they'd do it a third time, because A, they've done it twice already, and B, the response to the second one was not nearly as favorable as the original.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I was thinking that if they addressed it all, there will be another fourth wall break, and we got that at the start of the episode.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And that was really gratifying for me on a meta level, the fact that Rik said we're doing this instead of dimensional cable, and I went, oh, like, of course.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But then I think that accidentally set me up to expect it to be anything like dimensional cable, which it's really not.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Instead of crazy vignettes where they just spitball lines and then animate around them in a very appealing aesthetic kind of way, like with the two brothers.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's just called two brothers.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's classic shit. Everybody loves that.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And this was just a bunch of mini Rik and Morty adventures just smashed into one thing, and they were all new.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They were all original. They were cool.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But yeah, it came away a bit lukewarm.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a bunch of episodes that were decent.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's even selling it short. They were good. Some of them were quite interesting and quite funny, but in the end, we're just left with a bunch of shallow experiences that were kind of cheap fun.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, but the weird thing about it is that they're not going...

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This felt more like a story episode to me.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
With the dimensional cable, and granted, the first dimensional cable did have one of the most gripping narrative moments in the show with the family.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But the dimensional cable itself is like a totally ridiculous unscripted goofy shit.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I think the reason the second one wasn't as well received was that both stories were...

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The dimensional cable itself was the same as before. It's just a bunch of retarded bullshit that's hilarious.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But then the B plot was also really dumb, and so it didn't have the impact the original episode had.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This one, though, if they had never mentioned dimensional cable, this would have just seemed like an episode of Rik and Morty.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The point is this idea that Rik has been taking all these memories from Morty, some of them by Morty's request,

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and some of them because Rik got rid of them on purpose for his own reasons, usually which are hilariously petty.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Probably my favorite memory is the one where Rik just says a word wrong.

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He says taking for granted, everybody.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
As opposed to taking for granted, and Morty calls him out on it, and he erased that memory from Morty's mind.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There's also one where Morty beat him at checkers.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
While he was drunk, he wasn't even probably trying, and he still erased that memory.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'd be interested to know the creation process for this episode, because later on, Rik repeatedly says several times,

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Stop thinking of this as a lesson learning thing. Stop thinking of this as a normal narrative episode.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is a vignette episode. Stop taking it so seriously.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He was quite clear to make that point, but it manifests.

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The resulting we get of these micro episodes are good, but they're less out there and wacky and fun than the crazy shit you saw on interdimensional cable.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's the thing. They're less weird than a normal Rick and Morty episode a lot of the time.

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Even though these are the ones that are supposed to drive him literally insane, that's what we were promised at the beginning.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Usually it's just that Morty accidentally got someone killed in some kind of horrific way, and that's why he had the memory erased.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
While those stories are funny and fun, they're not so weird that it doesn't feel like a normal episode of Rick and Morty.

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Here's the other line that was deeply satisfying to me on a meta level, which is where at the very end of the episode,

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
when Rick and Morty are both calling Summer a bitch for no reason, she says,

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
no wonder you're arguing constantly and always behind schedule.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They're like, would you say it? She's like, nothing.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I was like, ah, there we go. That's why this episode happened.

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Because Justin Roiland wanted to do another interdimensional cable and some more unscripted bullshit,

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and Dan Harmon wants the show to be a serious drama show.

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you go back to the original episode, Dan Harmon wrote the half of the episode that was a completely serious story that was heart-wrenching,

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
was written by Dan Harmon, and the other half was Justin Roiland doing improv in a booth.

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I think that maybe there was disagreement about how the second one had gone,

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
where maybe, now I haven't listened to the commentaries on season two yet,

57
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
which I've been meaning to do this whole fucking time when I've never gotten around to,

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
but I should, and then I want to hear the commentaries on this season,

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
because I've kind of followed the production background of Rick and Morty a bit,

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
not only through having listened to the commentaries, but also when season two was airing,

61
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and I don't know if any of this has happened for season three, I haven't paid enough attention,

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
but when season two was airing, for the first episode and the last episode,

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Justin Roiland, like, periscoped and live-streamed the parties that they threw.

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, I remember that, yeah.

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, and during those, during the first one was one of the most fascinating things I've ever watched in my life,

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
specifically because of the fact that half of their people were being poached actively at the time.

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Right, right.

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They were talking about how their lead guy, their lead writer for that season,

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
had just been poached by Disney, and Justin Roiland was saying,

70
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
like, if the show goes downhill next season, it's because we lost this guy,

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and he said things like, you know, everyone was saying that, like,

72
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
because Justin does so much on the show is why it takes so long to come out,

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and like, just not having enough talent on the show is why it's always behind schedule,

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and why, you know, and like, because the talent that is there gets poached by better networks

75
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
who can pay them more, you know, and so they all leave, so no one stays on the show for long enough.

76
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So, like, if Rick and Morty were to go downhill, it would be because they couldn't spend two years

77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
letting Justin and Dan do everything on the show, you know.

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Now, obviously, the season's been pretty great, so they've found, they must have found someone.

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They've just strapped some shit together, yeah, they're working that out so far.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But, like, hearing them mention the idea that, like, oh, you two argue constantly are behind schedule,

81
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and the fact that it was directed at Rick and Morty, like, themselves, like,

82
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
because if it had been directed at more characters, I'd assume the whole cast,

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
or everyone involved is always arguing, but, like, framing it that way made it,

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
like, Justin and Dan are arguing all the time and always behind schedule,

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and, like, it's easy to imagine.

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Of course, that's exactly what it comes off as, yeah.

87
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm saying people, like, just in the last episode of this podcast,

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was talking about how Dan Harmon is known for being impossible to work with

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and a total piece of shit, and Justin Roiland's fucking crazy.

90
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is a guy who, last year, just leaked all this, like, information about a show he was trying to,

91
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
like, he was working with Fox on.

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know if this has been canceled by now, or if it's just, you know,

93
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know how far along it ever was, but he just, like, leaks all this information about his own show

94
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that he had been selling Fox.

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, cool. This is news to me, but all right.

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It was, he got really shit.

97
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why would you do that? Who was the point of that?

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He got shit-faced and leaked all this info, and he was, he posted,

99
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
he posted the text logs he was having with, like, the lead writer on the show,

100
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the guy was, or producer, who was telling him, like,

101
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
what the fuck are you doing? And he was screaming all caps at the guy,

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
this is new media, you motherfucker, like, stop living in the past.

103
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We're in the future now, like, Twitter is the future,

104
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
like, you can't hide shit behind corporate backgrounds and stuff like that,

105
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
like, he's just out, like, he's doing what I would do, basically.

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah, but he's doing it while trying to make a pitch to Fox or whatever, so, like, not...

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I think they already owned the show, like, it was a show that's in pre-production

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
that may or may not come to exist.

109
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay, it's just like, oh, look at me, I'm such a rebel,

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
while I work for a giant corporation making their cartoon, like,

111
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
it seems like a double-stamp, but okay, whatever, that's fine.

112
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, I think he saw it as a promotional thing,

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
like, let's promote this show in a very modern way

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
by releasing all this information and just being transparent about it,

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
which is how I think, you know.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That makes more sense.

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But the point is that Justin really doesn't play by the rules,

118
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and he's insane, you know, he kind of comes from the internet.

119
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He's originally an internet guy, like, he's from Hollywood,

120
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
but he's from the Hollywood internet, you know?

121
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What even is that? What is the Hollywood internet?

122
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Like, what sort of things do Hollywood internet people do?

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Have you ever heard of Channel 101?

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I am aware of the Channel 101 stuff.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's where Rick and Morty comes from.

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The original short was on there.

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But Channel 101, like, was supposed to be...

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The idea of it was that it was, like, people who work in TV.

129
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Like, it was people who were, like, sick of the restrictions

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
of what TV made them do.

131
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And so they went and made this other place

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
where they could break copyright law without getting punished.

133
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
They could, like, basically do whatever the fuck they want.

134
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It was, like, a guerrilla filmmaking thing.

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But, like, everyone involved with it was people who...

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Like, Dan Harmon was involved with Channel 101.

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like, these were all people who worked in TV,

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
but were, like, looking for an escape on the internet.

139
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It just didn't blow up that big.

140
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The only show that I think anybody really knows is Yacht Rock

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and Cautionary Tales of Swords, which are both amazing.

142
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Of course, of course.

143
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But that's why those shows have a little bit more production

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
than the average YouTube show,

145
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
because, like, it was a channel they were trying to launch online,

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
which Dan Harmon tried to do recently,

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
like, his show Harmon Town,

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
which was the Dungeons & Dragons show.

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Do you know about that?

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, that's right. I know of it in general.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I haven't seen any of it.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, they just animated, like, over a...

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Like, they played D&D live in front of an audience

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and then animated the campaign.

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's alright.

156
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It sounded like a terrible idea.

157
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay, nobody understands that D&D is the most boring thing

158
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
in the fucking world if you're not actually playing.

159
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But it's all comedians, though.

160
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, okay, if they know what they're doing, it's...

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's alright.

162
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Is this that show that you see the fucking trailers for

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
on, like, YouTube ads and shit all the time?

164
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Because it looks like the worst thing ever.

165
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Are you implying that I watch YouTube ads?

166
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, I mean, I skip them as much as possible,

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but I see that on mobile.

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The point is that it was on this new...

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Dan Harmon and a bunch of other people tried to create,

170
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
like, their own Hulu, like, a subscription service

171
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
to watch, like, specific shows.

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But it went as well as Tidal did.

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Right.

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Trying to do the same thing, which is,

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
you can't take people away from the websites they want to use

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and make them pay to watch content

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
that they don't even know what it is, you know?

178
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yep, I hear you.

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No one's gonna download Tidal so they can hear

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the new Kanye West album if they haven't already heard it

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and confirmed they liked it.

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They just want to pay for it normally.

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But anyways.

184
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like, there's a reason I didn't buy 4.44, Jay-Z.

185
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I downloaded that shit because I can't buy it anywhere.

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's only on fucking Tidal.

187
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Who's gonna do that? Not me.

188
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well...

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Not that it matters to him. He has a little money in there.

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In any case...

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Okay, so that's all cool.

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But I just did want to say about all that whole point

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
basically tied into that meta comment

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
that Summer makes at the end of this episode here.

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And, okay, so, like, yes.

196
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That is the lampshade hanging.

197
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Sort of explain...

198
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Possibly, as you just placed it forward.

199
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Explaining, like, why this episode seems to be disjointed

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and have, like, a half that's, you know, story-based,

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that doesn't really go anywhere,

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and then the other free-form thing that also feels kind of awkward.

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So, okay, we've got this basically explanation,

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
but that doesn't retroactively make the episode more entertaining

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
or, like, more good.

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It just gives me sort of a sense of satisfaction.

207
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It is an interesting thought about, like,

208
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
why this production is...

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why it took Season 3 so long to come out.

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You know, why they released the April 1st episode

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
that took another three months for the episode.

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
For the season, you know, like...

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Just the idea that Dan and Justin fight all the time

214
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
is entertaining to me because I can easily imagine it.

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You know, like, these guys are insane people.

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And, um...

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't know if that's why the episode itself

218
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
is like how it is, but it would certainly explain

219
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
why, like, I could easily imagine Justin being, like,

220
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
why not do another interdimensional cable?

221
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like, why not? I love it.

222
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You know, and Dan being like,

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
we didn't go...

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We're making it emotional, you know.

225
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Fucking Dan.

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't know, man.

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I almost feel like it's a waste of time

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
to even go into any of the details of the episode.

229
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Like, the moon thing, kind of funny, I guess.

230
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, I don't even blame them for that

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
because of the fact that, like, I loved the second

232
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
interdimensional cable, but that one did get a lot of flag.

233
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Like, I know people who think that episode's bad.

234
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And, like...

235
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I can't imagine why.

236
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I guess Monkey said...

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think Monkey's dissed that episode before.

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Really? But what's his argument that it's just too redundant?

239
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's just the same idea again?

240
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I think just because, I mean,

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
the Jerry half of the episode's not that funny.

242
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's true.

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll give him that, but...

244
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And the skits aren't as memorable as the first time.

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I just feel like I could watch an infinite number of those.

246
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's what I was gonna say.

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They don't all have to be as good as one another.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I will watch as many of those as you make

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
because they're fucking hilarious in concept alone, you know?

250
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I feel the very same.

251
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But, you know, I could see why

252
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
that episode was pretty criticized,

253
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
so I could see why they'd not want to take that route again.

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, I guess so.

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't know, man.

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I got nothing to fucking say about, like, the individual.

257
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Like, oh, it was so funny when the worm came out of Morty's mouth

258
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and they were like, lol, it's poop.

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That was great.

260
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Just pinch it off, dude.

261
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You know?

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay, I got a laugh out of that,

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
but then, like, I don't know, like, the joke dragged a little bit,

264
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and I was like, okay, I get it.

265
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let's wrap this thing up.

266
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The Moonman joke dragged,

267
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and, like, the high point of the joke of the Moonman thing

268
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
was, like, uh...

269
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Huh.

270
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Huh.

271
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay, I get it.

272
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah.

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's good.

274
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You know?

275
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I agree.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There was no real massive peek.

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Lol, he's jacking the dude off when he thinks he's torturing him.

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Kind of funny, but, like, it's...

279
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't...

280
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah, they weren't that funny.

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
They weren't that funny.

282
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
They weren't that funny.

283
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The funniest line in the episode by far to me

284
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
is immediately after Rick and Morty accidentally mind-wipe themselves,

285
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and after Morty's first memory, he says,

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I guess we're kind of like the men in black.

287
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah.

288
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And he asks Rick if he remembers men in black,

289
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and Rick says, I've only got men in black, too.

290
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And he says, well, then you get the concept, and he goes,

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
well, actually, it's mostly random callbacks to the first movie in there.

292
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Like, fucking...

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I lost it at that joke.

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
A couple more at the end of the episode.

295
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
All the jokes that really made me laugh weren't even in the memories,

296
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
except for when Morty beat Rick at Checkers,

297
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and that made me laugh.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That was good.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I went back and watched some of those, like, really fast clip show things that went by.

300
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, like, there was some...

301
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I like when they can cram.

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The fast ones were better than the long ones.

303
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I know, they were.

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They were.

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But then again...

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You know, honestly, some of them felt like they were legitimately, like,

307
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
rejected ideas from the show.

308
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

309
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Like, that Moon Man one could have been a full episode if they wanted to be.

310
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Or just, like, all of these were just things that they thought of for, like,

311
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
minor subplots and then didn't do.

312
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And then they just went, like,

313
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
let's just fill an episode with all of our extra bullshit that we thought was kind of funny.

314
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You know, the way that at the beginning, like,

315
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Rick is like, oh, we're doing a clip show, but they're all new clips.

316
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Like, oh, these are ideas we threw away,

317
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
but at least they're new.

318
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Here they are, everybody.

319
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You know, we got them on the table.

320
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The way he phrased it made it sound like it was stuff they'd thrown out, you know.

321
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You know what?

322
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm just gonna pin this one on the fucking women writers.

323
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Those goddamn fucking women writers.

324
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You can't trust them as far as you can throw them.

325
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why they gotta ruin Rick and Morty in every way like this?

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Actually, my favorite scene is when Morty's gonna kill himself,

327
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and Rick is, like, inspired to join him in a suicide pact.

328
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I do like that.

329
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's just such a Rick moment.

330
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Like, that's what I love about his character,

331
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
is the idea that he'd be like, you know what?

332
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I am down to kill myself.

333
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's do this, motherfucker, you know.

334
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, I like that reckless side to it.

335
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And then Summer coming in just like, oh, you guys are doing this again.

336
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I was like, ah, you got me.

337
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, we all got cucked.

338
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I wanted to see him fucking die.

339
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I really like this idea that Rick,

340
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
because he's so insanely well-prepared and has so much shit set up,

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and generally is only kind of afraid of death.

342
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We'll just let these scenarios play out.

343
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Like, you know, he openly says this isn't the first time we've done this.

344
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Like, we've literally gone down this road before,

345
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
just because he can write all his memories after it's over, you know.

346
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And the fact that he has set-ups for even if him and Morty accidentally wipe,

347
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
like, even this has happened before.

348
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Even them forgetting it happened has happened before.

349
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's right, that's right.

350
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
There's preparations for it, and I...

351
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, that's what I love about Rick and this show.

352
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That's good stuff.

353
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And, you know, just the idea of...

354
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, like, it makes sense that it just reinforces the whole thing.

355
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Like, not only is Rick able to go to infinite realities,

356
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and like, just if everyone dies here, he'll just go somewhere else.

357
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Everyone's fine, like, so, you know, his detachment has begun at that point.

358
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But now, even though he's able to just remove memories from himself

359
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and anyone else and replace them, it's just another layer of, like,

360
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
yeah, like, why would I give a shit about anything?

361
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I can just wipe those memories.

362
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Nothing matters whatsoever.

363
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah, exactly.

364
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's all just entertaining, you know.

365
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And I think this episode was helped for me also by the fact that I actually...

366
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I watched the first 15 minutes, and then I had to stop

367
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
because I had to do other shit, and then I watched the last five minutes just now.

368
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I really think the last five minutes saved the episode.

369
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Like, I think up till that point, I thought it was okay.

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I was like, alright, there's moments in here I like, but some of it's dumb.

371
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The very end, I thought, is the best part.

372
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Like, just when it actually, when it stops being just a clip show

373
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and becomes about them, you know, doing the suicide pact

374
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and, like, this meta idea that they've been doing this before

375
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
was way funnier than any of the actual stories they told.

376
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That's true.

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah, I don't know, man.

378
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I was just pretty disappointed overall in terms of the laugh-o-meter.

379
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah.

380
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't know.

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The stories were not that good.

382
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
They really felt cutting room.

383
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
They didn't feel original, and, like, they felt like stuff

384
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
that wasn't supposed to be in the show, that you watch and go,

385
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
oh, that should have been cut.

386
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Like, I know why you guys didn't put that in the episode

387
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
because it wasn't that good, you know?

388
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah, I don't know, man.

389
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And maybe that's why she was, maybe that's also part of the reference

390
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
to them being behind schedule, is like, they don't have time,

391
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
so they threw in an episode of, like, you know, half-complete shit.

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Who knows?

393
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah, we'll never know.

394
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I can't wait for, I cannot wait for the commentaries for this episode

395
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
because I think this episode, while by itself is not that great,

396
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
will be far more interesting to hear it talked about

397
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
than it will be to have watched it.

398
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's a great point.

399
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I would love to hear the commentary on this episode.

400
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
More than any other episode so far this season.

402
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, and I have a very different kind of engagement with this show, I think,

403
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
than this, you know, this is, I think we should address this, Nate.

404
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This has been a weirdly controversial podcast a lot of the time.

405
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
On occasion, that's true.

406
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think it might just be because, like, people watch this who,

407
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
maybe there's a lot of people who watch this who just are Rick and Morty fans,

408
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
like, maybe these episodes get found, I have no idea,

409
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
because they do get pretty high view counts for views, shows on this channel.

410
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
They get more views than any other thing on this channel, it's true.

411
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah, which is really weird.

412
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But the comments are often, like, aggressively against us,

413
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and they have bigger dislike bars than our normal videos.

414
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So I think people come in here just looking for Rick and Morty reviews,

415
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and when we, for instance, of the last episode,

416
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
went on a seven-minute rant about whether or not Dan Harmon is a liberal cuck,

417
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
we got a lot of flak for that.

418
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Rick and fuck off, that's the good shit, that's the good shit.

419
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, no, but that's sometimes, I mean, for one thing,

420
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
in this episode, the whole time watching the episode,

421
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I thought, I'm gonna have nothing to say about this.

422
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Like, I wasn't even sure if I was gonna be able to do a podcast

423
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
until the meta thing came through, and I went,

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
well, I can talk about that for 20 minutes, you know?

425
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And that's filled up 90% of the time we've been talking right now.

426
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah.

427
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
How worried were you?

428
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm never worried.

429
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I have developed a level of confidence that can talk for any amount of time about anything.

430
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll find a way.

431
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, that's how I felt.

432
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I was just basically gonna reiterate how unfunny,

433
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't wanna, like, oversell how unfunny this was.

434
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It was like, I did get some chuckles, I got some smiles,

435
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
there were some goofs in there, like the fact that the Moonman winked.

436
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
This is like a strong six episode, I think.

437
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, around there, around there.

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Like, I actually, I watched it twice, actually,

439
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
just because I had time while I was editing some other shit.

440
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And the first time, I liked it more the first time,

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
because I just let it wash over me,

442
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and just let the memes fall where they may,

443
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and was like, yeah, pretty positive.

444
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Then the second time.

445
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, I'm imagining watching the whole Moonman section again,

446
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and like, no, it wouldn't be worth it.

447
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's not that funny, like the payoff wasn't that good.

448
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The idea that he was literally a smudge on the lens doesn't really make sense

449
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
with what we saw in the beginning.

450
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He moves, he moves in like the first thing,

451
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
so like, it makes literally no sense,

452
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
but that's kind of what makes it funny, that it makes absolutely no sense.

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't know if that makes it funnier to me.

454
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh, he literally was a smudge on the lens, that's predictable.

455
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Rick and Morty really does a good job of basically explaining everything

456
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and never contradicting its own logic,

457
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and that definitely does contradict its own logic

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
in a way that one could criticize.

459
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I just think that like, it's a wash, like who cares

460
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
if that like doesn't make sense in this particular case.

461
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But, you know, it's a fair criticism.

462
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
If I was the mysterious Mr. Enter, which I am,

463
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I would deduct massive points for that tragic logical break.

464
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It would be a big problem for me.

465
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There's also stuff, probably the most predictable joke in the entire show,

466
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and maybe it's fine that it's predictable,

467
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
is when Rick types in like twisty ties or whatever into his magnet

468
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and gets a bunch of them, which I thought that was really funny.

469
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And then as soon as it shows Morty typing in,

470
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and I went, he's typing in tits.

471
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And then a bunch of chicks with huge tits fly into the house,

472
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and I went, yep, you know, like,

473
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I think it was less funny because I knew exactly,

474
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
because it was obvious.

475
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Like, what, if it had been anything else,

476
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
it would have been funnier because I didn't predict it.

477
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But it was exactly what I thought it would be.

478
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
They're going pretty, okay, I noticed that specifically

479
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
all those women were also redheaded.

480
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So like, it's clearly like a Jessica thing

481
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
that he was doing at that moment.

482
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
They're really going hard with the Jessica thing.

483
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Like, honestly, that kind of like,

484
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it's been annoying me a little bit.

485
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Why is Morty so into this one girl?

486
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Like, wouldn't he just fuck anyone?

487
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What's the deal?

488
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What's the deal here?

489
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I honestly feel like it's kind of a feminine perspective here.

490
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Like, you know, as a guy, I'd fuck anyone.

491
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'd fuck anyone.

492
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
How is that a feminine perspective

493
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
that he is more in love with Jessica?

494
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I think it's just that they're taking that direction.

495
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You don't think it's more feminine to be fixated on,

496
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
like, one person and have that kind of,

497
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
because the men sow the field.

498
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The men sow the field.

499
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The women...

500
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't think so at all.

501
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Whatever, man.

502
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You're like denying the existence of sluts right now.

503
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Like, what are you fucking talking about?

504
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
We're having the exact debate right now

505
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
from Eyes Wide Shut

506
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
between Natalie Portman and Tom Cruise.

507
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I haven't seen Eyes Wide Shut.

508
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You should, but that's exactly the debate

509
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
we're having right now.

510
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
One of my favorite movies.

511
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Everybody watch it.

512
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I highly doubt that that is at all involved

513
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
in the intentions.

514
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I think they're trying to make Jessica

515
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
a more important character

516
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
because she's going to be relevant.

517
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
She has been getting more scenes.

518
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's true.

519
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Because if you watch...

520
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
If you go back to season one,

521
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Jessica...

522
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We mentioned this before,

523
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
that she was kind of a non-...

524
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
She's just a girl who Morty has a crush on.

525
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Every once in a while,

526
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
they feed you a little idea

527
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
that maybe she could like him

528
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
in that classic 80s movie kind of way,

529
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
but it's not that important.

530
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And in the episode where Morty gets a sex spot,

531
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
he doesn't seem to give a fuck.

532
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Granted, in the last episode,

533
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
he objectively fucked a bunch of mermaids.

534
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He sure did.

535
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
He's not a virgin.

536
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So, like, I think in season one,

537
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
the idea was more Morty's this dorky virgin

538
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and he likes this girl

539
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
because he's just into her.

540
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But at this point,

541
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I think it's more that he legitimately

542
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
finds her more attractive than anyone else

543
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and is in love with her.

544
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But why?

545
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I've never heard a reason like why.

546
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Because I think they want to make her

547
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
a major character.

548
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Well, that would explain it, I guess.

549
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Even though that's not really...

550
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
She hasn't done anything other than be hot.

551
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And he's fucked countless mermaids less.

552
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Some people have...

553
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Some people just have one person there.

554
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
My fucking brother, Victor, chased his...

555
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The girl he's now dating,

556
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
he chased for six years

557
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
because he literally couldn't find anyone else attractive.

558
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh, boy.

559
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
We're gonna get into serious red pill territory

560
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
if I go down this road.

561
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Let's not dig too deep into that.

562
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Happens to some people.

563
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Happens to people.

564
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They just have a single target sexuality.

565
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You know?

566
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I can't relate.

567
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Because someone is so...

568
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Imagine...

569
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay.

570
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Imagine, Nate,

571
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
like you've probably never met someone

572
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
who just seems absolutely perfect.

573
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The closest thing that I've ever met

574
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
is this girl in college who was just super hot.

575
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That's the closest I could get.

576
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But imagine you met a girl who's so perfect,

577
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
like so insanely attuned to everything

578
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
you've ever thought or wanted,

579
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
that after meeting her, you think,

580
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
there's no way I can ever be happy with anyone else

581
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
because she's just that perfect.

582
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Like, I've seen the top of the mountain.

583
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
How could I settle for sitting on the side of the mountain?

584
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay, you know what?

585
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
When I find myself in a situation like that,

586
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
here's where my mind goes.

587
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Okay, I know for a fact that nobody's perfect,

588
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
so what's wrong with me

589
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
that I think this person will complete me?

590
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
What do I need to fix about myself

591
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
that I need this addition in my life?

592
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
This is a good defense mechanism for that.

593
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah, I think so.

594
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Because it's not a good position to be in

595
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
if they don't love you back.

596
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
No, it leaves you vulnerable, dude.

597
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It leaves you vulnerable.

598
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You can't be doing that.

599
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Some people, like my brother, get lucky

600
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and they eventually do love you back.

601
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
That's a rare thing, man.

602
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's a rare thing.

603
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, it's a rare thing.

604
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But you know, I get it.

605
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Like, I get why if someone,

606
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
like if the only thing you find attractive

607
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
is like a red head with tits this size

608
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and like everyone else you fuck is second best to that.

609
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Like you fuck some girl who might be a 9 out of 10,

610
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
but is that going to distract you from the 10 out of 10?

611
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You know, like you're always going to be thinking about the,

612
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
especially if it's within grasp,

613
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
because Jessica's kind of within grasp.

614
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That's true.

615
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Like, I'm sure in Morty's mind,

616
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
he thinks like she lives near me.

617
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's not like, it wouldn't be weird

618
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
if we got together, you know?

619
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You know, I feel like it's a little bit

620
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
that they want to have their cake and eat it too,

621
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
that they want Morty to be woke as fuck

622
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and you know, like this increasingly sociopathic guy,

623
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
you know, who's also gotten some morals and shit,

624
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
but then they also wanted to be like a naive kid

625
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
with like this innocent crush.

626
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I think they want to have it both ways a little bit.

627
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I think that's always been the case in this show.

628
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah.

629
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Like, I think it's, it kind of bothered me in season two

630
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
when some episodes Morty was like this hard ass

631
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and then other episodes he's a fucking retard.

632
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Right, right.

633
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And, I mean, that's always the problem

634
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
when you've got a bunch of writers in the show.

635
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's sort of the problem of like the archetype

636
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
of what, of the character that Morty is based on

637
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
versus like the character progression

638
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
throughout the show, you know?

639
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah.

640
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And I think season three's done a much better job

641
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
of keeping him consistent.

642
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I agree.

643
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Like, he's, he's felt pretty consistently woke

644
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
throughout the season.

645
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I haven't really felt like he was just a naive retard

646
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
much this time.

647
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's just the Jessica thing really,

648
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I guess that stands out to me now.

649
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I think that's why, that's why I think she's supposed

650
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to be a major character.

651
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Like, I think there's going to be some kind of development

652
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
in that relationship.

653
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And that's why they want us to keep it in mind.

654
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And if that's not the case, it will be weird.

655
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Like, why bring her up so much

656
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
unless you're going to do something about it.

657
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I agree.

658
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I agree.

659
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Because I don't remember her coming up that much

660
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
in season two.

661
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
She definitely did not.

662
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The most that she ever did was like,

663
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
the most important Jessica has been before this season

664
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
was like that episode where he like made her fall in love

665
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
with him.

666
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And then she, you know, was just mind controlled

667
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
to love him.

668
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
She was fairly relevant in season one.

669
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Like, she's probably mentioned in more than half

670
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
the episodes of season one.

671
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But season two, I don't remember her being a big deal.

672
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But I haven't rewatched season two.

673
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I've seen season one like four times.

674
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So, I'm a bigger expert in that.

675
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I forget.

676
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Cronenberg is season two, right?

677
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
No, that's one.

678
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Fuck.

679
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Okay, I can't keep it.

680
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That's like episode six.

681
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's where they killed the family

682
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and moved to the other universe.

683
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Okay, well whatever.

684
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
All right, well, good tangent.

685
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
See, that's the kind of quality you get under 60 minutes.

686
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That's the good stuff.

687
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Yeah.

688
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
An episode that neither of us had anything to say about

689
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
turned into one of the longest episodes of the podcast.

690
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Is that true, really?

691
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's how we do.

692
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah, normally these are under 30 minutes.

693
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh, that's cool.

694
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
There you go.

695
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So, there you go.

696
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Enjoy your various pills of wokeness and sleepiness.

697
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And specifically that like, you know,

698
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
that shack like asleep and then woke with like the glowing

699
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
eyes.

700
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah, that's the one.

701
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
All right, I've had to piss for 25 minutes.

702
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Okay, sounds good, my dude.

703
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We'll see you guys next week with a new episode.

704
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Bye-bye.
