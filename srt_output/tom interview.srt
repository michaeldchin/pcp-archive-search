1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's time for another PCP interview! It's been God knows how long since the last one, I don't remember.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Like a year and a half at least, right?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, they were all done relatively within a reasonable time frame of each other, and they're not ever again.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And then I think Nate and Mumkey had one, but now it's your turn.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And you're fucking who are you, motherfucker?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm Tom Oliver, and I do 3D stuff mostly now.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Tommy Oliver Says.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
On Twitter.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Tommy Oliver Blogs.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
On The Tumblr.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Tommy Oliver, what's your Instagram?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's PaulieState2.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And then YouTube is Tommy Oliver Says.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
C slash Tommy Oliver Says.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Anything happening on Facebook?

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Not yet, but I'm definitely gonna move there eventually.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I consider you sort of like, the reason that I think you're like a very underappreciated valuable asset to the PCP in a backroom sense that maybe even viewers wouldn't appreciate is that you know social media,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
like you know what's big, you know what's hot, you know tech, why? Why don't you know all this shit?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm just really interested in it. I've just been interested in technology for my entire life.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Like being a little kid when I was like, I got a Game Boy for the first time and like, can I make this do anything else besides play games?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Like I was just really fascinated.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Like I'm like, I'm super addicted to cell phones, but I wanted a cell phone before cell phones existed.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Like I was the kid in like seventh grade who had no like actual life, but got a PDA.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Just thought it was cool to have a computer in my pocket.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So everyone else, like everyone else was listening to iPods and stuff and I got a PDA and like got an SD card and put music on that,

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but also like could play little video games and could do like things.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And I was like, super interested in like the Dell Pocket PCs.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They had like the little Wi-Fi dongle you could plug in and shit.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is so cool.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Did you actually use your PDA to do like playing, like planner shit?

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Like did you actually keep schedule on it?

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I mean, I didn't have a schedule, but if I did, I would have put it in there.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Cause I, I never went for anything like that cause I am so bad at like,

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I love writing in a planner, but I never look back at it.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You know what I mean?

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Like I love writing a list of what I'm going to do today and then I never look at it.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
When I do it though, it's super effective.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh my God, it can be.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you fucking, like if you have scheduled time for videos and stuff and you can like pre-produce them ahead of time, that's like a huge boost.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My big thing, my hardest thing with production is that I can't start.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
As soon as I start, I get in the rhythm and I'm fine.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But I will like sit for like four hours and be like, should I do something?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh yeah, that's the hardest.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I mean, once you're in it, the only thing that's going to push you out is if like,

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you feel like this particular section is really soulless and you wish it wasn't even in your video, you know?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Like when you have those moments where you listen to a sentence and you're like,

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
there is no way to make this creative and fun to watch that I am capable of.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So I guess it's just going to be 30 seconds of footage from whatever show is relevant.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And that's when you want to get up and take a break and go outside and, you know.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Not exist anymore.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Exactly.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's me for the entire editing process start to finish.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Because as soon as I get to that point, like I've been doing the Y3D anime fail series.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I did the first two.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's been written out since, I want to say maybe August of last year.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have like this huge document.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You read it.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You read the whole thing pretty much.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I sent it to you like a year ago.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Which document?

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The Y3D anime fails like for each.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That long ago?

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It was a long time ago.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh fuck.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I didn't feel like that long ago.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And it just sits there because I don't want to edit it.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That video series.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What, how hopeful were you that that was going to be like a huge hit?

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That one in particular, I didn't think was going to be huge.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I thought it was going to do way better than it did.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, I thought so too.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And I think that the only reason it didn't was like just, just didn't get spread around

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
enough.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And I honestly like, I kind of wished you had just made it one big video.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I mean, it probably just never would have gotten done if that had been the case.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, I'd still be working on it.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But like.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Originally it was going to just be one big video.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,760
But I think the issue is that like because it's in smaller parts, people were like interested

86
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,000
but wanted to know more and then it took a long time before they learned anymore.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Here's the thing.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I think there's three things.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The first thing is that my channel is dead.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So like we just talked about how like only.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You should discuss that.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,560
So explain this to me because this is something that, you know, YouTubers are always trying

93
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,320
to keep track of the algorithmic changes, Matt Petz, the only person who seems to completely

94
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,560
understand it, but he does not reveal all the whole consulting business around it.

95
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
So right.

96
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,520
So he's not going to just spill everything.

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,200
There's a lot of things we all know and that we all copy, but there's a lot of things we

98
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,600
don't know that we have to theorize about like my theory that my turntable channel won't

99
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,280
get promoted to music channels because it's only watched by my fans.

100
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,040
So like you told me about this part of the algorithm none of us knew about and it's apparently

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,400
happening to your channel.

102
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,040
I think it's happening to everybody's channel.

103
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,120
It's just like there's a lot of people complaining like no one's seeing my video or whatever.

104
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,080
And I found out, watching some videos, I've been doing a lot of research on Instagram because

105
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,840
I mean, I'm trying to use Instagram a lot now because I just like the platform.

106
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,080
I think it suits my current work pretty well.

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,480
But they have every, everything now has a set algorithm and how it kind of like filters

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
content and stuff.

109
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,040
And they were talking about how on Instagram, the algorithm on Instagram is that the most

110
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,720
crucial window for your content on Instagram is the first hour.

111
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,120
So depending on how well your content performs, how many likes it gets, how many comments

112
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,240
it gets in the first 60 minutes is how it ranks for the rest of time.

113
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,720
Cause most people when they open Instagram, just look at the first few things and then

114
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
check off.

115
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,600
So like if you, if you get a bunch of like traffic on your posts in the first 60 minutes,

116
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,240
it goes to the explore page and then it also can get ranked in the hashtags.

117
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:24,840
So like every hashtag on Instagram, it has the top nine posts for the day in the hashtag.

118
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,360
So if you do really well, you can get pushed to there and then everybody sees it.

119
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,680
And there's constant chances, not unlike Reddit, but unlike Reddit, it's, it is self-promotion

120
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,840
and not you having to like weirdly, circuitously only promote other people's content.

121
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,800
Another really interesting thing about Instagram is that the, uh, how big the account is that

122
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,680
likes your photo affects your photo as well.

123
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,680
So if you have like 500,000 followers and you like a photo at boost it, because what

124
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,760
it does is that, um, there's also the explore page.

125
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,920
So like if, um, it's kind of like the search function in Instagram, but before you search

126
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,000
for anything, it just shows you a bunch of content, it thinks you'll be interested in.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,940
And that's based on who you follow.

128
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,740
So if you're an account that has 500,000 followers and you like my posts and I have

129
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,580
like 500, right, like a portion of your 500,000 followers will see the posts you liked in their

130
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,580
explore page.

131
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
Oh shit.

132
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,500
Is that how the, that's how Twitter works too with the likes then, right?

133
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
I think it's similar to that.

134
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,820
I think it has to do, I think on Twitter, it has to do with how many interactions you've

135
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,220
had with the person.

136
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,940
Like if you interact with them a lot, it shows you more of their likes or something or, or

137
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,140
if I don't know if like, I don't know what the fuck the logic is.

138
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,820
I haven't, I haven't looked into Twitter's algorithm all that much.

139
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,540
The only reason I don't even know about this YouTube thing is cause I, they mentioned it

140
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,500
in these Instagram videos, but for YouTube, it's not the first 60 minutes.

141
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,260
It's the first 24 hours and the first 24 hours only sends it out to 10% if you're following.

142
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,780
And depending on how well it does with that 10%, it'll either keep sending out to the

143
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,460
rest of your audience or drop it off completely and no one else will see it.

144
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,620
Clarify what does it mean your audience?

145
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,180
So your subscribers, so like it's, it's public and anybody who like searches for terms and

146
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,060
stuff can still see it, but it, you know how like cause, but will it be different?

147
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,420
Okay.

148
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:14,500
So I get the sense that, okay, I've never like not seen a video in my feed with the

149
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,380
exception of for some reason, exclusively super bunny hops channel.

150
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,620
And only this year, like will not give me every video he does, but everyone else always

151
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,460
has, but I think the reason is I only watch my subscriptions.

152
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,380
Like I consistently have for years only watched my subscriptions.

153
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,820
And even when I leave my subscriptions tab, most of what it recommends me is shit from

154
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,980
channels I'm subscribed to.

155
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,460
So I think maybe it just shows me, you're probably just cause you're a highly active

156
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,220
subscriber on all the channels you follow.

157
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,500
So it makes you're going to watch them.

158
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:52,260
And like the only times I ever, like for a very long time, I've had people who will show

159
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,660
up to my video and be like, huh, somehow missed this, didn't show up in my feed.

160
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,580
But like it would be only a couple of comments.

161
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,980
And like most people seem to see it and all the people who are regular subscribers

162
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,940
see it, but like the people in my discord, for instance, they are literally racing to

163
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,900
see who can publish my video in the discord first after it comes out.

164
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,140
So YouTube obviously is just going to recommend them everything in their feed.

165
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,780
But like, I think if you have an account that's not like that, maybe there's more of

166
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,940
a chance that it's, it's, you know, I mean, they keep it all close to the chest, obviously.

167
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,340
Right.

168
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,020
Cause someone like Nate, Nate doesn't even watch subscriptions.

169
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,340
Like he doesn't subscribe to channels.

170
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,140
He just goes to them occasionally when he wants to watch their videos.

171
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,500
Weird.

172
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,340
Yeah.

173
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,300
Why does he do that?

174
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,500
He just doesn't like use YouTube.

175
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,180
Like he doesn't like go there and, and go to the subscriptions tab and see what the

176
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,140
new videos are.

177
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,540
Like most people do, he'll go to trending and do that, or he'll go to like the

178
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,620
homepage and just like watch some recommended stuff.

179
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,980
But he mostly just, but I hate that I do it.

180
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,660
I hate, it just never recommends me anything I want to watch.

181
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,900
So I've, people have told me that if you do enough of the, like, I don't want to see

182
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,980
this button, it will eventually start to recommend you better stuff.

183
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,060
Cause like it takes enough out of your pool of what it thinks you want.

184
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,580
And, uh, but I'm scared that if I do that for some of the channels I'm subscribed

185
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,460
to, it'll just stop showing me that stuff in my subscription box.

186
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,940
So it's, it's a total clusterfuck.

187
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,340
Yeah.

188
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,700
I think that's one of the reasons that the videos didn't do well is because of the

189
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,780
10% thing and my entire channel is just dead.

190
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,300
And because not that 10% not enough of them are anime fans that they were going to.

191
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,260
So they're not going to click on it.

192
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,700
So it's not going to get seen by anything else.

193
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,940
Cause a lot of times, um, cause the first, I ran a Twitter poll trying to figure

194
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,220
out what the fuck's up with it.

195
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,580
So the first poll I ran was, have, do you know that I've been posting regularly

196
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,540
for the past 60, like, uh, like six months, 60% said no.

197
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,780
And Twitter is where I post on the daily.

198
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,900
So that's my most active people who know what I'm doing.

199
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,300
60% of them didn't even know I had uploaded.

200
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,780
Dude, I don't know if Twitter shows people all those YouTube links.

201
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,340
Cause like I've noticed that if I have a video,

202
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,300
why, why, because Twitter has an algorithm now too, like if you don't

203
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,660
turn it off, it does show best first instead of a chronological feed.

204
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,140
Yeah.

205
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,700
So it's the same exact thing.

206
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,460
I've, I've noticed that like my videos, cause I have all my channel set to just

207
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,700
auto tweet the videos and they come out cause I make videos fucking constantly

208
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,140
and I want to fucking just have them do that.

209
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,540
But, um, I've noticed that those never get very many likes or retweets unless

210
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,980
like there's a freak incident where someone retweeted it, maybe a few people will.

211
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,820
But if I like write out a tweet and put a link afterwards to the video, way

212
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,900
bigger chance that people are actually going to interact with it.

213
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,100
It's probably because Twitter, Twitter, I know Twitter actively doesn't like you

214
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,660
going to other platforms, especially Instagram.

215
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,620
I honestly think they're completely right to do that.

216
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,580
Cause there's lots of people on Twitter who the only reason I don't follow them

217
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,220
is too much shit is linked to their Twitter.

218
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,780
Like back in the day when everyone's Tumblr was linked to their Twitter and

219
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,900
you'd follow somebody and it would just be links to their Tumblr and I would

220
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
unfollow those people.

221
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,420
I know, I still follow some people who do that and it drives me insane.

222
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,220
The worst thing is like Tumblr has an image preview and you don't realize

223
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,860
it's Tumblr, so you just click, I want to see this picture and then it loads up

224
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,420
a page and I instantly back up because I don't want to wait the fucking

225
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,460
10 years for this to load.

226
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,180
Yeah, but like they, I know Twitter actively hates Instagram because it

227
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,140
doesn't, if you have an Instagram link, it doesn't show an image preview at all

228
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,460
because they don't want you going there.

229
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,220
So you have to like manually do all that shit.

230
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,220
But I know videos do really well on Twitter.

231
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,060
If like you post a preview of the video because Twitter is, everyone's

232
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,380
on the video kick right now.

233
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,700
So they want more video views on their platform.

234
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,180
So if you make, if you take like a 30 second clip of your, your video and then

235
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,100
you subtitle it.

236
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,540
So even if no one is, cause it's going to start auto-playing, but it's not

237
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,340
going to have any sound.

238
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,180
So if you can have subtitles that go with it so they can see what they're doing.

239
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:47,820
Yeah.

240
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,220
And then you have the link to YouTube to watch the rest of it.

241
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,300
That performs the best, but that takes, you know, fucking effort.

242
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,940
It takes a long time to make all those, but it, I mean, that's how the fucking,

243
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,060
that's how the Facebookers took over.

244
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,540
I mean, I know that for something, if I get back into video hardcore, I'm

245
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,100
going to do that.

246
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,060
You can just go on Fiverr and like five bucks, just like do it.

247
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,260
Well, like pay people to do it for you or something.

248
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,100
I've been, I've been looking on Fiverr a lot.

249
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,100
I have, so I've have someone right now on Fiverr actually like managing my

250
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,820
Instagram, it's not working very well.

251
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,500
But, but just, I'm just experimenting with shit.

252
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500
How do you like, can you set up like recurring payments on Fiverr or are

253
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,380
you just paying him every time he does, whenever he does?

254
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,620
I paid him, it was, it was for, it was a 15 bucks for a seven day gig.

255
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,220
And he was like only five.

256
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,540
It starts at five, but it can go up to like hundreds of thousands of dollars

257
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,820
depending what the services are.

258
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,900
But, um, yeah, it's, it's, I originally went in there because I wanted

259
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,780
someone to edit my videos, but nobody offers video edits, like what I

260
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,740
would need done, like actually like, you know, you're not going to go on

261
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,260
there and find someone fucking Bangladesh and be like, can you like edit

262
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,820
in some footage from Hoseki, you know, Cooney, relevant in the narration,

263
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,500
talking about things like, what do you've, what?

264
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,620
No, you know, it's just, it's not going to happen.

265
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,460
So, oh, I think I might move this table forward and bring a couple of chairs

266
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,540
over here because this is uncomfortable as fuck.

267
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,820
What did you, what did you back like breaking up?

268
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,540
Yeah, but I, I hunch all the time.

269
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,700
So this is kind of like normal, like dealing with this pain.

270
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,300
So I'm kind of, I sit in like a fucking expensive office chair all day.

271
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,900
Well, well fuck you and your money.

272
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,140
Okay.

273
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,300
I can kind of deal with this.

274
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,740
We should, I can sit up.

275
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,500
It's fucking, this is real painful.

276
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,860
I'm going to get those chairs anyway.

277
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:36,620
You should talk about, um, tell me about your background in, uh, okay.

278
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,540
I'm just going to skip to what I'm interested in and hopefully the

279
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,620
audience will care too.

280
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,060
That's fine.

281
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,100
I want to know what everything about M dot strange.

282
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,540
Okay.

283
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,860
Cause this guy was like a huge influence on massive.

284
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,180
Yeah.

285
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,580
And especially now that you're doing 3D work, I think it's going to be

286
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,940
something that maybe is more important to talk about than it was before for you.

287
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,980
So, um, first of all, who the fuck is M dot strange?

288
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,940
Try to get these chairs.

289
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,180
Sure.

290
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:04,460
So M dot strange is a, uh, he's a YouTuber from like way back in the early days,

291
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,780
but he's been creating content for fucking ever.

292
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,500
Like he, he, you dig deep into his stuff.

293
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,260
He talks about like making short films and to edit them.

294
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,860
He busts out two VCRs and like cuts from one back to the other back and forth.

295
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,420
Like that's before that shit existed.

296
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,260
Like he got an iMac and like flipped his shit.

297
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,580
Cause now he can do digital editing.

298
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,620
So, so this was, he's been making shit forever out of fucking way.

299
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,420
But yeah, he's a, uh, he's now, he's a, he's doing game design, but when I got

300
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,380
into him back in 2006, he was, I was wondering what the hell he was actually doing.

301
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,060
Yeah.

302
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,660
He's, um, I kind of like him less now just because like everybody does game design.

303
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,740
Nobody makes fucking movies by themselves.

304
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,300
So like, I feel like it's like less cool, but whatever.

305
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,060
It's, it's still good.

306
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:58,140
Um, I found him in 2006 because this was back when, uh, when YouTube wasn't a

307
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,700
total clusterfuck and like the featured page actually had cool shit on it.

308
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,220
Yeah.

309
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,060
Do you remember when they had like the featured videos like on the front page?

310
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,580
Oh dude.

311
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:11,620
I mean, back in the early days, like YouTube was like Freddie W and Epic

312
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,700
Meal Time and like channels you watched cause they were hilarious and cool and

313
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,820
we're doing something like of a caliber that stuff that was like made sense to

314
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,500
be on YouTube, but was a caliber above what you expected from YouTube.

315
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,260
You know, like Freddie W's like call of duty in real life videos.

316
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,220
It's like, you can't make this with a professional film studio because like

317
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,260
it's fucking copyright infringement.

318
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,700
And like, and it's for gamers, a very niche audience who's mostly on YouTube,

319
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,300
you know, but like it made sense there and he did it so much better than what

320
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,020
you expect that it was like, whoa.

321
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,660
Yeah, that's crazy.

322
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,460
And M.Dot Strange, I'm assuming was part of that sort of era because his stuff

323
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,220
is unbelievably impressive.

324
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,100
So like the whole idea was because what M.Dot was at the time and why I got

325
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,980
into him is he's a 3D filmmaker and he does independent 3D animated films.

326
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,420
He did a trilogy of them in like under 10 years.

327
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,500
Probably how long are they there?

328
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,540
An hour and a half, two hours fucking crazy.

329
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:11,860
Yeah.

330
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,180
And so they're full 3D and he does all of them by himself.

331
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,260
Like he has voice actors and his second film.

332
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,060
He had someone do the music for him.

333
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,500
But other than that, everything they look like if Tim Burton did reboot.

334
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,740
Yeah, like it's a good way of describing it.

335
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,020
They're fucking crazy out there visually just all over the place.

336
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,300
The first film was actually, he didn't know enough about 3D to do a straight

337
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,940
up 3D film, so it's mixed media.

338
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,060
So there's stop motion, puppetry, 3D, 2D.

339
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,180
There's a bunch of clashing medias.

340
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,500
They just kind of like stitched together in laughter effects.

341
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,420
Kind of better comparison.

342
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,900
It looks a little bit like a 3D version of the Madoka Magica witch sequences.

343
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,940
Yeah, especially we are the strange is very, very much like that.

344
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,860
But this was like years before that.

345
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,500
It's still but yeah, he'd been making films like live action and like music and

346
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,500
stuff for, for, for, I think like the better part of two decades, even before

347
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,140
that even hit because he was like in his thirties when that started happening.

348
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,180
That's crazy.

349
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,100
And I love, I love hearing about people who didn't make it till their thirties.

350
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,660
Yeah, I know.

351
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,340
I still have hope.

352
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,980
Yeah.

353
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,900
So, so like, but like he went through a bunch of crazy shit and like he had

354
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,700
like a really messed up, fucked up childhood and like question to believe

355
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,180
because I've read like his books and stuff, like maybe like sexual molestation

356
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,660
and like crazy shit happened back in the day.

357
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,660
But he was doing like live action stuff and he would like dress up as like a robot

358
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,700
and go out and send Jose and like just do chip tunes on the side of walk.

359
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,220
Like as a guy named agent a two zero three is to look up that stuff

360
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,340
and like and just like had like a band just doing like this crazy stuff.

361
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,660
And then he would just like put out stuff on Craigslist.

362
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,380
Like we're shooting a movie this weekend.

363
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,940
You want to be in it?

364
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,140
Come show up and people would come just just make videos with random people.

365
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,100
And he like always had like this one homeless lady that he became friends

366
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,340
with in all of his videos and she was like kind of crazy.

367
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,340
Like he did this whole thing called the potato phone experiment with her.

368
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,260
He just carved the word phone into a potato and like put her in a public place

369
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,420
and just pretend you're on the phone and like make a scene and you record it.

370
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,820
So she's like going to like restaurants just talking to a potato.

371
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
That's fucking hilarious.

372
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,460
It's amazing.

373
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,820
The guy's a fucking genius.

374
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,340
But then he did like these three feature films all by himself.

375
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,980
And I was glued to his production diaries because he just like was cranking it out.

376
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,580
And he just like, yeah, I bought like five computers.

377
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,980
Is he rich or like no money come from like he just like he's just like got

378
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,380
like the he just saved up like five grand and just like doing what I think.

379
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,340
And when at that point, I think he was doing like wedding photography

380
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,500
or something like that or like making wedding videos.

381
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,860
So he had like professional cameras and you know, I don't know

382
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,740
because he doesn't talk at all about that side of his life at all.

383
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,940
Like multiple times when he's done like Q&A things, I've asked like, how do you live?

384
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,260
That's what I'm interested in.

385
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,900
And he always never, never, never says anything.

386
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,180
I think that's the hugest difference between like the way millennial artists

387
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,460
are willing to talk about themselves and like the previous generation.

388
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,900
Because like people like just above our age don't like to talk about how much

389
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,460
they make at all.

390
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,380
They don't like to talk about like, you know, who their influences are.

391
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,140
Like because they want to like people used to say, oh, I try not to have influences.

392
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,020
I want to be original.

393
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,260
And now everyone's just like, no, my influences are why I make any money.

394
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,260
You know, like nobody would have played fucking undertale if you didn't tell

395
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,660
people like, oh, it's like Earthbound.

396
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,980
But you know, it's good.

397
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,300
It's good for my birthbound and Homestuck combined.

398
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,460
Yeah, it's good stuff.

399
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,940
So well, I guess Homestuck is already Earthbound.

400
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,660
But whatever point point being like that.

401
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,420
Yeah, it's it's it's it's just like a difference in perspective.

402
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,140
And like for our generation, we grew up with YouTubers who will like

403
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,860
tell us everything about like ever since Game Grumps, you know, I feel like

404
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,940
it's been passe for YouTubers to talk about like, yeah, we make a career out of this.

405
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,540
And like, here's how good of a living we can have.

406
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,220
And here we went to Disney World today on the back of the fucking Game Grumps.

407
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,140
One episode of Game Grumps, you know, it's fucking crazy.

408
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,100
But but yeah, I mean, the guy, the guys, he's like open.

409
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,020
But like for some reason is just like how he makes money.

410
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,980
I almost feel like it's probably because like he doesn't want to admit

411
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,420
that like this doesn't make him a fucking ton of money almost,

412
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,540
even though it's painfully obvious.

413
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,580
I mean, why would it?

414
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,100
Like, I think the most like it's weird.

415
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,220
The most disturbing aspect of my entire life creatively was like when I was

416
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,260
like knee deep in like the pony stuff and I went to check on EmDot and I

417
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,020
realized I had more subs in him.

418
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,420
I like almost killed myself.

419
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,100
I was like, this is not like the world is fucked and we're never going to recover.

420
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,980
That was how I felt when I fucking passed any of the artists I liked.

421
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,700
Like I remember passing like the band Clipping.

422
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,300
I remember passing I passed like Chance the rapper in his early days.

423
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,220
Now he's huge.

424
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,060
But like, like, I mean, not even early days, like when acid rapid come out,

425
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,700
he was blowing up, but I blew up a little faster on YouTube at least.

426
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,620
Obviously not in like album sales or anything.

427
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,980
But yeah, I was passing a bunch of my favorite artists and I was like really

428
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,660
upset about it because I was like, these people are way better than me.

429
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,860
Like even at the time when I was making the pony content, I did not consider it

430
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,100
like great art.

431
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,220
You know, I was just like, this is just something I do because people are

432
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,420
willing to pay me for something I want to do.

433
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,500
Yeah, it was just a fun little distraction.

434
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,580
But it had turned into something.

435
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:23,900
Yeah.

436
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,740
And like it when it became like, OK, this is just a job now.

437
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,300
That was when it was like, we need to consider ending this, you know, regardless

438
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,700
of what it means for our careers, which I mean, God, could we still we could still

439
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,900
be making money if we were still pony people.

440
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,380
We could probably be making more.

441
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,500
I don't know because there's less people.

442
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,500
There's less people to go around.

443
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,620
Like you don't understand.

444
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,340
Like there is still a core fervent amount of people knee deep in that.

445
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,860
Like my buddy Matt, it's crazy.

446
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,580
He still does like art, like porn art for that.

447
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,540
And his YCH is like go for it.

448
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,900
Oh, you mean a deep pony?

449
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,380
Yeah, like three hundred fifty dollars for like a YCH.

450
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,860
And it's just like, oh, my God.

451
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,500
I mean, that's why a lot of those people are in there is they can't leave.

452
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,820
It's too lucrative.

453
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,940
Like it took my friend Fern a long time to like focus.

454
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,740
Like Fern had burned out on the show even before I did, but was still like in the

455
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,700
community because like when she posted original songs, they just wouldn't get

456
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,740
listened to, you know, like if it wasn't a poor song, no one gave a fuck.

457
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,540
That's the whole thing.

458
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,420
That community was like lucrative, but also insanely insular.

459
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,020
Oh, yeah.

460
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,660
Like they don't they literally don't care about anything else.

461
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,300
Like I would try to make videos when I, you know, first started making anime videos.

462
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,420
I was still making pony and I did like probably 10 anime videos and they all

463
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,740
had like barely any views compared to the pony shit.

464
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,100
Music videos, nothing, you know.

465
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,220
So they you you got to you literally have to sell your soul.

466
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,220
Like if you're still in pony, I'm sorry that you've had to lose that part of your soul.

467
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,620
Well, I mean, there are people who still genuinely love it.

468
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,060
Like I know some people who do.

469
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,260
Sure, I mean, more power to you, I guess.

470
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:09,020
Like I have no, no, I can't mock you for it because I was there for like three years.

471
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:14,820
Yeah, if you're still, I mean, if you like, I think it was hilarious when

472
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,460
Jesse and hippo started up the whore, the horsey whore.

473
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,500
What the fuck is the horse?

474
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,220
Because the pony cast, the pony cast, the pony cast was hilarious

475
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,500
because they just kind of like, like, hey, we got a new thing.

476
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
And it's just a podcast and it's got a Patreon.

477
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,220
They still make like a hundred dollars or two hundred dollars a month off of it or something.

478
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,100
And I was like, how is this possible?

479
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:40,420
Like back then we, we thought there was a minimum level of quality control

480
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,620
that we had to do in order for anyone to care.

481
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
And it turns out we were wrong.

482
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,860
We just needed to talk about my little pony.

483
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,340
It was, you know, I mean, not to knock that Jesse and Gibbon can do

484
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,380
an entertaining podcast deserving of money, but just the fact that like

485
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,780
they couldn't have made that much talking about anything else.

486
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,660
You know, it's insane.

487
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,540
It's funny because there was, it was like a couple of months

488
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,020
where I was talking with Matt D.V. again about starting after I had like

489
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,700
ended the last channel and I was like, wanted to make easy money.

490
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,820
I was like, what if I just made a whole new channel and uppitched my voice

491
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,220
and just talked about the new scene.

492
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,740
Dude, I've considered, oh, well, that wouldn't do with ponies,

493
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,980
but I've considered doing that plan like for other things.

494
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
Yeah.

495
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,060
Just like come back as a different guy.

496
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,140
My plan was like to uppitch my voice enough to make it sound like it was a woman

497
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,380
to like double down on like getting more money.

498
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,540
Oh, boy, that's fucked.

499
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
And then I would have.

500
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
You could do that.

501
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,540
I could still could.

502
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:36,740
Yeah.

503
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,980
It'd have been, it'd be very easy, but no.

504
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,620
I can't do it.

505
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,060
Sainter Minds prevailed.

506
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,220
The only reason I can't do stuff like that.

507
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,820
I one time wanted to make a manga review channel that was going to be

508
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,140
me, which a pitch foot with a pitch shifted voice.

509
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,780
And the reason is back when I was doing anime blogging, I had gotten so known

510
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,620
for like this particular style of like really abrasive and like incendiary

511
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,260
dialogue that I wanted to like reset my identity and have people like,

512
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,420
because I had made like several other blogs, but I just wanted people to not

513
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,940
know it was me and make like a polite character.

514
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,540
So my manga blog was like very polite and serious and like no one knew it was

515
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,100
me at all, but also it had very few readers.

516
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,940
But like, I would want to do that.

517
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,820
The funny thing is if I had done this pony channel, the exact opposite would

518
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,180
have happened.

519
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,300
I have no doubt that because the plan was, was insidious and genius.

520
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,980
It would have been girl, a pitch, the voice.

521
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,500
So no one would know me girl would have been very agreeable.

522
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
And that's what everybody wants.

523
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
They want you to suck the dick, the show's dick.

524
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,700
And then the piece de resistance would have been, never can show my face

525
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,060
because I was sexually abused and I don't want anyone to know who I am.

526
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,220
So you would have just fucking crushed on SJW money.

527
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,420
It would have been so good.

528
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,780
Oh, if you ever got found, oh, shit, the camera stopped.

529
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,420
No one can know my crime.

530
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,700
These are, thankfully, when you have a microphone and it keeps cutting,

531
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,180
it's real easy to sync back up.

532
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,700
That's true.

533
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,020
Yeah.

534
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,300
So well, obviously neither of us went through with those plans.

535
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,820
In my case, I realized that the cadence of my voice is too recognizable.

536
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,900
Like if I read off of a script, I always read it the same way.

537
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,020
And like no amount of voice morphing can make it like, not obviously me.

538
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,540
It's real sad, but you might have better odds because your cadence is not as

539
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,100
recognized.

540
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,220
Another thing I could have just done is paid $5 to some girl read it on fire.

541
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,260
That you could have done.

542
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,540
Yeah.

543
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,580
So, you know, but that would be a total evil scheme.

544
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,860
And the best part is you could get away with it and just never tell anyone.

545
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,660
Like you don't even have to tell us you could have actually done this.

546
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,740
Maybe I'm doing it right now.

547
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,140
Who knows?

548
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,660
Yeah, I said that he wouldn't be quite as like, you probably wouldn't be

549
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,900
begging for money on page.

550
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,780
I just keep the character gone.

551
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,100
It's fine.

552
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,260
So, all right, you were talking about M dot strange.

553
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,420
Yeah, you actually, you actually worked with them before, right?

554
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,340
I have worked with them a little bit a couple of times.

555
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,300
The first thing I mean, I didn't really work with them on this, but like

556
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,740
since I was glued to the production diaries on We Are The Strange,

557
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,620
she was like, all right, I'm going to need a bunch of extras.

558
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,900
So like send me your photo and I'll like fuck it up and like make you look

559
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,220
like a psychopath and you'll be in like a shot in this church scene.

560
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,740
So I was like, OK, and I'm in the church scene at the in the middle of the movie.

561
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,260
OK, yeah, that's the people find you.

562
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,900
Like if yeah, yeah, it's it's it's like it's a quick thing in a church

563
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,700
scene, but it's more like it's also in the end credits and it's pretty obvious.

564
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,700
So that that's I guess it's kind of scour the end credits for Tom Oliver

565
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,500
and We Are The Strange.

566
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,140
Before podcasting and like like like live streaming and stuff became a thing.

567
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,820
He did live streaming on something called blog talk radio.

568
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,980
Have you ever heard of that?

569
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,460
I've heard the name, but I don't know what it was.

570
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,380
What it was was that instead of like just talking live,

571
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,940
you would you would do a live stream on the Internet.

572
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,020
But instead of like having people call in.

573
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,140
Yeah, my phone's going off.

574
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,060
Someone's trying to fucking call me.

575
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,060
I'm trying to ignore it.

576
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,500
Oh, it's not a spam call.

577
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,420
I made the mistake.

578
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,860
I bought polystation2.com and I didn't get the domain protection.

579
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:08,460
So every day I get thousands of spam calls and like tons of what the fuck things

580
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,100
in my inbox saying, do you need web service?

581
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,020
I'm like, bitch, I make websites.

582
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,060
Don't don't don't get out of here.

583
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,020
But that's something I'm going to ask you about a bit.

584
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,220
But yeah, so what was I even saying?

585
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,860
Wasn't there something you worked on him with the head to do with mindless

586
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,620
self-indulgence? Yes, I did.

587
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,740
I did all the lip syncing for the characters in one of those

588
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,340
minus self-indulgence videos he did because he did videos for

589
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,340
minus self-indulgence and rabbit junk.

590
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,140
What songs?

591
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:39,580
Because I've never seen only one I've ever seen animal from that's from if, right?

592
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,620
I think so.

593
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,740
I don't even remember which fucking song that is.

594
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,860
It's an animal, it's an animal, it's an animal, I'm believable.

595
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,980
OK, that sounds familiar.

596
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,300
That might be from the, oh, you know what?

597
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,140
It's probably from the three heart album or the heart maybe the heart shape one.

598
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,940
I remember I did this during college.

599
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,900
So when I should have been doing homework, that's probably the album

600
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,380
that would have been coming out at the time.

601
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,180
Like 2010 ish 2008, 2009 ish problem.

602
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,620
OK, that's yeah, it's either from if or less than three.

603
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,900
I think it's if because less than three was like the short EP that came right

604
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,300
after that and I wouldn't recognize the songs as well on that.

605
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:24,700
In any case, so how do you do you think that like his style has influenced yours

606
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,100
at all because yours doesn't really look like his.

607
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Your style is more like comic book.

608
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,540
Yeah, I wouldn't say he influenced my style in terms of like his artwork.

609
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,180
Like I think I'm more interested as much as I love his movies.

610
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,780
I'm much more interested in him as a person and his work ethic.

611
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,780
Yeah.

612
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,620
Because I just what I really liked about him back in the day and to this day

613
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,460
is that he's like not afraid to like say things that are like fucking insane

614
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,380
and like just like raw.

615
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,460
Like he'll talk about like how much he hates like Hollywood

616
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,980
and how much he hates like all this like shit because he just like is uncompromising

617
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,660
and like because he could do like actual things that worked.

618
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,380
But he just doesn't give a fuck.

619
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,580
He's like he could be like he could be working on like Coraline or something.

620
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,060
Yeah, easily like here's the thing.

621
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,900
Like, you know, he for somehow through like some like fucking

622
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,020
I think it's just because it was unprecedented.

623
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,940
Like he submitted We Are the Strange to the Sundance Film Festival

624
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,180
and got accepted. Right.

625
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,220
So the movie showed there and he he while he was there,

626
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,940
like this is like him.

627
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,740
He's still like not didn't know much about Hollywood and everything

628
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,900
hated the entire experience because they like that he got an agent from there

629
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,820
and they're like, well, we need to buy out the theater.

630
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,260
So we need to like have all the theater when we play has to be full of plants.

631
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,740
So everybody loves the movie.

632
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,700
They react crazily over the top so they can they get people to buy it.

633
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,500
And he was like, get fucked.

634
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,940
So instead, he just like went on Twitter and was like, hey,

635
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,060
you want to come see the movie?

636
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,260
Why would they think a guy like that would be they didn't?

637
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,820
They had no idea who they were dealing with.

638
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,180
Like did they watch the movie?

639
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,900
Yeah. So what happened instead is that like they're just like normal

640
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,620
people from the film vessel came in and then he had an army of people

641
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,460
from Twitter who came in like my buddy, my buddy,

642
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,620
Ed went up there and like shit and went and see it.

643
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,940
And like so everyone who was just there from the theater got up and left

644
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,900
because they were disgusted by the movie.

645
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,620
Everyone who brought there like fucking lost their shit.

646
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,140
And so but the regardless, he got like, I think like 10 or 15 deals

647
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,100
on the movie and turned them all down.

648
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,260
So like there was like big money on the table and you just like get fucked

649
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,620
and just publish it himself instead.

650
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,500
Didn't want to go through any more bullshit.

651
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,860
Yeah, because he's just like he looked through the contracts like, OK,

652
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,500
like I don't own my movie anymore.

653
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,460
Like fuck you.

654
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,020
Yeah, you know, at this point, I'm sure he's probably made more

655
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,060
on Blu-ray and DVD sales don't need to do that in today's world.

656
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,980
Yeah, but this is like 2007 and he's like, you know, like had the foresight

657
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,660
just like fuck that curve for sure.

658
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,700
Yeah, he's like published like books like.

659
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,380
But that's the thing.

660
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,500
I think though a lot of I think a lot of the

661
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,140
God, I'm about to sound real fucking old and I'm accusing myself of this too.

662
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,300
But I think a lot of our generation of like content creators

663
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,020
are spoiled because we knew it was possible.

664
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,380
Like a lot of the people before us were like hoping it was possible

665
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,740
or like had the like thought like, hmm, well, you know,

666
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,980
you guys might not want to buy my movie, but I see the Internet over there

667
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,500
and I'll bet if I release it there, people might like it.

668
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,420
But like we know that we know it's possible as a result.

669
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,820
I think that's why a lot more people now are like just doing like YouTube

670
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,300
du jour instead of their unique ideas.

671
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,660
The generation before us and, you know, it wasn't possible for them.

672
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,980
So I understand the confusion.

673
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,300
But like the thing that really worked for MDOT for me is that he made

674
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,860
me realize that I wanted to be my own boss.

675
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,940
Because before that, like my plan was like my big influence

676
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,780
before that was a Joan Vasquez.

677
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,100
And so I was like, oh, I'll just like make a really cool comic.

678
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,660
It's very closely related to MSI.

679
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,220
Have you ever been into MSI or do you just happen to like?

680
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,980
I just I just happen.

681
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,220
I mean, I've listened to a bit of mindless self-indulgence,

682
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,580
but it's like it's good, but not like I'm a huge fan.

683
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,900
Yeah, so like it's weird how like it just worked like that

684
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,220
because I watched his video.

685
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,220
He did too.

686
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,660
Yeah, I was like, this is fucking dope, but it wasn't animated.

687
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,460
And I was very disappointed because I wanted to be a fun video and super cool.

688
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,340
But yeah, like so my plan before that was like, I'm going to publish

689
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,860
with SLG or something like that, because I was listening to a podcast

690
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,620
called Indie Spinner Rack all throughout high school and just these two guys

691
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,500
who just like knew everything about the indie comic scene.

692
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,780
And I ended up going to the Mocha Art Festival in New York and like met a bunch

693
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,900
of people and like was like shopping to recommend me that podcast.

694
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,860
Is it like, is it good to get into if you don't know anything about indie comics?

695
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,980
I knew nothing about indie comics going into it.

696
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,420
They they name drop a lot and don't provide a lot of context,

697
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
but they give you things to Google.

698
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,340
The podcast is long defunct.

699
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,100
Like it ended like five years ago, but all the information on it's still pretty good.

700
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,860
Yeah, they recommend a lot like like artists.

701
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,460
They recommend are like people like indie.

702
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,420
Yeah, because they're older.

703
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,780
So it's like indie to them is like not like web comics.

704
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,420
It's like the Xerox books and like ship them out.

705
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,700
The hardest thing about getting into like indie comics is just that nobody talks about them.

706
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,780
Yeah, these guys did a really good job.

707
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,740
And I just like started like learning like the names of the presses and like people.

708
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,180
And I was like, I bought a bunch of books.

709
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,980
They did like a they did two anthologies and I bought both of those.

710
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,460
And the guys like they did they did work.

711
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,260
So they went to both went to the Joke Hubert School for comics.

712
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,340
Yeah. And I learned about where is that?

713
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,780
Is that like famous?

714
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,140
Oh, yeah, Joke Hubert is like a famous like comic artist.

715
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,940
And like you go there and like you learn it's just you just go there to learn how to draw comics.

716
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,780
And then there was another school that opened.

717
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,540
Oh, my God, was it the Center for Cartoon Studies?

718
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,020
And I learned about it through that podcast.

719
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,860
And I was like, this is the college I'm going to.

720
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,100
And I was so fucking stoked.

721
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,020
And I was because like this was like the tail end of high school and my parents

722
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
like you need to go to college.

723
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,100
I'm like, I don't want I just want to draw.

724
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,420
And they're like, no, do it.

725
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,100
So I'm like, I want to go to I want to go I want to go to CCS.

726
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,540
And they're like, we are not signing loans for you to go throw your life away.

727
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,380
Little did they know I was going to throw my life away regardless.

728
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,340
Yeah. So what did you end up doing?

729
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,140
Well, after that, I went to a bunch of art schools, like quote unquote, regular art schools.

730
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,220
How old are you in the city?

731
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:23,340
17, 17, 18 ish at that around that age.

732
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,860
Like it's just, you know, your birthday, November 8th.

733
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,820
OK, so so you would have turned 18, like towards the start of senior year.

734
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,700
Yeah. So this is like right before that.

735
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,580
So we're looking at colleges and stuff.

736
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,540
And so everyone I go to

737
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,500
doesn't take me like I remember I went to the Art Institute of Boston

738
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,460
and the guy sat me down and just like I'm sick and tired of seeing portfolios

739
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,300
that are just shit get out.

740
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,820
Was it shit?

741
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,940
Yeah. OK.

742
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,260
I was a really bad artist and I knew it.

743
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,700
You have improved a lot.

744
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,260
Yeah, no, I'm definitely like way better than I was back then.

745
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,060
Do you think you'd get accepted there now?

746
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,620
Probably not just because like that there was a fine art school.

747
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,660
Like I never had a chance in hell of getting to a school like that.

748
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,820
And that's kind of what I.

749
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,700
Yeah, this is why I wanted to go to CCS.

750
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,740
Yes, because they're they're they would see your potential

751
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,860
and think this is a totally right because your art style is real different.

752
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,060
And I want to ask you about that, too.

753
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,140
Like how the fuck did you develop this art style?

754
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,580
Because I have literally never seen anyone with the style that even

755
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,900
like resembles yours.

756
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,340
Um, I don't.

757
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,060
And yours has changed a lot, too.

758
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,700
Yeah, because when you started doing my little pony art,

759
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,180
you were doing very show accurate stuff and your stuff on its own was

760
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,900
a little bit more, I don't know.

761
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,300
Like you you're very into variable line widths.

762
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,060
Yeah, which I don't think most people even know what the fuck that means.

763
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,980
I only learned that term from you.

764
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,020
But it's where the I mean, it's as it sounds when you draw the outline

765
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,260
of a character, it like has curves and like it gets thicker and thinner as it goes.

766
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,340
A lot of it is very hard to do thick, thick, thick line, thicker lines are usually

767
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,460
kind of used to highlight shadows or like places that are supposed to be darker.

768
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,060
It's done a lot.

769
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,540
I mean, it's not done in animation basically ever because it's so hard to animate.

770
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,780
Yeah, because like if you're doing variable line width, you have to keep

771
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,420
that line with placement consistent from frame to frame, which like,

772
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,700
which is why when people like watch like a one punch man

773
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,820
soccer casino, they're like so blown away, you know, since like how the fuck?

774
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,980
Like you're insane.

775
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,380
But yeah, I'm super big into like line art and stuff like that.

776
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,100
I don't know.

777
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,180
I mean, anime was the first big artistic influence for me.

778
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,220
I mean, trying to draw anime, but I never could really do it.

779
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,300
The only anime I can think of that has outlines as fucking thick

780
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,380
with two Cs as yours is DBZ.

781
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,220
But I mean, you were into that.

782
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:50,700
Yeah.

783
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,180
No, I was huge into DBZ or Powerpuff Girls.

784
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,700
Yeah, I did.

785
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,140
I did like Powerpuff Girls a lot.

786
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,420
I don't know.

787
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,420
I just I just consumed a lot of different things.

788
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,220
I watched like everything that was on TUNAMI.

789
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,060
I really liked the original full about Huckmus and that was airing.

790
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,740
I was obsessed with that.

791
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,780
I don't think that comes through much in your art style.

792
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,220
Maybe you're writing, but not so much the.

793
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,660
No, I don't think artistically, it's a lot of influence there.

794
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,180
I mean, was there a comic artist who was like your

795
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,980
favorite, who you used to list as like your biggest influence?

796
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,300
Let's see.

797
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,020
I I mean, one guy who worked in like all black and white.

798
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,420
Aren't you like a fan of Bone?

799
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,260
I do love Bone.

800
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,340
Jeff Smith's Bone is fucking gorgeous.

801
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,220
Bone is a little bit like your art.

802
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,860
A little bit.

803
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,340
Yeah, it's way more detail.

804
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,620
That guy is like fucking super pro.

805
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,820
I like.

806
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,220
Wait, am I thinking of his bone?

807
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,580
The one that's like a detective?

808
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,460
No, I wait.

809
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,900
What is is it all black and white?

810
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,820
It is. They did a reprint.

811
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,620
Scholastic did a color reprint.

812
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,340
That's why I've seen a color version.

813
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,180
But yeah, I really like Dave Sim.

814
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,300
He did Sarabis, which is another one of those like he did.

815
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,860
How God fucking Dave Sim.

816
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,580
What a fucking winner.

817
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,500
I just my favorite artists are them people who are just like

818
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,940
everything fucking sucks.

819
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,140
Do it anyway.

820
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,020
Like that just gets me like rock hard.

821
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,660
It's so good.

822
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,180
Like Dave Sim is just like like, oh, God, he's such a cool guy.

823
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,580
So like he he did all this like 300 issue comic by himself.

824
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
Like the tail end of it.

825
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,700
He had some guy do the backgrounds with him, but he's just like

826
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,900
an alcoholic guy who just draws comics and and and just like says,

827
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,020
fuck you.

828
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,380
Like like he had this book that came out because he started in the 70s,

829
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,740
I think, and like he was quoted early in an early menu series when someone

830
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,300
asked him, like, how long is Sarabis going to be?

831
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,540
Because it was like blowing up at the time.

832
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,860
He's like 300 issues, like just kind of just not thinking.

833
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,100
And then he's like, fuck, now I got to do 300 issues.

834
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,620
So like he finished it in like 2005.

835
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,980
So like 30 years, just grinding this shit out.

836
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,940
And like, I remember because they were talking about an indie

837
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,500
spinner rack and they interviewed him.

838
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,260
They were one of their first gigs.

839
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,540
Their first like gags on the show was called dialing Dave

840
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,340
because this is like when the internet still isn't this.

841
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,620
So they would just look in phone books for people named Dave Sim,

842
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,740
then call them live on the phone.

843
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,620
They're like, are you Dave Sim who made Sarabis?

844
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,300
Like some random guy like, who the fuck is that?

845
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,220
And they're like, click.

846
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,020
Well, that's not Dave Sim.

847
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,540
So like there's like episodes of episodes that they eventually

848
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,940
like found the actual Dave Sim.

849
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,060
I think like he contacted them or something.

850
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,780
But Dave Sim hates all technology, doesn't own a computer,

851
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,460
doesn't have an email address or anything like that.

852
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,420
So he drew everything by hand and like cut out the zippitone dots

853
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,140
and glued them down and like, like fucking he cut.

854
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,260
Wait, so you know, like the halftone dots.

855
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,740
You don't mean like individually.

856
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,140
No, no, no, he did screen tone the screen tone.

857
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,020
I mean, isn't that normal in Japanese manga though?

858
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,060
The Japanese are insane.

859
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,420
All right.

860
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,860
Over here in America, where we take shortcuts.

861
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,660
We have Cuban rights.

862
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,780
Yeah, we laugh.

863
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,860
That's not even that far from the truth.

864
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,860
So yeah, he does this and and they, I guess at the end of Sarabis,

865
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,940
they spoiled the end of Sarabis for me because I still haven't finished it

866
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,540
because it's like 300 issues.

867
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,580
So it's like he published because he had his own publishing company

868
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,660
called Ardvark Veraheim Press and he published everything himself

869
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,740
because then this is the 70s.

870
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm like, it's not internet.

871
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
And even now he's like internet is gay.

872
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:16,180
So he has some guy run his website and everything.

873
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,820
But so he had these big volumes that he called phone books

874
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,460
because they were the size of phone books that had his comics in them.

875
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,980
And so at the end of the run, he kills Sarabis.

876
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,580
Like Sarabis dies at the end of everything.

877
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,660
Well, now you spoiled Sarabis.

878
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:28,900
Yeah.

879
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,660
So I mean, if I have to suffer with knowing how it ends, all of you do too.

880
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,060
I think actually on his emails, I think he started a new service.

881
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,500
There's only two ways you get into story.

882
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:38,860
Right.

883
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,340
The main character does or doesn't die.

884
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,780
Like those are the two endings.

885
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,220
So that's a spoiler for you.

886
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,300
Then who the coin toss, you know, like.

887
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,700
So like, I think he actually is doing a new Sarabis series.

888
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,860
I need to look for it because I just got a message in my inbox

889
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,420
like two days ago called Sarabis and hell issue two is out.

890
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,460
I'm like, whoa, so.

891
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,540
But yeah, well, the character has gone to hell.

892
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,140
Yeah, like in the nature of the series to have, I mean, or is that weird?

893
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,540
I'm not super far into it

894
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,820
because I have the first three volumes, which is a fuck ton of comics by itself.

895
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,420
But there's still like, I think nine more that I have to get.

896
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,820
And they're hard to track down.

897
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,980
So. But yeah, at the.

898
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,740
So he dies.

899
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,580
I'm like, they're they're talking to Dave Sim.

900
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,820
They're like, I was really emotional.

901
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,100
Like at the end of the series, like, like, did you feel like

902
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,500
as you have been with this character for 30 years?

903
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,340
And he's like, how did you feel about like killing your character?

904
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,620
And he's like, so glad the fucker's dead.

905
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,340
Yeah, I imagine.

906
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,820
Like, oh, my God, it's always been looking forward to you for 30 years.

907
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,660
Like halfway through, Sarah, this is run.

908
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,140
He came out with a book called the Sarah, this style guide.

909
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,820
And he was just like, look, you got to do a page a day.

910
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,420
And what you need to do is need to for a month, you have to do a page a day.

911
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,660
And every day you don't fucking do it.

912
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,820
You have to reflect on why you would get it done.

913
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,580
Was it was it?

914
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,260
He's like, was it because was it because you were lazy?

915
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,180
You know, was your girlfriend?

916
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,860
You got to choose the page or the girlfriend.

917
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,660
That's the power of of comics is that because it's a well-established

918
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,660
medium to go in for 100 years, like there's generally like a speed.

919
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,940
People have agreed upon like a page a day is healthy.

920
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,420
More than that is necessary if you're doing a Shonen Jump comic.

921
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,540
Yeah, you need to like, but you need a team, probably.

922
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,540
I can't imagine.

923
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,940
I get like as much as I like making art, I could never publish for Shonen Jump.

924
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,860
You well, you have to be real dedicated to both a.

925
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,340
Doing manga and be making money.

926
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,420
Yeah, it's like to make it and Shonen Jump.

927
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:38,340
It's not about doing the manga that you're the most passionate about.

928
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,900
It's about doing the manga that is the best idea.

929
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,580
When I read Bakuman, I like literally like every every Shonen anime

930
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,100
I ever read dropped like two points across the board.

931
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,180
I realized that they were all fake.

932
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,460
I mean, I felt that way too.

933
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,500
But at the same time, it made it more special when something is that good.

934
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,060
And you're like, fuck, they did.

935
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,980
Like Bakuman makes Death Note more enjoyable

936
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,580
because they talk about the serious comedy thing.

937
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,940
And when you read about that and then you read Death Note

938
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,660
and you see how they did that and that the anime left it out.

939
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,340
Yeah, you're just like, mm, the manga was better.

940
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,220
You know, like this is why I read eight volumes of this

941
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,740
and why I did not finish the show, even though I was interested, you know.

942
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,420
But but in any case, so these comic book

943
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,420
authors are big influences on you.

944
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,580
Yeah, comedy wise.

945
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,900
It sounds like you were you did the same thing I did,

946
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,780
which was brainwash yourself into believing that you can work from home

947
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,020
and not have to answer to anybody.

948
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:40,300
Well, the thing was just that I've never, ever, ever, ever

949
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,020
been able to visualize myself in a professional environment.

950
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,260
Yeah, I just do it.

951
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,620
It's fucking impossible.

952
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:50,580
Well, the thing is just like my biggest thing is I know that I'm going to die.

953
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,740
Yeah. And the fact of like even like like that's I hate being depressed

954
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,460
because I spent half my time doing something I don't want to ever do

955
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,100
anything you don't want to do.

956
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,660
If you might get hit by a car tomorrow, right, you'll be like,

957
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,300
didn't do anything I wanted to do.

958
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,420
And that's that's why I was told to do when we did the the the art

959
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,260
apologies thing, like that's why I hate that I haven't done any of this shit yet.

960
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,900
So like my thing right now is I'm doing this Polystation two thing

961
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,460
and I'm like practicing my craft and getting better at doing like these fan

962
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,460
art pieces.

963
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,260
But like if nothing big happens with it, I'm just like, fuck it.

964
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,540
I'm just going to do Sorcerous Lost.

965
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,900
And like if I have to live in a box, so so be it.

966
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,580
All right, heavy question.

967
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:31,620
Would you say that that desire to like have completed things is what's keeping you alive?

968
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,420
Yes, because I got the sense that like because you've been you've been openly

969
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,060
very suicidal for a long time.

970
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,060
Sure. Yeah.

971
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,380
And but it seems as though like the reason that you've never been like gung ho

972
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:50,500
about I'm going to go die today is that like you haven't made a masterpiece yet.

973
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,660
I'm like I'm like it's it's I'm I'm depressed and anxious at the same time.

974
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,220
And so it's just like I want I definitely their days.

975
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,060
I'm just like, I'm just going to like end my life.

976
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,940
Like I feel like crap scenario.

977
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,740
You create something that you legitimately believe is like a work of merit.

978
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,340
No one cares about it.

979
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,620
What happens?

980
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,700
Nothing, because I'm already operating under the assumption that that's what's

981
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,060
going to happen, like deep down in my mind, I'm kind of convinced at this point,

982
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,180
like probably not going to be a Digi Bro.

983
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,140
Like that's probably not going to happen for me.

984
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,340
Like becoming as big as I am because I don't intend to stay at this level.

985
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,180
Right. But like I'm not even going to reach that point.

986
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:33,060
I think I'm going to be this weird, awkward guy who's just going to not.

987
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,300
I don't know. It depends on I think it depends on how legitimately good

988
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,260
could the projects you come out with are.

989
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,220
Because like so far, your narrative projects have never really come out.

990
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,260
Yeah. Yeah.

991
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,420
Except for the My Little Pony fan fiction.

992
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:46,940
Yeah.

993
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,420
But like you can't recommend that to your friends too easily.

994
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,020
No. No, unfortunately.

995
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:58,700
No. But like I just think that it's hard to say, like one of the problems I've

996
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,860
always had with with with trying to, you know, when you come to me for advice,

997
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,220
I'm like, well, the problem is that it's hard to say if you need to like,

998
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,460
like you're good enough that I'm like, clearly this guy could do like an

999
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,180
amazing series, like a great, he could write a great novel.

1000
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,180
He could write a great comic.

1001
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,620
He could write a great whatever, but like it hasn't happened yet.

1002
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,020
Right.

1003
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,100
And so it's hard for me to say, like, oh, you're, you know,

1004
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,940
people just don't care about your art style as opposed to, well,

1005
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,940
if you gave them like a great story, they might.

1006
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,060
And maybe the kinds of stories that you are best at telling can't be done

1007
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,620
in a short amount of time, you know, like, because there are some people

1008
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:43,540
who can just like draw a picture in an hour and it somehow tells a story

1009
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,700
and people are like entranced by it.

1010
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,100
And then there's other people who are like, I can tell a way better story

1011
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,980
than that, but you're going to have to give me a year.

1012
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,340
Right.

1013
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,900
Well, that's my, I just, I work insanely slowly.

1014
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,660
And I don't know, I don't know if it's because I just have a really shit

1015
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,540
work ethic or if I'm just like, I think it's your, I, I'm going to go ahead

1016
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,540
and say, I don't think that your work ethic is your biggest problem.

1017
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:09,020
Because I think that the work I've seen you do is unbelievably taxing

1018
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,940
the way you do it.

1019
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,860
Like back when you used to draw, because you did a few art

1020
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,580
live streams and you were doing the Trixie comic, do you want to explain

1021
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,140
that period of time?

1022
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,580
How, what happened there?

1023
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,380
Actually, we might have to cut off and upload footage and then read, restart

1024
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,620
if this is going to be long, probably only like six minutes left of recording.

1025
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,140
I can probably get through this in six minutes.

1026
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,420
All right.

1027
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:35,140
Um, no, well, that was just, I got, I got big into vectoring

1028
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,900
during MLP because that's like how they did the show was with vector graphics.

1029
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,340
The difference between doing vector graphics in the show versus when I was

1030
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,020
doing them, because like a vector graphic is just, it's infinitely scalable.

1031
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,420
Yeah.

1032
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,460
So like it's all done with points and math instead of pixels.

1033
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:56,300
Um, but the way you do vict vector art, like precisely is use the pen tool.

1034
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,020
And so you base, it's all done with bestie.

1035
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,620
Do you not do that anymore when you draw?

1036
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,300
No, I've moved, I've moved.

1037
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,900
I mean, sometimes I still do.

1038
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,740
Because when you were doing that, I watched some of those live streams

1039
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:10,900
and you would be like drawing a tree for three hours.

1040
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,260
Yeah.

1041
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,940
And I was like, this is what, like you could, you were doing

1042
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,820
commissions that you literally could charge somebody like $50.

1043
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,780
And you're, you're only getting paid like a dollar an hour

1044
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,020
for the amount of work you did.

1045
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,820
I'm running into that problem right now with 3D because like I'm doing,

1046
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,580
I'm pricing it out.

1047
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:31,180
Like if I wanted to start commissions or you're just planning on it.

1048
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:35,220
But the problem is like to, to charge minimum wage to do a commission.

1049
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,620
It would start at like $300.

1050
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,580
And how long is the commission?

1051
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,580
Or just, is it just a model or it's just like a model to do a model

1052
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,260
with like a turnaround and one pose would take probably like, there's some

1053
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,420
people who would buy it, but they're not in your YouTube audience.

1054
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,100
No, they're not like, they're, they're no, I don't know them yet.

1055
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,180
Essentially.

1056
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:51,660
All right.

1057
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,540
The card is filled up.

1058
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:56,740
So we'll take a short break to, uh, unfilled.

1059
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,420
Here we go.

1060
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:02,380
So before we just took a little break, you were talking about your influences

1061
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,740
and how you have a lot of clear influences on like your lifestyle and

1062
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:09,700
mentality, but not so much on your actual aesthetic art style.

1063
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,300
Yeah.

1064
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,620
I guess it's kind of, that's a bit more nebulous to track.

1065
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:19,540
Um, my, my art style has changed a lot, uh, as, as time has gone by.

1066
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,300
Uh, I, I can definitely recall like specific artists that I was trying

1067
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,780
to integrate into my style, but like my, my art really took off when I

1068
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,460
stopped trying to actively develop it.

1069
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,260
Um, Jonah Vasquez was huge back in the day.

1070
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:36,140
I think everybody had a Jonah Vasquez phase who was into drawing

1071
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,820
comics or art in the mid 2000s, like invaders him, killed all of us.

1072
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,740
And then Johnny the homicidal maniac and squee and all that shit.

1073
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:51,660
Um, I remember distinctly, uh, I started getting into spawn, like the original,

1074
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:56,180
like spawn run from image and, uh, Oh God, what's the guy's name?

1075
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,380
Not Tard McFarlane.

1076
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,060
I like, I love his art too, but like the guy specifically, uh, Steve, no.

1077
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:01,900
Hmm.

1078
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,460
Oh God, I'm blanking, but it was specific, specific artists, artists on

1079
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,500
spawn that I really fucking liked, um, Dave Capullo, he was fucking dope.

1080
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,980
And like his arts, the complete antithesis of what I do, cause it was

1081
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,020
like really thin lines, tons of cross hatching and extraneous detail everywhere.

1082
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,860
And like really soft painterly colors.

1083
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,140
It was like, he took like Todd's art style and like pushed it further.

1084
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,980
Um, and I, but I really liked him.

1085
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,780
There was a whole phase during college where I was desperately trying to do

1086
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,180
that and failing miserably because I have no patients.

1087
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,460
And at one point specifically, I remember in illustration class, I was like,

1088
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,620
fuck it, I'm not this.

1089
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,020
So I did the exact opposite.

1090
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,700
It did really simple cartoony things.

1091
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:44,140
And I think that's probably where my style like kind of became its own.

1092
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,540
Cause I realized like I'm way too lazy to sit there and spend 10 hours on one

1093
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,540
drawing that people can look at like your old fucking like super detailed shit.

1094
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,140
I mean, I don't think any of it's online anymore.

1095
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,500
Uh, was it any good?

1096
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,940
No, that was the whole problem is like, I didn't have the patience to be a

1097
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:10,300
Dave Caputo cause like his art, like you could zoom in that shit like extensively

1098
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:10,820
to make it work.

1099
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,100
It's just like, I don't, I don't know how, how people sit there.

1100
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:19,180
Cause like my whole thing is like, I want to tell the story and the art.

1101
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:24,660
Well, you've always been way more of a narrative as than an esthetician, I suppose,

1102
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:29,220
which is kind of funny because you do mostly work in visual mediums or

1103
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,860
you've, you've, like you've always considered like visual mediums to be at

1104
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,860
the forefront of your career, except for the period where you were trying to be

1105
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,900
a novelist.

1106
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,260
Yeah.

1107
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,460
Um, how do you like reconcile that?

1108
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:40,820
Sure.

1109
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,820
I think I really enjoy my, my favorite things, like ever since I was a little kid,

1110
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,780
like stories and like experiencing stories have been really thing.

1111
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:52,900
I think one of my very, very, very, very first influences was Animorphs.

1112
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,740
That scholastic book series, like everybody laughs them for the covers.

1113
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,020
That book series was fucking crazy.

1114
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,420
Like people were killed.

1115
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,820
You just reread that a couple of years ago.

1116
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,220
I did.

1117
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:05,060
I read, I bought, I bought the whole series again to read, check it out.

1118
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:10,180
And like the writing is super basic, but like, it's about like high school kids

1119
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,460
being traumatized by war.

1120
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,940
Like that's what the entire thing's about.

1121
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,540
And like the book ends super solemnly.

1122
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,740
There's no happy ending.

1123
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,780
They don't win.

1124
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,740
Shit's bad.

1125
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,540
Oh, that's like, they, they end up like spoilers for Animorphs.

1126
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,700
I'll actually warn you this time.

1127
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,580
They end up like repelling the aliens and everything, but the book,

1128
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:32,620
the last book is like 15 years later, one of the characters has post-traumatic

1129
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,980
stress disorder and nobody knows where he is.

1130
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,340
He just dropped off, faced the planet.

1131
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,820
The ship that was through the entire book, Cassie and Jake never happens.

1132
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:45,340
They break up because Jake is like not able to like parse, like not being in war.

1133
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,660
So they can't work out.

1134
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:51,380
And like it's just like super, like just like how like soldiers, they never recover.

1135
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,700
Yeah.

1136
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,620
And so like the book ends with like Jake, like going back into space to go on another

1137
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,980
mission and like the book ends with them encountering some other aliens.

1138
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,380
And like, it's like, do they live or die?

1139
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:00,940
We don't know.

1140
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,180
That's some heavy shit.

1141
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:03,700
Yeah.

1142
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,460
Like the thing is, like they like get stabbed and murdered and like severed.

1143
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:12,460
And like, like there's one point where like, uh, like one of them gets cut in half

1144
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,620
and they have to like de-morph back to human.

1145
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,900
Cause when you, your wounds recover, when you go back to your regular form.

1146
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,100
So like they almost die a bunch of times.

1147
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,780
There's like torture and murder and like all this crazy shit.

1148
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,740
That's like, I never actually read any of it.

1149
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,740
It's so good.

1150
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,300
Oh God.

1151
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,100
I really wish they was like an adult revision of this.

1152
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,500
Cause the way it works is that, um, there's these aliens called the yurks and like

1153
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,780
they're parasites, they go into your ear and they take, they wrap around your

1154
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,180
brain and take over your body.

1155
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,980
And so there, there's like these aliens everywhere.

1156
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:46,340
Um, like parasite, they're parasitic aliens and, uh, they have like these, they've

1157
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,580
taken over tons of tons of worlds and now they're coming to earth.

1158
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,860
Cause in this world, earth is like, we're basically, we breed like cattle.

1159
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:56,740
So like there's like, we're billions of people on earth that like doesn't happen.

1160
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:01,060
Like all these other planets, there's a couple million of both species, but here

1161
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,740
it's like a gold mine for this alien race.

1162
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:06,740
I'm like, we're super underdeveloped, but our bodies are like really great for them.

1163
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,740
So they're like trying to take over the planet.

1164
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,100
And then there's other aliens called the andolites who are fighting them.

1165
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:19,780
And so, um, the way they fight them have this to basically for espionage is morphing.

1166
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,460
So you can like acquire the DNA of an animal by touching it.

1167
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,340
And then for two hours, you can transform and become them.

1168
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:30,100
Um, but if you don't de-morph in two hours, you're trapped in that form forever.

1169
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,980
So the characters don't have like a specific animal they morph into.

1170
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,700
They just can morph into animals.

1171
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,220
You can pull a bunch of different ones.

1172
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:41,940
And once you acquire DNA, essentially, yeah, but the interesting thing is when

1173
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,340
you transform into an animal, the first time you have to fight its instincts

1174
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,660
because it can take over your mind.

1175
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,540
So that never happened to any characters.

1176
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:50,980
It does.

1177
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,940
It does temporarily.

1178
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,580
Like one of the scariest things is like when they have to morph into ants

1179
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,380
and like ants are just like automata.

1180
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,580
So for like 15 pages, they're just like they find another ant colony and like

1181
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,940
they're describing what happens when they have no control of themselves.

1182
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,220
They're like biting other ants and have it having a huge colony war.

1183
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,340
And like halfway through it, they realize what's going on.

1184
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,860
And like they de-morph in the middle.

1185
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,940
Like they burst through a wall and like fall out and it's like they're all

1186
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:19,060
traumatized and like like 20, 30 books later, they're like, well, it's never

1187
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,380
morph into ants again ever.

1188
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:25,460
But one of the kids Tobias, like he the very first book he gets stuck trapped

1189
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,420
in the form of a hawk.

1190
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,100
So for like half the series, he's just a hawk.

1191
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,700
And so he lives, he lives in the woods.

1192
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:36,420
He and like he for the first for the first like 20 or 30 books, like people are

1193
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,460
like he'll like go to like Jake's house and like he'll like feed him like a

1194
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,980
hamburger or something because he has to just eat meat now because he's a bird.

1195
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:49,460
Um, and, uh, eventually, uh, he just like, he's been in a hawk so long, like he

1196
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,740
just succumbs to the, the, uh, the instinct and he starts hunting and like killing.

1197
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,340
Like they describe in great detail.

1198
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,020
He finds a mouse or rips it open.

1199
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,500
It starts feasting on its intestines and he has like a fucking panic attack.

1200
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,940
But eventually like his like subplot is like learning to just accept the fact

1201
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,940
that like this is who he is now narrates through this, this hawk and every,

1202
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,780
every book changes narration, its first person narration, but every single

1203
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,060
book it changes from one of the five, one of the six main characters.

1204
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,900
So this is one of his books where he just describes it like, yeah, I just

1205
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,420
ate this thing and it was fucking great.

1206
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,620
So like, he just starts doing that.

1207
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,860
And like at the end in the last book in the series, they're like,

1208
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,300
because he never, he's just a hawk.

1209
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,620
So like there was like, we don't know what happened to Tobias.

1210
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,940
Like hawks only live for a few years.

1211
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,660
He could be dead.

1212
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,300
We don't know.

1213
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,500
He just disappeared.

1214
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,580
That's nuts.

1215
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,140
It's, it's, it's so fucking good.

1216
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:42,780
But like that's like that and Digimon are probably like my two big, like super

1217
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,900
big influences in the beginning.

1218
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,140
Cause those are like the only things that had like a continuous narrative that

1219
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,100
kept going on.

1220
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,940
Um, so all right.

1221
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,100
Well, I guess we kind of got to the heart of your, uh, your influences.

1222
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,900
Unless there's any other, like, are there any influences that aren't really

1223
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:02,820
like art related, but are like way more than most people realize, like affect

1224
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:07,940
your life, you know, um, I don't know.

1225
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:13,580
I mean, like I, I watched a lot of like, like YouTube, like, uh, I really

1226
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,540
liked Gary Vee.

1227
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,460
He's fucking dope.

1228
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,300
Never heard of him.

1229
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:21,100
Uh, he does like, uh, business and like social media and personal

1230
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,260
brand development and stuff.

1231
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,180
He's super cool.

1232
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,260
I'm about to read his new book.

1233
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,100
What would you say are your biggest influences as a YouTuber?

1234
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,660
Oh, I don't know.

1235
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,540
I really don't.

1236
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,660
I mean, it's just kind of an amalgam of like, yeah, it's just like, I don't

1237
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,660
styles that have sort of sprung from the primordial ooze of the biggest one

1238
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,300
that we both had in the beginning was a sequelitis.

1239
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,460
Like that's where our whole format initially came from.

1240
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,980
Pretty much was just like trying to, I mean, he took it from Mr.

1241
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,500
Plinkett.

1242
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:54,820
So it really, he's like the forefather of this current style, you know, um, in

1243
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:58,580
terms of like, I really liked just like tech YouTubers when I was doing

1244
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:03,820
Rebel pixels, a lot of MKBHD and like Austin Evans and, and, and I pocket

1245
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,500
out a bunch of all the big ones.

1246
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:11,500
You definitely had MKBHD is like, uh, attitude towards tech, which is like

1247
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,420
these, everything should be like kind of sleek and modern.

1248
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,860
And like, I mean, it's unfortunate that you were filming it in a basement as

1249
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,060
compared to his fucking studio.

1250
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:24,660
I mean, not that he always had that, but like, you know, you have, you, you

1251
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:28,140
branded it very strongly to look like that kind of channel.

1252
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,060
Like everything is like modern and cool.

1253
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:31,580
Yeah.

1254
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,820
I mean, that's what I went to school for.

1255
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:34,140
Yeah.

1256
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,220
Tell me more about that.

1257
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:40,380
Cause again, um, a lot of the things about you that fascinate me the most are

1258
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:44,940
the things that have nothing to do with YouTube at all, um, such as your

1259
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,260
graphic design and website design history.

1260
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:50,980
Cause you make good, how the fuck did you make the sorceress lost website?

1261
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,420
The motion comic site, a lot of work.

1262
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,740
It was just like all, I mean, I still have the file.

1263
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:56,140
You can look at it.

1264
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:00,220
It's all hand coded and just like, those aren't like gifts or no, they're

1265
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:04,660
or anything they were video files with no audio.

1266
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,740
And then you, there's an HTML five.

1267
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:12,100
They have like a video embed, like, uh, I don't even remember the word before it

1268
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,380
is at this point, just like a option you can do.

1269
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,300
In case anyone doesn't know what we're talking about, go to the sorceress

1270
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,660
lost site, it's still up.

1271
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,340
Unfortunately, some of the fonts don't work anymore.

1272
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,500
Cause like Dropbox, I was hosting a bunch of stuff for it on Dropbox.

1273
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,060
Um, and then Dropbox changed the way their files work.

1274
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,100
So you can't link out to other files anymore.

1275
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,500
So all the web fonts that I was hosting all don't work.

1276
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,100
So it's like in times in Roman, it looks 10 times worse than it used to.

1277
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,340
Um, but yeah, it's just, uh, and then I went into the player, you can

1278
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,420
edit the properties of the player.

1279
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,820
So I set it to autoplay and then to hide the controls.

1280
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,660
So they look like gifts, they act like gifts, but they're video files.

1281
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,420
So like a 10th of the size of the gift that would be,

1282
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,900
but you can scroll over it and like, yeah, when you scroll over it, the

1283
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,940
controllers, the pot, they pop up, right?

1284
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,180
It's really sleek looking.

1285
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:00,020
And I'd never seen anything presented that way, but I assume that the

1286
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:05,220
bottom line is, it is not worth the amount of effort to tell that story that way.

1287
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:10,500
Um, I mean, now that I can do 3D, it would be so much easier to do the same thing.

1288
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,900
Do you still think you might take that direction with, uh, it's very

1289
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:19,380
sourceable, I've realized to go back to the question that you initially asked

1290
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:23,820
was how do I reconcile wanting to do visuals, but being a very narrative

1291
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,660
centric person?

1292
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,900
The reason I started writing for a while is because like I came to the

1293
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,100
conclusion, like all I really care about is telling the story and like,

1294
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,540
why not just do that?

1295
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:35,500
And the problem, not even the problem, but like what I realized through

1296
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,420
doing that is that my really like visual storytelling.

1297
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,540
I like being able to like move the camera around and like do things without,

1298
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,100
just, I hate description.

1299
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:45,460
Yeah.

1300
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:48,500
Like every time I got to get to a book and like, when they have to

1301
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,540
describe all this shit, like, like the Scootaloo book that I wrote, it

1302
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,900
doesn't have the word said in there ever.

1303
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,660
I never made an active decision to never have a said tag because I

1304
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,460
hate that so fucking much.

1305
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,220
The word said.

1306
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:02,500
Yeah.

1307
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:07,060
So every time, instead of like saying, like they said, I'd be like, you know,

1308
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,220
that the opposite is what is preached is correct.

1309
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:09,700
Right.

1310
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:09,980
Right.

1311
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:14,540
Well, the thing is, I, it's because they say don't change said to like, he

1312
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,060
replied or he did.

1313
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,020
So what I did instead is I would use what's called an action tag.

1314
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:24,340
So instead of being like saying like, like, Hey, did you, I said or something,

1315
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,660
I'd be like, I picked up the can off the table.

1316
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,420
Hey, did you?

1317
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,500
And then, you know, I love stuff like that.

1318
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:33,500
So it was, I don't put any saids in my stories usually either, but I'll just

1319
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,380
like full paragraph break for dialogue.

1320
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:35,660
Yeah.

1321
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,900
I mean, write it like a script, you know, the thing, that's how I usually

1322
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,460
start when I would write all those chapters, like, because the dialogues

1323
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,540
apart, I love doing the most.

1324
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,100
I just write the dialogue out and then like, okay, I guess what I'm going to

1325
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,780
do while they're talking and then just go back through and like slowly piece

1326
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,620
the scene together.

1327
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,100
Yeah.

1328
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,660
Um, that's interesting.

1329
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,860
But that, but doing all that, like, I loved writing the dialogue.

1330
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:58,620
I loved coming it up with this story conceptually, but I would get super bogged

1331
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:04,260
down and like trying to not a, um, writing like descriptions of things because

1332
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,220
like, I'm like, I could just draw this and then be like transitioning from

1333
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,140
scene to scene was also tricky.

1334
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:13,660
I don't, I don't know how to like, I don't know if it's just that back in

1335
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,580
the old times when you had to read books.

1336
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:23,900
I think people had a just more ability to imagine what those places looked like.

1337
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,260
Cause when I read like a long descriptive part of a book, I cannot

1338
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,140
picture it at all.

1339
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:31,260
Like I just come up with whatever I think it might, but I'm just like, this

1340
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,420
doesn't feel right.

1341
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:36,780
The same way that just seeing a picture, you in a picture, whoever said pictures

1342
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,940
worth a thousand words underestimated the worth of a picture, right?

1343
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,500
Like a thousand words ain't that much.

1344
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,900
And you can tell a fucking big story with a picture.

1345
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:49,100
Like just show a picture of someone's room and you can tell me like a thousand

1346
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,700
things about that character, you know?

1347
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:56,100
So I totally agree that like with certain scopes of stories, like a big

1348
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:02,780
fantasy story, like it's real hard to be able to like write enough minute

1349
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,820
details without it bogging down.

1350
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:08,540
Like a lot of fantasy novels and shit, I have a great example of this in

1351
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:13,740
Sorcerous Laws depth of why like this is actually one scene in the beginning

1352
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,980
of SL that I don't think I'm going to use anymore.

1353
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,700
But at the time in the first revision I was working on really made me like think,

1354
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:22,620
fuck, I don't really think I can work with books the way I want to.

1355
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:27,060
Cause there's, there's a shot that I had that in the beginning of the story, Sarah

1356
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:30,980
was going to go to like the docks and meet somebody who was coming in for her

1357
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:34,460
mentor and pick up these scrolls that he needed.

1358
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:38,300
So what I want to do, she was going to sit down on like a bench, wait for the

1359
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,340
ship to come in and then they're like, we got sound like the ship's coming into

1360
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:45,820
dock. She turned around and like it was the camera would zoom out and you see

1361
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,940
that not only is that ship coming to dock, the islands like floating in the

1362
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,700
sky being suspended by magic.

1363
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,900
So there's like this airship coming into dock, not just a regular ship.

1364
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,900
So it zooms out, you have this big glory shot.

1365
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,620
And I was like, oh, this is so cool.

1366
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,740
But then I switched to a book.

1367
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,420
I'm like, how the fuck am I going to do this scene?

1368
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:04,500
There's no way to give the camera pants out and like it would sound like, but

1369
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,340
that's how I think of a visual art.

1370
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,940
So I'm like, I can't write it.

1371
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,460
Like it's exactly, I can write the dialogue just fine.

1372
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,900
But like in terms of like telling this story and just telling stories in general,

1373
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,020
I'm thinking like a director and not.

1374
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:21,740
When I was trying to write the the book that I wrote back in 2010 for Nana

1375
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:26,180
Remo, like it took me two years to get it to the stage of a novel because the

1376
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:30,700
initial idea I had was just of like a scene of someone firing a bullet and then

1377
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,660
like time stopping and the character like flicking it around and shooting it back

1378
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,780
or something like that.

1379
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,860
But the only way it made sense in my head was visually.

1380
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:42,140
It's like, no one will understand how cool this power looks if I describe it in

1381
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:44,180
text because you don't see the bullet stop.

1382
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:44,660
Right.

1383
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,940
You know, so it won't.

1384
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,340
This story can't be told that way.

1385
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:48,780
Yeah.

1386
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,460
And eventually it just changed the story.

1387
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,300
So that worked for me.

1388
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,100
Yeah, I cut that scene out of the written version.

1389
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:54,860
It's up on Tumblr.

1390
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,340
You can read it.

1391
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,500
It doesn't happen like that.

1392
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:57,980
But like, I don't, I don't.

1393
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:03,260
I mean, every time someone makes a YouTube video about any adaptation of anything,

1394
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,420
they're like, oh, mediums can't be crossed.

1395
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,620
Like it's new information.

1396
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,780
But like, you do kind of have to keep reminding people, including yourself,

1397
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,060
like, hey, some of your ideas just won't be.

1398
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:13,460
Yeah.

1399
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:17,900
Do I mean, to, to, to, in defensive books, something that's really easy to do

1400
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:22,180
with books that's harder to do with other visuals is engage even not even

1401
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,700
expedition thing I was going to say is engage all the senses.

1402
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:29,140
Yeah, you can describe easily how things smell, how they feel without having to

1403
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:32,740
like, like if you're going to do that in a visual thing, like you can either imply

1404
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,980
it with visuals or you'd be like, Hey, it stinks in here.

1405
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:39,300
You know, you, you can't really like elegantly integrate in senses.

1406
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:43,940
I think I think the best thing about text is just that like a character can

1407
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,660
easily give their reactions to a situation.

1408
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,060
Yeah.

1409
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:53,980
And I think that like a lot of the reason that adaptations from like books to

1410
01:07:53,980 --> 01:08:00,180
film always end up so bad is that like the book, the book is not focused on the

1411
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,060
visual element because it can't do that well.

1412
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:02,300
Right.

1413
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:05,180
It's focused on the fucking thoughts in the character's head.

1414
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,100
So like most books are more focused on character development.

1415
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,540
Well, I think, you know, and like something that I was noticing while I was

1416
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:17,420
writing, because I was trying to figure this out myself is that like any visual

1417
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:21,100
medium kind of always like has the issue of time, right?

1418
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:24,940
Cause like most, most of a movie is done basically, like each scene is in real

1419
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:30,020
time, whereas in a book, like in between two people talking, like one sentence

1420
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:34,100
and another, the character can have a thought that goes on for like 16 pages.

1421
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:34,940
Yeah, exactly.

1422
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,660
And like there's no way to, you can't just like stop the frame.

1423
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,580
Like and then the character thinks like it feels totally weird.

1424
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:42,780
And what are you going to show?

1425
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:43,180
Right.

1426
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,580
You can't really do anything.

1427
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,700
Like you, like, like you'd have to like go into their head and like animate

1428
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:51,460
all this stuff, but like it feels awkward because like nothing's shot like that.

1429
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,020
Yeah.

1430
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:55,620
And I mean, obviously there's lots of books that like, like House of Leaves,

1431
01:08:55,620 --> 01:09:00,140
there's no way to make not a book because like it's constant notations

1432
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:02,140
and active reader participation.

1433
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:06,700
You can maybe make it a visual novel, but not, not a book, you know?

1434
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,780
But, um, yeah.

1435
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:12,980
So, so Sorceress Lost is still in the works, would you say?

1436
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:13,420
For sure.

1437
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:14,180
Okay.

1438
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:18,020
Um, I just finished like a rewrite, like a month and a change ago.

1439
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,660
I have the first chapter redone.

1440
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:25,060
So how like glued to this universe are you a Sorceress Lost?

1441
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,500
I really enjoy it.

1442
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:31,460
And depending on how I mean, my plan initially was like, I would want to

1443
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:35,420
have like any future stories I do take place in Salon as well, which is

1444
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,300
like the name of the world.

1445
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:36,820
Yeah.

1446
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:44,260
I, uh, speaking as one former aspiring author who gave up on his world to

1447
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:49,780
another, um, because for me, the hardest thing about any project is I have an

1448
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:51,260
idea for the next project.

1449
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:55,660
And so like it becomes, I don't want to let this project take up too much of my

1450
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,740
time because I want to move on to the next one.

1451
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,780
Do you ever feel that way about Sorceress Lost?

1452
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:03,740
Like, is there another project like underneath that waiting to get out?

1453
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:07,540
Or is it more like this is my thing and I want it to fucking happen?

1454
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:11,700
The weird thing for me, and like this almost undermines everything I've

1455
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:15,980
been saying so far is that I, and like this is something I've been dealing

1456
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:17,580
with a lot recently and trying to figure out.

1457
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:21,140
And I think I've kind of understood it is that because I have like all

1458
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:25,900
these self-esteem problems, like my projects don't feel real or as special.

1459
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:31,140
Like I can't be as passionate about SL as like how I got, I can't be as into

1460
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,380
SL as I was into like MLP or something like that.

1461
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:38,740
Just because like, because it's from me, it feels tainted almost like intrinsically.

1462
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:42,980
But like the way I'm trying to like get around that is I've, I've, I've found

1463
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:47,260
that some of my best work and the things I can get most hype about that I

1464
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:51,140
work on is when I'm working as a group, because then the project transcends

1465
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,220
just me and it becomes bigger and more important.

1466
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:56,020
Did you watch my Dear Artists video?

1467
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:56,460
I did.

1468
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,020
Cause I, you inspired that video.

1469
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,020
I figured when I was like the first photo to come up as like artists

1470
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:06,420
struggling, I was like, I think, I think I was watching, did you recent, like in

1471
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:09,220
the last week put out like a hyperbolic wine chamber or something?

1472
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:09,580
Yes.

1473
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,100
Cause it was, I was watching that and you were just talking about like the

1474
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,180
difficulties of marketing yourself and stuff.

1475
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:20,540
And I just somehow the thought crossed my mind about Vocaloid or something.

1476
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:23,700
And I was just like, Tom should do that or something.

1477
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:24,420
I don't know.

1478
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:29,180
I was just like artists can team up and they can make it like take

1479
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:32,380
some of the burden off of yourself, you know, it doesn't have to be all you most.

1480
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:38,020
I think that the YouTube sphere is very individualistic, even though there's

1481
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:41,660
like tons of YouTube channels that are teams, you know, like, especially a lot

1482
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,420
of the big ones have multiple persons behind them.

1483
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:48,380
But like, I think the romantic idea of the YouTuber is like guys like Casey

1484
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:52,420
Neistat who are just like, I don't sleep and I make a video every day and it's

1485
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:53,340
always good.

1486
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,980
And so we pressure ourselves to be like that.

1487
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:00,060
Um, and obviously, you know, the idea of like odd tour artists and shit, but like

1488
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,820
even a fucking, you could look at Quentin Tarantino and be like, oh, he's

1489
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,420
my favorite director, but it's like, he would be nothing without the

1490
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,980
cinematographers who bring those fucking shots to life because his cinematographers

1491
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,700
are God tier.

1492
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:18,180
So like, you know, I think not enough people to some, some people responded

1493
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,420
to my video, like, isn't this all obvious?

1494
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,460
This is one on one shit.

1495
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:25,140
And other people were like, thanks, Digi revolutionized my life going to

1496
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,500
implement this right now.

1497
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,900
I was looking through the comments because like I was kind of like in both

1498
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,540
camps because it was like, yeah, this is like something I've been considering.

1499
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:35,460
And at the same time, other people were like, I don't know.

1500
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,100
So I guess it depends on where you are.

1501
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:37,620
Yeah.

1502
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:42,940
I mean, for some people, they just never even think about how like marketing

1503
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,980
yourself is extremely difficult.

1504
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:48,220
Cause first of all, you have to recognize what about yourself is marketable.

1505
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,020
And then you've got to figure out like who is going to care.

1506
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,580
And how do I find those people and show it to them?

1507
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:58,940
Well, I think one of the things that like I've had issues with is that like,

1508
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:03,020
I've always been afraid that the stuff I actually want to do has no market value.

1509
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:03,500
Right.

1510
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:07,060
Cause like even with police station two right now, I think, like

1511
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,140
it's I'm doing fan art on police station too.

1512
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:12,460
When like at my core, like if you ask me, what do I think of fan art?

1513
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:13,580
I think it's stupid.

1514
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:14,820
I think it's a waste of time.

1515
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:15,260
Yeah.

1516
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:19,540
Like it's not like it's obviously a great marketing tactic to use, but I don't feel

1517
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:23,740
like I feel like it has inherently less artistic value than doing original work.

1518
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:26,620
But ironically, it is the only thing anybody cares about.

1519
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,100
Exactly.

1520
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,020
Unless, unless, well, okay.

1521
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:33,340
At the same time, though, I do feel like there's a little bit of anytime.

1522
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:34,980
Well, okay.

1523
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:38,260
You're going to agree with me on this because you're really hard on yourself.

1524
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:42,660
You would probably say that if you made a good enough story, you would need to

1525
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:43,660
rely on fan art.

1526
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,100
I mean, some people do that.

1527
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:50,460
I mean, I think if you get to a certain, there's a certain like level that

1528
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:53,100
once you hit that, like the work speaks for itself.

1529
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,460
Most people aren't there.

1530
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,540
Everything that people are drawing fan art of is something that reached that level.

1531
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:57,900
Exactly.

1532
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:02,260
You know, like it had to be good enough that people, it inspired fan art and, you know,

1533
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:06,700
it was, I got a really interesting comment on that wine chamber.

1534
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,900
I did someone said, like, it's like, I've never really personally connected to

1535
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:14,660
your work because the most stuff you've been doing recently is fan art.

1536
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:18,340
Whereas I really connect to Ben because everything he's doing is his own work.

1537
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:18,780
Right.

1538
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,020
I'm like, that's an interesting.

1539
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:25,580
I mean, for me, the difficulties with connecting with your work is mostly that I

1540
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:26,900
know how much you hate it.

1541
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:29,860
And it's hard for me, like, especially the YouTube videos.

1542
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,860
Yeah, I just, I'm not like, if I watch a YouTube

1543
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:37,420
video that I know you didn't want to make, then I'm just like, well, he obvious.

1544
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:39,740
Like sometimes you just seem like you're having fun with it.

1545
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:42,300
Like you put out a vlog because you just wanted to rant about this thing.

1546
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,900
And like, that's why a lot of my videos exist.

1547
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,620
They weren't made for an audience.

1548
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:50,580
They were made because I had an idea and I thought, eh, 3,000 people will click on this.

1549
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,300
It's worth posting.

1550
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,980
You know, like someone might think this is quotable or funny or they've had the same

1551
01:14:55,980 --> 01:15:00,620
thought, but, uh, but when it's one that I can see that you like forced yourself to

1552
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:03,500
do, I'm just like, Tom, you got to get out of there.

1553
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,140
Like you got to get out of there.

1554
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,020
You got to make the stuff you want to do, you know?

1555
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:07,700
Yeah.

1556
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:10,700
And that's like, I'm the next couple of months.

1557
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:13,940
Like I have my nest egg for moving, which is going to happen, I guess, in a few months.

1558
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:19,260
So I quit my job before coming to RAGCon because I'm like, I'm just going to focus

1559
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,660
on getting that.

1560
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,300
Tell us about the job you've been doing.

1561
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,940
I want people to understand the, because you've talked about it briefly, but the

1562
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:29,220
conditions of this job are terrible.

1563
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:34,860
And it's cause I guess the guy who hires you owns half the city and can just do

1564
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:35,780
whatever he wants.

1565
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:36,180
Yeah.

1566
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:40,940
Um, cause we, we actually, uh, when it got really bad, we actually talked to one of

1567
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:46,300
the, uh, like officials for the town and he was like, yeah, it's fine, but you can't

1568
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,020
do anything about it.

1569
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:47,860
Like, don't try.

1570
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:49,860
So I'm just like, okay.

1571
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:55,500
Uh, but yeah, no, I work for the last like two years, I've worked as a quote unquote

1572
01:15:55,540 --> 01:16:00,300
security guard at an abandoned building, uh, Draper mill in the center of our tiny

1573
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:05,140
little town, and it's an old, old building.

1574
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,260
It's like stripped to the bone.

1575
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:10,620
There's just nothing in there, but like asbestos, probably, and lead, even though

1576
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:15,420
apparently they've done, you know, inspections and it's fine, maybe, but, uh,

1577
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,180
yeah, and I just like do the graveyard shift.

1578
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,940
So 11 PM to seven in the morning.

1579
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,740
And you just wander around an abandoned building, wander around the abandoned

1580
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:23,860
building, just to, to what?

1581
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,940
Make sure homeless people don't sleep there.

1582
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:28,660
I mean, we don't even have homeless people in Hopedale, but, uh, what did

1583
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:33,220
anything ever happen that would there were the only thing you having been there?

1584
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:33,420
Okay.

1585
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:37,180
Well, the reason I'm tech, they call you a security guard.

1586
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:41,340
The reason I'm there is I'm babysitting the building because we go around the

1587
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:45,500
entire building and like, make sure the fire extinguishers are fine because

1588
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,020
there's the building isn't up to fire code.

1589
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:51,420
And so legally this guy has to have someone in there to use the fire

1590
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:55,740
extinguishers in case the building catches on fire, but we're neighbors with

1591
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,060
the head of the fire department.

1592
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:59,580
And he said, if you want to die, do your job.

1593
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,340
If you want to live, get the fuck out of that building.

1594
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,660
If it ever catches on fire.

1595
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:10,980
Well, so you've been doing this incredible, dangerous, dirty job.

1596
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,780
Does it pay over the table?

1597
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:14,860
Yeah.

1598
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:15,540
Okay.

1599
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:20,300
So, but it's just a shit job that you, that the guy can't be taken to task for it.

1600
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:20,580
Yeah.

1601
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:21,380
And he just owns.

1602
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,740
You were doing that for like over a year, right?

1603
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,380
Yeah, two years.

1604
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,500
Holy shit.

1605
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:26,940
But you kindly quit.

1606
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:27,700
Yeah.

1607
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,500
I figured whatever.

1608
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:31,340
I mean, you're not going to have a house in a month anyway.

1609
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,180
So fuck it.

1610
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:33,980
So, okay.

1611
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:40,580
I need to understand exactly the plan because I kind of like the idea that

1612
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,260
you're just going to try to live in your car and do art from there.

1613
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:45,460
What do you, what is the plan?

1614
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,820
Like, well, where are you taking the car first?

1615
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:48,580
Well, here's the thing.

1616
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,300
The thing is I have a couple options, apparently.

1617
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:57,220
I have a friend who might want to move in with me, but she's been very slow on

1618
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,260
the uptake on that.

1619
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,660
So I'm not really relying on that.

1620
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:06,180
But if I did that, I have to like be a normal person and get another real job.

1621
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,660
And like, I don't really technically want to do that.

1622
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,500
So that's like one of the options.

1623
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,980
The second option would be to buy a tiny house.

1624
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,100
Are they cheap?

1625
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:16,660
That cheap?

1626
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:17,820
They can be.

1627
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:18,380
Okay.

1628
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:19,060
Some of them are.

1629
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,020
Cause usually like a tiny house can be just like.

1630
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,660
Is a tiny house cheaper than a trailer?

1631
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,620
So you can just get a trailer.

1632
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:25,420
A trailer.

1633
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,140
Put yourself down.

1634
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:28,660
Yeah.

1635
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,700
I mean, I'm looking into options right now.

1636
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,260
Trailer is definitely one option.

1637
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:37,060
Tiny house is, I mean, a lot of tiny houses are just like houses built on a

1638
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:37,940
trailer bed anyway.

1639
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:39,820
So they're around the same size, but just a bit nicer.

1640
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:40,700
Okay.

1641
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:46,380
And then the other option is to convert a cargo van into a mini like apartment on

1642
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:46,940
wheels and drive.

1643
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,660
Are you aware of the YouTuber Noah called?

1644
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,540
Well, I told you about him.

1645
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:51,620
Okay.

1646
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:56,220
So this guy is a gaming YouTuber whose thing is that he does like two and a

1647
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:59,580
half hour long analysis videos of entire franchises.

1648
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:03,300
Like he'll, he'll do like dragon's age and then he'll go through all the

1649
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:07,100
dragon's age games and talk about all the storylines and compare everything and

1650
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,540
say like, here's what was good.

1651
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,380
Here's what was bad.

1652
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,820
And, uh, his audio is dog shit.

1653
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,660
He doesn't edit the audio at all.

1654
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,620
So you can hear him like wrestling with papers and fucking up lines.

1655
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,900
And, um, fucking stuttering.

1656
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,740
He's got a very dry voice.

1657
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,220
He barely edits the video.

1658
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:26,860
It's usually just like long gameplay footage, but just because of the fact

1659
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:32,620
that he talks about an entire game series all the way and talks about everything.

1660
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:36,260
And because of the fact that it's all PC games that have like fervent cult

1661
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:41,420
followings, he's got a huge Patreon, uh, not, not huge like mine, but like, you

1662
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:45,660
know, big enough to sustain himself on and he had been a pizza boy at the time.

1663
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:50,380
But he had this, he's like a huge into road novels, like obsessed with road novels.

1664
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:54,220
So he like refurbished a Volkswagen van for like three years.

1665
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:59,220
And now him and his wife like live out of the van and just travel the country.

1666
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:03,460
Do he just uploads YouTube videos from wherever and like subsist off of Patreon

1667
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:08,220
and like sort of him doing that was part of what inspired me to hit the road, you know,

1668
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,420
and be like, oh, shit, we can do this from anywhere.

1669
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:11,540
I gotta fucking the camera.

1670
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:13,060
Stop.

1671
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:17,380
When you told me you were going to be doing PS2 graphics out of the back of a car,

1672
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,420
I was like, hey, it's Noah Coldwell.

1673
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,340
Jervay is doing it.

1674
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,540
There's, there's a whole making as much as he is.

1675
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:25,780
There's a whole, uh, like culture of people doing that.

1676
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:29,180
Like I follow tons of YouTubers right now who are just traveling and just

1677
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:29,940
traveling doing that.

1678
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:33,180
Like the difference is that they do it because like they love living on the road.

1679
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,860
I'm doing it because I hate having a life.

1680
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,420
Have a house to go back to though.

1681
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,580
Noah Coldwell Jervay was just dirt poor.

1682
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:43,540
He like just sold off the house and all of their belongings and went into the

1683
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:44,420
Volkswagen van.

1684
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,140
Like that is the life now.

1685
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,460
There are people who do that.

1686
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,140
They just like, they live the van life.

1687
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,100
Like they've just decided.

1688
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,980
So I could live the RV life.

1689
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,620
I could not live the van life.

1690
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:58,940
The like Volkswagen van where the bed is like your body went from the ceiling.

1691
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,420
Yeah, that's pretty.

1692
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:01,900
It's it's cramped as fuck, dude.

1693
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,460
But I mean, I don't feel like I would be that much.

1694
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,980
You don't take up much space except as being like six foot.

1695
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:14,020
Yeah, but like in terms of, you know, your, your, your range of activity.

1696
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:14,220
Yeah.

1697
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,380
I mean, I would only sleep in the thing.

1698
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:17,020
Yeah.

1699
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,700
I've been planning on probably just like going to like coffee shops or whatever

1700
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:24,100
and get out and net cafes and just, I mean, I can do my work there.

1701
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:24,540
Yeah.

1702
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,620
So, but like a tiny house would be kind of the same idea.

1703
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:34,620
Um, I just, I don't, like it said, I can't even imagine like getting up at like

1704
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:38,980
six a.m. putting on like dress clothes, going into a cubicle.

1705
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:43,300
Like I would either like get a gun and either kill myself for everyone around

1706
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,980
me, because I mean, I've done that.

1707
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:51,420
I did an internship for my dad at Hanscom Air Force Base for like a summer

1708
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,460
and a winter and it paid good money.

1709
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:54,140
Yeah.

1710
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:55,060
I want to be clear.

1711
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:59,420
You like you are like, uh, first of all, how old are you?

1712
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,060
29.

1713
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,140
So you're 29.

1714
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:04,420
I think you're the, as you were Ben, the oldest Ben is the oldest by

1715
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,140
a couple of months.

1716
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:05,620
Okay.

1717
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:10,940
So you're sort of a battle hardened veteran of many life trials.

1718
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:15,380
Uh, I guess I don't feel like, I feel like my life's been pretty easy, which

1719
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:19,860
is, I mean, compared to, let me put it, I was telling Munchie about how I got

1720
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:22,900
fucked over on my job and he was like flabbergasted, but I'm just like, I don't

1721
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:23,060
know.

1722
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:28,740
Well, I mean, it's that you have, you've been to enough things that I wouldn't

1723
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,540
say that when you're, when you're saying, I can't even imagine myself at a

1724
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,940
normal job, it's like you, you've worked them.

1725
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:38,580
You're not just saying that cause like, I know there's a lot of people, like I

1726
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:41,700
like to say things like, oh, like I could never go back to work, but like, I

1727
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,300
didn't even really hate the one job I've ever had.

1728
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,580
And like, so I could probably do a normal job.

1729
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:51,180
Like I probably could not for long cause I'd be constantly scheming to quit.

1730
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:56,580
But like, um, you know, you are not just saying this out of nowhere.

1731
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:58,340
You've worked a bunch of places.

1732
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,220
I think you worked at a Whole Foods.

1733
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:00,580
I did.

1734
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:02,580
That was probably my longest stint.

1735
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:03,340
Yeah.

1736
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:08,660
Was I did like, I was, I have like this curse, like, except for this job, which

1737
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:12,940
was like, to make it clear, I was so bad even at this job that I probably

1738
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:15,340
should have been fired, but there was nobody else there to fire me.

1739
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:17,900
So it was impossible and nobody else would do that shift.

1740
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:21,140
So like, I, when I put in my notice, like a day before I came here, the guy

1741
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:24,860
was like, are you sure we can give you like two months off to like not be sick

1742
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:25,860
and dying anymore?

1743
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,940
And I'm just like, no, dude, I'm cool.

1744
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,340
They're just going to offer you months off.

1745
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:31,620
Yeah.

1746
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:34,340
They're just like, we can give you two months off if you need to like recover.

1747
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:38,180
And I'm just like, I'm okay because they know how bad, right?

1748
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,140
Because they know, they know that no one's going to take that slot before the

1749
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:45,780
winter even started, but the winter was bad to enjoy the summer.

1750
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:46,100
Okay.

1751
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:50,340
To, to tell you how bad it was, um, I can actually show you a photo after this

1752
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,940
to show you what the office ended up looking like.

1753
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:55,140
If you want to laugh your ass off, uh, I kept it for legal reasons.

1754
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:59,340
I figured if it was going to go down, I needed ammo, but, um, if anybody decides

1755
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:04,100
to class action this guy, so I think that's how that works.

1756
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:09,460
The, uh, the building for almost the entirety of the summer had no, for the

1757
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,100
entire, the winter had no heat anymore.

1758
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:12,020
The heat was broken.

1759
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,900
So, uh, even imagined that he would be involved.

1760
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,260
Yeah.

1761
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,780
So like, there was a picture of this place.

1762
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:18,780
It's not even like walls.

1763
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:22,260
There's like one little office where they kind of had heat, but the heat stopped

1764
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:22,820
working.

1765
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:23,180
Yeah.

1766
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:26,180
So it was just like, and then the whole building leaks.

1767
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:29,940
So every time it rains, the office floods, the entire building floods, but

1768
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,180
like the building never completely dries.

1769
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,940
So there's mold and mildew all through the whole place.

1770
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:35,940
Why is they keeping it up?

1771
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,460
Because they can't get rid of it.

1772
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,460
The problem is like the town's water supply runs under this building.

1773
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,460
So if they do anything to it, the entire water supply is fucked.

1774
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:44,580
Oh boy.

1775
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,060
And, and they're just stuck with the shitty building.

1776
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:47,180
Yeah.

1777
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:47,740
There's nothing.

1778
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:51,060
It's, it's just a relic of a lost age that can't be salvaged and can't be

1779
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:55,780
destroyed to, and this guy has to pay somebody to do this job.

1780
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:56,740
Legally.

1781
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:00,700
But he won't like take care of them because it's a worthless job.

1782
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:01,300
Exactly.

1783
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,220
Cause there's no, there's no money in it though.

1784
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:03,700
Yeah.

1785
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,740
He's just doing it to keep himself from getting sued.

1786
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:10,260
Actually, funny enough though, a lot of people out there have probably seen this

1787
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:13,820
building because if you've seen the movie, the surrogates.

1788
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:14,860
I have not.

1789
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:15,260
Okay.

1790
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:18,460
It's the, the movie of Bruce was based on a comic and indie comic, which was really

1791
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:18,700
good.

1792
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:25,300
There's a scene where they go to the slums and this movie had a multimillion

1793
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,020
dollar budget.

1794
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:31,860
They could have gone anywhere in the world to film the shithole of the movie.

1795
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,300
And where were they for about three weeks and everyone was freaking out because

1796
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:39,140
Bruce Willis was in Hopedale, Massachusetts in the building I worked at.

1797
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:43,780
So the slums of that movie is where I worked for two years.

1798
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,500
Look at the literal cyberpunk slum.

1799
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:45,780
Yeah.

1800
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,540
That's a cyberpunk movie, right?

1801
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:49,620
Sort of.

1802
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,580
I mean, it's, it's not like, so it's, it's kind of more like a general

1803
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,100
culture, sci-fi kind of.

1804
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:55,860
Yeah.

1805
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,020
I guess, I guess you could classify it as cyberpunk.

1806
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:00,060
It doesn't play the aesthetic very, very hard.

1807
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,420
It looks very kind of normal.

1808
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:03,340
It's still fucking hilarious.

1809
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:03,620
Yeah.

1810
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:04,260
That building.

1811
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,420
Every, but that was the whole thing.

1812
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:06,300
I was like stunned.

1813
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,580
Everyone's like, oh my God, Bruce Willis is here.

1814
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,460
It's just so amazing.

1815
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:13,460
I'm like, we, we're officially the shittiest place on the planet Earth.

1816
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:14,700
Like, do you understand?

1817
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,580
Like, like they could go anywhere.

1818
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,620
They could have filmed us in Africa if they wanted to.

1819
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,420
They came here.

1820
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:22,580
How many years was it between you saying that and then working there?

1821
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,620
Um, oh God, when did that movie come out?

1822
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:27,180
At least five years.

1823
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:27,820
It was a while.

1824
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,060
That's nuts.

1825
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:33,140
Well, yeah, go check out Tom's building in Syragates with Bruce Willis.

1826
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:36,660
I'm sure they CGI'd up a little bit, but they didn't go that far.

1827
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:37,140
Let me tell you.

1828
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,420
All right.

1829
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:44,580
Well, so do you think that your life's going to be better or worse once you're

1830
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,980
out of your parents' house?

1831
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:48,460
Better, for sure.

1832
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:52,340
So you think even though, even though you're going to be in, uh, like

1833
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,540
living possibly living out of a car, would you still say that was like better

1834
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:59,940
than nothing material things don't interest me, you know, like, like, I'm

1835
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:03,940
the person that if like I made like a million dollars a year, I wouldn't

1836
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:04,860
have a big house.

1837
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:10,860
Do you think that you are going to like in the, the, this, you sort of

1838
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,180
talked about like being liberated by this.

1839
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:18,260
Um, yeah, I think there's just a lot of like, because like the interesting

1840
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:21,660
thing is like you have moved around your entire life.

1841
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:22,140
Yeah.

1842
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:23,500
Constantly.

1843
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:29,060
I went to sixth grade right down the street from where I live right now.

1844
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:29,580
I see.

1845
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:33,220
My entire life has been this tiring, tiny little fucking.

1846
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:36,620
So you think that by escaping that you might open something up?

1847
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,100
I, yeah, definitely.

1848
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:39,820
I like it's imagine.

1849
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:43,380
It's weird when you drive to work and you pass by your high school.

1850
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:44,020
Yeah.

1851
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:44,860
At 29.

1852
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,620
Yeah, a little like that's super fucking.

1853
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:49,980
That's why I like literally it's funny.

1854
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:54,620
You say that because like, you know, I moved to my, my girlfriend's town, like

1855
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:57,540
with the intention of getting her out of there and like we pass all of her

1856
01:27:57,540 --> 01:28:00,940
schools all the time and she's just like, this is why we can't be here anymore.

1857
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:03,460
Cause every time I see that high school, I want to burn it down.

1858
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:04,900
So you need to get me away from it.

1859
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:08,980
So, but yeah, I do think that'll help.

1860
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:17,180
Um, obviously this, just the fact that you are, um, considering the

1861
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:20,300
possibility that would be even better of a lifestyle, doesn't mean people

1862
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:23,020
should give you any less money or that you don't need help.

1863
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:26,780
Um, I mean, I, I mentioned in the wine chamber that I want people, I don't

1864
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:30,860
want people to give me money because they think like they, they are being a charity

1865
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:31,300
case.

1866
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:34,220
I want to make work that people think is worth paying for.

1867
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:38,620
So you, you want to make sure that people know that like if Patreon.com slash

1868
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:42,540
save me is not about Tom needs the money.

1869
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:43,980
It's not even safe anymore.

1870
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:46,140
I changed it to slash Polystation too.

1871
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:49,900
Cause I didn't, I didn't want to be, I think the joke kind of outlived itself at

1872
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,460
this point.

1873
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:57,260
Um, I think it's just the kind of meme that when you push it entirely yourself,

1874
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:58,860
people aren't as receptive to it.

1875
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,300
Yeah.

1876
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:03,660
Like Patreon.com slash Ben St took off, I think more because other people were

1877
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:10,620
like, like propping it up more than, uh, than him himself or not more so, but

1878
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:15,820
like as much, um, your meme was too forced.

1879
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,860
Unfortunately, I'm not good at comedy.

1880
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,100
I, I don't think you're like bad at comedy.

1881
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:26,020
I'm, I'm bad at like, I can do like off the cuff reactionary comedy, but I can't

1882
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:27,420
like sit down and script a joke.

1883
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:31,780
You're better at reacting to someone else's thing and piling onto it.

1884
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:36,500
I would say like on PCP, that's your funniest shit is like quips, like response

1885
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:43,420
quips that come out like, you know, exactly.

1886
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:44,660
But, uh,

1887
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:51,220
wrote that point of the interview with a quick draw word play, and I'm trying

1888
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,740
to like remember what questions I need to ask you.

1889
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:55,740
Like, what do I need to know about Tom?

1890
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:58,340
Um, or do people need to know about Tom?

1891
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,620
Um, okay.

1892
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:03,540
So right now you consider yourself mostly a 3D graphic artist.

1893
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:03,980
Yeah.

1894
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:07,940
I mean, ever since I got a watch, we are the strange, like it's something

1895
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,340
it's always been in the back of my mind.

1896
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:10,380
Like this is kind of cool.

1897
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:15,220
And I always thought conceptually it would be a good move to make because

1898
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:18,620
like the hardest thing for me to do with drawing is, uh, foreshortening.

1899
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:24,500
Like, like drawing anything in perspective is just like, uh, like that sort of shit.

1900
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:29,020
It's just like, yeah, yeah, that specifically that that pose.

1901
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:29,780
Exactly.

1902
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:34,580
Um, so, so I've always been like, well, 3D, like that's all done for you.

1903
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,100
Cause that's like the entire nature of it.

1904
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:39,260
Like the extra, the seeds mentioned, it's not like that, right?

1905
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:43,220
Well, I mean, it, it, it is essentially cause you don't, you make the model

1906
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,300
and then you, the camera does all the foreshortening.

1907
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:49,700
But you can't do like, you can't do certain things that you think you can.

1908
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,260
Like that would be possible in 2D.

1909
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:51,660
Yeah.

1910
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:55,140
I mean, you can't like do like, cause like a lot of the crazy foreshortening

1911
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:56,860
stuff is like breaking perspective.

1912
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:59,780
You can, you can like, fudge it for sure.

1913
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:02,340
And you can like change camera settings and stuff to kind of get like a crazy

1914
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:05,100
dramatic kind of depth of field sort of thing.

1915
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:10,380
But just in terms of just like, if I wanted to draw a person from an angle,

1916
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:13,340
even if it's not like crazy foreshortening, like it's difficult for me,

1917
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,780
but like 3D, you just do it.

1918
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,460
So like it makes up for a weakness of mine.

1919
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:21,260
Like I think just doing the 3D that I've done, like this is more how my

1920
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:23,060
brain thinks of like objects.

1921
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:23,660
Yeah.

1922
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:29,300
Cause like you, you don't so much want to have to like, uh, draw the entire character

1923
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:32,340
every time you just want to put the character in the goddamn environment

1924
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:33,780
basically and like pose them.

1925
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:37,740
And like, I think if you don't really need your care, like you tend to draw

1926
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:39,500
your characters pretty consistently.

1927
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:43,580
They're not like extremely expressive where they're going to be changing

1928
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:46,100
expressions wildly from page to page or anything like that.

1929
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:49,060
Like it's safe for them to just be models that could be posed enough.

1930
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:53,380
And especially in like a fantasy story where, you know, like the facial

1931
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,100
expressions are not driving the story.

1932
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:55,380
Yeah.

1933
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:59,300
It's not like, not like tech savory cartoons or anything like that.

1934
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:00,900
It's pretty restrained.

1935
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,740
Um, so it just, it works out really well.

1936
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:07,860
And like, I've always loved that like low poly PS two kind of look.

1937
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:08,340
Yeah.

1938
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:09,300
I grew up with it.

1939
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:13,220
I mean, I don't think, I think, I think doing low poly is probably going to

1940
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:17,740
limit the, the reach of anything I do because I think most people, I think

1941
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:20,180
there's nostalgia for like eight bit.

1942
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,700
There's nostalgia for like that PS one kind of thing.

1943
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:23,460
It's coming.

1944
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:28,380
That the PS tune, cause the thing is that, uh, you know, you're 29, you're not

1945
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:31,980
old enough to, to be nostalgia baiting yet.

1946
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:32,660
Really.

1947
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:33,860
You know, it's possible.

1948
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:35,340
I'm just too ahead of the curve right now.

1949
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:35,700
Okay.

1950
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:38,780
Cause I did not grow up with any eight or 16 big games.

1951
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:40,460
So I have no nostalgia for that shit.

1952
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:45,100
Like for me, my era of playing those games is mostly the fucking on steam.

1953
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,860
Like someone like Munchy, that motherfucker was born in 2000.

1954
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:53,460
Like his first console is probably the fucking we, it was, you know, so like disgusting.

1955
01:32:54,340 --> 01:33:01,580
So for someone like him, you know, he'll be nostalgic for like Minecraft, you know,

1956
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:05,060
which I mean Minecraft looks dated anyways, but he'll be nostalgic for it

1957
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:07,740
because that was the, the zeitgeist of the time.

1958
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,980
And I think that, you know, I mean, obviously you got Hippo who's

1959
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:15,020
constantly talking about how like the PS two was the best era for graphics, you

1960
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:18,100
know, like that's his whole fucking channel's identity.

1961
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,980
It's like PS two is the only graphics I ever want to see.

1962
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,780
So when you come out with Polystation two, it's like this, there's your target

1963
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:28,220
audience is right there to give me like all this patron money and that'll be fine.

1964
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:34,580
But, uh, do you have any concerns about the idea of trying to do a fantasy story

1965
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:35,380
in CG?

1966
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:38,220
Cause I've always felt that like one of the biggest problems I have with the

1967
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:43,900
Berserk movies was that like, I thought that the extremely like wispy,

1968
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:47,660
fanciful art of the manga did not really translate to anime.

1969
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:51,500
But since you're not really adapting this from a source material, I think, I

1970
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:58,020
mean, I really like one of, one of the, I really liked the, the PS

1971
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:04,580
two JRPG, something like, like a Dragon Quest eight fuzzy piece in this night.

1972
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,180
You didn't get it.

1973
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:06,060
Oh God.

1974
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:07,060
Where is it?

1975
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,220
It's not very evident.

1976
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,220
So it's hard to, oh, God, we got a mirror.

1977
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:14,260
Herpaderb.

1978
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:14,540
Yeah.

1979
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:18,420
Um, I think because it's not an adaptation, like a building the

1980
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:21,900
aesthetic from the ground up, I think it will probably be okay.

1981
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:26,140
I'll definitely be like making sure that it doesn't become too ugly or anything.

1982
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:29,340
How did you translate your drawing style into 3D?

1983
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:33,020
Cause you've done your 3D art looks just like your 2D art.

1984
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:37,380
The only big concession I had to make was like making the eyes a little bit

1985
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:40,380
smaller and there were ways I could have gotten around that.

1986
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:44,820
But the thing is like I'm doing everything super low poly and like the

1987
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:48,780
eye socket in the model has eight points to define it.

1988
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:51,900
So when I stretch it to that big, it looks basically like a really ugly

1989
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:53,580
octagon and it doesn't look right.

1990
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:55,820
But when you have a smaller sort of eye, it kind of reads more

1991
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:56,420
smoothly.

1992
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:56,900
I see.

1993
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:00,900
Um, I could have done it as a texture, but I wanted to give it that flexibility

1994
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,500
because the way I do all the expression is something called shape keys.

1995
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:06,660
So like you have the basis of the face, just kind of neutral.

1996
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,780
And then you make a new key and then you pull the point.

1997
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,060
So it looks more like an expression.

1998
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:14,220
Then you have a slider that kind of transitions between those two.

1999
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,740
That's how the face morphs from one expression to another.

2000
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:17,380
Okay.

2001
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:22,300
So you can make the faces move and everything like in real time in your comic.

2002
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,340
Um, that's cool.

2003
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,380
I don't know why I'm like impressed with that.

2004
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:30,540
Like that's not normal, but I mean, I was like, whoa, you can make their mouths

2005
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:33,780
move like for in my mind that I was like reacting that strong.

2006
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:37,500
I got like a thing of false, like going through a couple of different expression

2007
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,940
loops on, on Instagram came out pretty good.

2008
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:44,620
So fuck, I forgot how I wanted to phrase this.

2009
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:48,460
So yeah, your art style is so particular.

2010
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:51,860
How much of that is like, you have to draw that way and how much of it is

2011
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:52,980
you want to draw that way?

2012
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:57,100
You know, it's interesting because now that I'm doing 3d and I feel so much

2013
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:00,580
more comfortable with it, like a lot of that was just like, this is just how

2014
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:04,940
it's coming out, but like I'm doing a couple of models right now that they're

2015
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,260
not like super different.

2016
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:10,860
Cause like I did the thing, the way the 3d like work throw works is that you

2017
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:12,020
work off a reference image.

2018
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:15,220
So you get like a front and a side view and then you kind of model from both

2019
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,860
angles and it makes a 3d version of it.

2020
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:22,220
And like the techniques I could apply to anything, like I could get like, you

2021
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:25,780
know, anybody's art of a front and side view and I could reconstruct it.

2022
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:26,020
Right.

2023
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:29,740
Um, but I'm making sure like I'm doing like Bayonetta right now is like the

2024
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:31,100
next big model I'm working on.

2025
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:34,220
I could just gotten like a, you know, from the design Bible for Bayonetta

2026
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:37,340
modeled off that, but like I redrew it myself because I wanted it to be my

2027
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:39,260
proportions and my kind of art style.

2028
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:44,300
So there's definitely like, um, I'm doing that because I feel like that's my

2029
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:45,900
identity and I like it.

2030
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:49,900
Um, cause I don't want to just like turn into like, I don't want it to

2031
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:54,100
become just technical of just like, yo, I can like recreate other people's stuff.

2032
01:36:54,220 --> 01:37:00,420
Do you think that your, um, like art style is going to radically shift as you

2033
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:04,860
one of the, one of the big things that is coming right now is I'm going to start

2034
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,060
using way more color.

2035
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:09,340
I've, I've been super big into black and white forever.

2036
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:09,780
Yeah.

2037
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:13,900
Your aesthetic has always been very, my big push now, cause like what I really

2038
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:17,500
love about 3ds, I love that like that low poly like hand painted like world of

2039
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,780
warcraft is so fucking gorgeous.

2040
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:20,500
It's fucking great.

2041
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:24,860
So I'm starting to, oh, if you, dude, if you can create some, like I, your

2042
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:26,500
art style is pretty close to that.

2043
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:30,220
Like your Trixie pub is very world of warcraft ish.

2044
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:33,260
Anybody who doesn't know we're talking about, there was a Trixie comic.

2045
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:37,820
We were talking about it before the camera died that, um, that you had made

2046
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:43,260
this like towards the tail end of doing like, basically you quit the pony YouTube

2047
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:46,740
shit and then we're like, I'm going to do this comic and then you worked on it for

2048
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:49,420
a couple of months and then it switched over to sorceress loss.

2049
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:54,500
I guess because I was saying in the other video, it's just like the, I wanted, I

2050
01:37:54,500 --> 01:38:00,060
had like this autistic obsession with keeping all my fan content, like non

2051
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,940
conflicting with Canon and then like they shotgun ruined a bunch of ideas that

2052
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:04,580
were going to happen.

2053
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,300
Like the whole story of the Trixie arc, she was going to go into the every

2054
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,380
forest and find like, like all this crazy shit.

2055
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:12,060
Then they like retcon like, oh, we're just in the Everfree and we figured out

2056
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,060
all that shit and what it is.

2057
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:14,860
I'm like, well, that whole story is just torpedoed.

2058
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,980
So I was just like, well, all the passion died with that.

2059
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,500
And then like the more stuff I did, like the more I like, kind of like we're

2060
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,740
sort of tweaking little things.

2061
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:25,980
Like I wanted to like Celestine Luna to be made way more like gods and stuff.

2062
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:28,020
Cause like I thought that was like a cool idea from the first season that

2063
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:30,100
they totally fucked up after that.

2064
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:32,900
So then I was like, why don't I just make my own thing where like there are

2065
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:35,340
gods and they are gods and they do God shit.

2066
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:35,740
Yeah.

2067
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:36,780
So like that's what it is.

2068
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:40,300
There's like 13 big countries and they all ruled by a God and they all have

2069
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:41,340
different cultures and stuff.

2070
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:44,620
And like, so it just, I just started running with it and like it came,

2071
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:45,540
it became way better.

2072
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:46,180
Yeah.

2073
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:50,420
So, um, I don't know if this is the same technique that you use for the

2074
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:54,180
motion comic and sorceress loss, but in the Trixie comic, while it was a two

2075
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:59,100
dimensional comic, all the backgrounds were 3D environments you created that so

2076
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,700
that you could just, you know, put a character against an environment and

2077
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,460
from whatever angle and just shoot it easily.

2078
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:08,620
Again, you're much more into just having the elements rather than having to draw

2079
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:11,740
them 2000 times differently.

2080
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:18,220
But the pub is very World of Warcraft looking now that you've mentioned it.

2081
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:23,500
And I think if you could nail that, like not just, just World of Warcraft, but

2082
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,900
if you could nail an aesthetic like that, I do think people would be really

2083
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:26,700
attracted to that.

2084
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:30,260
Well, I found out, well, I knew about it, but I learned how to start doing it.

2085
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:35,300
Like the FOSS model, like I did, I, all of that was painted directly on the

2086
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,500
model because there's a way of doing it.

2087
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:39,580
But usually like you unwrap a model, like you put seams in it and you flatten

2088
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:42,940
it out like a papercraft doll and then you like kind of like texture it on the

2089
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:43,660
flatten thing.

2090
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:46,980
And then when you put it back, it wraps around, but like blender has a thing

2091
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:50,820
where you can just take a brush and just draw right on the model on the screen.

2092
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,940
So you can get a lot more subtlety going on there.

2093
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:56,140
Cause like you don't have to like kind of like think abstract, like how will this

2094
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:57,380
look when it's wrapped back up?

2095
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,260
Yeah, you just like draw right on it.

2096
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:00,980
And like I'm just painting.

2097
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:04,060
I just painted the whole thing and it looked really nice.

2098
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:07,500
And like I've never really done much with color, but I'm going to try

2099
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,580
experimenting with that.

2100
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:11,580
Probably a lot faster than building a whole texture to wrap around.

2101
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:11,900
Right.

2102
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:12,140
Yeah.

2103
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:15,060
I mean, yeah, it's more, it's faster cause it's more intuitive.

2104
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:18,500
Like you don't have to like think like, okay, like part of the foot's over there.

2105
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:19,660
Part of the arms up here.

2106
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:20,900
How am I going to make them mesh together?

2107
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,220
You just, just draw.

2108
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:23,580
It's much more natural.

2109
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:28,300
Um, so that's, that's really exciting, but I'm doing a lot of experiments with that.

2110
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:32,180
Like one of the first things I did actually, I did like a 3D reconstruction of

2111
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:36,540
the first room from Undertale and Frisk and that was all hand painted too.

2112
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:38,100
That looked pretty cool.

2113
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,860
So I'm just like, yeah, yeah, it's going to be dope.

2114
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:41,180
All right.

2115
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,620
Let's take a short break.

2116
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,740
Cause I got a piss and get another drink and we'll come right back.

2117
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:47,300
I don't know, dude.

2118
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:53,580
All right, Tom, we've asked you about your influences, your art, your plans for the

2119
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,060
future.

2120
01:40:54,060 --> 01:41:00,380
Do you, would you say that you currently see yourself as having like, uh, are you

2121
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:05,420
living project to project or is there something like is, or would you say that,

2122
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:07,780
uh, you're more focused on the big project?

2123
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:13,580
Uh, in terms of like, like art, art project wise, like, uh, I find myself, if

2124
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:17,220
I'm working on a big thing, then it's like, that's what I'm doing.

2125
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:20,860
And like, there's other things that come out, but the big thing is the important

2126
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:25,940
thing and other times it's just like, uh, well, it's a new week.

2127
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,300
What am I going to make next?

2128
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:27,660
Yeah.

2129
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:32,340
Well, my problem is that I flip flop constantly between like, should I run

2130
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:37,060
myself as a business or should I be an artist that's like destined to kill

2131
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:38,180
myself or something?

2132
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:42,940
Cause, cause like so hard, like business wise, business wise, I should be like

2133
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:45,860
just pumping out more fan art, trying to get my name out there, build a

2134
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:47,740
personal brand and like build an audience.

2135
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:50,460
So like when I said, oh, I'm going to start doing original work, like I have

2136
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:53,780
like a thousand dollars a month based on my art and like a huge following to

2137
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:54,740
actually support it.

2138
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:59,020
Uh, but the artist in me is just like, fuck that, that stuff's never going to

2139
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,020
take off because your passion isn't in there.

2140
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:04,060
You should just like let your passion shine through on like something you're

2141
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:07,540
actually super fucking invested in, even if it's like a smaller thing.

2142
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:09,300
I mean, I think that's the way to go.

2143
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:14,940
But I mean, I'm one to talk cause I, I, your, your, your passion

2144
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:17,660
happens to be insanely like marketable.

2145
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:25,740
I, you know, not anymore because like I, I found myself, we can't, we

2146
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:28,380
can't control the audience that, that props us up.

2147
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:29,300
Unfortunately.

2148
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:29,980
Yeah.

2149
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:32,780
I mean, it's just a simple matter of that.

2150
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:38,820
I was more willing to, not even that I'm more willing to, but like less ambitious.

2151
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:43,940
It's like the more ambitious you are, the harder it's going to be because, um,

2152
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:48,340
if you want to communicate a really complicated idea, then you probably

2153
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,220
can't do that in a simplistic way.

2154
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:54,980
I don't know, like it's not, you can't just sit down in front of a video and

2155
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:59,540
explain the entire plot of sorceress lost and have people care about sorceress

2156
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:04,660
lost, you know, um, on some level, they might be interested in it, but cause

2157
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:06,380
yeah, I've done that before.

2158
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:09,220
I've been like, Hey, here's the plot of some novel I've got an idea for.

2159
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:12,900
And people are like, wow, I'd love to see that, you know, but while you're not

2160
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:17,180
getting it cause it's just an idea, um, feel free to steal it.

2161
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:21,860
So you're just kind of bouncing between those two streams all the time.

2162
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:26,340
It's, it's, it's complicated because like ideally in a perfect world, like I

2163
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:30,340
wouldn't have financial obligations, you know, cause it's even the problem is

2164
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:34,580
like, even if I like drop off the face of the earth and live in a, in a van, I

2165
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:35,540
still have student debt.

2166
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:39,300
So I'm going to have to defer on all of that to actually like make it work.

2167
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:41,980
What does that do?

2168
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:45,540
Uh, you basically just like, I can get like a deferment.

2169
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:48,740
So it's still gaining interest, but you're not required to pay it back at that point.

2170
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:54,620
So you're just basically like, owing more money so you don't have to pay it right

2171
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:55,140
now.

2172
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:56,020
Okay.

2173
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:58,020
But in the future, you will have to pay it.

2174
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:58,340
Right.

2175
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:03,180
So you just got to try to make a big thing right now before you got to pay my only

2176
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:07,340
scheme, but Trump, Trump's America seems to be on its way to ruining it is that

2177
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:10,300
they have a thing right now where if you're poor for 15 years, they'll forgive

2178
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:11,140
your federal loans.

2179
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:12,740
I'm like halfway through that right now.

2180
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:13,380
Oh yeah.

2181
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,900
And, uh, and if Trump has his way, that's going to go away.

2182
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:19,860
And then I'm going to go fucking shoot up the White House cause fuck you, you

2183
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,620
ruined my long game here, you dick.

2184
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:25,700
So for what it's worth, that was satire.

2185
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:26,060
Yeah.

2186
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:26,380
Yeah.

2187
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:26,700
Yeah.

2188
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:29,460
I heard that the secret service shows up at your house.

2189
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:33,580
I mean, half the secret service would support me if I did that at this point.

2190
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:37,460
Um, yeah, I don't know.

2191
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:40,900
It's just, I would like to just do that.

2192
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,260
Just like focus on that one thing.

2193
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:45,260
Cause like I'm someone who's like really just unit task minded.

2194
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:49,700
Like I can't, like I had a schedule for a while where I'd like on this day, I'll

2195
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:50,420
do this project.

2196
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:52,860
And I'll just see all this project and I just end up doing nothing cause my

2197
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:54,020
brain was too scattered.

2198
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:57,820
Like what I'm doing right now, which is working a little bit better is that like

2199
01:44:57,860 --> 01:45:00,700
I'm just going to do this one thing until it's done and move on to the next

2200
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:01,580
thing until that's done.

2201
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:01,940
Yeah.

2202
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:07,260
And I just, I don't know, simple, simple, just like doing this and it makes it

2203
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:08,820
better to get done.

2204
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:18,540
Um, what do you think is the current, like, uh, let's say six months from now,

2205
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:21,340
what do you think your content is going to look like?

2206
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:23,460
Like what can people expect?

2207
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:27,980
Cause like for me, um, one of the harder things about following you as a content

2208
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:30,100
creator is that you've changed gears so many times.

2209
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:33,060
I never know if you're planning to stay there.

2210
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:33,500
Right.

2211
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,340
No, it's, it's bad.

2212
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:38,020
Like my personal brand's a mess, which was the name of that last wine chamber.

2213
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:39,780
My personal brand's a mess, but it's not pity.

2214
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:45,380
Uh, yeah, I need to just like really, that's why I wanted to get, take the, get

2215
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:46,980
off work and take these next couple of months.

2216
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:48,780
Like really just like hammer away a game plan.

2217
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:52,500
Like the, the biggest, like fucking breakthrough of like the last 10 years has

2218
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:57,220
been like, I enjoy making art and not just the finest finished product, which

2219
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,180
has never happened.

2220
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:02,380
Like it's, it's like the fucking craziest, God damn shit.

2221
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:05,220
Cause you were saying like, Oh, you just like look for all these shortcuts.

2222
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:07,180
The shortcuts were because I hated doing it.

2223
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:07,820
Yeah.

2224
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:12,940
Now that's, I mean, that's the thing is that if you try to work in a medium that

2225
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:17,500
you don't enjoy doing the thing, then it's always going to fail.

2226
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:19,780
And the interesting thing is fucking sucks.

2227
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:25,660
I'd done it for so long that I thought it was just cause I was lazy, but I'm not.

2228
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:29,940
I mean, I am lazy, but that's the hardest part is that like there, everybody,

2229
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:31,420
everybody's lazy about doing shit.

2230
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:35,780
They don't want to do, you know, and like for me, when I wanted to be an

2231
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:39,140
author or a filmmaker and all that stuff, like I didn't realize that when I was

2232
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:41,580
a teenager, like there was a solid year and a half.

2233
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:44,540
I wanted to be a filmmaker and I never made any fucking films.

2234
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:47,740
And at the end of that, I had to go, well, clearly I'm not a fucking filmmaker

2235
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:50,700
cause I had all the time and opportunities and like, I just didn't do it.

2236
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:55,940
So meanwhile, like anime blogging was just happening naturally, you know, and I feel

2237
01:46:55,940 --> 01:47:01,300
like if you can find something that you just enjoy doing it and there's any way

2238
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:03,860
it could be marketable, it's worth exploring.

2239
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:08,620
And if it's not marketable, well, you got a fun hobby making fucking PS2.

2240
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:11,220
Well, that's like kind of why I want to take these

2241
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:14,500
couple of months because like I have no, I'll have no responsibility, nothing else.

2242
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:18,380
So if I can't do it in this situation, there's no way it's going to happen when

2243
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:19,540
other things are added on top.

2244
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:21,540
If you can't bust your own ass.

2245
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:26,420
I mean, they always say that like having the rug pulled out from under you is a

2246
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:29,380
good way to hit the ground running.

2247
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:33,220
I don't know if anybody's ever like premeditated that to the extent that this is

2248
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:39,540
though, but I mean, the whole thing is just like, I just, I can't.

2249
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:43,740
It's really, I fantasized about the things that's happening to you have happening

2250
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:45,580
to me back when I was a teenager.

2251
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:49,940
Like I wanted to run away and thought like, oh, if I like, if I have to bust

2252
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:55,140
my ass, I'll work, you know, but I never did, obviously.

2253
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:56,820
But I'm real curious if it'll.

2254
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:02,220
Yeah, I mean, ideally, like if I could get myself into one thing that I'm slowly

2255
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:05,700
like trying to do is like delegation and like trying to like, I want to work

2256
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:09,300
with other people because like I said earlier, like I bust my ass way harder

2257
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,660
like working for a PCP than I do for myself.

2258
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:17,420
Like I would not, I would not sit down and make a hundred t-shirts for myself.

2259
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:20,980
Like I'll do it for PCP because it's a bigger thing that I believe in outside.

2260
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:24,860
But if I like doing like Polystation to branded shirts, I'm like, just go on

2261
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:25,700
red bubble, pay double.

2262
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:26,380
I don't give a fuck.

2263
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:26,700
Yeah.

2264
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:30,180
It also can be really, it can be way easier to just riff off of someone else's

2265
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:35,580
thing, you know, like it's easier to come up with ideas if it's like someone has

2266
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:39,060
already set up the baseline and you're just like riffing off of that baseline.

2267
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:41,940
It's not even like, like the, the idea part.

2268
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:47,700
It's because I, when I think of myself and my work, it's just me.

2269
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:52,780
And so like, because I don't think too highly of myself yet, I can't get too

2270
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:56,620
excited about it, but like when I work with PCP or just with anybody else,

2271
01:48:56,620 --> 01:49:00,780
like I remember I did a project with my buddy, like right after college.

2272
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:03,940
And like we both busted our ass for a week because like, and I worked hard

2273
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:07,660
because it was like, this isn't just me, like it's something bigger than me now.

2274
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:11,380
I'm working towards something larger than just like my like, you know,

2275
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:12,980
artistic masturbation.

2276
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:16,860
Do you think you're okay with like a life where it was never like, oh,

2277
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:18,260
I did it all by myself?

2278
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,660
Well, that was a, that was something I'm letting go of.

2279
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:22,100
I was super obsessed with that.

2280
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:26,260
Like I wouldn't want, like I'd rather do this bad than myself and get it done.

2281
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:26,500
Right.

2282
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:30,060
But now I'm just like, it's been 10 years of that and nothing's been done.

2283
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:32,580
So like now I'm just like, I'd rather have something done than something not done.

2284
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:32,940
Right.

2285
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:39,980
I met at the point now where like, I continually hire the DeVoo because even

2286
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:42,420
though I've been getting better as an editor, so has he.

2287
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:47,540
And it's like, you know, that, that's the kind of delegation where at the time

2288
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:50,580
that I hired him, everyone in the PCP was terrified of hiring editors

2289
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:53,620
because we were all like, oh, I want to have, I want it to all be my personal

2290
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,860
mark. It has to be me, me, me.

2291
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:56,660
It has to be like my perfect vision.

2292
01:49:56,940 --> 01:50:00,100
But then I just found a guy who kind of understood my vision.

2293
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:02,780
But at the time I was writing stuff that's nowhere near as advanced as

2294
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:05,580
like what Jesse was doing where Jesse was like, oh, I can't hire an editor

2295
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:07,340
because like he won't understand my vision.

2296
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:10,220
And I'm like, well, yeah, you're doing like a really complicated thing,

2297
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,740
which is more fun to edit anyways.

2298
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:16,940
Like ironically, it's more fun to edit something that forces you to be creative

2299
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:18,060
and think about it.

2300
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:24,500
But because of the fact that DeVoo's been editing for me for so long that now

2301
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:27,580
if I do want to give him something more advanced, that's like, oh, this is more

2302
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:29,060
of my personal vision thing.

2303
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:34,140
Like he can, he can deliver on my vision better than I can because I can

2304
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:36,660
just describe it to him and he'll show me something and I'll be like, well,

2305
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,660
that's way cooler than how I had imagined it.

2306
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:41,140
You know, I mean, that's, that's like the advice they give you.

2307
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,860
You want to hire people better than yourself.

2308
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:44,980
And like that's what I want to do.

2309
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:47,460
Like it really starts with just being honest.

2310
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:51,500
Like I would love like my ideal situation.

2311
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:55,900
I'd love to do something like, like Ruby where like I'm like the creative

2312
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,860
director and I'm doing, like I want to still be in the trenches and like doing

2313
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,500
a lot of the modeling and like doing story.

2314
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:04,220
Ruby right there is proof that that brand of PS2 model is popular.

2315
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:06,140
Especially it's low poly as fuck, right?

2316
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:10,220
The newer ones have gotten better, but the initial ones, they were pretty rough.

2317
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:12,740
And like, I remember watching like the first, I just watched Ruby a little

2318
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:15,940
while ago and I was like, oh my God, this is aesthetics on point.

2319
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:18,660
And then they changed to my, I was like, oh, it's looks so modern.

2320
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:19,740
What happened?

2321
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:24,860
I definitely can say I like your models more than the Ruby models.

2322
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:27,620
Well, the Ruby models were like, what, like 10 years ago or something

2323
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:28,540
like that at this point.

2324
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:29,820
Shit.

2325
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:32,380
Um, okay.

2326
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:39,580
Uh, well, now I want to ask you some more philosophical questions, I guess.

2327
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,060
Okay.

2328
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:44,260
Uh, like, you know, how do you see the world?

2329
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:46,820
How is the world right now?

2330
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:47,860
How are things?

2331
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:48,700
Okay.

2332
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:54,580
Um, like in terms of just society, how do you think is going things going in

2333
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:57,300
a direction that you, uh, that is good.

2334
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:58,460
Well, okay.

2335
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:01,860
I don't think the reaction things are going is like necessarily good for anybody,

2336
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:07,780
but like, have you felt yourself like burdened with the, the, the foibles of

2337
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:11,140
modern society much, or are you more just like concerned about your shit?

2338
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:17,820
Um, I'm kind of like torn on this because like there's, there's, I definitely

2339
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:22,380
feel like, I think I brought this up on a PCP episode once where I was saying how

2340
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:26,860
like, because of social media and like the internet and stuff, like.

2341
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:32,020
Our, our like, uh, scale in which we can judge our personal ability has

2342
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:34,020
like been expanded like a thousand fold.

2343
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:37,220
You know, that's kind of what I adjusted at the start of that deer artist

2344
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:41,500
video is like, there's so many people online who legitimately deserve to be

2345
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,820
famous and you're competing with all of them.

2346
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:44,100
Right.

2347
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:48,420
Like all of us, if we were just like new, like the people in our city, we'd all

2348
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:53,340
be like the 99th percentile of what we do, but the problem is we're online and

2349
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:57,020
it's like, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of you're, you're in the biggest pond.

2350
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:01,780
Like, I mean, you can be within a sub pond of like, Oh, I'm the biggest pony guy

2351
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:03,740
or I'm the biggest anime guy or whatever.

2352
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:08,420
But like, you know, you're still a small fish in the YouTube pond of guys with

2353
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:09,740
millions of subscribers.

2354
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:13,900
So, I mean, it's the same thing with art or anything else.

2355
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:19,500
Any, any niche, like you're just, you're competing on, on like a global level.

2356
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:25,940
And the problem is because all the cream rises to the crop, the top 1% feels

2357
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:26,740
like normal.

2358
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:29,900
And so when you're not the top 1%, you feel inadequate when you really

2359
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:30,620
shouldn't be.

2360
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:36,020
No, I mean, like, yeah, you're constantly looking at shit that's better than yours.

2361
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:37,260
Yeah, like you can't help it.

2362
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:41,940
But like for me, the way that I process that information is, I have to get as

2363
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:42,900
good as that guy.

2364
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:43,460
Right.

2365
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,060
How do you feel when you see that stuff?

2366
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:49,620
Well, it's interesting because up until I started doing 3D, I would feel

2367
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:51,500
miserable, but now I just get jazzed.

2368
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:53,340
Like, this is fucking dope.

2369
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:57,300
And for some, I guess it's just like a mindset change of just like, I feel

2370
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:59,620
like this medium is within my grasp.

2371
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:04,460
Like I could do that with enough application of effort, whereas with drawing

2372
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:06,940
and stuff, it never felt like I would, would get there.

2373
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:07,620
Yeah.

2374
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:12,420
So it's definitely been a big project can get done within a timely enough fashion

2375
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:16,420
that they will make sense and be like positive experiences to have worked on.

2376
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:17,460
I mean, I don't know.

2377
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:21,100
I, the big mystery for me is always like the marketing aspect because I feel

2378
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:24,860
like despite all the best practices and stuff, there's always a degree of luck.

2379
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:28,140
Like because that aspect, you can't control it.

2380
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:30,220
Like I can't control people coming to me.

2381
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:32,180
I can't control you liking what I do.

2382
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:37,580
And I mean, I think there's also a strong element though of like, uh, you, you

2383
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:40,340
can't, you might not be able to make them drink, but you can lead the horse to

2384
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:44,180
water at the very least by like just making people understand.

2385
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:47,860
Like I think when people talk about having a personal narrative online and

2386
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:53,180
everything, like this has been construed as like be a vlogger and be a fun

2387
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:54,060
online persona.

2388
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:57,420
But I think the main thing people just want to know is like, why do you care

2389
01:54:57,420 --> 01:54:59,220
so much about this goddamn thing?

2390
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:02,140
Well, there's a, there's a, it's a great, I think we had to talk about this.

2391
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:06,140
I told you about Simon Sinek when he says people, people buy why you do things,

2392
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:06,820
not what you do.

2393
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:07,300
Yeah.

2394
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:08,220
It's so true.

2395
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:09,620
It's, it is definitely.

2396
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:14,900
I mean, especially for me, like a lot of my audience is about the why of like

2397
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:19,380
and that's something I really kind of want to get more into on Polystation

2398
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:22,340
too, which is kind of the reason why I kind of think maybe pivoting away from

2399
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:22,780
fan art.

2400
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:25,780
Cause like if I, I think that if I did an impassioned rant or something,

2401
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:29,780
I mean, like how, why fan art sucks or like not even being that blunt about it,

2402
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:32,660
but like why like the artistic integrity is important.

2403
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:35,180
I think there's a group of people that would really resonate with that.

2404
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:36,300
Certainly.

2405
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:40,140
I, I also think that you, uh, yeah.

2406
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:42,940
If you did more original content, it would just show more.

2407
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:46,060
I think people want to know like what's the message you're trying to send.

2408
01:55:46,060 --> 01:55:49,580
Like I know a lot of random things about source or a slosh,

2409
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:51,740
but I don't know what the themes are, you know?

2410
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:55,620
So that's like kind of the problem is I don't think enough people know what

2411
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:59,780
you're trying to explore with your work, you know, like it, or even if you know

2412
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:02,700
what you're trying to explore with your work, do you, do you have like a strong

2413
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:07,660
sense of like what, I mean, the, the theme, the theme of, of the story is actually

2414
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:10,380
like, I guess it's ironically kind of similar to what I've been doing.

2415
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:13,500
It's like there's, there's, there's another, another way of accomplishing

2416
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:14,260
what you want to do.

2417
01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:18,380
Cause like the main thrust of it is that Sarah's in a world of mages or a

2418
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:20,460
culture of mages and she can't do magic.

2419
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:23,940
And so like she wants to be like a great mage or whatever.

2420
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:28,620
So she goes to all these other countries outside of hers and like each country

2421
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:32,060
has a different culture and there's different ways of doing magic.

2422
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:35,300
And she kind of becomes like this amalgamation of all these different

2423
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:39,980
schools of thought and becomes like better and stronger that way.

2424
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:43,580
And it's going to be like this cultural clash between her and her

2425
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:47,420
brother, who like is very traditionalist from her culture and like how they

2426
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:49,180
play off of each other and things like that.

2427
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:50,820
And like a lot of more, more is going to happen.

2428
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:55,140
And is this more like down to earth or does this expand in like story scope?

2429
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:56,580
Like, does it, is there a war?

2430
01:56:57,100 --> 01:57:01,820
You know, I distinctly wanted to make it not like a chosen one on the world

2431
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:03,180
in the brink of war kind of story.

2432
01:57:03,380 --> 01:57:06,260
The entire like culture is stable.

2433
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:06,740
Okay.

2434
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:10,100
So it's just going to be exploring like these different cultures, like being

2435
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:14,900
able to look at a fantasy world that's not like unstable.

2436
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:17,980
I'm like, it's closer to like a My Little Pony tonality.

2437
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:21,060
Like, yeah, because I mean, that's where it came from at the end of the day.

2438
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:24,180
It's just like a world where I still find that so refreshing.

2439
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:28,700
There's a lot of politics and magic and everything, but it's not violent.

2440
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:29,180
Yeah.

2441
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:30,620
I mean, there can be violence.

2442
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:33,980
Like in isolated cases, like there's a certain short story I want to tell.

2443
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:36,860
Like I want to like challenge like perceptions and stuff because like she

2444
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:40,100
comes from this culture where magic is like the be all end all.

2445
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:43,620
And then like there's going to be cities like we're like magics look down upon.

2446
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:46,700
Like there's going to be a whole like culture that's basically going to be kind

2447
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:49,380
of like steampunk where they're like, like they're basically going to be like

2448
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:51,620
what atheists would be in a world where gods exist.

2449
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:53,660
Like fuck God, I don't want to have anything to do with them.

2450
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:56,300
So they reject magic because magic is like the power of the gods.

2451
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:59,780
So like just make technology and but the gods are literally real.

2452
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:00,140
Yes.

2453
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:02,860
They, they, they're the rulers of each of each country.

2454
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:04,540
So, okay.

2455
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:06,540
Well, that's interesting.

2456
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:10,020
It's more than I've ever known about the long-term plot of Sorcerer's loss.

2457
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:12,820
I mean, that's because it just kind of got finalized a little while ago.

2458
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:14,380
It was a lot different before.

2459
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:18,380
Um, but like the original one of the, it was, it's funny.

2460
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:23,020
Like it's the original plot was going to be like sometimes you just like have to

2461
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:25,020
like realize your limitations.

2462
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,620
And I think a big problem is that because I don't believe that at all.

2463
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:27,980
Yeah.

2464
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:28,860
And so like,

2465
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,260
No, you got that girl in the gun.

2466
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:30,700
Yeah.

2467
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:33,900
So go beyond the impossible, maybe impossible possible.

2468
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,740
So I was just like, eh, it didn't resonate.

2469
01:58:35,740 --> 01:58:37,660
So I had to go back and scrap that and redo it.

2470
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:41,620
And like this is, and it's funny because like as I was developing the story,

2471
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:44,900
like it happened with my own life because like 3ds, I'm going to push these

2472
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:46,260
barriers that I couldn't do before.

2473
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:47,060
So it's like, huh.

2474
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:47,860
Yeah.

2475
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:54,420
How badly do you wish you'd got into 3d art like four years ago or 10 years ago?

2476
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:59,820
Well, you know, that the, the, the, the technology has advanced to a place where

2477
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:03,180
like it's definitely more feasible to do it now than it was then.

2478
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:07,140
And also like, there were a couple like key YouTube videos that like kind of

2479
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:11,060
unlocked a way of doing it that I kind of wrapped my brain around that if I

2480
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:14,780
hadn't decided to do it now, I might not have stumbled across and I might not have

2481
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:16,420
been able to push to where I am at this point.

2482
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:20,940
So I try, like even with, with like all these rewrites of SL and stuff,

2483
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:23,820
like it's going to be so much better than it would have been if I had just

2484
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:25,020
pushed through with it before.

2485
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:29,060
So there is a part of me that's like grateful that it had extra time to incubate.

2486
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:29,340
Yeah.

2487
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:33,700
I mean, in a lot of ways, um, people always say you have to get like your

2488
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:34,660
first story out there.

2489
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:38,460
You have to get, you have to, like, like Munchie was saying in the podcast,

2490
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:40,940
you and him did, I don't know what the release order of any of this shit's

2491
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:45,700
going to be, but, uh, you and Munchie did a podcast about, uh, do you know what

2492
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:46,420
that video is going to be called?

2493
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:50,380
Art, apologies, you know, in the art, apologies, um, podcast.

2494
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:52,540
Munchie was talking about how you need to get your early work out of the way

2495
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:54,860
because it's always going to be your worst and like you can keep making it

2496
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:58,540
better, but then the paradox that, uh, the longer you work on it, the better

2497
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:01,900
it gets, but in a lot of ways you've just created multiple stories.

2498
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:06,420
Like by the time the, the story I wrote as a, as a novel, like I said,

2499
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:07,700
originally it was going to be a movie.

2500
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:11,060
I spent like two years redeveloping it until it was a book.

2501
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:14,580
And by that point it was yet vastly better than the pre, than what it would have

2502
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:14,740
been.

2503
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:18,500
And if I made it again now, it would be two, but it would also just be another story.

2504
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:22,900
Like the same character is the same plot, but it's not the same story.

2505
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:26,100
You know, I mean, I've written other stuff.

2506
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:28,300
So it's not like this is my first rodeo on writing a story.

2507
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:28,660
Right.

2508
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:31,940
And it's also, but I'm just saying that like, even if none of this stuff's been

2509
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:35,540
published, like silently in the background, you're grinding the power level,

2510
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:39,900
which used to be how it was, like most people didn't crack the scene till they

2511
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:42,140
were of a certain power level.

2512
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:45,780
Now it's like all your old shit can be on your DeviantArt.

2513
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:48,820
Some people try to cover that stuff up, but I'm one of those people.

2514
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:50,740
All my old Deviantarts are gone.

2515
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:51,820
You'll never see them.

2516
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:54,580
What's the farthest back of your content that's viewable online?

2517
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:57,940
Uh, well, I actually just axed all my pony work off of DeviantArt a couple

2518
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:01,580
weeks ago, so, uh, like two years ago, it's the longest it goes back.

2519
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:05,980
Um, is that true on like all social media or the, okay, but to clarify,

2520
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:09,020
the reason that I decided to, to get rid of the pony stuff wasn't even

2521
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:10,500
because I was super embarrassed by it.

2522
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:13,980
It was because I didn't want that metadata to fuck up with anything that's

2523
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:14,540
going forward.

2524
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:18,620
I didn't remove my pony videos out of embarrassment either.

2525
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:22,780
It was just like, for a while, I'm like an anime channel that has like three

2526
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:26,060
rows of anime videos and then pages of pony videos.

2527
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:27,140
And I was like, these all need to go.

2528
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:30,220
That was the thing, cause like I'm rebranding is like all those 3D stuff.

2529
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:33,380
And then you go back and there's all this pony stuff and it doesn't make any sense.

2530
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:36,220
And like, because like all these things are driven by algorithms now,

2531
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:40,780
traffic to that is going to fuck up directing where you're supposed to go.

2532
02:01:40,780 --> 02:01:42,100
Oh God, they're ruining the internet.

2533
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:42,860
It's really bad.

2534
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:44,300
They're ruining the fucking internet.

2535
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:47,020
And the only reason that the only thing that's going to save it is that everyone

2536
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:47,980
knows they're doing it.

2537
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:50,020
That's how we can all escape.

2538
02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:54,260
Um, all right, how long, how far are we into this?

2539
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:56,980
Could I am running out of questions?

2540
02:01:58,140 --> 02:01:59,860
Well, is there anything, anything?

2541
02:01:59,860 --> 02:02:02,940
Cause I don't want to ask you about any broad topic stuff cause we talk about

2542
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,780
enough of that on the PCP right now.

2543
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:08,100
Is there anything else you want to share?

2544
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:11,660
I guess like going back to what we were saying about like how we feel about like

2545
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:13,620
society or whatever, like how that shit goes.

2546
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:17,540
I think there's a lot of negative that comes on with this whole internet shit.

2547
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:21,340
But like we were saying before, like, you know, the last generation couldn't do

2548
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:21,940
what we're doing.

2549
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:26,060
Like there's no way that, like, can you imagine like, like the ridiculousness

2550
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:29,500
of like, Oh, like five friends are sitting around a table having a discussion

2551
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:31,380
and you get like almost a grand for it.

2552
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:37,460
I mean, like the, this whole setup that we're currently in right now is exceedingly

2553
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:38,060
strange.

2554
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:40,100
Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous.

2555
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:46,420
Renting a house to make like to fly six guys in and make YouTube videos for 10

2556
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:46,780
days.

2557
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:51,380
Like it's utterly nuts and definitely it couldn't have existed before.

2558
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:51,740
Yeah.

2559
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:55,900
So I know we all give social media a lot of shit, but like,

2560
02:02:55,900 --> 02:03:01,460
I, I'm also like really just grateful that like, I'm, I really, I like being the

2561
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:06,740
age that I am because I'm like young enough to be able to take advantage of

2562
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:10,300
all this, but old enough to understand like how important it is.

2563
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:10,740
Oh yeah.

2564
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:12,540
How like to not take it for granted.

2565
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:12,900
Right.

2566
02:03:12,900 --> 02:03:13,340
Yeah.

2567
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:13,940
So.

2568
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:18,980
But at the same time, I feel as though we are just too old to understand certain

2569
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:21,740
like why things become trendy on social media.

2570
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:22,180
For sure.

2571
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:23,660
There's definitely a disconnect.

2572
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:30,180
Like every once in a while, um, I'll just like hear some new song that's like all

2573
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:36,860
over Vine and I'm like, why, why, why this is just is not my generation.

2574
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:41,220
I guess, you know, that's, I, I definitely am terrified of growing old just because

2575
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:43,220
of like, I'm terrified of death in general.

2576
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:47,860
I remember that like, you know, there's always people your age, like people,

2577
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:51,540
people act like if you, um, I mean, granted, like teenagers are the most

2578
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:55,300
interested in art because they need it to like understand the world around them.

2579
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:59,860
And they have tons of free time, but like adults still consume it and they want shit

2580
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:00,460
for them.

2581
02:04:00,460 --> 02:04:01,660
I'm just terrified of dying.

2582
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:03,260
Yeah.

2583
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:04,460
Well, that's pretty bad.

2584
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:06,700
I mean, we're all terrified of dying.

2585
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:09,700
Me, I think it's just because I haven't done what I want to do yet.

2586
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:13,180
Like I think if I can get enough shit out of me, I'd be like, if I died tomorrow,

2587
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:17,860
like it, it take a lot because like for me, there's so much.

2588
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:19,220
Well, that's a whole problem.

2589
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:21,820
It's like, there's, there's, I'm never, my brain's never going to turn off.

2590
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:23,340
There's always going to be another idea.

2591
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:25,780
So like, I'm going to die unfulfilled somehow.

2592
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:28,580
I really want you to read, um, or maybe I sent this to you.

2593
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:29,300
I don't even remember.

2594
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:34,580
Did you read a thing, um, by this comic artist about like how he wasted 14 years

2595
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:37,980
or whatever drawing this comic that was only supposed to take five and like his

2596
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,620
tips on how to not do that?

2597
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:43,700
Um, possibly was a YouTube video.

2598
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:44,540
No, it's recent.

2599
02:04:44,540 --> 02:04:45,380
It's fairly recent.

2600
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:49,060
It was a, it was a blog post, but it was a, I saw a video kind of

2601
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:51,100
similar to that or no, it was a YouTube video.

2602
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:51,740
I'm wrong.

2603
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:53,140
It was a YouTube video.

2604
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:54,260
I think I watched that.

2605
02:04:54,380 --> 02:04:57,660
It was like, and it was like kind of like an edutainment video, but it was a,

2606
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:02,500
a guy who was a comic artist who had spent like an obscene amount of time over a

2607
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:04,660
decade drawing like this three volume comic.

2608
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:10,180
And it was because he copied the style of like, um, oh yeah, because he did all

2609
02:05:10,180 --> 02:05:11,740
that super insane patching and stuff.

2610
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:12,420
Yeah, I did watch it.

2611
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:15,820
Yeah, but then he talks about like where you need to cut to like, he's like,

2612
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:16,700
pick your battles.

2613
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:20,980
Like this shot was not important and didn't need to be shot in a location that

2614
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:22,540
had four layers of detail.

2615
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:26,820
Uh, I will not do that next time, but the most fascinating part was when he was

2616
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:30,060
talking about like, so this took me this many years.

2617
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:35,300
And that means that if I only do three more comics than that, or if I, if I

2618
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:38,100
keep doing comments at this rate, I will only get three done before I die.

2619
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:39,900
And I have more than three ideas.

2620
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:43,900
And, uh, do you ever find yourself like, do you worry about that?

2621
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:47,660
Especially with like sorceress, that's like my number one thing.

2622
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:52,100
Like, I remember yesterday when I was on my way here, I was like, do I really

2623
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:53,140
have a week to spare?

2624
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:54,980
Like, should I just be working right now?

2625
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:58,620
Cause I have like two models like that have just been in limbo.

2626
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:01,700
I feel very similar because like two weeks for the last two weeks, I've done

2627
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:03,100
nothing, but read the guilty.

2628
02:06:03,100 --> 02:06:03,700
Get wiki.

2629
02:06:04,220 --> 02:06:05,780
God damn fucking lecture.

2630
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:08,740
And I still have all of XR to get through for me.

2631
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:11,340
It was the dick show like days and days.

2632
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:12,420
And I was like sick of it.

2633
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:14,220
And I was, I was, I was talking to my friend.

2634
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:16,420
He's like, why the fuck are you even doing this?

2635
02:06:16,420 --> 02:06:17,980
All fighting game stories are retarded.

2636
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:19,220
I'm like, I mean, you're right.

2637
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:22,340
But I said, I said, I do hard stories for target.

2638
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:24,220
It's got 150,000 views.

2639
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:28,300
So dude, this lecture, the first, the first half an hour is a hundred years

2640
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:30,900
before the first game because that's, you need to know all of that.

2641
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:34,620
It's really, but, uh, yeah.

2642
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:41,020
Yeah, I, I too was like at the, at the like very beginning of like the

2643
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:44,380
project that is going to define my career for the next year.

2644
02:06:44,420 --> 02:06:47,060
And I'm like, gotta not work on that yet.

2645
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,260
Let's go to Radcon.

2646
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:48,780
But like,

2647
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:49,980
it's been really frustrating.

2648
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:52,700
Cause I'm just like, I want to keep going on that.

2649
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:53,340
Right.

2650
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:56,780
But you're, you've been talking about you and Munchie, uh, inspiring

2651
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:58,100
each other to try to work here.

2652
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:03,580
So yeah, no, I got those, those two files have just been open for

2653
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:04,420
like the last two weeks.

2654
02:07:04,420 --> 02:07:05,900
Just like, are you sure?

2655
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:06,980
Are you sure?

2656
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:10,700
God, that feeling of having it open and like, or

2657
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:13,860
especially if you have something for a project on a tab in your fucking

2658
02:07:13,860 --> 02:07:18,540
chrome and it's there for days or like a half finished movie and you're just

2659
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:20,260
like, I'm never going to finish this movie.

2660
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:22,060
It's the worst.

2661
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:22,620
Yeah.

2662
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:23,340
All right.

2663
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:28,540
Well, uh, I think we're about done here cause I am sick of sitting in this

2664
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:30,980
chair and I've run out of questions.

2665
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:31,540
All right.

2666
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:33,700
So that's the interview with Tom.

2667
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:37,860
Hope you all enjoyed interviews are not like back.

2668
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:39,380
There's only like two that need to be done.

2669
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:40,780
It was you and mage, I think.

2670
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:41,180
Yeah.

2671
02:07:41,380 --> 02:07:42,620
And now this one's knocked out.

2672
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:46,980
So, uh, I hope you enjoyed it with video and look forward to more rad con

2673
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:49,420
video because there's a thousand of them.

2674
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:54,100
We've literally filmed like, like probably over 20 vlogs today or 20 pieces

2675
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:55,540
of entertainment today.

2676
02:07:55,580 --> 02:07:58,140
Yeah, look forward to everything.

2677
02:07:58,620 --> 02:07:59,300
Peace.
