00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Greetings, everyone, to a PCP Mini. This is an impulsive, spur-of-the-moments topic that we came up with because we were talking about it so much in the chat and I felt it needed to be hashed out verbally between at least a couple of us.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The subject is, is analysis worth existing? Should we even be doing it? This isn't like a highfalutin, what is the value of the medium like that one podcast we had which was utterly miserably terrible.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This one is specifically about us and whether or not it's something worthwhile for us to pursue in our lives, whether as consumers or as creators of the subject of analysis.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now if you look at Urban Dictionary, the definition is, uh, anal says that's it. There's no Urban Dictionary on the word analysis, let's move on.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh yeah, with me is Nate and Mumkey and Ben and me, The View. No introductions. So anyway, here we go.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Nate, you start with your opinion of analysis. Okay, well, first I'm going to give some context as to why we were having this discussion.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, okay. It's because our good buddy, Nate, just put up probably the best video of all time where he's doing analysis. According to Reddit, according to Reddit, it's the greatest video.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Nate, is the number one post on r slash anime as of, I guess, last night and this morning?

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As of this morning, it had fallen, it's fallen a little bit down now, but it got over 3,200 upboats, so not bad.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And you got like 2,000 subs overnight, which is fucking phenomenal.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I got over 2,000 subs and it's got like around 40,000 views now or so.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So our good buddy, Nate, you know, we're all proud of him because he made a successful analysis video and it's blowing up. But then, oh brother, my brother, gets who comes in to pull the rug out from under.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You know, I felt bad griping, but now that I know how successful it's been, I don't care anymore and I don't feel bad anymore.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You know, you say that, but I feel like if this, I feel like everyone's really jumping the gun on my breakout success a little bit.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is like one video with like, it's probably, maybe it'll climb to like 50,000 views. That is like not even that good.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Nate, this is Ben, class warfare saint you're talking to. I don't think he's gonna give you much lenience.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, okay. I shouldn't complain. I'm happy that it's getting the attention that it does.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, yeah, so I mean, I'm glad about that. I've got my own feelings about that video in particular, but I'm more interested in, you know, the general subject in hand.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, like David was saying, when it comes to analysis videos, there are really two ways to think about it from our side of the spectrum.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The autism spectrum. And so there's like the, first of all, like the, I guess like the value as art pieces, or I would call like the societal value of like creating something like that to begin with.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And then there's just like the commercial value, like if you're, if you're gonna be able to survive making that kind of thing.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And there's, there's always going to be a balance between those two things. And so like this video, for example, I feel like it's the funny thing about it is it's very similar to other videos I've made.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Like it really reminds me of the one punch man one, and that video did did pretty well actually.

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But like the way that I branded this one was different and was like a little bit more skewed to like what I've come to understand as like the YouTube success formula, which is just like thumbnail, just a big picture of Galco's face.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's like my favorite frame from the whole thing. And then the name of the thing, you know, the name is like, it's like a thought like understand, I'm forgetting what it was like something about defying, defying stereotypes.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, in oh shit, the Galco Chan. Yeah, that that's right.

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So the love progressive shit like that.

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They do, even though it's really not a very progressive message, I guess it kind of is whatever. It doesn't matter.

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But the point is, like, there is no more intellectual content. If you put like that more kind of marketing angle to it, like my instinct would have been just to call it like best anime ever.

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh shit, a Galco Chan, because I think about doing these things as like episodes in my like TV show that is best anime ever or like, you know, the best blank ever, whatever the series.

31
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's how I think about it. But like with the way things are going, that just doesn't work right now.

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So in this particular case, I didn't have to actually like really think about how to like change the content of the video so as to like, you know, be most rewarded on YouTube.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can always put it out there with a YouTubey name, let it get that initial view surge and then just change it later.

34
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's true. I mean, I've actually been pretty comfortable with the way this is named. I don't really mind it at all.

35
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I kind of like leading with like, I like leading with the idea that's going to be presented in there and you know, that's totally fine.

36
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But I do feel resistance like going back and changing old video names, like the one punch man change to Saitama's a big fuckboy. I don't know, it doesn't matter.

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah.

38
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, it's not wrong.

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But you know, but like I do think that when I, because you know, like to me, the most important thing about making a video is like having the idea of what you're going to make in the first place.

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And really, that's where like, you know, that's where like the big decisions are made, at least for me.

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So I mean, I was happy to make this Galco video because it is like perfectly fit for YouTube. It's just over 10 minutes long, which means I could put an ad at the end of the video.

42
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So I was totally aware of that fact while making it.

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And you know, like the fact that I made this and didn't work on one of the many other projects that I've got, you know, just like written and waiting to go, you know, like the, it's, it's just like,

44
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it's the framing, it's that, you know, like the commercialization and the ability to survive and to make money.

45
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Like that did control to some extent, like what I chose to make as this current product, as opposed to, you know, like another, like I'd love to make like a big analysis of, you know, like Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, you know, like as like a sequel to the thing.

46
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But I'm not going to do that anytime soon, because it's not as viable.

47
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't, I don't my, my interest in the concept of an analysis or even a review is at like an all time low right now.

48
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Maybe not all time, but certainly has gone down consistently for like the last six months after like me being really obsessed with it for like two years.

49
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And now my default reaction to any analysis is just who cares, you know, like, like any video that is a review, it's like a steep uphill battle on its part to get me to go and wow, this is valid.

50
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You know, I've, you know, I've become very like burned out.

51
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And I feel like I've heard of all the things, you know, like, yeah.

52
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Do you think that you're burned out because you spend hours each week editing these types of videos for digital?

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, I do believe that isn't, you know, the insiderness of it is absolutely that, you know, I'm in the looking at my sub feed right now.

54
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's like, do stories ruin spoilers?

55
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Super bunny high patch wolf.

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm just like, like, I don't know, do I want to know?

57
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Maybe it would be best if I just never, if I just go the rest of my life, never know.

58
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You know what that video is going to be before you even watch it.

59
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's going to be him.

60
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's going to, he's going to go on a long thing.

61
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Most of it will be superfluous.

62
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Maybe there'll be some jokes or something.

63
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And the point will be that you can enjoy a thing even if you're spoiled on it, uh, rewatches, uh, da, da, da, da.

64
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's all, it's all shit we've heard before.

65
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm right with you, I'm right with you, Davoo.

66
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I feel like, I feel like I've heard everything and I feel like it's so fucking rare.

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's so fucking rare for someone on YouTube to say a thing that I've never heard before and it just makes me feel, just makes me feel like what's the point, you know?

68
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay, let me, let me, I, I've got to watch videos anymore.

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is something I've been thinking about for a while now and it's that, uh, that we are in fact no longer the target audience for YouTube, including the content we make.

70
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Indeed.

71
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The target audience is like, people new to analysis and new to YouTube.

72
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Like, at this point, like, I, I'm not going to say the name, but I'm, I'm reading a book that is about a lot of the stuff that I think about, like as a consequence of all the anime I've consumed.

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The fountain.

74
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I, no, that one, that one's in the can, my friend.

75
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Um, no, uh.

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The autism spectrum diagnosis booklet.

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Basically, yeah.

78
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The Triflors by Monkey Jones.

79
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, you guessed it buddy, you guessed it.

80
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That is literally sitting on my desk right in front of me right now.

81
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Um.

82
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Do you use it as a poster?

83
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Actually, it is a, it is my little cloud from Kingdom Hearts.

84
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Uh, he's sitting on it.

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So it's his little table.

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, that's cute.

87
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Isn't that cute?

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He loves, he loves that thing.

89
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm glad it was put to some use in the, in the Nate household.

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's there to remind me to read it as soon as I have a free moment.

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Now you already bought it.

92
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't care if you read it.

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Exactly.

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I just wanted to do five bucks.

95
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You got it, dude.

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Uh, where was I going with that?

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, like, yeah.

98
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I was just saying that I feel like for guys like us, we're kind of, yeah.

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Like, like Ben was saying, I also feel like I am, I basically learned everything there

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
was to learn.

101
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Like what did these YouTubers, like what is their skill set that they have like delved

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
into and like cultivated on YouTube?

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Like, you know, right?

104
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That is the thing.

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There's nothing.

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's nothing.

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There's literally nothing separating a YouTuber from, from me.

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There's nothing there.

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There's one thing Ben, there's one crucial thing and it is editing ability.

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It is editing ability.

111
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's the only thing.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, that's what puts, that's what puts people like Captain Christian over the top.

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Captain Christian is the absolute fucking nadir of human civilization.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, well, he's just, he's just very...

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Captain Christian just fucking typifies everything that is wrong.

116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Which is that you can just regurgitate, you can just regurgitate information, dress it

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
up in like a pleasing way, just tell people what they already know they want to hear.

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And fucking put a little fucking editing stank on it.

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And they will, and, and the people will think it's genius.

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The people will think it's genius because they're being validated.

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They'll think you're a fucking prophet because, oh my God.

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, for fuck's sake.

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's true too, man.

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why'd you have to bring up Captain Christian?

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That, that's what he had to.

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm already fucking angry enough already.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I, yeah.

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I, I, I hate his success.

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I am angry how, how successful he is.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Well, okay.

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So, you know, my, my whole time on the internet over the past many years, you know, has been

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
discovering different practices, different disciplines, different mediums, right?

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So around the mid-2000s, that's when I sort of discovered the idea of reviews as this

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
thing, you know, like, like, I see a review and I'm like, wow, you're, you're looking

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
at a piece of work and then you're talking about it and summarizing it.

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And that concept alone fascinated me for a number of years, right?

139
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Then slowly over the course of time, I start to understand this idea of analysis as distinct

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
from a review, which is a critical thought exercise.

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So finally, for the first time in a number of years, I was, I was revitalized in a new

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
practice, a new, a new, a new technique, a new skill to try to develop.

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And that was like five years ago now.

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It would have been like 2012 when I first got introduced to this idea of analysis as

145
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
distinct from reviews.

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And I feel like once you basically like dwell and meditate on Mr. B tongue for like a straight

147
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
six months as I once did, you've basically hit maximum critical, you've hit critical

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
mass with critical thoughts.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And so from then, what I've been pursuing since then is just people who have different

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
life experiences and different, different banks of information to go to, you know,

151
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
which is what has made a Digi's content still pretty valuable is by having this wealth

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
of shit that he's watched.

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But then, but then recently I was walking around the streets of Atlanta with Digi and

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
some old commenter of his who I believe has seen more anime than he does than he ever

155
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
has, just shitting on all of Digi's opinions constantly by inciting just like every single

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
time he wanted to justify any opinion, he just name drops like 17 old robot shows to back

157
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
up his argument.

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And I'm like, this guy needs to make videos.

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This guy has a totally different world view.

160
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Me and Digi are both like, dude, please make videos.

161
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And he's like, I don't want to make videos.

162
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That would be a waste of life.

163
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I'm like, what, what, what, no, no.

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That guy knows exactly what's up.

165
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That guy, I'm way on board with that guy.

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think he does.

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's, I'm going to fucking, I'm going to date that boy.

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We both looked at each other.

169
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Me and Digi and we were like, wait, there's something you could do with your life other

170
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
than make analysis videos.

171
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah.

172
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So I've been like in a weirdly unique position with analysis and that I've gotten to like

173
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
be on the receiving end of producing it without having to actually write any of it, which is

174
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
sort of the easiest possible way.

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So, you know, and I still get the satisfaction of transmitting analytical ideas because I

176
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
kind of have to like reinterpret them in order to create a visual, you know, a visual of

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
it.

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Right.

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But without having to actually like go set on a rock for five days as Digi does to come

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
up with ideas.

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Because coming up with ideas is fucking impossible.

182
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
DeVoo, I think last month you made a video that has stuck with me and I've been thinking

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
about it a lot called YouTube is stomach acid.

184
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I think is what you called it.

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah.

186
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And it's very relevant to what we're saying because I think your main idea there was that

187
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
on YouTube there aren't really any original things.

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Nobody's really making original content.

189
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They're just talking about other content that already exists.

190
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And that's a problem with reviews and analysis.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Guys, what if Mario was racist?

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Just imagine.

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay.

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Just imagine.

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Several levels below like analytical critique there is game theory, which is what you're

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
talking about there.

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, yeah.

198
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I think there's something to the idea of like presenting an alternate interpretation.

200
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Right.

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That can be food for thought.

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I suppose that's true.

203
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't think Jesse's Mario was the one though.

204
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Maybe not.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Ben, isn't that what Nate did in his newest video that you were kind of...

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No.

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't think it is.

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I feel like what was explained in that video is all explicit to the text of Galcochan.

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay.

210
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Here's the feeling that I got watching that video and it's a feeling that I've had with

212
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
lots of other videos is that like the...

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What's good about that video is that it just like...

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't know.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What's good about Galcochan and just like kind of packages all the like the positive

216
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
message or whatever and like delivers it in this kind of nugget without earning it.

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Like they had to earn it by making the fucking show in the first place.

218
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh man, that reminds me of Digi's video.

219
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Digi's video.

220
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He has a vlog from like I think two years ago where he's comparing analysis to vapor

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
wave where you literally just take exactly what you're basing yourself off of and then

222
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
just slow it down and then loop it and then add the Windows 95 startup sound effect.

223
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I will happily admit that my favorite thing about that video by far...

224
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I like that it is spreading awareness about Galcochan.

225
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Which is a show I really, really like.

226
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's good.

227
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I would feel better if I thought that people were going to watch that video and be like

228
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
hey, sounds like a cool show that I'll like and then go watch it.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But I don't get that.

230
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
A bunch of people did.

231
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I got a bunch of people saying that.

232
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I get the feeling that the video is appreciated on its own merits and here I fucking go.

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Here's my point.

234
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Like the video's merits are not its own.

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They're merits of the show.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I will happily admit that my favorite thing about that video, which was always the same

237
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
before, is that I got to recreate the final pointing scene from The Breakfast Club, which

238
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
is the whole point.

239
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's what I wanted to do.

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That commenter who asked that, yes, you're right.

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That was my goal and I did it.

242
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I know you were sending me footage and screenshots and asking me about, I know you were really

243
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
putting effort into replicating it perfectly.

244
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Can I just take this moment to tell the tale since the topic has come up.

245
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I worked for literally weeks to get that shot right because I work alone because I have

246
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
no friends and I had to set up the camera by myself.

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I had to figure out the right camera placement.

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Turns out it's got to be really low to the ground and even mine wasn't low enough.

249
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And your viewfinder doesn't flip around either.

250
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
My viewfinder does not flip around.

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So I had to do takes and I couldn't even review the footage because the resolution is too bad.

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I can't tell if it's in focus or not.

253
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I had to do my takes, go home and review the footage, find out if I focused right.

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And then the sun had to be in the right position.

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, it was a big thing.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It took me four separate trips to that fucking field.

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So Ben.

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
In addition to scouting around four locations at which to film it.

259
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is a big thing.

260
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This is a big thing.

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But Ben.

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I have a way to phrase I think what you're getting at and I think I feel exactly the same

263
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
way is that analysis videos often serve as a cheat to get the themes and morals of a

264
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
story without having to consume the actual work.

265
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's like reading cliff notes and it gives you the sensation of watching these experiences.

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But we're moving like the nutrition of them.

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You know what I'm saying?

268
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And like the moment where this finally started to sink in for me was when I saw fucking reaction

269
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
videos on crunchy roll, like crunchy roll on its front page where it has a little flip

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
through the main featured articles thing or main featured shows.

271
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Half of them are episodes, you know, like watch fucking Super Whale God know everybody

272
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
that buddy episode five, but then also watch some white blonde woman react to some other

273
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
episode of something else.

274
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm like, wait a second, why are reaction videos on the website that's supposed to have

275
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the thing that you react to?

276
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And it's because no one wants to watch anything anymore.

277
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No one wants to have the attention span.

278
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's a bit of an overstate.

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's not that there's not enough people.

280
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I know that there's people that watch an analysis video of a show will digest it, feel that they

281
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
have like understood the show and then not watch it because I do that all the time.

282
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And I don't like that about myself, but I can't fucking go watch everything.

283
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Damn shame that YouTube gets so many more views because it's YouTube and it's so easy

284
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
to watch where it's like actual art takes more time and patience.

285
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And I feel like if all the analysis in the universe just disappeared forever and was disallowed

286
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
from returning, then, you know, a bunch of people would just take more time out of their

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
day to find stuff.

288
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay, guys, well, let me let me ask you this and I'm serious about this.

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Nate, I'm sorry.

290
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm sorry to beat up on you.

291
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't want it to come across as too mean spirited.

292
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No, I don't feel like you're being that way.

293
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah, I think it's really, Bennett, it was distasteful that you would be so aggressive

294
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
towards another PCP member and always talk shit about them.

295
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't know why you would do that.

296
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It was unforgivable and I will pitch myself off of the nearest bridge.

297
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So you're talking about you're talking about like distilling down.

299
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
No, I won't.

300
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I won't apologize.

301
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll just kill myself.

302
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's acceptable.

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So you're talking about distilling like the core, I guess, ideas behind a show and, you

304
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
know, presenting them in an analysis video as kind of, you know, like cheating to get

305
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
the, the nuggety center out and not having to like put in the work to consume the piece

306
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
of art.

307
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But okay, now this is going to sound a little crazy, but maybe that's better.

308
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Like it's a more efficient way to consume the idea of, you know, like the work in question.

309
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So what are you losing?

310
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What is being lost?

311
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm not saying that it has that there's no merit to it at all.

312
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I just, it's just, it's just cheap, you know, it's just cheap.

313
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I think it's helpful because like DeVu brought up Cliff Notes.

314
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I was an English major in college and I mean in high school as well.

315
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I use Spark Notes for most of my assignments.

316
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm not, I don't have time to read all that shit.

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

318
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's extremely valuable in a case of videos that I've watched in my life.

319
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Old, shitty, terrible games are the best example.

320
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Like when you watch, I recently watched Aqua Lung Game Reviews, the Chuck Norris game on

321
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Atari 2600.

322
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The fascinating mechanics on that thing would have been a miserable weekend if I tried to

323
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
find that out for myself.

324
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So yeah, definitely.

325
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
If you Cliff Note responsibly, it could do you great.

326
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Like I think, like, I guess I think that like discussing art is a worthwhile thing to do,

327
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I guess.

328
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And like an analysis video is just like a form of discussion of a work of art.

329
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And I think that that is all fine and dandy.

330
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But I do think, I mean, I guess I will say that like, I don't know, people build their

331
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
careers and their fucking internet presences around like talking about other art and it's

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
just like, you know, it's just fan art and it just feels like, it just feels like they're,

333
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
you know, they're just kind of stepping into that other things limelight and grabbing it,

334
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
grabbing as much of a piece as they can.

335
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The metaphor that Mumki was referring to that I came up with, YouTube is stomach acid.

336
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The idea is that all the stuff you watch and read is like food and then the analysis you

337
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
watch of it and the discussions you have about it is like digesting it, which is very important,

338
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
you know, to come to an understanding of what you've consumed.

339
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But what I'm concerned about is when people get stuck in a loop of just digesting and

340
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
digesting and then they become malnutritioned and die.

341
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And that's what I'm concerned about on behalf of like, whenever I see people who are like

342
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
PCP fans and seem to keep up with everyone in the PCP, I'm like, how do you have time

343
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
for anything else?

344
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah.

345
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's a good point.

346
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We put out a lot of shit.

347
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah.

348
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So, you know, I feel like, I feel like, I feel like a lot of this comes down for me to

349
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
to goals and plans and how they've shifted over time because I became...

350
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Let me touch on that PCP thing.

351
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah.

352
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Like the PCP is a great example.

353
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Like, you know, we have a small but really like dedicated kind of like cult fan base

354
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and for them, for a lot of them, it's like...

355
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's not inaccurate.

356
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Like we're making art.

357
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Some of our art is about other art, whatever.

358
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's all fine.

359
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But like, to a lot of them, the...

360
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
To a lot of them, like the PCP, like the object of interest is the PCP itself.

361
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But like, we're not here.

362
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We're not here like, you know, like what we're doing, like we're trying to make other stuff.

363
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But like that...

364
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I feel like to a lot of people, this is getting into my fucking shit right now.

365
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
To a lot of people, like the stuff that the PCP makes is less important than the PCP

366
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
itself and that is like a real ugly thing and it makes me feel bad.

367
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It leaves a real bad taste in my mouth.

368
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't...

369
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I haven't been keeping up with anybody's...

370
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Anybody's work, including Digi.

371
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Like pretty much the only Digi stuff I consistently watch is the stuff I work on now.

372
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah, I can't...

373
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I can't follow like anyone, I don't know, I'll watch like occasional stuff.

374
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, just to...

375
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I mean, what the PCP is, is...

376
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I mean, and it's kind of been talked about this way the whole time.

377
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You know, it's like a bunch of friends talking about stuff, like debating, you know, ideas

378
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
or whatever.

379
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah, I certainly hope that what people would primarily do is like discuss the ideas that

380
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
are presented, but like, you know, a lot of it is comedy and joke it around and it's only

381
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
natural that like the personalities of the people involved would be a primary focus of

382
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
what people discuss.

383
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, you know, my favorite podcast is the Digi...

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's not a philosophy show specifically, like where we're like, okay, today we're bringing

385
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
in like this idea, we're going to talk about it specifically, like it is a comedy show

386
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
at its heart.

387
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
My favorite podcast is the Digi show and I love his personality and I love the personality

388
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
of Sean and a couple of other of his regular guests and I love that show.

389
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But when he talks about the fans and the viewership and like the communities of sprung up around

390
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
him, it's just like the whole PCP community stuff, but like significantly larger.

391
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
There's the Facebook group and the Reddit group and there's like drama going on within

392
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
the different groups of the fandom of this show where the whole concept is just one guy

393
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and a couple of friends and I'm like, I get the impression there's a lot of people for

394
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
whom their whole life is being fans of that show, whereas it should only be the host's

395
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
full-time life.

396
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Dustin Isanova, that is definitely his whole life.

397
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And I just like, I have a, you know, for me, it's like this, the world is like a giant

398
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
game of Minecraft, the world of art, right?

399
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The media out there, especially after the internet, is infinite resources.

400
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You could just find some random niche that is a subset of a subset of a subset of some

401
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
other niche and spend your entire life dedicating yourself to the study and honing of that tiny

402
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
little corner of the world, of culture, right?

403
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And there are so many stories that you can tell.

404
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You basically can weave your own narrative of life about what you experience, right?

405
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The favorite one I've heard in a while is Munchy explaining his story with Parkour

406
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Dude91, where it's like, this is an incredible little, tiny little, weird little story that

407
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Munchy happened to be there to witness all of, and he got to relate that to others.

408
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And that for me is like a divine, beautiful thing that he experienced.

409
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And for me, I feel like I have a responsibility, especially as someone with a microphone that

410
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
a few people will listen to, you know, just a humble little content creator like myself

411
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
that people are gonna like, you know, take some inspiration from maybe, that I should have

412
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
an interesting story of like, hey guys, today I went to this random website and discovered

413
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
this random little thing.

414
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't like the idea of like just sort of being carried along by the current of like

415
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
whatever feels convenient to click on from day to day.

416
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't like it when I hear from people who spend 75% of their time just experiencing

417
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
what happens to be in their Facebook feed, right?

418
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Where they're just carried along by the current, by the tide of wherever things take them,

419
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
rather than like trying to go out and find their own.

420
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You're never gonna watch everything.

421
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You're never gonna consume even the tiniest fraction of anything.

422
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And when I feel like people are just stuck in some sort of full time routine that isn't interesting,

423
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I feel sad and offended for them.

424
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I feel like they're wasting their life.

425
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And I feel like this is a problem.

426
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Man, I agree.

427
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I agree.

428
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I feel that because I've been in that loop before.

429
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I've been in that fucking cycle.

430
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And yeah, it's terrible.

431
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This reminds me of something.

432
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Just to go back a little bit to what Ben had said before about, you know,

433
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I think it was Ben, about people being obsessed and like fixating on the people

434
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and like in the PCP, they're more focused on us as opposed to the ideas.

435
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Like as I said, I'm a little bit more excusing of that.

436
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But what I hate in general is the focus on like the people on YouTube at large.

437
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Like the fixation on characters.

438
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah.

439
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You know, I...

440
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What do you mean?

441
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Well, it's this idea, right?

442
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's this Eleanor Roosevelt quote that I always think about that everybody should know.

443
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Great minds discuss ideas.

444
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Average minds discuss events.

445
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Small minds discuss people.

446
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And I feel like YouTube is far too much of small minds discussing people.

447
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Indeed.

448
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I feel like it's just such a waste of brain power.

449
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That's what YouTube drama is all about.

450
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's just talking about people.

451
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah, you know what I don't like about YouTube, I guess, is that I always have it in my mind.

452
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm always conscious of this hierarchy.

453
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Like I always know that there are people out there with 10 million subscribers

454
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
who are like affecting more people.

455
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And I don't like the way it feels like a...

456
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Like it feels like this hierarchy, right?

457
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
One thing I liked at first when I got into YouTube was anytime someone commented,

458
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I wish you deserve more subscribers.

459
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I still like those kinds of comments.

460
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But I felt a little cheated upon when I started seeing in other people's comment sections

461
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
who had hundreds of thousands of subs.

462
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm like, how do you need more subscribers?

463
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's because the people who comment that are subbed to people with 10 million subscribers.

464
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
True.

465
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And we're all sort of...

466
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
We're sort of judged as though we're on like the same plane of existence.

467
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Whereas for me, they're really not.

468
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And I feel like old YouTube, you know, as early as...

469
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's late as 2007, it still felt like...

470
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It still felt like a bunch of blogs in a way.

471
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It felt more like blog spot.

472
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
When you're on like a blog, when you're on WordPress,

473
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
you're not conscious of comparing the view counts of this WordPress

474
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
to the most famous WordPress, PewDiePres, you could say, right?

475
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But on YouTube, you're always...

476
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Because YouTube is so interconnected,

477
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
YouTube always feels like you're on an intersection.

478
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And every four directions, there's another video.

479
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You always know who the popular guys are.

480
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And so it feels like...

481
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It feels more like...

482
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I think just the fact that the view counts is the most prominently displayed statistic.

483
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It always makes you think, oh, but how can you get more popular?

484
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And it makes everyone fixated on how to get more popular and more popular

485
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
rather than being content with 125,365 subscribers.

486
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm done, you know?

487
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And this ties in, of course, to the whole, you know, like the sort of...

488
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
What's the word I'm looking for?

489
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Like the bleaching of content on YouTube.

490
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Like they're trying to clean up their act, you know?

491
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
To appeal more to like large...

492
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah, YouTube wants to encourage it.

493
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
YouTube is encouraging.

494
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
YouTube wants the most viewed videos.

495
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's all pushing things towards this kind of sanitized...

496
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's the word I was looking for, sanitized.

497
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Sanitized, you know, like a kind of content

498
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
that's sort of further and further away from the kind of like individualized

499
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
things that you might have seen, you know, back in the day.

500
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And there's some advantages to that, like the larger reach that you can get

501
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
as YouTube gets more and more popular.

502
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But there's disadvantages too.

503
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah.

504
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So, okay.

505
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
See, the ultimate thing I wanted to say about analysis is I feel like

506
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
it just depends on different needs and plans I have

507
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
at different times as years go on.

508
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And this is why I was talking about getting out of loops, right?

509
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Where it used to be the given that I would watch every video

510
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
by every analysis channel that I kind of liked, right?

511
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And now I'm so insistent on getting myself out of that loop

512
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
that I feel the need to record a whole podcast

513
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
just to say that that's what I'm going to do

514
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
so that I feel accountable to myself to actually do it.

515
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And I have been doing a good job.

516
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I've barely been watching videos.

517
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I've barely been watching Digi's videos.

518
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I feel like I basically...

519
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's not like I'm done with analysis forever more.

520
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's just that I've spent enough time.

521
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I feel like it was like being a monk out in the mountains

522
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and meditating to find my center in regards to the creation of art.

523
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You know, I tried to make a video game back in 2014 and 2013

524
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and I failed miserably.

525
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And so I've spent like three years watching analysis videos

526
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
trying to like give it another shot

527
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
so I can fail slightly less miserably next time.

528
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And now that I'm basically doing that,

529
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I feel like, okay, I'm basically taking my entire viewership

530
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
of Extra Credits and Mr. B-Tongue and internalizing it.

531
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And I'm going to try and use that wisdom as much as possible

532
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and make a video game.

533
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And then when it's done, I'll see how bad it is

534
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and then whoever is the new cool kid in town,

535
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll fucking watch his videos and how wrong I was

536
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
to make the game that way.

537
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And I'll repeat the cycle anew.

538
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So this really, this video is a PSA for everyone, including me,

539
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
to not just be in training all the time.

540
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
If you are an artist, I feel like analysis is like training

541
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
or it's like finding your center and you just can't do it 24-7.

542
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I strongly, strongly disagree with that sentiment.

543
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Because, I don't know.

544
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Okay, people make, shit tons of people make fucking game

545
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and story analysis and stuff.

546
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And do you find that it comes that so much of what they say

547
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
ends up getting repeated,

548
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
so much of what they say is shared between them

549
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and they all coalesce into this hive mind

550
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
that all has the same opinions about what makes good art,

551
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
what makes good games or whatever.

552
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah, that's why you should then stop.

553
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I don't see how that's different from what I said earlier.

554
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I don't see how it's like contradictory.

555
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh, Ben, fuck you.

556
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I just don't, I don't think, I don't know,

557
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't think you should listen to anyone

558
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
about like what your art should be.

559
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I have a question for Davoo and Ben,

560
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
since you guys are more on the negative side

561
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
of analysis existing as a format.

562
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
If somebody in the audience wants to make analysis videos,

563
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
would you give them any advice or would you say don't do it?

564
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Is there a right way to do it?

565
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Honestly, unless they had some incredible gimmick

566
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
that I'd never heard before, I would say don't do it.

567
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I would say don't do it, yeah.

568
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So would you both tell Digi, like hey,

569
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
quit your main channel, let's just do Digi after dark?

570
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
No.

571
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No, don't say it, I fucking, that's my job too.

572
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm thinking about that one, I'm thinking real hard.

573
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Ben's not the biggest fan of Digi's main content as I recall.

574
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I watch Digi's main content, I don't know, it's fine, whatever.

575
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I mean to be honest, I kind of feel the same way about it.

576
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But if it disappeared, would I cry? No.

577
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Well, I would financially, but like in terms of,

578
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
this is what it is, right?

579
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Analysis Digi's channel has become for me like a day job

580
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
but in a really, really good way.

581
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Where I get just enough satisfaction out of it

582
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
to where when I'm done with it, I'm like man,

583
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
that was really worth my time.

584
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But it's not like I'm discovering all new planes of thought,

585
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
it's not like I'm like having to radically evolve myself,

586
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
which is good because it means that

587
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
it doesn't actually take that much of my time to like think about.

588
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I don't have to spend any time meditating trying to figure it out.

589
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Which leaves me with so much space in between

590
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
to fulfill my other ideas, which is to make a video game

591
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
which takes a whole lot of time.

592
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So basically I'm considering the analysis to be funding

593
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
my other artistic ambitions you see.

594
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And when it comes to the fact that I'm...

595
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So for me it's worth it, I think I honestly wonder

596
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
how much it's becoming like that for Digi too

597
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
because he just dropped a rap music video where I'm like

598
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
if he like lost everything and he had to pursue a rap career

599
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
he'd probably not have the worst odds at this point

600
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
because he's pretty close to like professional now.

601
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So yeah, I don't know.

602
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I mean I think it's a little...

603
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I mean I think whether or not you can fund yourself on your art

604
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
is kind of aside from the point of like

605
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
whether it's worthwhile as art in the first place.

606
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Like of course all these YouTubers that are all getting sanitized

607
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
because that's what gets the clicks.

608
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Like of course they're all doing it that way

609
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
because that's what makes the money.

610
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But that's the problem is that it makes it all fucking the same and shitty.

611
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I mean just think about the fact that like all the old animators

612
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
nobody makes animations of the level that we used to see

613
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
because it just doesn't pay anymore.

614
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That shit is gone by the wayside.

615
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You know what really used to happen on YouTube is

616
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
is people... is a paid content on YouTube needs to become regular

617
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and people need to like get used to the idea

618
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
that they're gonna drop like 15 cents every time they go on YouTube.

619
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That way animation can come back. That's my theory.

620
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Like I think I am not against...

621
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm not against the idea of a creator doing what is popular

622
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
or I'm not against the idea of someone doing

623
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
working in like a format because that's what works

624
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
at that time and place.

625
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I don't think Charles Dickens is a piece of shit

626
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
because he wrote fucking serialized shit in like newspaper or whatever.

627
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I don't hold that against him.

628
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That format is what worked at the time

629
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and it's the reason why his stories are the way they are and whatever.

630
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That's all well and good.

631
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But I do take issue with the idea of like deliberately making your content.

632
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
When you're not doing it because it's what works

633
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
or because it's what you wanted.

634
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's when you're just making it like everyone else

635
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
to like fit into this crowd.

636
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Because when everyone is doing that, then nobody is any good ever.

637
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't fucking know.

638
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I like... in 100 years is anyone gonna look back

639
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
at any of this analysis content and be impressed?

640
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Is anyone gonna give a shit?

641
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Have we gained anything?

642
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
That's a great question and I don't know.

643
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't think so.

644
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I mean, not unless it's somehow relevant to some...

645
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Are there any works of criticism that are like really famous historically?

646
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
In-defensive policy is pretty up there, but otherwise I can't think of many.

647
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
There are some.

648
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The Ghost in the Machine is like a response to Descartes' theories about Cartesian dualism.

649
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's basically an analysis piece on Descartes.

650
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I guess so.

651
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Here's another way of...

652
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Because every time we formulate what is the problem here,

653
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
each one is equally true and also not true.

654
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Here's another reformulation.

655
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's sort of a huge simultaneous everyone's getting old and running out of ideas effect.

656
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You see a dynamic new pop star or new rocker fucking person

657
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
or some other genre of music you like.

658
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Then they make three albums and then they make two albums that aren't as inspired

659
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and then they put out one album that's completely uninspired.

660
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This is sort of happening to a bunch of people simultaneously

661
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
because the whole scene was invented sort of around the early 2010s or so.

662
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm looking at Mr. Betung's channel right now.

663
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
His first video was five years ago.

664
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That video obviously came out about...

665
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
He had an idea, he really wanted to explain it

666
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
so much that it was worth all the pain in the ass of figuring out

667
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
how to use Windows Movie Maker for him.

668
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Back in 2012, that's what basically all of them were for the most part.

669
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It was always like, man, I have these ideas I really want to explain

670
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and so I'm going to make these videos to get my thoughts out there

671
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
because otherwise it's going to bug the shit out of me.

672
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The thing about Mr. Betung is that he's the only one I know

673
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
who remains exactly that.

674
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
He only makes a video when it's something he really wants to bitch at people about

675
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and has never started doing it for the sake of justifying itself.

676
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Which I know is a trap that Tom fell into immediately

677
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
with the pony analysis thing where he dropped a couple that he cared about

678
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and now he's like, oh, well, now I need the money

679
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
so I'm going to force myself to care about it.

680
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's the same as a band's first sellout album.

681
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Where they're just doing it for the sake of doing itself.

682
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
That's kind of what gets me when the analysis becomes...

683
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah, when it exists just for its own sake.

684
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Or when a channel exists for its own sake.

685
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Or when an artist, when a fucking YouTuber is just putting out shit

686
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and it's just there because you want to see this guy

687
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and it doesn't even matter what he says.

688
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I really hate the whole idea of a cult of personality

689
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that just exists for its own sake

690
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and that's why I've been really resistant to the dick show

691
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and even though I liked him on Biggest Problem

692
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I don't want to fucking watch the dick show

693
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
because I don't want to tune in every week

694
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
to hear a commercial for how cool dick is.

695
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
That's exactly how I felt too,

696
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
even though I haven't watched all of Biggest Problem.

697
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It just sounded like that to me.

698
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But there is good news.

699
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I have the solution to this problem

700
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and I don't have the materials on hand just yet

701
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
but the solution to all this shit you're talking about

702
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
is post-scarcity

703
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
because once nobody needs to make any money

704
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
like do you think that fucking...

705
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
God, I don't know.

706
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Whoever.

707
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Do you think anyone is going to make a shitty YouTube channel

708
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
where they review something once they're bored with it?

709
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Honestly?

710
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
If they don't need money anymore?

711
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yes, because if there's no money

712
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
people would just do it for the popularity.

713
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah, they'll crave the attention.

714
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But no one will...

715
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I think post-scarcity will get lots of like

716
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
suicide on YouTube.

717
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Let me work out the kinks on that.

718
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
People will just like upload...

719
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
There'll be mass suicide

720
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and people will just upload it onto YouTube

721
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and YouTube won't even take it down

722
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
because death doesn't scare anyone anymore.

723
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Hey, you know what?

724
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
If there's mass suicide at that point, that's great

725
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
because the only people left will be the people

726
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
strong enough to survive in that kind of environment

727
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and they'll breed the superior race.

728
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I can't wait for that to happen.

729
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yup.

730
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Alright, well I guess that's basically the end of that point.

731
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
This is a mini episode after all

732
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
so we should end at 42 minutes.

733
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes?

734
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
How...

735
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Can I make one last point before we end?

736
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Absolutely.

737
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Alright.

738
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Okay, and it was just...

739
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You guys...

740
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You, Davoo, we're saying something about...

741
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Like you were talking about music, for example,

742
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and like something about them being...

743
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Like, you know, a band makes an album

744
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and it's inspired.

745
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And then they make another album

746
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and it's inspired.

747
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And then they make another one

748
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and it's not inspired.

749
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
What I wanted to ask about is, like,

750
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
what do you mean by inspired?

751
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Like, what...

752
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
What is the utility of an inspired album

753
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
versus a non-inspired one?

754
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What's the difference there?

755
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Um, is it better?

756
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Why is it better?

757
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Well, it depends on the bands.

758
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Um, but like even...

759
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Just think of any one.

760
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Any example you want.

761
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Even with bands where a lot of their albums

762
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
or even if almost all their albums are good.

763
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I mean, like, Steeley Dan is the first example I think of

764
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
because I've listened to all their albums a bunch of times.

765
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Well, they're a bad example if they're all good.

766
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Well, the thing is, is that the first album

767
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I do enjoy slightly differently

768
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
because each song, like, feels more unique

769
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
from every other song in that particular track listing.

770
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Whereas all their other albums,

771
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
many of which I might even like more than the first one,

772
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
it feels more like they're like this cohesive thing.

773
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Um...

774
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Okay, well hang on.

775
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I understand what you're saying

776
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and that's perfectly fine.

777
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But that's not really what I wanted to ask about.

778
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What I'm sort of asking at is,

779
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
like, what is the purpose of a band

780
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
that makes a good album?

781
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What is the world's gain?

782
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Finding good music to listen to.

783
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah, what does that do for us?

784
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The music is the point.

785
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So, like, people listen to it and enjoy it and then what?

786
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
They live their life better?

787
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Is that it?

788
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No.

789
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
No, they just enjoy it.

790
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That's all.

791
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Nate, this is what you're saying is,

792
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
this line of reasoning is reductionism

793
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
by making it too big of scale.

794
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't know.

795
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I think Nate might have a good point.

796
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
What if people just enjoy

797
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
hearing their opinions regurgitated in an analysis?

798
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Isn't that as valuable as a good album of music?

799
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That's kind of the comparison I wanted to make.

800
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh, God.

801
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh, no.

802
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
God.

803
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Yeah, shit.

804
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Ben, people can like things that you don't like.

805
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Is that the point?

806
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
No, no.

807
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I'm saying, oh, no,

808
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
because I don't think I can argue against that point.

809
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I finally have one of these.

810
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
If you can see that music is valuable

811
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
because it makes people happy,

812
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I think you also have to concede that analysis

813
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
that makes people happy is equally valuable.

814
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
God.

815
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
No.

816
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh, no.

817
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Unless you're like me,

818
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and you don't see value in music,

819
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and you think the only purpose of that

820
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
should be to educate people on better ways

821
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
to improve human society.

822
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Well, you know what?

823
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Okay, here.

824
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Objective value.

825
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I do have an analogy.

826
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Parallel to...

827
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah, I just lost.

828
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I need a sporty pig with this.

829
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You can't fucking argue.

830
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That's all, folks.

831
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You can't argue against fun.

832
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You can't argue against what do people like.

833
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Now it just comes down to,

834
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I like it and you don't.

835
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah.

836
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But I really don't like it, though.

837
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Well, we should defer to Ben on this matter.

838
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

839
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Here's my parallel.

840
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I think about what is the most, you know,

841
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
like derivative analysis,

842
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and I think what's the most like derivative music

843
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
that I like and why that would be a future funk.

844
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You can just put on the whole playlist.

845
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It doesn't really matter which.

846
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's all the same,

847
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
but I like it always entirely

848
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
because it's good to jack off

849
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
while playing in the background.

850
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So the question is,

851
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
who can I jack off while it plays in the background?

852
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Monkey Jones.

853
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I can't jack off.

854
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So there you go.

855
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That's the ultimate answer.

856
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't actually...

857
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I think I missed something.

858
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Okay.

859
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
All right.

860
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hey, let's end this so I can go pee.

861
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That sounds good.

862
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Is there anything else?

863
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Is there anything else to say?

864
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That is all to say.

865
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm good.

866
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I feel like we've accomplished nothing here.

867
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah.

868
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Of course we did.

869
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
There was no hope.

870
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I honestly think there's going to be a lot of people.

871
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
My goal is that there are some people,

872
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
some TPC viewers,

873
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
who to whom that exact armchair diagnosis I came up with

874
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
completely applies to them,

875
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and that this would be something they haven't thought of.

876
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
The whole being stuck in a loop

877
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
of just watching analysis.

878
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Oh, yeah.

879
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I am so young.

880
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And there are people talking about how they used to...

881
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Even it's been around like a year,

882
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
but they used to love the PCP,

883
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
but they feel kind of done with it.

884
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Like they've gotten out of it all that they're going to,

885
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and I think that's kind of similar to what you're talking about.

886
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That's like half the members right now.

887
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Are you talking about the members

888
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
or are you talking about the audience?

889
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
No, no.

890
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm talking about the audience.

891
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm talking about the audience here,

892
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
the members too.

893
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah.

894
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Mm-hmm.

895
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yep.

896
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Well, I think sometimes these things,

897
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
these podcasts kind of seem formatted

898
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
like we're trying to win,

899
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
but that's not it.

900
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Like we're not trying to find the solution.

901
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I think we just had a discussion,

902
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and hopefully we generate more discussion

903
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
from the audience in the comments.

904
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We're not here to find the answer,

905
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
so I think this was a worthwhile podcast.

906
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The goal is don't get bored.

907
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Don't get bored.

908
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That is the goal.

909
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Sure.

910
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
That's the goal of our life.

911
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That's our goal.

912
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And that's your goal viewer.

913
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But why not get bored?

914
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
No.

915
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Okay, I'm done.

916
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
What's the purpose of...

917
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Nate, this is Nate, Colin.

918
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
What's the purpose of boredom?

919
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Starfleet, like everything else.

920
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Starfleet.

921
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Starfleet.

922
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Starfleet.

923
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It all comes back to Starfleet.

924
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Will there be any boredom post-scarcity?

925
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
All roads lead to Starfleet.

926
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Yes.

927
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
There will be no boredom post-scarcity.

928
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
There will be nothing but boredom post-scarcity.

929
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
That's what you think.

930
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That's what half the post-scarcity stories are like.

931
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Humanity will change.

932
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Humanity will change and adapt.

933
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Okay.

934
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We'll get there another day.

935
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
For the PCP Mini,

936
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I've been Momkey Jones.

937
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Ben Sane.

938
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Best guy ever, Nate.

939
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Davoo.

940
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Out.

941
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We're...

942
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Goodbye.

943
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So long.

944
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Bye.
