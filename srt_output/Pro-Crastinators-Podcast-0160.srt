00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another clusterfuck of an episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am your host today, Tom Oliver, and we got a host of degenerates with us to talk about whatever the fuck comes up from our brain matters.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We got Digibro.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm alive for you. I'm awake because of you.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm flattered. We got Mage.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Pie Chicken, Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Pie Chicken, Pizza Hut McDonald's, McDonald's, Big Donald's, Big McDonald's, Pizza Hut McDonald's.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're on endless war for the bit there, and then a deviated drastically.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I just always.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
To get us back on track, we have Munchy with tiny hats.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Whoa, heaven let your light shine down.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We have Nate.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,040
I'm at the Pizza Hut. I'm at the Taco Bell. I'm at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. That's me.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,280
My favorite.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,040
And of course, the one, the only, the yang-gang himself, Ben Zayn.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,400
We've got the American Jesus. See him on the interstate.

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,880
We've got the American Jesus. He'll ever whelming millions every day. You guys like bad religion?

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:38,000
Ben, Ben, how's it feel to be on the cutting edge of political thought, Ben? How's it feel to be on the fucking, on the forefront?

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
It's exhilarating, Munchie. Exhilarating.

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,000
Titillating. Listen, you just, you just, you know, you know, blind yourself for the aesthetic, you know,

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,880
if the Mac parallels, walk up to a nearby cliff edge and just spout your fucking drivel for all the

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,000
pros to waddle up in here every single day. And soon enough, you're gonna be more powerful than the president.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,280
Here's the thing. Thing about bad religion, I realize, is it's basically Linkin Park in the sense that it is like purely,

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:13,600
it is pure, it trades on pure emotionality over any like, like real, only, only the villain,

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:21,200
only the villain that is being railed against is just like, you know, society, bad politicians, you know,

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:32,800
evil, general evils of society, capitalism and all that, you know, rich people, instead of with Linkin Park, it's just teen angst,

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,200
just general angst. So once you hit your 20s, you just switch over? I like that better. Ben, you're so fucking killer, poor dude.

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,760
You just love being a teen. You love hating your parents. You love rebelling against the system. You're the most like killer core

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,760
person on earth. Why would I, why would you ever stop? Why would you ever want to grow out of it? Every, every single, like,

29
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,600
you know what, every single thought you have, I think that's an interesting thought. Then I, then I weave it back into the

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,200
overall Benson narrative. And I think, oh, this is actually like, you know, extremely in character. There's no

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,160
deviation. It sounds like every step that Ben takes is another mistake to you.

32
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,600
Ben, when we were young, we listened to Bad Religion, Alien, Ant Farm, obviously you led because you were the older

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,900
one. My friend, you remember my friend, Stefan. There are people who listen to Alien, Ant Farm. Absolutely. Well, let me

34
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,080
tell you about it. Pretty much just that one single. Any, are you okay? Right? Yeah, you're okay. You're okay. Now,

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Ben, do you remember?

36
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:37,440
Well, whatever. It's good. It's a good cover. I think they're both good in different ways. But Ben, remember when we were

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,440
young? My friend, Stefan, made me, he burned me a CD of a bunch of Bad Religion music and like a couple other

38
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,960
things, including that Alien, Ant Farm cover. Yep. Just to introduce me to his favorite band and I listened to it over

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,040
and over and over again. Ben, I remember there was a time, I briefly, that played on the air and I remember you

40
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,120
said, uh, that's my favorite band. That's my favorite band right there. What, Alien, Ant Farm? Yeah. Yeah, that was a brief

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,160
period. Yeah, dude, absolutely. Alien, Ant Farm was never my favorite band. And I remember, okay, this is why I

42
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,360
think that, because I remember a brief episode where I said, hey, Ben, I've got, I've got a surprise for you. I've got a

43
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:22,400
secret to tell you, Ben. No, no. And it's that, guess what my favorite band also is? Your unrelated reasons. It's Alien, Ant

44
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,160
Farm, dude. And the rage, Ben, the rage at the fact that I would dare insist that your favorite band was also my

45
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,480
favorite band, you know, was enough to shatter galaxies. It exploded. I, I don't, the blows rained down on me from

46
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,680
all. I believe both of you. I believe that that wasn't Ben's favorite band and that he was that mad anyway.

47
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,680
I think it should be that mad at anyone whose favorite band is Alien, Ant Farm.

48
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,640
Yeah. All right, that's fair. Okay. All right. Yeah, good times. But then I grew up in and the cure became my favorite

49
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:04,680
band. Yeah. Okay. Really? Yeah. What an amazing musical history you guys have. Mine was disturbed for a very long

50
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:13,080
while. Oh, that's really, that makes a total sense to me weirdly. Just like, because all their songs are, they have the

51
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:20,640
same kind of underlying aesthetic as the kind of stuff you like that like, I'm going to explode and murder everyone around

52
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:29,120
me. No, no, mommy, don't do it again. Don't do it again. I'll be a good boy. I'll be a good boy. You know, early musical

53
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,160
taste is very incredible. So I mean, it seems totally natural that just when you're young, whatever music is around

54
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,480
will like the first shit you hear will just be your favorite. I remember the first time I realized music was

55
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:50,040
good was listening to the cure on someone CD at Boy Scout Camp. And I was like, entranced. I was like, whoa, is that music? I don't

56
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,400
fucking get it. But now I do get it. This is like good.

57
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,720
The reason why is because this was before Lime Wire, like back when you first got it. So you weren't spoiled for choice yet.

58
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,360
You couldn't just go on Lime Wire and find 10 billion songs. Like the world is at my fingertips. I mean, even today,

59
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,960
whatever the kid, like the first song he listens to and likes, he'll be like, well, that's my favorite song. Therefore, whatever's

60
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,440
popular will just be somebody's favorite.

61
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:23,840
I just remembered I think the reason why the reason why Stefan burned me that CD was because I brought it up to him because I

62
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,400
had heard some bad religion. So there was like one bad religion song on the soundtrack to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater

63
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,880
2. And I was like, I like that song. And I talked to him and he's like, oh, yeah, I know that band. I'll burn you some, some, some

64
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:44,480
tunes from that's nice. And I was like, cool. What a champ. Yeah, friends are cool. Shout out to Stefan. What a good guy. Shout out to

65
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,200
Stefan.

66
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,000
So is Stefan Molyneux?

67
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,840
Rest in peace.

68
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:00,120
Every day, I'm robbed of having this fucking teen musical experience, because I'm convinced that like, if you're above

69
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:09,040
30, you don't know what like headphones are. Because every single day, I have the same ritual. I go downstairs. I'm trying

70
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,760
to mind my own business. I'm just trying to get in and out of the kitchen as fast as possible before the mobs start

71
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,200
to spawn. But you know, it's like when you run into like a mob of spawning, you just try and raid the chest for all the

72
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,840
cookies and all the watermelon seeds. And then of course, the skeleton start to spawn in rows of three. I try and do that

73
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,880
but with scrambled eggs instead of cookies. So I sprint downstairs, usually trying to do this. Like I debate doing the

74
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:40,320
Super Mario 64 and long jump down the stairs and break all my bones. Every single day I get closer and closer to doing it.

75
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,960
And I'm going to die that way, I guarantee you. Anyway, I'm downstairs. And then I have my headphones in, you know, listening to

76
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,360
music, you know, thrashing about a little bit. And then every single day, every single moment when I have my headphones

77
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,960
in, people just try and talk to me. And it's like, guys, listen, I understand. I understand I'm your son, you want to speak

78
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:08,120
to me. Say to me, hey, let's speak now. And then I'll take off my headphones. Just stop. I'm always like this. Learn

79
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,760
my routine, learn how I am. Please, I beg you, I just want to be undisturbed. And then when I take them off, I'm not even

80
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:23,440
spoken to. Mom, I hate, I hate my parents. I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna listen to bad romance to load up that CD

81
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,880
bin.

82
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,640
Would you like to see how it feels, mommy? Here it comes.

83
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,960
Have you guys heard of the band tattoo? TATU?

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
TATU.

85
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,760
My sister loved that band.

86
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,920
Two girls and two sisters?

87
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,160
I don't remember there.

88
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,320
No, it's too hot Russians who make out and shit.

89
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,040
Maybe they're also sisters.

90
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
That was the whole point was that they make out.

91
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,680
Yeah, I think I'm confusing them with another like sister duo.

92
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,800
I don't think they were sisters. But yeah, they had the whole lesbian thing on. Like, I really liked their music before they

93
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,800
started singing in English. And there was this one song I don't even remember what it was called. But I like my sister had

94
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,800
a CD and I just played like the first song on loop for hours. And then I remember her coming into my room all

95
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,640
angry. It's like, can't you stop listening to that same song? It's depressing as shit. And me, me not understanding Russian

96
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,560
was like, oh, okay.

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,840
Me, an intellectual.

98
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,560
Another band.

99
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,720
Me, an intellectual committing suicide.

100
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:33,320
Another band that really shaped my life. Like, I have only been to one concert. It was of this band, the band Lordy actually

101
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:41,440
listened to their songs yesterday and it was like, oh, the good old times. And I had a Lord Lordy. Yeah, I'm sending in the chat.

102
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,400
The image of Lordy is, are you familiar with guar?

103
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
They're, yeah, they're the ones that wear like the rubber.

104
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,200
I had the biggest question the lead singer.

105
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,040
Guar is the ones that wear like the rubber like monster costumes.

106
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,360
Yes. Yeah, Lordy also does that, except that they're the like the the Christian version.

107
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,600
That sounds incredibly killer.

108
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,440
Look at the second chat, the gross disgusting chat.

109
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,440
This is crazy.

110
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,800
That I had, I had a huge crush now.

111
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,400
Whoa, this is the sickest shit.

112
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,680
Dude, this is just steam steam powered giraffe.

113
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,880
Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, kind of.

114
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,840
By the way, which one did you like?

115
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,640
Which one did you like?

116
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,400
The lead singer.

117
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,720
The one in the middle.

118
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,040
Okay, like in the makeup around me.

119
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,240
And I don't know how he looks out of the makeup.

120
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,680
Yeah, yeah, oh my God, the face of the knee.

121
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,440
Oh my God, the severed face on his kneecap.

122
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,760
That's fucking sick.

123
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,880
Look at his belt buckle.

124
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,080
It's another face with a bit with a severed face.

125
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,360
You know, mage makes a lot more sense now.

126
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,480
I'm not going to lie.

127
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,000
Like this explains a lot.

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,760
Oh, look at the artistry on that, though.

129
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,800
You know, this is super sick.

130
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,000
It was a super sick.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
It's pretty sick.

132
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,840
I'm all about it.

133
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,080
You know, this guy should be in Halloween too, mage.

134
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,880
Don't forget to include him.

135
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,640
I'm still waiting for it to come out.

136
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,160
The first the first bands that I got into,

137
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,680
my friend was burning me CDs with like

138
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
Demo Borgia and Children of Bodom and Shakespeare.

139
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,800
He was super into metal.

140
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
And that's how I got into it.

141
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,400
I was I was I was part of the goth click in my high school.

142
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,080
But I was like, I was just kind of a hanger on like I had,

143
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,160
you know, had like one pair of fucking hot topic trap pants.

144
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,560
You know, I had some I had black t-shirts.

145
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,520
I had long hair pants, Ben.

146
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,080
Trip pants, not TRIPP trip.

147
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,800
OK, yeah, trip, you know, yeah, with like the bondage rings

148
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,600
and all the zippers and shit.

149
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,680
I had one pair of of acid blue trip.

150
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,080
What? Oh, you got to go classic black.

151
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,640
No, man, I had the blue and black checkered pattern, you know,

152
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,240
and like they that's not what was great about them was that.

153
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,200
Well, no, they were more like punk, like a neo goth or something.

154
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,520
Whatever, they came from hot topic.

155
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Who gives a shit? Right.

156
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,520
What was great about them is I wore them to every convention

157
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,120
because they had just these fucking insanely massive pockets.

158
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,080
And it was like having two mobile purses on your.

159
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,600
You could steal everything.

160
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
No one would know.

161
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Yeah, well, like one time was my friend, Josh, used to wear

162
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,560
trip exclusively wore a pair of black trip pants.

163
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,160
And we went to see a movie one time and he had put like a whole

164
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:35,720
two liter of Mountain Dew in like a whole box of KFC in one pocket.

165
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,200
Dude, imagine like imagine the marshal potential there.

166
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,800
But you do like a spinning roundhouse kick and explode an entire

167
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,240
Mountain Dew container on someone's fucking face.

168
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,760
It was for acid damage.

169
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,480
You always have to carry all this bullshit, like all the extra schedules

170
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,240
and maps and shit. And so I would just have.

171
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,800
Yeah, I just I just I just want to paint a picture of my click.

172
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
So I was in this goth click, but I was more of a hanger on.

173
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,280
I didn't go to like concerts or anything there.

174
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,720
There were like two there were like two guys who were sort of the de facto

175
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,040
like top dogs and everyone else.

176
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,520
And like those guys like found bands.

177
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,720
Those guys went to concerts.

178
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,520
Those guys were hard.

179
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,360
They had like a ton of fucking like that.

180
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm impressed that your fucking goth click actually like did things

181
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,680
because at my school, the goth click was just a bunch of stoners who did nothing.

182
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,960
Not all of them, but a few of them did.

183
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,680
And so their music, their musical tastes kind of trickled down.

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,040
Right. And Steph.

185
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,000
Stefan was in it, too.

186
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,440
My other friend who and he he had the pants.

187
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,480
He didn't go to like concerts, but he was he would he found me anyway.

188
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,520
They're their musical their musical discovery is all trickled down.

189
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,640
And so I was I was given like, yeah, children of Bodum and Cradle of Filth and stuff.

190
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,560
And I was like, yeah, well, I guess this is what I like now.

191
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,120
Dark time for music.

192
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,960
That was yeah.

193
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,400
Yeah, I think it was the worst show ever.

194
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,320
My they are the worst band ever.

195
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,640
One time my friends were over in my basement playing Dungeons and Dragons

196
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,840
or procrastinating and not playing Dungeons and Dragons just fucking around

197
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,840
shame instead of playing and someone put on a Cradle of Filth album

198
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,200
and our dad came down and I with with disdain in his voice.

199
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
He asked it was really funny.

200
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,200
He asked, like, oh, how did he say it?

201
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,880
It was like, hmm, so what are you listening to?

202
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,080
Songs about devil worship?

203
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,640
And I was like, yeah, I like sputtered with rage.

204
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,160
Don't fucking.

205
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,800
What? No.

206
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
Satan's misunderstood, dad.

207
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,040
You will never get it.

208
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,480
Basically. And he never and he never did.

209
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,880
Does have some songs about devil worship.

210
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,000
They absolutely do.

211
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,280
At one hundred percent.

212
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,480
It was wrong.

213
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,880
But he was uncool about it.

214
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,240
It's really funny because at that point in history,

215
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,520
my mom was way into black metal, specifically because it's about devil worship.

216
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,880
Our dad likes smooth jazz.

217
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,360
James Taylor, James.

218
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,640
Yeah, James Taylor, who I have.

219
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,800
I have come to appreciate some of the stuff that our dad liked.

220
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,880
Carolina on my mind.

221
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,080
Absolute banger.

222
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,880
Absolute banger of a song.

223
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,800
I've come I've come to love James Taylor.

224
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,200
I've come to love Genesis.

225
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah. And so that was all good.

226
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,040
However, he did have a habit of putting on like very, very dull,

227
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,760
like, on basically unlistnable, like smooth jazz, like medleys.

228
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,000
Well, that was just the anime study music of his generation.

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,680
He said it pretty much.

230
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,520
Chill beats to study too. Yeah.

231
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,920
It's true.

232
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,800
But I don't like it.

233
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,480
Me neither.

234
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,440
Hey, by the way, speaking of bad shows, I know this is a bit.

235
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,360
I think this is a bit of a cliche, but it's just that my buddy, John,

236
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,640
once went to a a Dragon Force concert and said it was like the dullest

237
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,240
piece of shit show I had ever been to.

238
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
I know exactly.

239
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,920
No, they're not slow, not because I've seen them twice.

240
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,080
And the first time it was early in the day because they were like the first

241
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,400
band at Oz Fest, and it was actually great.

242
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,120
They played all their songs accurately.

243
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,800
They had a couple of trampolines they're bouncing off of and shit.

244
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,560
It was cool as fuck.

245
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,080
So then they headlined a show and me and my brother Victor, because Victor is

246
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,200
a biggest fucking Dragon Force fan in the world at the time.

247
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,120
It was his favorite band is all he listened to.

248
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,880
We saw them live and they were all clearly fucked up.

249
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,320
Like, OK, OK, in different ways.

250
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,640
Like the singer was drunk.

251
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,080
The guitarist was on was seemed to be on Coke or something.

252
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,880
And then like one guy is like on speed.

253
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,680
Like they're all on different drugs.

254
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,280
And they sound like they're all on different drugs.

255
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,240
Like everybody's playing their parts wrong.

256
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,080
And so they sounded like shit to the fucking.

257
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,320
OK, the drummer just seemed like he was playing a blast beat nonstop

258
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,640
with no thought like he was just like, oh, this is what the drums are.

259
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,080
The guitarists were like playing the wrong parts at time.

260
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,960
And I swear to God, there was one part where one of the guitarists, Sam

261
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,480
Topman, was like playing the wrong solo.

262
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,600
And I think somebody was like trying to tell him.

263
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,760
And I saw him mouth to the guy.

264
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,120
They all sound the same.

265
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,840
In many ways, the guitarists said that.

266
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,680
Yes. And like the singer kept like throwing water onto the crowd and shit.

267
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,400
And he just seemed like pissed off for some reason.

268
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,760
Dude, they're getting too hot, getting fizzled.

269
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,640
Dude, it was a miserable show.

270
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,840
I literally deleted all their music off my computer after that show.

271
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,840
I was like, how old were you, how old were you like 18?

272
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,160
Yeah, OK, OK.

273
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,800
The illusion was shattered.

274
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,640
That's rough. I mean, I guess I guess touring will take a toll on you after a while.

275
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,440
I well, I've heard a lot of stories about the fact that they suck live.

276
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,080
And I think it's just because they do a lot of drugs.

277
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,640
Like definitely possible, because they like when when I saw them earlier

278
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,200
in the day, they were fine, because they hadn't started drinking yet.

279
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,400
And like at that that Ozfest, I met the two guitarists, because they were

280
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,080
just kind of wandering around, talking to random people.

281
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,840
And they were both of them are completely incomprehensible,

282
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,280
because I don't know if you know, but Dragon Force is a super group

283
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,080
and they're all from different countries and they all have no fucking idea.

284
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,280
All right. So they come over.

285
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,320
Is that Chinese guy who like actually Chinese?

286
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,920
Or is he? Yeah, he's actually Chinese and sick.

287
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,400
And the other guitarist is like just British and they're but they were both

288
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,520
sloshed because like we saw them somewhat after their show

289
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,200
and they were coming up to us, telling us how there is two Catholic girls

290
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,440
who they were trying to fuck because they were really hot.

291
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,920
But they're like they're both neither of them.

292
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,640
I think they're both virgins and they were like trying to pitch to us

293
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,760
this dilemma of like, should we fuck the hot girls we already have?

294
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,760
Who might not put out or should we go hunting for new hot girls?

295
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But this came out like, yeah, well, we got this whole fucking bitches.

296
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,840
Like they're totally sloshed, incomprehensible.

297
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,120
Wait, wait, OK.

298
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,960
So he was describing to this to you a random fan asking for your advice

299
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,320
on which hot girls people it was me and Victor and my cousin, Boyd.

300
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,160
And like they had come to us after talking to another group of random people.

301
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,960
Like they were making fun of this.

302
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,320
Consensus, they were like an opinion.

303
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,560
They were yelling this out on stage or they were.

304
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,640
No, they're just walking around and this is like a huge festival as a Ozfest show.

305
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,000
So like there's, you know, food stalls and shit.

306
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,280
And they're just like walking around the stall area talking to random people.

307
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,400
And like there we came up to them because we had seen them talking

308
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,200
to these other two guys and they were making fun of this dude

309
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,200
because he was wearing this shirt for like a Christian hardcore band

310
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
that was at the show and POD.

311
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,680
No, POD is not a hardcore band.

312
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,720
God damn it.

313
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,760
Anyway, they were making fun of it because it had like a dinosaur on it.

314
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,280
And they were like, doesn't isn't dinosaurs evolution?

315
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,320
I can't have that on a Christian band.

316
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,280
And like, OK, it was funny.

317
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,840
Then and then after the last show, because the headliner I think was Slipknot,

318
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,520
after that show, we're leaving the pit and the two guys are just like kind of

319
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,160
standing at the entrance of the pit, like high-fiving people as they walk out.

320
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,360
And they said to us, we fucked those two girls.

321
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,160
They were awful. Yeah, all right.

322
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,840
OK, makes sense. Makes sense.

323
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,000
Virgins. It's terrible. No, that's great.

324
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,800
So, yeah, after that show, I was like, I wonder how the girls felt about it.

325
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,680
And we never we never got to hear their side.

326
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm sure they were fucking terrible, too.

327
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,440
They're both shitfaced.

328
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,680
Like they probably whiskey dick out the fucking ass.

329
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,200
But yeah, it was like after that show, I was like, oh, Dragon Force

330
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,880
are so cool, we got to meet them and stuff.

331
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,920
That is the second time never listening to this band again.

332
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. All right.

333
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,880
Well, that's a fascinating story.

334
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,920
Yeah, I can't believe that they were so forthcoming with with asking

335
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,840
just random people up.

336
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,720
But it's so cool that they were that they were just walking around

337
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,480
seemingly aimlessly begging for advice.

338
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,680
Who's going to criticize them?

339
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,400
Who's going to be like, too much information, Mr.

340
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,280
Dragon Force, man?

341
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,960
I mean, it was such a.

342
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I wish he was fucking me instead.

343
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,560
It was legendary in particular

344
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,960
because it was the two guitarists who like, you know, they like stand back

345
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,280
to back and play guitars on stage and shit.

346
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,680
You just have the sense that like they've just become this power duo

347
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,640
who doesn't just hangs out and tries to fuck girls together.

348
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,920
I imagine they did it in front of each other, like going by the way

349
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,160
the story is playing out.

350
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
It had to be all in the same place.

351
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,760
Thank goodness.

352
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,480
I mean, or that reminds me of the time that I met X celebrity

353
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,600
at a grocery store in Los Angeles.

354
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Tom Cruise, I told him how cool it was to meet him in person.

355
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,440
But I didn't want to be a douche

356
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,520
and bother him and ask for photos for anything.

357
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,640
He said, oh, like you're doing now.

358
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,840
I was taken aback.

359
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,400
And all I could say was, huh?

360
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,360
And he kept cutting me off, going, huh, huh, huh?

361
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,400
And closing his hands in front of my face.

362
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,200
I walked away and continued with my shopping and heard him chuckle as I walked off.

363
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,040
When I came to pay for my stuff up front,

364
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,760
I saw him try to walk out of the doors with like 15 milky ways in his ass.

365
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Has anyone put a stop to this?

366
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,160
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional.

367
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,600
And she was like, sir, we need to pay for those first.

368
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,800
But first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her,

369
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,280
but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

370
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,840
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times,

371
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,800
he stopped her and told her to scan individually to prevent electrical interference.

372
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,880
He said and turned around and winked at me.

373
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,680
I didn't even think that's a word.

374
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,560
After he scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price,

375
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,680
he kept interrupting her.

376
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
He's laughing.

377
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
He's just laughing.

378
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
At a copy pasta.

379
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,880
I'm sure he's read a hundred times.

380
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,960
Oh, it's one of the best.

381
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,520
It's one of the best.

382
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,480
All right, that's it.

383
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
I'm done.

384
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,480
That's a great story, though.

385
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,840
Tom Cruise, sorry, we had a bad first meeting.

386
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Was it Tom Cruise?

387
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,440
I thought it was.

388
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,200
Apparently, the origin is Flying Lotus, whoever that is.

389
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,280
I don't know who that is.

390
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,080
I've heard it with music, man, I think.

391
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,240
No, electronic musician, Flying Lotus.

392
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,960
He's a he just did a music video that was made by Shinichiro Watanabe.

393
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,880
Oh, sick.

394
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,800
Yeah.

395
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,680
And he's the guy who who I wrapped over in my Shintaro Kago video.

396
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,040
That was a flying lotus song because he had a cover.

397
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,880
Meeting celebs at fucking in a.k.a.

398
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,040
real celebs or fake celebs, E celebs is always a magical experience.

399
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,720
It's always the highlight of cons.

400
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,360
We see them, you know, outside of the smoke and mirrors game

401
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,120
at the console playing, just walking around, maybe being a hot dog

402
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,080
or a pretzel with cheese sauce, just walking around and you know

403
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
that you can engage them at any time.

404
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,040
Are you among them, doctor?

405
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,200
Well, who literally feel that way about you.

406
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,360
That's true.

407
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,520
That's true.

408
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:46,160
So then I would initially imagine actually and expo, not the legendary

409
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,960
expo, but last an expo was particularly weird because I was like stopped

410
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,080
more like vastly more so than one would think.

411
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,040
Like very often, like very often, like I think like seven times a day.

412
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,520
That's a lot.

413
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,040
I know for fucking little old me.

414
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,720
So it was extremely weird.

415
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,080
It was extremely weird to be in that scenario because from my perspective,

416
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,240
it's not as though like I'm I have like a panel or like, you know,

417
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,640
I'm an anime guru or man.

418
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,360
Your face isn't even online that much comparatively speaking.

419
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,280
Yeah, that's also another thing to think about that a lot of times people.

420
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,160
I don't know what people like imagine me as.

421
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,280
Maybe they imagine me as my curvy avatar or something like that.

422
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,120
I guess your image is pretty powerful, though.

423
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,920
Like people are aware of what you look like.

424
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,840
Yeah, what were you wearing?

425
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,240
Were you in like a pizza jumpsuit?

426
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,000
Because I was definitely I was I was in the pizza jumpsuit.

427
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,480
One of the days I was I was in the curvy shirt.

428
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,960
I was in my iconic wear.

429
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,600
So that's OK. Good.

430
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,280
I'm so happy people don't know how I look like.

431
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,040
Yeah, that's a plus.

432
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,840
I'm terrified of people stopping me in the middle of a street being high mage.

433
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,440
And I I I'm spooked.

434
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,480
Well, you got to try it.

435
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,680
Well, it's awesome with that.

436
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,120
No, I'm scared.

437
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,760
I got scared.

438
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,200
Well, how are they going to they're going to praise you?

439
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,240
Are you like, oh, I mean, the thing about it is

440
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,920
once you're in that position, you cannot go back.

441
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,160
So like, you know, I get being cautious about it.

442
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,040
And frankly, I mean, I don't know, I've been listening a little bit to like

443
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,080
with this like James Charles shit going on or whatever.

444
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,160
I don't know, just for whatever reason,

445
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,520
I've been looking back at like a couple of like fucking like PewDiePie.

446
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,800
Like what is it?

447
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,920
The controversy memes.

448
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,160
And there was one about, I don't know, like foosie tube or something.

449
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,400
Whatever point was like PewDiePie was just saying like, yeah,

450
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,880
I fucking hate being in public.

451
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,920
It's the worst.

452
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,360
And I'm like, make make sense.

453
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,840
Probably gets harassed like a lot every time he's in public.

454
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,840
So you would be getting stopped everywhere, I would imagine.

455
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,160
And I know he's like, obviously the far reach,

456
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,760
like the most convenient stuff.

457
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,440
I enjoy it at a convention because you're going there.

458
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,400
You're kind of there for that, yeah.

459
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,880
And like if it happens randomly every once in a while,

460
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,960
like at my level of fame, it's exciting because it's like, wow,

461
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,720
people in the place I live know who I am.

462
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,480
That's cool.

463
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,280
And it's only happened like three times.

464
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,520
Well, maybe like five times.

465
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,760
Like, but yeah, it's it's I've been most of it was in Rochester.

466
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,200
Weirdly, like I would get one guy recognized.

467
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,640
We had a grocery store at a theme park and at the mall.

468
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,360
Like I think those are the convention there, right?

469
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,240
Did they have an anime convention?

470
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,760
Yeah, and I did the convention.

471
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,400
And, you know, obviously people knew who I was at the con.

472
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,560
But like I had never been stopped anywhere in Virginia Beach before.

473
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,080
But in Rochester, it was like a few times.

474
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,360
And like it's always like, wow, I feel like a walking legend, you know,

475
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,440
but like, yeah, yeah, it would very easily cross a threshold.

476
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,480
If it was happening even once a week, I would get right.

477
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,080
Right.

478
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,960
So with PewDiePie, it's got to be daily.

479
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,640
And none of us have really gotten to that point or even close.

480
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,080
So I mean, yeah, and like when you like the things like I'm two of my own

481
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,360
own or anything, it wasn't a convention, which vastly increases the odds.

482
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,160
But even sure, of course, still though.

483
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,440
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I should like VidCon where people are straight up in danger

484
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,120
because crowds are swarming to such ridiculous degrees.

485
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,040
Videos of VidCon are fucking crazy, dude.

486
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,560
They're like literal like swarms of dude.

487
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,720
OK, because it's it's totally dystopian.

488
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,560
It's it's fucking crazy seeing like a crowd of people all with their phones out,

489
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,800
circled or like surrounding Casey Neistat, all like with video cameras

490
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,760
about their head to vlog seeing Casey Neistat in the exact same experience

491
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,960
that all of these other like hundreds of people are doing.

492
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,800
So this person's vlog, if you're vlogging that moment, you're just like a fucking

493
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,280
like a complete sheep.

494
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,520
You have no agency whatsoever.

495
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,440
Just it is fascinating exact same fucking thing.

496
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,120
Things like that, things like that really seem to me to like make me believe

497
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,960
not only that like human beings are complete like sheep, but it's specifically

498
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,560
that like, oh my God, like my fellow human beings would absolutely like

499
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,320
trample me and tear me apart for the sake of like some small gain of their own.

500
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,240
I mean, not to that degree, but I was just thinking about this like yesterday

501
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,160
and I want to talk about it, that yeah, it fascinates me.

502
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,960
The level people will go to to just like touch fame,

503
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,440
even though it's not hard to get and it's like more work.

504
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,720
It's really well, it's really interesting to me like how people think of it

505
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,040
because I've seen plenty of people in online circles who just kind of become

506
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,600
friends with a lot of famous people by just messaging them and like literally

507
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,920
mean literally like, yeah, like there's there's lots of people just because

508
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,720
they work at that person and they think, oh, that seems like a cool guy who I

509
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,320
bet I could have a fun conversation with.

510
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,760
And so they just approach you and, you know, do so well.

511
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,080
And then like your friends and then there's other people who like view you.

512
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,760
If you even have like, say, 10,000 subscribers on YouTube, they think you're

513
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,800
like untouchable, like I can't believe you would have time to risk.

514
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,960
Like I still today have times where I respond to somebody's comment on YouTube

515
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,640
and they might be like, oh my God, I can't believe Digi Bro responded to me.

516
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,720
And I'm like, dude, I hang out in like a discord server of people.

517
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,080
Like I'm fucking easy to reach like message me.

518
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,800
I just don't know.

519
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,640
It's I just don't know.

520
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:32,800
And it's really funny because like my mom is very much a fame chaser of this sort.

521
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,640
And like she loves going to concerts and she always tries to meet the band.

522
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,760
Like she has, she's a huge fan of the band System of a Down and she like has, you

523
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,960
know, pictures she's taken with the band members that she like treasures.

524
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,480
Like they are, you know, the most important things she has is like these

525
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,000
pictures are like momentary interactions that she'll remember forever.

526
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,800
And like I, I, I guess I understand that.

527
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,640
But for me, I've gotten into a position where like the people who I look up to

528
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,160
or admire, I can just hang out with because I'm famous.

529
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,520
Like I got to go to Dick Masterson's house because he's never even seen

530
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,480
any of my content.

531
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,560
I don't think like I just am somebody who happens to be your lecture moderate.

532
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,680
Oh, except for the lecture.

533
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,080
Yeah.

534
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,440
But like he had had me on his show even before then just because he knew that

535
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,760
I was a guy who had a lot of followers who happened to be at his live show.

536
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,840
So he brought me on the show to talk about it.

537
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,840
And it's like, that is the basis of our relationship is I'm a guy who has

538
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,640
followers who is a fan of his, you know, and it's just funny for me to think that

539
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,720
like there are people who call into that show who are like, oh man, I would,

540
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
I would do anything to be able to get a spot on the Dick show.

541
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,360
And it's like, I just kind of got it just because I am somewhat famous.

542
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,000
And like, I think anybody, I don't feel like it's hard to do.

543
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,720
I feel like it's pretty easy to just, you know, if you even open your mouth on the

544
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,560
internet about anything of interest and like 10 people follow you, you're already on the path.

545
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,320
Like you just got to keep doing that and you will get bigger.

546
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,440
We've certainly lowered the bar for entry massively.

547
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:17,040
Speaking of like, well, when you said about when you left a reply on a YouTube comment

548
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,920
and someone was like, oh, should did you bro replied?

549
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,720
They reminded me of like, one time I commented on some random video and someone was like,

550
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,760
oh, you're you, you're Lathalora major.

551
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,440
Wow. Fancy meeting you here.

552
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,720
And I'm like, yeah, I enjoy media online as well.

553
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,840
Fancy that.

554
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,480
But that also like gives me like a scary thought.

555
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,600
It was like, when you're famous, it's kind of hard to just leave random comments on videos

556
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,720
because people will just like take it as like some sort of mega statement that like you posted.

557
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
You're like, oh, hey, I like your music.

558
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,440
And suddenly a news article, did you bro, I liked this music.

559
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,800
He supports the artist.

560
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,000
We see people, yeah, make articles about that kind of shit with really high profile people.

561
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,400
So yeah.

562
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,200
I have been from the very beginning very careful about that.

563
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,400
Like I won't comment or like something unless unless I do completely stand by it because I expect that.

564
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,560
Yeah, you're forced to make those kind of at least weigh that as part of your decision.

565
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,400
And it sucks.

566
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,680
I mean, it's kind of life.

567
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,640
You say it sucks.

568
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,800
But all you have to do is make it all to count.

569
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,040
You know, like just, I mean, true, make a sock puppet that you can use to comment.

570
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,400
Tons of people do it.

571
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,680
It's interesting when you go to, if you go to a lot of like famous YouTube channels and stuff,

572
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,400
they often don't use that as their main one because like you'll go to say ego raptor and like

573
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,840
he has no subscriptions.

574
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,480
And it's like, well, you obviously subscribe to people on YouTube.

575
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,800
You must have another account, you know, I think that's pretty common.

576
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,000
True.

577
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,360
In fact, I've kind of been meaning to do that just for the sake of convenience.

578
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,080
So I just don't have to think about this so I can just be like, yeah,

579
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,560
whatever this is my fucking, in fact, I have several accounts that I use for like uploading,

580
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,400
like test uploads and shit like that.

581
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,280
I want to make one just for shitposting because I get, there's times where I watch videos and

582
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,920
I have something really mean to say and I'm like, if I say this as myself, people are going to be

583
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,800
like, what the fuck?

584
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,120
So I need to make a just shitposting account.

585
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,520
I guess I, I don't know, not to make it too serious or anything, but like I think about like,

586
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,120
if that's like kind of fucked up to like hide who I really am when I make a certain comment,

587
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,920
like the same exact thought crosses my mind all the time.

588
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,280
The thing is who you really are, like, I mean, as a content creator, you are,

589
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,440
you're only showing a little bit of yourself anyway, like who you really are is always veiled.

590
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,920
If anybody had a direct read into any of our minds, they would hear all kinds of, I mean,

591
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,640
I don't think there's anybody whose mind is sanitary who can like not think anything fucked

592
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,560
up or bad at all.

593
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,520
So like, you know, ultimately it's just about like, which thoughts do you decide to represent

594
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,720
as part of your character?

595
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,360
I think it's totally fair to represent other thoughts as part of a different character.

596
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,360
I got you.

597
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,960
And isn't that a fascinating thing?

598
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,840
I kind of feel like a lot of what the modern world is going to is the sort of the expectation

599
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,640
that everybody is clean all the time.

600
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,600
And I mean, it just goes in line with this like old post that we've made before posts mattered

601
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,760
and you could shit talking, nobody cared.

602
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,360
But now that's being, it's being recontextualized and changed.

603
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,960
And I mean, I get it.

604
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,440
I get it.

605
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,240
It's just, I think as we get more and more into each other's heads,

606
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,720
we're going to see more and more shit we don't like seeing.

607
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,480
And we need, I think the best thing we need is some sort of exhaust valve to be like,

608
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,040
okay, you know what?

609
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,640
I shouldn't care that this person said this fucked up thing at this time.

610
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,560
I should not care that much because we all say fucked up things and think to ourselves,

611
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,360
fucked up shit as long as it's not hurting anybody directly.

612
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,560
The sort of combining of two things where on one hand,

613
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,240
all of your interactions you have are like encased into marble and you cannot scrub them

614
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,360
clean no matter what you do.

615
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,720
You can delete a post.

616
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,200
It doesn't mean it's not going to be on the way back machine if it was a really

617
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,120
controversial post or anything like that.

618
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,960
So really, there's not anything you can do.

619
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,560
But also because of that, yeah, now people are really scared of posting things that

620
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,440
may be considered controversial or bad.

621
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,800
So then it can breed a situation where there's no bad posts on a particular profile because

622
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,440
they've made it to be that way intentionally.

623
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,600
So then it can have an air of perfection or pristineness that is not natural.

624
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:47,600
What the cultural shift I want to see the most is to not be so hard up on trying to not be wrong.

625
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,920
Like it feels like it's if you say something wrong these days,

626
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,240
people will jump down your throat about it.

627
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,720
And like, I don't think that being correct all the time is that interesting or necessary or like,

628
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,200
you know, makes you a better person because everything you say isn't wrong.

629
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,840
In a way, I think it's less about you being wrong and more people just wanting the gotcha

630
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,560
moment being correct on the internet, getting their limelight.

631
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,400
Yeah, very much so.

632
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,960
And it's kind of sad.

633
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,960
They want to be able to feel like they have something over you, which it's understandable

634
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,080
because it's it's sort of like justified bullying in a way.

635
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:31,840
It's like, yeah, the reason people bully is always that, you know, they someone has power

636
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,560
over them, they want to have power over someone else.

637
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,400
And like in a culture where we understand that bullying is wrong,

638
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,280
it's like, how can I bully you but be correct in doing so be justified.

639
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,680
And it's like, oh, you said something wrong.

640
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,280
I'm going to harangue you about it.

641
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,920
And it's like, yeah, but who gives a shit?

642
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,400
And the mental, the mental gymnastics some people go through just to twist your words

643
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,840
into being wrong so they can be right is scary.

644
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,320
This may be a provocative example, but like the whole projared thing going on recently,

645
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,920
I'm very much reminded of.

646
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,040
And at first, I mean, obviously a lot going on there.

647
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,160
But like the first thing that we all hear much going on there.

648
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,760
To the OK, the only thing I want to get into is specifically that like, OK,

649
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,360
at the point that we're at now.

650
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,720
So like, obviously, Jared was involved with some degree to other women.

651
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,000
I don't know what the timeline is.

652
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,080
But like the timeline is actually kind of important because it sounds like they were

653
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,000
going through like a period of breaking up since like February.

654
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So like, I don't know exactly when these the whole underage thing again, like maybe.

655
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,440
OK, here's my point.

656
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,200
I'm going to bad things were said about Jared.

657
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,280
And I'm sure some of them are true.

658
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,280
But we really don't know exactly what is true and what he knew when.

659
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,120
And like if he did bad things exactly at this specific time and on the whole charge

660
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,960
of like cheating on his wife, all I'm saying is she says that he cheated.

661
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,040
His response is we actually had a more complicated open relationships,

662
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,440
which it seems to a degree is true.

663
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,840
So my only thing is, well, shit, this is complicated.

664
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,120
I don't know what to say.

665
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,280
Yeah, yeah, he did in his most recent.

666
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,960
The wife confirmed it as well.

667
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,840
She said eventually.

668
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,880
But that's the thing.

669
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,120
And it's just like it's such a clusterfuck.

670
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,000
And what?

671
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,040
The last update was he put out a message that said like and she responded to it.

672
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,680
But he said like, yeah, we like we had an open relationship and blah, blah, blah.

673
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,800
Things get out of hand.

674
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,760
Things went bad.

675
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,960
So what did so what did she what did she say to that?

676
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,120
Basically, she said like that's I think she agreed that it was somewhat true.

677
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,200
But like the thing with Heidi, for example, like went way beyond what they had agreed to.

678
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,120
Right. Yeah, that's what I meant.

679
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,840
Like that went like she specifically said, like, don't do this.

680
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,440
Okay. So like now in order for us to make a determination who's bad and who's good,

681
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,760
I need to know the timeline, the motivation of characters involved.

682
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,200
Like exactly.

683
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,160
And so my point is I cannot sort this out.

684
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,960
I can't do it.

685
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,440
No.

686
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,160
Nor should you have to for any reason at all.

687
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,400
Yeah.

688
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,880
Right.

689
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,600
That's what I'm getting to.

690
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,400
I absolutely hate things like this.

691
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,760
Because on the one hand, like for some some weird part of my brain is fascinated by

692
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,280
internet celebrity drama.

693
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,280
But at the same time, I'll be checking out of the grocery store and I'll see People Magazine

694
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
and I'll like puke in my mouth.

695
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,560
And this is the exact same thing.

696
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,880
It's just people magazine for E celebs on Twitter.

697
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,280
Yeah.

698
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,560
So I was I was deeply ashamed of myself for finding myself like totally like engaged in this.

699
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,240
And like, I'm a totally hypocrite.

700
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,400
Me too.

701
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,520
Discuss myself.

702
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,520
I'm so happy to announce that I have I have no idea what you're talking about.

703
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,120
And there's I'd like to make a public statement.

704
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,680
I have no idea what any of you are talking about.

705
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,080
You're a champion among us.

706
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,400
To me, there's like there's there's it's like with something like the pro-jaret situation.

707
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,560
It's so it's so like again, like you said, unclear and also it's just something that

708
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,720
like if I was a fan, this doesn't affect his content in any way.

709
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,800
Like if he actually did like have sex with an underage girl or like send

710
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,640
dick pics to underage girls, then that's it's that's bad.

711
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,360
I'm okay.

712
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,840
You know, the authorities might want to get involved with that.

713
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,280
You know, like whatever.

714
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,600
I mean, it's the stuff the stuff about the stuff about cheating on his wife.

715
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,520
That's, you know, maybe bad.

716
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,760
But I don't give a fuck if somebody cheats on their wife.

717
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,040
Like it's no one else's business at all.

718
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,520
The stuff.

719
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:29,760
Okay.

720
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,320
The stuff about the underage girl, I find the timing of when all that happened to be very

721
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,600
suspicious.

722
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,280
Like, isn't it strange that his wife outs him as a cheater?

723
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,680
Public opinion suddenly turns against him.

724
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,880
And then only at that moment, a handful of people come out and say,

725
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
oh yeah, he did all these other bad stuff too.

726
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,160
And he's fired for it.

727
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,600
We were investigating this whole time, but only now are we going to say anything about it.

728
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,960
Everybody acts like the people who come out and confess are such heroes.

729
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,720
But it's like if you've known for years and you haven't said anything, only now when it's

730
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,840
publicly safe to come out and like dog pile, like you're just as much of an asshole.

731
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,280
Like I have no respect for you.

732
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,120
Well, I mean, again, like maybe these people are true heroes who felt super scared by the

733
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,400
powerful pro-Jarrod.

734
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,440
And only now, I'm just saying, maybe that's true.

735
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
I don't fucking know.

736
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,080
I smell a little whiff of bullshit on that whole thing.

737
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:28,080
But at the end of the day, at the end of the day, like these allegations are criminal and

738
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,520
therefore should be decided in a court of law and not in the court of public.

739
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,880
Well, you know what people say.

740
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,480
I think it's weird for an like granted.

741
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,840
I don't think anybody gave a fuck about pro-Jarrod at the time this happened.

742
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,800
I think him bleeding all those subscribers was more like people having an excuse to

743
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,360
Like he hadn't uploaded a video in like four months, right?

744
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,440
And he hasn't been relevant in years.

745
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,240
His videos have very low view counts even among the ones that was due to like personal issues.

746
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,200
But I mean, that is true.

747
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,640
Whatever the case may be, people, I don't think like people act like

748
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,200
I'm so offended he cheated on his wife.

749
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,880
If he was making great content, people wouldn't care.

750
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,080
Like John Tron, when he got into his whole racist thing,

751
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,640
he had a huge backlash.

752
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,000
His whole subreddit turned against him.

753
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,680
He lost a bunch of subs, put out more videos that people liked and it completely blew over.

754
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,600
I mean, people will get over this because honestly, because this this issue,

755
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,800
like what's the substance?

756
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,200
I mean, I'll tell you what it is.

757
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,760
It's a whole lot of virtue signaling.

758
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,040
It sure is, buddy.

759
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,440
I don't like that Projara did this thing.

760
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,480
So I'm unsubscribing.

761
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,360
And I'm just like, what even is the virtue of this for a guy cheating on his wife?

762
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,880
I don't like cheating.

763
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,080
I would not do it, but I don't understand the moral.

764
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,600
It's like, it's just some social contract you have with the government.

765
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:00,080
Like it's not, you know, why are we judging somebody on the basis of like what their sex life is like?

766
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,520
I just don't get that.

767
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,240
I mean, yeah, people, people don't think about this,

768
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,560
but let's just paint the theoretical scenario about a man who's in a somewhat open marriage

769
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,800
with a wife who let's just say for the sake of possible example is horrible to him.

770
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,360
I'm not saying she was, but like, okay, maybe it would make sense why they drift apart.

771
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,680
And he is like with other women and as we've established some degree of open marriage.

772
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,120
Now that's just a hypothetical.

773
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,360
I have no idea how good or bad this man was.

774
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,080
But like, because that's possible, I just think that it makes sense to just like hold off and

775
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,000
let people with knowledge sort it out.

776
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,840
I have an interesting, I have a different perspective that I gained this past week because

777
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,440
I was saying this before the show started.

778
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,240
So I've been listening.

779
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,880
I have been while I've been working and doing other stuff.

780
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,280
I've been binge watching a ton of like the Penny Arcade D&D games,

781
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:59,280
specifically the C team with Amy Falcone and Chris Straub and some other guys.

782
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,320
But they did a crossover event with another group called Dice Camera Action,

783
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,880
I think, or AKA Waffles Incorporated.

784
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,040
And the thing that's relevant there is that two of the players in that game,

785
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,760
a long running game, are Pro Jared and Holly Conrad, which is very interesting.

786
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,640
That game is mostly played over Skype calls, over video chat,

787
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,960
but for this special crossover event, they all came and they sat in the room.

788
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,200
So this is what happened.

789
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,160
Is that what you're trying to say?

790
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,360
Maybe.

791
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,480
Oh, definitely.

792
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm pretty sure that this is during when they were cheating,

793
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,120
or they were fucking each other at this time that this event was recorded.

794
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,960
And I don't know, it was just really weird with this new context.

795
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,360
I was watching them and the two of them are like,

796
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,920
they will make goofy faces at each other and they look at each other a bunch.

797
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,640
And funny enough, their whole character arc is like,

798
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,160
they're like star-crossed lovers that can't be together.

799
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah, straight up.

800
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,040
One of them is from a family that has packed with demons,

801
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,600
and the other is from one that have packed with angels.

802
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,080
And it's like, if they get together, the multiverse is destroyed.

803
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,000
So they make a deal with Asmodeus to change their fucking family.

804
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,240
And I'm like, oh my god, I can't fucking believe this.

805
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,960
Isn't it crazy?

806
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,440
That is fascinating.

807
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,640
It's fucking crazy.

808
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,280
I would like, I want there to be a psychological study

809
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,640
on how often do people's D&D campaigns just reflect their inner,

810
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,040
like what they want to be happening in real life, or how they see themselves.

811
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,600
I am 100, okay, I've been watching the C-Team.

812
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:46,000
I am 100% convinced that everyone's character is just what they want to be.

813
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,880
Yeah, fascinating.

814
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,120
I mean, mine was when I was playing Niga Rafiki and I had 500 bottles,

815
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,920
5,000 bottles of ale, and that was all I had.

816
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,240
Word.

817
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,200
Like, I don't know, Chris Straw plays this drow who is a complete introvert,

818
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,240
who doesn't understand social interaction and hates his physical body,

819
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,400
and is disgusted by his physical existence

820
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,320
and only wants to consider high-minded divinity and stuff.

821
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:20,960
And the dragonborn Donar Blitzen, he's this fucking high-falutin,

822
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,800
fucking narcissist Chad guy who's played by this shlubby guy who loves sports and wrestling.

823
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,880
The list goes on.

824
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,600
I'm convinced.

825
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,040
I'm absolutely convinced that everyone's D&D character is just what their inner self looks like.

826
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,160
That is fascinating perspective.

827
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,440
Whether they intend it or not.

828
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,520
By the way, on this issue, I just want to be super clear.

829
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,480
I hate cheaters, and more than anything, I hate liars.

830
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,680
People who lie regularly are absolutely scum to me.

831
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,160
But the issue is, yeah, exactly, I despise lying at every capacity.

832
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,160
It's just that I don't actually know what accusations are true or false,

833
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,400
so I can't identify who's the bad guy yet.

834
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,080
But when we do, look, we'll probably never know for sure by my standard.

835
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,360
Here's the thing.

836
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,760
So in addition to all that, I've been listening to some Slavoj Žižek.

837
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,200
And in particular, this started with the Jordan Peterson debate.

838
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,800
And he raised an example in that that I want to dig into more about where it came from

839
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,360
and who said it originally, because I think he was quoting.

840
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:27,200
But he said something about, imagine a husband who is jealous of his wife.

841
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,960
He's convinced that his wife is cheating on him, and he's upset by it.

842
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,280
And he said that even if it's all true, the husband's jealousy is still pathological.

843
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,120
Because it's too late, it's already the ship sailed, and she's gone.

844
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,880
You know, I don't really know the explanation, but I think it's like,

845
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,680
well, you can't control what she's doing.

846
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,280
Like, if you are obsessing over this, and this is causing you great grief,

847
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,040
and you continue, you've got to do something.

848
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,760
Yeah, break it up, or do something about it.

849
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,200
Don't just be a fucking jealous, cucked husband who's upset about it.

850
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,480
Like, do something.

851
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,160
And I don't know.

852
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,160
I kind of feel like maybe that applies to his wife.

853
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,560
I don't know.

854
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,160
The point is, I don't feel bad for his wife.

855
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,680
I think his wife probably is.

856
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,320
Probably.

857
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,440
You know, this doesn't give me any...

858
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:13,920
I don't know, man.

859
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,520
And judging by the way she's acted on Twitter, I don't think you should feel sorry for her.

860
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,000
But...

861
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,120
She's what on Twitter?

862
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,600
Just the way she acted.

863
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,560
Just by the way she's acted.

864
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:21,920
Yeah, yeah.

865
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,280
I don't feel any sympathy for her.

866
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,760
I don't...

867
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,400
I'm not...

868
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,440
Even if Jared did her wrong, that doesn't make me think she's good, you know?

869
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,720
Nate, I'm curious, like, I know you say you hate cheaters,

870
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,080
but would you ever like...

871
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Like, if you found out that...

872
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:38,960
What's her name?

873
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,880
The girl, Sapa Kanakin.

874
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,840
What am I thinking of?

875
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,040
Oh, Joanna Newsome.

876
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,960
If it turned out Joanna Newsome was cheating on a fucking...

877
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,680
What's this fuck?

878
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,320
Chewboy.

879
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,040
Andy, Andy...

880
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:49,680
If Andy...

881
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,000
Cuck...

882
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,400
Why can't I Cuck?

883
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:50,720
Why can't I Cuck?

884
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:50,880
Why can't I Cuck?

885
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,200
Why can't I Cuck?

886
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,440
Why can't I Cuck?

887
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:51,600
Why can't I Cuck?

888
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,080
Why can't I Cuck?

889
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:52,640
God damn it.

890
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,600
Samberg, Andy Samberg.

891
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,160
Say Andy's thing.

892
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,080
If you found out she was cheating on Andy Samberg,

893
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,800
would this affect your listening to her music at all?

894
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,280
Okay, you know, so unfortunately, I think that it probably would.

895
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:05,760
I don't think...

896
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:06,880
I think that it's...

897
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,840
That's amazing to me.

898
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,440
Like, I don't...

899
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,680
I don't want it to.

900
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,360
I just think that I'd be like, man, this sucks.

901
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,640
The thing is that like most...

902
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,760
I think, first of all, most creatives are damaged individuals,

903
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,560
and second of all, most people are doing something fucking.

904
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,240
I mean, I agree.

905
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,440
I just don't want to know about it.

906
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,640
I mean, it's just like I kind of assume that like there's always

907
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,080
going to be something about everybody that if I knew it,

908
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,280
I mean, even just...

909
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,240
Like there's lots of music I listen to from people who I think

910
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,760
are like politically fucking retarded or something.

911
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,920
And like, I know that.

912
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,400
And maybe it enters my mind every once in a while,

913
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,960
but like if the music is good, the music is good.

914
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,680
And like, I just kind of have to assume that if I knew everything

915
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,640
about everyone I listened to, I would not be able to listen to anything.

916
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,600
I mean, I think if I knew everything about any individual,

917
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,520
I would find them contemptible and disgusting,

918
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,520
because I'm sure people would feel the same way about me

919
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,520
if they knew like my innermost thoughts all the time.

920
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,680
So I agree.

921
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,000
But like, I just think this is why I don't want...

922
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,800
I don't want to know.

923
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,840
I don't want to know what's going on in people's heads.

924
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,200
It's really fascinating to me, though,

925
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,480
the like what gets into people's crop,

926
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,600
because it's like there are a lot of rappers, for instance,

927
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,400
who have literally murdered people,

928
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,440
and like nobody holds that against their music.

929
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,920
And then you've got like...

930
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,480
Like Pro Jarrod's a way worse person for cheating on his wife,

931
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,400
you know, potentially, as opposed to murderers.

932
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,120
Or like Kanye West, who like Kanye gets like totally assblasted

933
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,000
by like the whole black community for like wearing a Trump hat.

934
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,960
And it's like some...

935
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,680
You guys are listening to people who kill people.

936
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,680
And like people are like, oh, I don't listen to Kanye

937
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,520
because he has political opinions.

938
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,880
He has a hat.

939
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,240
I don't like.

940
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,280
It's a funny thing, dude.

941
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,320
It's a funny thing.

942
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,480
Someone on Twitter, I saw this was on the day

943
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,160
that the Pro Jarrod story broke.

944
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,240
Someone was like peanut butter, like normal boots,

945
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,960
when John Tron says his racist shit, like,

946
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,440
oh, fuck you, we don't want to be associated with you.

947
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,920
Pro Jarrod, when he treats on his wife,

948
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,520
oh, you know, we're sorry, man, you know,

949
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,040
hope things get better for you.

950
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,720
And I read this and I'm like, yeah, those aren't even similar.

951
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,720
Why would you, like, why is it hypocritical

952
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,640
to react differently to those two things?

953
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,960
It's like, oh, these two people

954
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,280
both did something that I disagree with.

955
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,240
Why is there not an equal outcry for both things?

956
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,280
Well, you know, I suppose they could be making the point

957
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,200
that like, you know, like cheating on one's wife

958
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,240
is more, you know.

959
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,880
I think being racist is worse than cheating on your wife.

960
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,560
Well, okay, I mean, we'd have to get into the discussion

961
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,160
of like, was it in fact racist?

962
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,120
You can make a case.

963
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,840
Okay, well, I'm just accepting this guy's premise.

964
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,760
Okay, if you accept the premise, then I'm with you.

965
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,960
John Tron said horrible.

966
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,720
I actually don't know what John Tron said

967
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,000
that was this event.

968
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,360
I'm unclear exactly.

969
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,120
Is that what he quoted in statistics?

970
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,120
It was willing to meet this guy on his own terms.

971
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,760
Okay, sure.

972
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,040
And I still hate it.

973
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,800
The John Tron thing was just that he made the awful mistake

974
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,160
of debating with Destiny.

975
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,360
And...

976
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,040
Well, yeah, fair enough.

977
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,880
And that was basically it.

978
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,720
It was just him and Destiny had a debate

979
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,360
about the fact that he was like into Sargon and shit

980
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,040
and like was kind of...

981
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,960
Now, there's a fucking thing

982
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,640
Oh, boy.

983
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,360
I have not had any more fun than making...

984
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,760
Like Sargon's current downfall

985
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,360
is the funniest thing in the fucking world.

986
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,920
I don't...

987
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,200
Okay, I've heard the thing...

988
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,240
I've heard the thing about joking about raping MPs.

989
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,000
I don't know what he actually said.

990
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,520
I don't know what an MP is.

991
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,400
Well, did he know where these two worlds...

992
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,480
Two worlds are colliding right now

993
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,000
because I'm over here just following Brexit news

994
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,640
as like hardcore and as intensely as possible.

995
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,360
Every day I wake up and I read the BBC.

996
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,640
And then like from like off screen,

997
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,240
like there's a glimmer of light in the distance.

998
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,760
I squint my eyes.

999
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,160
And then in three frames max,

1000
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,840
there's a punch from who other than Sargon of Akkad

1001
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,040
entering the political sphere out of fucking nowhere.

1002
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,520
When?

1003
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,120
I thought I left you behind.

1004
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,400
How did you get here?

1005
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,440
Ben, are you aware that Sargon is running for office in...

1006
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1007
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,200
So I did.

1008
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:05,760
I did.

1009
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,120
Yeah, a position in the EU.

1010
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,560
Dude, it is the funniest.

1011
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,920
Fucking thing in the world.

1012
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,440
I've seen clips of him just being like really belligerent

1013
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,680
like in public, like at his public appearance.

1014
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,000
Sargon of Akkad is a fucking moron.

1015
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,960
He's an absolute moron.

1016
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,320
He absolutely is a fucking moron.

1017
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,680
And he is running for office that he...

1018
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,040
Because the party that got him

1019
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,440
is basically a totally irrelevant party

1020
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,040
that is just clinging to him

1021
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,360
because he is more relevant than they are.

1022
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,120
So like they see him as like,

1023
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,320
oh, famous YouTube guy.

1024
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,280
This is our ticket.

1025
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,320
This is our ticket too.

1026
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,240
But the fact of the matter is that while Sargon is,

1027
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,320
you know, somewhat internet famous,

1028
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,960
he's not necessarily taken seriously

1029
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,560
and less and less so

1030
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,360
as he continues to make a fucking fool of himself.

1031
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,600
And there's this great...

1032
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,920
I highly recommend this particularly to Nate.

1033
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,680
There's this YouTuber called Porcelain,

1034
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,240
spelled P-O-R-S-A-L-I-N,

1035
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,200
who does these like hour and a half long documentaries

1036
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,640
about people that are extremely well made.

1037
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:06,960
And he...

1038
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,240
That sounds nifty.

1039
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,680
He's definitely...

1040
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:15,600
He himself is a like far right poll meme lord.

1041
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,240
But the people who he rags on

1042
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,040
are other like right wing people

1043
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,680
who have just fucked up so badly

1044
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,840
that they are now laughing socks

1045
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,360
within their own community.

1046
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,040
And so he has one about Sargon

1047
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,880
that's like an hour 45 minutes,

1048
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,920
fucking hilarious.

1049
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,920
Just it goes to his entire history

1050
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,320
and every dipshit move he's made.

1051
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,520
But like the most recent one...

1052
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,880
That almost feels scary in a way.

1053
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,920
That almost feels like going back

1054
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,880
to what we were talking about earlier

1055
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,840
where it's like okay,

1056
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,120
well, he's made mistakes,

1057
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,720
but he's just made one too many

1058
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,600
that broke the candles back

1059
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,200
and now he has like a hit piece video about him.

1060
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,160
That's the thing.

1061
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,400
The thing about it though is that,

1062
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,920
and this is why I'm bringing it up

1063
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,600
because with Pro Jarrod,

1064
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,760
I'm like guy cheats on his wife.

1065
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,840
That's unfortunate.

1066
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,400
It's bedroom politics.

1067
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,280
I have nothing to do with it.

1068
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,800
You guys sort that out.

1069
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,040
With Sargon, he's running for office.

1070
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,480
So what he does, does matter.

1071
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,040
What he says, what his like positions are

1072
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
when he's saying it in interviews.

1073
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,600
It's like the entertainment value

1074
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,680
in watching this man dig his own grave

1075
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,800
is in that he is so self-important

1076
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,520
that he believes that he's doing something good.

1077
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,480
Like it's one thing if like say,

1078
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,600
if something I did,

1079
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,240
like let's say I did some heinous act

1080
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,600
and it came to light,

1081
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,640
my best course of action would be to apologize, right?

1082
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,840
It would be like, hey man,

1083
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,360
I'm sorry about what happened.

1084
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,840
This was something that happened in my day-to-day life.

1085
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,520
Maybe there's more context or something.

1086
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,080
I don't know.

1087
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,160
Like this is a fictional scenario.

1088
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,360
But with Sargon,

1089
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,360
this is his public statements

1090
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,040
as a man running for office.

1091
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,360
Like as a public figure,

1092
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,360
he is saying and doing things

1093
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,320
that are so hilariously retarded

1094
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,760
that you have to make fun of him

1095
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,440
so that people understand

1096
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,920
that if you're going to run for office,

1097
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,840
you can't do these things.

1098
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,880
What's he saying?

1099
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,040
The most recent one and funniest is

1100
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,840
he was defending Amos Yee.

1101
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,160
You guys remember that guy, right?

1102
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,200
I do.

1103
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,400
Amos Yee, yeah.

1104
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,160
Yeah, he's a pro pedophile guy.

1105
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,680
He patroned me and Jesse for a little while.

1106
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,000
He was a pedophile who is like,

1107
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,200
he's like the world's-

1108
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,200
I don't think he is specifically a pedophile.

1109
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:31,680
No, he is.

1110
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,760
He's been to jail several times for pedophilia.

1111
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,280
Okay, if you say so.

1112
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,640
He is a many times incriminated pedophile

1113
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,440
who is also like a public defender of pedophilia.

1114
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,920
And basically his platform is

1115
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,200
that because there have been cases

1116
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,480
wherein the child was not harmed

1117
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,280
or wherein the child enjoyed the relationship,

1118
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,920
it therefore is not always not okay.

1119
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,520
Did this guy have you-

1120
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,160
Want you to read a thing on how they marketed?

1121
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,800
Yes, I did a bit on him and how they marketed

1122
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,760
because he wanted me to market his video

1123
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,960
defending pedophilia.

1124
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,200
And I just made a clip talking about it

1125
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,360
and explaining why I thought it was wrongheaded.

1126
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,000
Because the bottom line is

1127
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,120
there's no way to measure the psychological damage

1128
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,240
done to somebody.

1129
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,480
It's like you can't say,

1130
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,680
oh, the kid enjoyed it and therefore it's okay.

1131
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,080
It's like you don't know what the long-term effect

1132
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:30,720
of that could be.

1133
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,120
There's so many questions to be asked

1134
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,200
and it's like in this sphere,

1135
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,840
there's always going to be an arbitrary line.

1136
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,000
You know, what we decide is the age

1137
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,440
is always going to be arbitrary,

1138
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,920
but we have to have something

1139
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,680
just so that we as a society can say,

1140
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,840
all right, here's a hard and fast rule,

1141
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,120
just follow this rule.

1142
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:49,840
The bottom line is-

1143
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,000
And to be fair, to be fair to his point,

1144
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,960
we are technically repressing some freedoms,

1145
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,080
but it's for protection.

1146
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,080
We repress freedoms all the time.

1147
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,320
The whole basis of society is repressive.

1148
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,080
You don't have the freedom to murder people

1149
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,640
because we repress that.

1150
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,280
It's like, dude, the bottom line is

1151
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,520
you don't have to fuck kids.

1152
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,840
You can just wait till they grow up.

1153
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,720
How hard is that?

1154
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,360
Oh yeah, but let's get back to the Sargon issue.

1155
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:20,320
So Sargon had apparently defended Amos Ye at some point,

1156
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,320
so this gets brought up in an interview

1157
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,120
for a political interview.

1158
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,040
It is important how he defended him

1159
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,480
because there's a lot of different ways to defend him.

1160
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,560
Well, he basically restated his argument.

1161
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,480
He literally said, like,

1162
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,720
well, you can't say it's always bad

1163
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,240
if sometimes it goes okay,

1164
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,840
and everyone was just like, all right, Sargon.

1165
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,640
But I mean, that's true.

1166
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,840
All right, go ahead and say it.

1167
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,200
Yeah, all right, all right.

1168
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,840
It was just, yeah.

1169
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,360
The fascinating thing about all this

1170
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,320
is I'm actually a big Sargon fan.

1171
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,920
A big Sargon fan.

1172
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,480
Are you really?

1173
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,920
And I really am.

1174
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,560
I unironically am.

1175
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,040
How?

1176
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,160
That guy's so retarded.

1177
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,320
He's a complete stooge.

1178
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,280
Look, I'll tell you how.

1179
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,680
It's because where you guys are asserting

1180
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,960
that he's, you know, like a grandstander

1181
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,320
and, you know, I don't know,

1182
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,000
doing it maybe for attention or something.

1183
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,640
I mean, I've been convinced, maybe I'm crazy,

1184
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,560
I've been convinced he's doing it for principles

1185
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:10,880
that he believes.

1186
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,800
Oh, no, I totally think he's doing it for principles.

1187
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,680
What are you talking about?

1188
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,200
I never said he was a grandstander.

1189
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,000
He's just retarded.

1190
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,400
Yeah, okay, for no.

1191
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,040
Oh, I mean, you can make a case for that, sure.

1192
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,120
I used to sort of like his content

1193
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,320
and then I stopped caring.

1194
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,720
He is like, he is just a complete, like, alt-right stooge.

1195
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,520
He doesn't even know what he's doing.

1196
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,720
Ben, he's not even on the alt-right.

1197
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1198
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,400
Listen, listen, listen.

1199
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,440
He doesn't even get it.

1200
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,640
He doesn't even know that he's doing it half the time.

1201
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,080
But he just...

1202
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,680
Why do you think he's no better than the guy?

1203
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,760
He's just thoughtless in the things that he repeats.

1204
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,120
I agree with what you're saying, Ben,

1205
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,000
that he is thoughtless.

1206
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,360
I don't think that that,

1207
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,560
I don't think he has led himself to the conclusions

1208
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,840
that alt-right people have.

1209
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,240
No, that's not what I'm saying.

1210
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,800
I mean, he argues all day against identitarianism.

1211
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,120
He does function as an unwitting mouthpiece

1212
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:01,760
for like conservative fucking, I don't know.

1213
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,840
I mean, I've seen some Sargon stuff.

1214
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,400
I've never seen him be a mouthpiece for conservative...

1215
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,880
Ben, what's the position that he is a mouthpiece on

1216
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,120
that he's unaware of, if you can think of something?

1217
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,480
I mean, isn't he kind of in bed with like, metaphorically,

1218
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,280
not in like a pro-Jarrod kind of way, you know what I'm saying?

1219
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,000
There he goes.

1220
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,400
But he's kind of in bed with like, Lauren Southern

1221
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,440
and that fucking guy who sells the brain pills and...

1222
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,240
Alex Jones, you mean?

1223
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:24,880
The brain pills?

1224
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,040
No, not Alex Jones, well, maybe him, but the guy who just...

1225
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,920
No, the fucking...

1226
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,880
Paul Joseph Watson?

1227
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,200
Ben, I mean, okay.

1228
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,560
Yeah, well, Watson, Watson.

1229
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,640
I'm not, this isn't, I'm not trying to catch or anything,

1230
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,240
but like, I asked you for like a position

1231
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,360
and you're saying he's associated with these people, therefore.

1232
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,320
And that doesn't seem like it.

1233
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,280
Well, isn't he?

1234
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,840
Okay, isn't, okay, I'll give a position.

1235
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,920
It's, he kind of seems like he's one of these,

1236
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,880
like, Islamophobic, like, you know, no, no refugees ever,

1237
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,280
kind of.

1238
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,560
I mean, he definitely believes strongly in border control,

1239
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,960
but I just think there's a principled argument to make for it,

1240
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,840
for, I mean, in his case, the sake of the British populace

1241
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,800
and protecting their lower classes from immigration,

1242
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,680
which pushes down wages, which is bad for their people.

1243
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,960
And I mean, you can argue that,

1244
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,120
you can say that he has malicious intent or something,

1245
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,320
but I mean, I think his case is reasonable.

1246
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,200
You're misreading me.

1247
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,600
I'm not saying that he has malicious intent.

1248
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,840
I'm sure he does believe the things he says

1249
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,480
and generally thinks that he is saying the right things

1250
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,800
for the right reasons with good intentions.

1251
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,200
I just think he is a stooge, no fucking clue.

1252
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,480
Just the only question of this is,

1253
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,640
so do you, do you think it's fair to say that like,

1254
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,280
like you said, if he's reaching the same conclusion

1255
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,440
as alt-right people, let's say, of, you know,

1256
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,560
close the borders, something like that, then reaching that

1257
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,280
for any reason is like playing into the hands,

1258
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,360
even when you have like a decent argument for it?

1259
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:46,960
Because I mean, what can you do?

1260
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,320
What can you do if you really believe it?

1261
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,200
You could get smart for one thing.

1262
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,840
Well, here, okay, here's what I'm saying.

1263
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,400
I mean, I've seen like, okay, in particular,

1264
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,880
I've seen videos from Sean, the YouTuber Sean,

1265
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,080
where he deconstructs Sargon's points and stuff

1266
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,600
and arguments that Sargon has made

1267
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,280
and shows that like the things he is quoting are wrong.

1268
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,680
That he is like knowingly or not,

1269
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,480
he is quoting like, you know, Nazi sympathizers and stuff.

1270
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,520
He is repeating facts that are demonstrably false.

1271
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,720
Things like that, okay.

1272
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,760
You gotta remember, you know,

1273
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,480
Hitler was right about some things, you know, like,

1274
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,200
everybody's right about some things.

1275
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,320
Even a broken clock gets right to two times a day, as they say.

1276
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:30,800
Right.

1277
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,680
Is that true?

1278
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,960
Is that, have we tested that?

1279
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,760
I just think it's unfair to say that just because

1280
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,320
an alt-right person also said the thing that, like,

1281
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,800
to me, alt-right is a totalizing position.

1282
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,080
It's like, if you don't believe literally all of the things,

1283
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,440
then you're not that.

1284
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,480
Alt-right breathes air.

1285
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,440
I, that's true.

1286
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,600
Do you condemn the breathing of air, I guess?

1287
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,720
That's solid, solid.

1288
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,000
Two things.

1289
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,880
Number one, I just want to comment on this MOC guy.

1290
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,120
He looks like, like, if you put, like, the dryer on high,

1291
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,240
you three Econin, like, left them there for like six hours

1292
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,040
and he tumbled out and, like, was completely broken.

1293
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,880
Like, his hair is just constantly unkempt and just, like,

1294
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,240
it just obliterated his, like, more, like, like, like,

1295
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,960
like, if Econ's atoms were just, like, splattered,

1296
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,600
maybe, like, like a millimeter or something,

1297
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,560
but now he's just constantly, like, a being of chaos.

1298
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,520
Also, number two, I wanted to comment on Sargon of Cod,

1299
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,560
not in a political sense, but more like a political analysis sense

1300
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,800
about what, giving a little more context about him running.

1301
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,080
So he has joined the UK Independence Party,

1302
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,120
which was the original party behind Brexit,

1303
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,800
well, not behind, you know, a major proponent and whatnot.

1304
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:54,400
And what's funny about UKIP is they are in a fucking tailspin right now,

1305
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,800
and they and the leading party of the conservatives

1306
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,880
are just fucking dean obliterated

1307
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,720
when you hear conservatives don't think

1308
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,240
conservative America is different.

1309
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:05,840
Right, right.

1310
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,440
But so UKIP was the Nigel Farage party,

1311
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,360
but now Nigel Farage left,

1312
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:17,120
and so now they've just been in that for that and numerous other reasons.

1313
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,880
They've just been crashing and burning.

1314
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,760
And so I like the aesthetic, the image, the painting

1315
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,400
that is being depicted in real life of UKIP,

1316
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,600
soaring high, getting, you know, Brexit, the vote,

1317
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,160
and they've just been a victorious moment,

1318
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,800
and then just through the constant struggle of Brexit,

1319
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,440
Nigel Farage leaving due to controversy within the group,

1320
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,840
and now they're just, like, in, like, a burning sinking ship.

1321
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,840
They're like, oh, god, who's our poster child?

1322
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,040
Who's our poster child?

1323
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,400
We need a new fucking guy!

1324
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,960
Sargon of Akkad, that works!

1325
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,600
That's fine!

1326
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,760
Anyone, anyone!

1327
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,960
It's the two-headed dragon of Sargon of Akkad and, um, Count Dankula.

1328
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,600
Count Dankula, which Count Dankula seems like he's in it for the meme.

1329
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,000
Like, he, he's always just looks like a smiley fucking guy.

1330
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,200
He's just like, yeah, like, I don't know if any of this is working or doing anything,

1331
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,800
but I'm here, because this is, this is clearly hilarious.

1332
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,880
Sargon, meanwhile, is taking it completely seriously,

1333
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,440
and everyone's just laughing at him.

1334
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,160
Well, here's one of the reasons why I like the guy.

1335
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,640
I mean, sure, okay, but he just got his entire channel demonetized,

1336
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,320
and what is his response?

1337
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,600
I'm gonna keep going.

1338
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,760
I mean, is this the mark of, like, a bad person or someone who's, you know...

1339
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,400
Nate, fucking, do you realize how much fucking...

1340
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,240
That restarted his career.

1341
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,400
Like, this dude was not really relevant,

1342
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,880
and then suddenly everybody's talking about him again, because...

1343
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,840
I mean, how is 800,000 subs irrelevant?

1344
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,680
I mean, he's making a fine living doing his shit.

1345
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,720
Okay, having subscribers has nothing to do with relevance.

1346
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,320
What is his fucking view count?

1347
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,680
Well, you just made it about relevance.

1348
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,760
No, I'm saying that view, I'm saying subscriber count does not imply relevance.

1349
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,680
You can have dead subs forever.

1350
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,440
Okay, sure, that's, that's fair.

1351
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,360
His videos get decent view counts, don't they?

1352
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,080
I don't think like there's...

1353
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,640
It's not that I'm saying he's not, like, at...

1354
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,120
Like, I'm not saying he's not at all relevant.

1355
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,880
Like, he literally is nobody now.

1356
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,680
I'm saying that, like, at the height of Gamergate, he was the guy.

1357
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,040
Like, he was the guy who made that movement as big as it is.

1358
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,320
And now...

1359
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,360
Those are the days.

1360
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,200
Now, you know, and he's been trying to somehow get back to that.

1361
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,160
I don't know if you saw the whole...

1362
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:26,640
I mean...

1363
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,880
Oh, you just gotta watch the fucking documentary, god damn it.

1364
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,520
What better argument is there against Sargon of Akkad

1365
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,040
that he was a Gamergate guy?

1366
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,640
He was the Gamergate guy.

1367
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,080
I mean, again, we would just reach totally different conclusions on that

1368
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,680
than we have as we have in the pack.

1369
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,560
I guess so.

1370
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,360
Here's an example.

1371
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,160
Here's an example.

1372
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,960
This comes from Sean on his Curious Cat.

1373
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,880
Example of Sargon being a stooge.

1374
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,320
He repeats the fascist lie that Heather Hayer died of a heart attack

1375
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,800
because she was unfit rather than being hit by a car

1376
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,040
driven by James Fields at Charlottesville.

1377
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,560
This was someone was hit by a car at a protest or something.

1378
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,840
And the right falsely spread the rumor

1379
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,680
that she actually died of a heart attack.

1380
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,360
Ha ha ha, isn't that funny?

1381
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,440
No, she was just murdered because someone ran her over...

1382
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,160
Okay, sure.

1383
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,840
...because a fucking right-winger ran her over with a car.

1384
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,080
Okay, great.

1385
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:10,720
We've heard his side.

1386
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,400
Now we need to dive into exactly what situation he said that in.

1387
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,880
I mean, maybe our boy Sean is literally lying

1388
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,240
and it was like a joke, he said.

1389
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:18,880
I don't know.

1390
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,280
I don't know.

1391
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:19,360
I need to find out.

1392
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,880
I'm totally willing to believe that Sargon just heard that

1393
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,000
and thought it was true.

1394
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,480
Yes, and that's what I think he does.

1395
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:26,800
Right.

1396
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,640
Well, that's why I think he's a moron,

1397
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,120
because it has nothing to do with his political opinions.

1398
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,320
I don't give a shit.

1399
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,840
It's just the way he presents himself in talks

1400
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,480
that like, I get the sense that this dude

1401
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,800
like just kind of, you know,

1402
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,000
listens to the talking points of other people,

1403
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,880
collects the ones that sound good and parrots them,

1404
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,840
and then has no...

1405
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,120
The ones that support his,

1406
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,280
the ones that support his sort of general...

1407
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,600
Right, and he has no idea how to really defend those things in argument.

1408
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,960
Because like, when Sargon makes scripted content,

1409
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,600
he's just like, you know, making a formulated point

1410
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,480
on the basis of whatever data he has.

1411
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,960
And that can come out fine a lot more easily.

1412
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,680
If you listen to the man debate anyone,

1413
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,960
he clowns himself into oblivion.

1414
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,120
He is so bad at debating.

1415
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,680
He just kind of talks over people and shuts them down

1416
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,800
and continually insists that they're not really listening to him or that...

1417
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,840
Or like, he just...

1418
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,440
It's really embarrassing.

1419
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,800
Actually, I watched recently a video of him talking to an interviewer

1420
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,200
and she completely didn't listen to him at all.

1421
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,800
And like, no matter what he said,

1422
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,320
she just kept pressing her own words and questions.

1423
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,120
And it's just...

1424
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,960
Anytime you talk to the mainstream media,

1425
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,320
you're fucked because they don't give a shit.

1426
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,560
Yeah, it was just so aggravating.

1427
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,080
I stopped watching.

1428
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,400
It was me and Byter, we were watching together

1429
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,600
and I was like, Byter, stop.

1430
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,040
No, I don't want to watch anymore.

1431
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,240
Was that the Sky News clip?

1432
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,720
There was a whole clip I was seeing about Sky News

1433
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,800
put out this video where they heavily doctored it,

1434
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,320
but he secretly recorded the whole thing

1435
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,000
and the context was totally different there.

1436
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,040
I just know he was talking to a female interviewer

1437
01:08:59,040 --> 01:08:59,600
and she was...

1438
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,560
That's a totally different context

1439
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,960
because the mainstream media will fuck you

1440
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,240
no matter who you are to further their own agenda.

1441
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,360
But Sargon, when he debates people on the internet,

1442
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,840
like internet, blood sports, whatever the fuck you want to call it,

1443
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,360
he's not a good debater.

1444
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,760
He says a lot of stupid things and that's gotten him in trouble.

1445
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,880
He always tries to do this thing where he...

1446
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,920
He always tries to be clever.

1447
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,240
Like, he's always trying to throw what you say back at you

1448
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,920
or try to find a way to make it into a funny joke

1449
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,160
and he's really bad at it.

1450
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,120
Again, I would recommend the Porcelain documentary on him.

1451
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,640
It's basically a chronicle of his whole career,

1452
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,920
I mean, everything he's ever done

1453
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,400
and why exactly his own team is turning against him now.

1454
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:43,680
It's pretty funny.

1455
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,880
What do you mean by his own team?

1456
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,800
Is that like UKIP or his employees?

1457
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,680
No, all the other right-wing YouTube crew.

1458
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,360
Everybody in the skeptic community...

1459
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,920
Who's the right-wing YouTube crew?

1460
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,440
Just everybody.

1461
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,520
Well, the main guy who's sort of...

1462
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,360
The main reason, I think,

1463
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,560
that he's gotten into heat with his community

1464
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,560
is because he's beefing with Mr. Medeker

1465
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:09,120
and looking like the asshole in that beef.

1466
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,640
And so because people...

1467
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,240
And also the Ralph Rettort.

1468
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,840
So like, because Medeker and Ralph

1469
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,960
are sort of the more relevant voices now

1470
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,280
and are memeing on him so fucking hard,

1471
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,480
it's turning a lot of people against him.

1472
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,520
It doesn't surprise me at all that Medeker is memeing on him.

1473
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,920
Medeker takes the piss out of everybody

1474
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,360
when they treat anything with any sort of seriousness.

1475
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,040
Medeker seems to be there to just laugh at them.

1476
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,240
So if he starts running for office,

1477
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,840
of course Mr. Medeker is going to shit on him.

1478
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,280
That just seems like his wheelhouse.

1479
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,280
It's more intimate than that.

1480
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,240
It's more than just guys making videos about each other.

1481
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,600
It's like there's a legit beef.

1482
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,120
Just I don't want to go into all this

1483
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,120
because I had to watch an hour and 45 minutes

1484
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,400
of all this being explained to me.

1485
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,320
We are being People Magazine right now for isolates.

1486
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,800
I'm seeing Ethan Ralph tweeting about the breaking news of Sargon

1487
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,880
and it is UKIP's Carl Benjamin hit by milkshake in Salisbury

1488
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,960
in fourth attack this week.

1489
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,600
Damn.

1490
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,160
Now see, that's not okay.

1491
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,400
Don't fucking throw milkshakes at a guy just because we're talking.

1492
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,920
I mean, no, it's kind of funny, but it's no.

1493
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,880
I don't think it's...

1494
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,680
I can accept that.

1495
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,720
You're just making his case stronger by doing that.

1496
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,280
Yeah.

1497
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,680
I'm just over here leaning back in my chair

1498
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,160
just with the rag-to-wee theme playing in my head

1499
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,520
with my glass of fine wine.

1500
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,160
The glass of fine red wine.

1501
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,520
It wasn't even just wine.

1502
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,960
It was the fourth milkshake.

1503
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,040
Yeah, the fourth milkshake.

1504
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,520
And reminiscing about how in the Skype calls,

1505
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,960
I would be talking to Gigi's ex-girlfriend Cookie Cutter

1506
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,800
about Gamergate and talking...

1507
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,120
And I was linking to her talking about the state of video games at the time.

1508
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,400
He hit Cookie Cutter on the show.

1509
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,000
Yeah, great idea.

1510
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,520
And I thought about each hand.

1511
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,720
It was just a glorious time.

1512
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,400
You see, guys, I understand.

1513
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,040
I'm sure Sargon's done many stupid things.

1514
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,720
I've heard many of them myself.

1515
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,360
And that's...

1516
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,800
And perhaps I'm the naive one.

1517
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,400
Perhaps I'm the fool who's just hearing the things I want to hear

1518
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,320
and discarding all things that are relevant.

1519
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,440
Totally possible.

1520
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,840
It's just that when I hear things like him getting shut down monetarily

1521
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,440
and getting milkshakes thrown at him,

1522
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,040
and I see his videos and he's like,

1523
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,080
not going to stop me.

1524
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,320
I'm like, that seems like an honorable person.

1525
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,360
I mean, that's okay.

1526
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,080
Because...

1527
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,240
But I'm not going to stop him from doing what.

1528
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,280
Nate, if you understand...

1529
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,800
I don't know, trying to lead UK to the independence that he thinks it needs.

1530
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,640
And I'm like, I don't know, UK.

1531
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,600
Sure, go for it.

1532
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,400
Look, it's so fucking easy to spin that shit.

1533
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:35,920
Not just...

1534
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,120
Okay, people are doing that to him and that sucks.

1535
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,560
It sucks that people are doing that.

1536
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:47,040
But to act like him soldiering on through that is such a bold move.

1537
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,360
It's like all those things will empower him.

1538
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,120
They make his position stronger.

1539
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,200
But I already agree with his position.

1540
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,200
So I mean, it's working out pretty well.

1541
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,520
It's like he gets to play the victim now.

1542
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,120
And don't give me any of this fucking shit, people.

1543
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,120
I don't agree with every position he has, Jesus Christ.

1544
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,760
Well, it's not like he arranged this to like,

1545
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,400
oh, now I'm going to make sure people hate me

1546
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,000
so I can play the victim in their court.

1547
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,800
I don't even think...

1548
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,200
What?

1549
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,080
I don't even think that.

1550
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,880
I just think that if people act...

1551
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,600
Well, here's my advice to people who don't like Sargon.

1552
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,120
Don't throw a fucking milkshake at him

1553
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,120
because you're going to empower the position.

1554
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,240
Like, you are doing the opposite of him.

1555
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,720
And victimhood is not proof that your argument is correct.

1556
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,760
I totally accept that.

1557
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,200
What specifically do you agree with him about?

1558
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,080
I mean, how about the fact that the UK should have the right

1559
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,200
to determine whether or not it wants to open its borders to immigrants.

1560
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,360
Therefore, it should leave the EU so it can control that.

1561
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,400
Seems reasonable to me.

1562
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:37,760
Sure.

1563
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,640
I mean, yeah.

1564
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,920
That seems to be like the major issue.

1565
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,840
I can see the logic.

1566
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,800
I mean, that seems to be his entire platform right now, right?

1567
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,720
Because like, Brexit's been dragged out for what?

1568
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,320
Like, three years now and people won't have another vote or some shit?

1569
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,600
It was supposed to happen in March.

1570
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,920
Dude, it was supposed to happen several times over by now.

1571
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,560
I mean, the official, like, actual big dick date was, yeah, in March.

1572
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,520
Now it's in...

1573
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,920
I believe they pushed it back to November,

1574
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,720
but that's a definitely 100% no fucking way happening.

1575
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,880
I see it in 2020.

1576
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,560
If then, dude.

1577
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,280
I see it if then.

1578
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,160
I think the goal right now seems to be just wear the people out

1579
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,000
so the UK stays in the EU.

1580
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,560
Yeah.

1581
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,440
I mean, that could possibly be the goal for some people.

1582
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,480
Dude, you hear people making the case for it every damn day.

1583
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,040
By the MPs.

1584
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,880
There was some fucking lady debating on...

1585
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,960
I mean, I'm sure this argument is thrown around all the time.

1586
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:37,040
That's like, okay, like, I get the idea that like, no, no, no.

1587
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,320
The people were gaslighted and misinformed,

1588
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:45,120
and therefore the first vote, like, it does not accurately reflect

1589
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,840
what the British people would have thought.

1590
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,200
Therefore, we need to either cancel it or try again or something.

1591
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,400
But see, now we're getting into like the nitpick stuff of like little...

1592
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,920
Of course, we have to cancel it and restart it after like three years

1593
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,600
of our own gaslighting and fear mongering from mainstream media.

1594
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,520
I like how literally every election has already functioned that way,

1595
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,560
but because some people don't like the results of this one, it's suddenly...

1596
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:08,960
Oh, yeah.

1597
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:09,920
Yeah.

1598
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,400
That's literally how the whole world is run.

1599
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,200
All an election is, is a battle of propaganda.

1600
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,400
At that time and place.

1601
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,200
Well, Brexit has been just been a constant bag and forth between people

1602
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,680
who really want Brexit and people who really don't,

1603
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,600
and then just people trying to compromise,

1604
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,760
but no one can come up with a proper compromise.

1605
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,280
I mean, there is no compromise.

1606
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,800
Either you leave the EU or you don't.

1607
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,000
And I mean, you had a referendum and leave one.

1608
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,360
And if you do like a pussyfoot, you know, like misstep,

1609
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,680
and instead of going like hard Brexit, you know,

1610
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,440
World Trade Organization rules.

1611
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,000
If you just go somewhere in the middle and you know,

1612
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,040
oh, this isn't what a lot of people want because it's not hard enough.

1613
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,000
It's like too soft.

1614
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:54,240
But like if you go for like a Norway style and like just give up your seat in the EU parliament,

1615
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,200
just for no reason, just for like, you know, cause...

1616
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:57,680
Yeah, it's just insane.

1617
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,600
That's just not going to appease anyone.

1618
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,200
That's just going to make everyone mad.

1619
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,920
So it just seems like there's going to be no compromise.

1620
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,600
And so now everyone's getting upset at everyone in power from every angle,

1621
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,920
like even people who want it or mad people who want it,

1622
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,760
even people who don't want it or mad people who don't want it,

1623
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,760
because they don't want it, you know, hard enough.

1624
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,320
Has everybody seen the CGP gray video about how there's literally no way

1625
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,440
to give every people what they want because of the Ireland divide?

1626
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,720
And how Ireland will...

1627
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,440
I mean, it depends on who you're asking.

1628
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:31,840
I mean, if you ask someone, if you ask like a conservative from...

1629
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,800
You know, our conception of conservative from like the north of England.

1630
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,440
The Tories.

1631
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,400
Yeah, if you ask a hard line Brexiteer, it's the proper term, I should use that,

1632
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,280
who's like not in Northern Ireland, they'll say,

1633
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,120
yeah, just fucking World Trade Organization rules, we're out of that with any other country.

1634
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,720
If you ask someone in Northern Ireland that obviously have a different opinion,

1635
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,080
you know, no one can agree.

1636
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,800
No one can agree.

1637
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,160
I foresee great troubles.

1638
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,360
I mean, if we're not, if you can't define already, this is a great troubles.

1639
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,240
And I do mean troubles with the capital T there, astute listeners.

1640
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,360
Indeed, indeed.

1641
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,720
Well, fuck, I mean, I don't know.

1642
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:11,600
So what have we learned?

1643
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:19,120
I think that we've learned that when any two parties look at a particular object,

1644
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,840
they most see the characteristics of that object that for whatever reason,

1645
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,040
appeal the most to them, positively or negatively.

1646
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,520
And I think Sargon is certainly one, we all are.

1647
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,240
I want to say in closing, just to be clear, that like,

1648
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:37,040
I'm not even going to say whether I agree or disagree with Sargon's politics.

1649
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,360
It's more like I don't care and barely even know.

1650
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:47,520
All I see is a man who makes a meme out of himself all the time unintentionally.

1651
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:55,360
And the face of the man is the dopiest, most vacant, most self-important fucking face.

1652
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,400
Mostly it's his face.

1653
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,440
That's most of what I have a problem with, that he just looks like such a

1654
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,560
fucking dipshit.

1655
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,600
He just looks like he thinks that he's the smartest guy in the room,

1656
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,440
everywhere he goes, but also has no idea what's happening.

1657
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,320
You know what I mean?

1658
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:13,360
Yeah, I mean, I would disagree with my conclusions, but I understand how you arrive there.

1659
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,040
Yeah, fair enough.

1660
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:22,400
So I've been playing some tabletop games lately.

1661
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,040
Yeah?

1662
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,040
You know who does that? Sargon of a cod.

1663
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,240
Let's all go subscribe.

1664
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,120
That's not true.

1665
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:27,680
Is that true?

1666
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,160
Yeah, no, he has a D&D thing he does like weekly.

1667
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:30,800
Really?

1668
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,880
How could he not do tabletop games?

1669
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,400
The man's a fucking turbo nerd.

1670
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,560
You know, maybe I underestimated this guy.

1671
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,120
Yeah, going back to D&D.

1672
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,640
Could he be the genius that we've waited for?

1673
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:46,240
Well, I shouldn't say that I've started, but I'm participating in my first D&D campaign.

1674
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,520
Your first ever, really?

1675
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,480
Yeah, first ever.

1676
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,200
Tell us about that.

1677
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,640
Like I said, I've been watching the CT, I've been watching the Penny Arcade D&D stuff,

1678
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,400
and I've been like, oh, it's fun.

1679
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:57,840
I like it.

1680
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,920
Despite our vast immeasurable differences, Ben, we're not so different, you and I.

1681
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,480
You were just like me trying to make destiny.

1682
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,000
Yes, question mark, question mark, question mark.

1683
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,840
Anyway, I wish Hippo was here because he's in the D&D campaign.

1684
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,200
Wait, wait, who's playing?

1685
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:24,640
So it's me, Hippo, and a few other people from our friend circle outside the PCP,

1686
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,160
and we're all hanging out.

1687
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,600
I feel more specific, it is nameable.

1688
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,880
Hang on, hang on one second.

1689
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,000
I'm checking my notes.

1690
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,720
I didn't authorize any friendships outside the PCP with you,

1691
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,000
so we're going to need to cut that off.

1692
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,800
You know, it's been a long time coming, you know, frankly.

1693
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,760
Okay, you know, sure.

1694
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,680
No, we got to get them on the payroll.

1695
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,680
Oh, that's fair, as in paying us, as in paying us for the right to...

1696
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,600
They're renting Munchie out as friend.

1697
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,440
That is an exclusive PCP right, so they need to check with us.

1698
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:57,280
The bin, you will know the DM, because it's 610,

1699
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,040
the Hippo Pageant Model of Health and Treatment Services.

1700
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,640
Yes, I've seen him on Twitter lately posting stuff about learning Japanese.

1701
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,480
Yes, yes, yes.

1702
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,480
So anyway, we're only a few sessions in.

1703
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,600
Ganbarimashou.

1704
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,880
It's very hard to do it.

1705
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,520
What are you playing?

1706
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,320
What's your character?

1707
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,760
Uh, I am playing...

1708
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:23,360
My character is a Prussian who wants to unify all ethnic Germans under one flag,

1709
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,120
and not in a racist way, just in a cool way.

1710
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:25,760
That's my boy.

1711
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,320
What fucking game are you playing?

1712
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,480
Not in a Hitler way, but in a Bismarck way.

1713
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:31,920
Of course.

1714
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,520
What game are you playing exactly?

1715
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,280
Well, we're playing...

1716
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,680
We're not playing D&D, we're playing a...

1717
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,040
A...

1718
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,960
Oh god, I don't know what it's fucking called.

1719
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,920
Fate, I think?

1720
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,120
Okay, I heard it.

1721
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,480
I think it's called Fate.

1722
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,560
Oh, I think I heard it.

1723
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,600
It's very loose on rules.

1724
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,120
It's very loose on rules.

1725
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:50,560
Yeah.

1726
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,360
Wait, is that the one?

1727
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:51,760
It should be.

1728
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,640
What's that?

1729
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,600
There's some game...

1730
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,040
I'm not sure if it's Fate, but there's one where you have to define everything about your character,

1731
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,080
including the circumference of their anus.

1732
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:02,480
Wow.

1733
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:02,800
Oh no.

1734
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,040
That sounds like Munchie's kind of thing.

1735
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,120
Hold on, hold on.

1736
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:07,600
Anal?

1737
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,480
I'm circling.

1738
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,040
Anal circumference.

1739
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,480
Well, good luck on R&B.

1740
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,920
I didn't have to define that.

1741
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:14,960
Okay, no, no, no.

1742
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,080
That one's called Fatal.

1743
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,360
Okay, real quick.

1744
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,800
Obviously, the center of your anus is always going to be a zero circumference.

1745
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,800
Is this like the brown hole around it?

1746
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,000
Well, I don't know about that.

1747
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,360
It's how far it can stretch.

1748
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,640
It's how far it can stretch.

1749
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,200
Oh, okay.

1750
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:27,520
Okay, okay.

1751
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,320
That makes sense.

1752
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,400
Yeah, we're talking about maximum circumference.

1753
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,440
Right, of course.

1754
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:32,880
Before you...

1755
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,560
God, why did we waste all the time on Sargon when we could have talked about this the whole time?

1756
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:36,800
I know.

1757
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,240
What were we doing?

1758
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:38,880
Talk about assholes.

1759
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,320
I think the topics are one and the same.

1760
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,680
Quote from Darren McLennan.

1761
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,720
So basically, Fatal is the date rape RPG.

1762
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,560
Sign me up.

1763
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,160
But that's not what we're talking about.

1764
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,360
Well, I mean, I wish it was.

1765
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:54,800
You know what?

1766
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,400
Oh, guys, PCPDD campaign by D&D.

1767
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,320
I mean, a Fatal campaign.

1768
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,280
I think that's a...

1769
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,160
Sounds like a plan to do.

1770
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,280
Yeah, I think it's in the near future.

1771
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,000
I guess I'm in.

1772
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,280
What's Hippo playing?

1773
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:13,600
Hippo is playing a crippled boy, a crippled lad, who is on top of an aged Boston dynamic

1774
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,160
robot, and the Boston dynamic robot carries him on.

1775
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:16,640
Awesome.

1776
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,280
That's cool.

1777
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:17,760
I like it.

1778
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,400
Awesome.

1779
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,720
Well, tell them it.

1780
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:21,440
Tell us about it.

1781
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,440
I don't know if you want me to get into the raw fucking details or anything.

1782
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:25,920
Yeah, a little bit.

1783
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,640
Maybe an overview.

1784
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,280
Yeah, whatever.

1785
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,240
Okay.

1786
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:34,560
Well, Sixen's whipped up this, again, not a very serious endeavor,

1787
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,880
because I don't think anyone wants to do that, especially me.

1788
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:44,720
I can't imagine a worse fate than tuning in for two hours to fucking hardcore roleplay

1789
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:45,440
for realsies.

1790
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,240
Honestly, that was my opinion before.

1791
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,080
I'm starting to get a little bit more into it now that I have a firmer understanding of how

1792
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:52,640
things work.

1793
01:22:52,640 --> 01:23:01,360
But nevertheless, Sixen is obviously a Swedish boy who's whipped up a Scandinavian escapade.

1794
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,720
There isn't really a clear plot right now, but we're just hanging out and trying to get our

1795
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,040
bearing straight and our sea legs.

1796
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,840
Because, again, I've never done this before.

1797
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,480
I think that no one else has done it before either besides Sixen who was DM'd before.

1798
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,320
It's fun.

1799
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:18,880
I want to play.

1800
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,680
Is it fantasy?

1801
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,560
Like, is there magic?

1802
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,120
Are there monsters?

1803
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:21,760
Yes.

1804
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,160
Yes.

1805
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:30,240
I describe it as like, imagine, it takes place in one of those post-apocalypse,

1806
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,880
which just means that people have reverted back to medieval times,

1807
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,960
but there's an excuse to have technology in it.

1808
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,480
That's the way to do it, yeah.

1809
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:43,040
So we're in sort of a middle ages runic setting, like Scandinavia.

1810
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,000
Sounds pretty sick.

1811
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,640
There's bards, there's magic, but there's also obviously Boston Dynamics robots,

1812
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,960
and I have a pick a lot because, of course, I do.

1813
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,920
Indeed, of course.

1814
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,640
Why else would you play oppression for any reason?

1815
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,240
Yeah, literally, unironically.

1816
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,400
So, yeah.

1817
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:06,960
So what's interesting about it to me is that it's sort of very weird experience,

1818
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:13,680
because I am very, like, sort of weirdly far removed from roleplaying.

1819
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:21,280
Obviously, legendarily, mythically, my old Pokemon roleplays are known throughout the land,

1820
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:26,000
and I used to roleplay very heavily in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon

1821
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,120
fandom, but that was many years ago, and very different than a live-action Dean.

1822
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,040
I'm just going to say D&D when I say what I mean.

1823
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:33,680
That's fine, yeah.

1824
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,240
I'll wheel you.

1825
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:34,720
Yeah.

1826
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,520
Yeah, okay.

1827
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,960
I've never done a D&D thing like that.

1828
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:43,840
And it's weird that all my conventions or ideas of how to create a good story

1829
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:50,880
sort of don't apply, and when I try and do them, they're working against what it's meant to be.

1830
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,240
And that's just like...

1831
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,000
What do you mean?

1832
01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:03,680
What I mean by that is that, like, when you are presented with a scenario by the DM,

1833
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:09,440
and you have to work through a problem, be it through diplomacy or with force,

1834
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,600
it's not really...

1835
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,960
It's instead of saying to yourself as a writer,

1836
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:22,080
time to write an interesting exchange between two people, between two characters,

1837
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:29,760
which I am crafting with my own hand, and I'm the deciding factor, it is I have to pretend

1838
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:37,040
to be someone else and work for my own advantage, or the character's advantage, rather.

1839
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,640
So instead of...

1840
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:44,880
I mean, obviously, it's not like they are completely separate things, but instead of,

1841
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:51,600
you know, writing arcs that I can very clearly define because I am in control of the scenario,

1842
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:57,840
I am at the whim of the DM, and I am at the whim of wanting the best for myself.

1843
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,000
So, obviously, while characters may want the best for themselves in fictional scenarios,

1844
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,840
it's not so clear as in I have to make the decision, which will further my own goals,

1845
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:14,400
and I have almost paradoxally, because I have more agency, I have less,

1846
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,640
because I can't affect the game world, I can only affect my actions within it,

1847
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,040
so I'm always going to be looking for positive scenarios for my characters,

1848
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:27,040
which is not actually maybe the most interesting things that could happen.

1849
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:32,720
Like, I'm never going to put myself in bad scenarios, or there is not a

1850
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:36,080
eyebrow game player enough to do that yet.

1851
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,320
If it's what your character would do...

1852
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:42,320
Well, sure, but if it's not what the character would do, then I wouldn't do it.

1853
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,080
But, I mean, the most interesting scenarios are when there's conflict.

1854
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,880
That's true, yeah.

1855
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:55,520
So, obviously, I'm not a... these are sort of like first impressions.

1856
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,320
I don't know if what I said have made any sense,

1857
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,800
since I'm still trying to work out the terminology in my mind.

1858
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,760
I mean, I mean, I... to me, it's like, okay, you got your character,

1859
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,360
you got his motivations, you got your stats, you got your dice,

1860
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,120
you walk yourself into a conflict, and then it's like, you decide,

1861
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:16,000
like, what would my character do if there's a conflict there?

1862
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,720
You know, you roll the dice, you pick what stat you're using,

1863
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,520
you pick what equipment you're using, and like, here's how I'm handling this.

1864
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:29,040
And like, one thing about the C team that I've been watching is Tycho,

1865
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:33,600
the DM, is always... he's always asking... it never ends with a,

1866
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,480
this is what my character does, my character uses this spell,

1867
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,560
my character, you know, uses this skill.

1868
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,080
He always asks, like, okay, tell me what that looks like.

1869
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,200
It's like, okay, I'm using Intimidate.

1870
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,280
Rosie tries to intimidate someone, and he's like, okay,

1871
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,160
but what does that look like?

1872
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:55,760
And she's like, um, well, you know, I think Rosie would attune herself

1873
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,000
to the plane of shadows, and she would like, I don't know,

1874
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,240
maybe she would make like an extra plane of shadow,

1875
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:04,000
like a loom up behind her to make herself look bigger or something,

1876
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,960
and like, I don't know.

1877
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,280
Like, there's like specific, like what... you know,

1878
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,600
it's like the dice and stuff are sort of like a prompt,

1879
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,200
they're sort of like a storytelling prompt.

1880
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,600
And you can decide what things look like

1881
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:19,520
and decide how things progress, but like within this boundary.

1882
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,280
It sounds like a really good way of DMing.

1883
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, like, for example, like,

1884
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:29,600
when he, like, when the warlock, when Cathriss summons a demon,

1885
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,720
it's not just, oh, okay, I pick this demon,

1886
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,720
and like, you know, I make this circle,

1887
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,760
and the demon shows up, and I roll to command it, and stuff.

1888
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,520
That's just the beginning,

1889
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,560
because like, the demon will show up, and then he'll like,

1890
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,200
they'll, they'll role play like a conversation with the demon,

1891
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,120
where like, the demon will introduce himself,

1892
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,680
and like, you'll find, he'll tell you his, his name and stuff,

1893
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,240
and then they'll be like, they'll like discuss,

1894
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,560
like, what am I here on this plane to achieve,

1895
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,240
and like, why should, like, what will you pay me,

1896
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,560
like, what will you give me in exchange for my services,

1897
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,360
and stuff like that.

1898
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,080
It is, it's a very, he digs in, he really digs into it.

1899
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,640
Well, it sounds like a lot of fucking work to me, frankly.

1900
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,480
Well, it's fucking, it's storytelling.

1901
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,480
Yeah, I think that

1902
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,640
D&D just falls into the same, I don't want to say problems,

1903
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,760
because that implies negatives,

1904
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,880
but just like hurdles that normal things don't,

1905
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,240
because it's a game, you know, is a role playing game,

1906
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:24,320
in which, you know, it's almost inherently about empowerment

1907
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,840
to make it feel satisfying to you, the player,

1908
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,560
who is engaged with it as a player.

1909
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,080
So it's almost inherently supposed to be, again,

1910
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,240
I keep coming back to this idea that

1911
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,840
it's supposed to be positive for you,

1912
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,360
where a lot of my most, the most interesting stories to me

1913
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,520
are things in which characters fail,

1914
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,960
or do they not accomplish their tasks,

1915
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,800
or they are flawed in some way,

1916
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,960
which I guess could apply to the D&D characters.

1917
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,840
And obviously, it's, again, I don't want to seem,

1918
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,920
imply that they are so radically different,

1919
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,480
right in a good character, or being a good player,

1920
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,600
but it's just a difference in perspective

1921
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,760
that makes it suddenly different

1922
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,560
in ways that I do think have somewhat massive implications,

1923
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,720
when, again, you are not in control of the scenario,

1924
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:18,080
and you just have to be empowered to make decisions

1925
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,760
in which may not be the most interesting narratively,

1926
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,880
but just make the most sense for the game at that present.

1927
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,320
It sounds to me like you are grappling with the age,

1928
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:33,200
the age-old conflict of role playing versus role playing

1929
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,440
R-O-L-E versus R-O-L-L.

1930
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,960
Is that, do I have the right of it?

1931
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,680
I don't explain further.

1932
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,400
Like, you know, there's the aspect of the game

1933
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,720
that is about storytelling and playing a character,

1934
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,520
and then there's the aspect that is about seeing numbers go up.

1935
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:50,880
Right.

1936
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,000
Well, yeah.

1937
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
The most difficult thing about playing D&D

1938
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
is when you have a group that's just interested

1939
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,840
in rolling dice and swinging swords,

1940
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,680
because that's, you can just go play a video game

1941
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,360
if you want to just do combat and stuff.

1942
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,080
That's how I see it.

1943
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,360
That's me, my dudes.

1944
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:09,360
When I play D&D, I'm like, I barely even look at my numbers

1945
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,080
or my ability.

1946
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,040
I'm not even interested.

1947
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,080
The greatest...

1948
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,440
That part is just sort of incident.

1949
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,320
D&D's greatest strength is that you can do anything.

1950
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,520
You know, the DM allows,

1951
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,920
because you can say you want to do whatever you want,

1952
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,320
as long as the DM allow you to make a check for it,

1953
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,320
you're not bound by a preset amount of mechanics,

1954
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,600
like a video game or something.

1955
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,520
Anything you can think of, you can do,

1956
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,200
and that's what really makes it interesting.

1957
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,000
A lot of the times I've played with people are just like,

1958
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,760
I'm just going to roll my dice and swing my sword.

1959
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:36,240
I'm a fighter.

1960
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,760
I'm just like, this is a slog.

1961
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,560
You've got to play with it.

1962
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,280
Like the best group I ever played with was early last year,

1963
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,640
it was me and a couple buddies,

1964
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:45,920
and we were all just really having fun with it,

1965
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,240
and the DM was another of my friends.

1966
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,680
He's really lax about things,

1967
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,360
just to have everything be fun.

1968
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:57,200
My character is like a half orc, way the drunken fist guy,

1969
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:00,000
so I would have to drink whenever I would need to use drinking stuff.

1970
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,000
So I'd be drunk halfway through the campaign.

1971
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,840
Then my friend was a bard, and he brought his guitar,

1972
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,040
and he'd just sing all the time,

1973
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,520
just make up stupid songs the whole time we were playing,

1974
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:08,960
and it was the best time ever.

1975
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:09,280
That's right.

1976
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,760
You also have to have a good DM for those sort of things,

1977
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,480
because if the DM himself or herself,

1978
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,720
they're interested in just rolling dice and swinging swords,

1979
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:19,680
then you can't really have fun in that sort of way.

1980
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,840
If you're interested in rolling dice and swinging swords,

1981
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,040
you probably shouldn't be DMing,

1982
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,960
because you have to add all the flavor

1983
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,640
that binds everything together.

1984
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:27,680
Did I tell you guys about...

1985
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,360
It is extremely like numbers light.

1986
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,840
There are very few instances where like our stats matter.

1987
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,720
Well, I like that.

1988
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,720
That's how they're like kind of game.

1989
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,120
It's not as though you don't roll dice or anything like that,

1990
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:49,360
and I will say my least favorite part of this experience so far

1991
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,720
is rolling the dice,

1992
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:55,280
because it just feels like it's random self-control

1993
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,000
in a situation where it's like,

1994
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,920
I know to not use like my finishing move or something

1995
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,840
that effect in opportune moments,

1996
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,280
so it wouldn't be narratively satisfying.

1997
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,240
By the way, my finishing move is I can split things in half,

1998
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:12,320
and only in half, 50%.

1999
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,600
And I can do this two things, like all things.

2000
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,000
So I can split like people in half,

2001
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,480
but I can also split like atoms in half.

2002
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,000
And cause a nuclear explosion.

2003
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,720
Oh my God.

2004
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:27,760
But anyway, I know to not use that all the time,

2005
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,440
or else it would just be boring,

2006
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:33,760
but rolls are just like when I want to do something,

2007
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,320
that seems like it shouldn't really be an issue,

2008
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,480
like just attacking someone.

2009
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,520
You know, now it's just like,

2010
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,040
oh, I have a chance to not do it,

2011
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,360
and I just don't do it for some reason.

2012
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,600
And now the DM has to come up with like a weird reason

2013
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,320
why I just now suddenly don't for some reason.

2014
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,640
It's your, well, it's your skill at attacking

2015
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:54,160
versus their skill at avoiding your blow.

2016
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,880
That's, you know, there's a conflict there.

2017
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,640
There's two individuals each trying to achieve something

2018
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,040
different.

2019
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,240
It's not skill-based.

2020
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,560
It's chance-based is what is the problem.

2021
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,560
I mean, it always really comes down to that in the-

2022
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,480
It is chance-based, yeah.

2023
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:08,720
Yeah.

2024
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,960
I mean, that's always been my biggest issue with D&D,

2025
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,200
is that like there's so many times

2026
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,040
where you can just get terrible RNG.

2027
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Like that was like the biggest problem

2028
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,600
with that character I was talking about.

2029
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,640
Thrax, the half orc drunk man, he would just constantly miss

2030
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,680
even though his punches could like destroy anything.

2031
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,200
And like the gimmick was just like,

2032
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,960
he's so drunk, he can't hit anything, I guess,

2033
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,720
because like my dice rolls always suck.

2034
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:33,120
Dude, I've sounded somewhat negative here,

2035
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,480
and I don't mean to be.

2036
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:38,320
Hold on, I want to say that reminds me of in Morrowind,

2037
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,160
in Elder Scrolls Morrowind,

2038
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:43,600
you, it does a random number generator every time you attack.

2039
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,680
So you can literally see your spear go into an enemy

2040
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,240
and see the word miss pop up above their head.

2041
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,480
D&D is a little better at that.

2042
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,720
The first, when I tried to play that game,

2043
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,680
all I did was like, I was in the starting village,

2044
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,800
I just like walked out of it, tried to attack a monster,

2045
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,720
missed like 12 times in a row,

2046
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,320
and stopped playing the game forever.

2047
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,320
That's understandable.

2048
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:06,880
That's RPGs.

2049
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,320
Yeah.

2050
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:09,440
Well, I-

2051
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,480
Well, it shouldn't be, I mean, like in an action RPG,

2052
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:16,080
I feel like the whole point is that that abstraction isn't there.

2053
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,120
That's true, I agree.

2054
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,880
I think it makes sense.

2055
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,440
I get it.

2056
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,080
And in D&D, it's not that way,

2057
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,080
because like really, you don't see what's happening,

2058
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,000
what's happening if you're fighting like an armored guy

2059
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,720
and you fail to overcome his, what's the AC stand for?

2060
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:28,800
What's the-

2061
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,600
Armor class.

2062
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:29,920
Armor class.

2063
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,720
Armor class, right.

2064
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,480
Like you just chink, you're off his armor,

2065
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,200
which makes sense.

2066
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,600
He's got fucking armor on, your sword bounces off it,

2067
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,320
or he's a speedy fuck.

2068
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,560
Or he's a dodger, he's dodged your flow,

2069
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,280
or there's a magical repulsion or something, you know?

2070
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,640
So it feels unsatisfying,

2071
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,120
but really it actually is perfectly reasonable.

2072
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:46,880
It makes sense within the logic of the world,

2073
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,880
but the problem is that the dice tend to rob you from agency

2074
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,920
in a game that's biggest strength is that you can do whatever you want.

2075
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,200
Yeah, I agree, Tom.

2076
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,320
That's a good way to put it.

2077
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,240
Well, I mean, I think the idea is that like,

2078
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:01,520
you know, as your character advances and your numbers do go up,

2079
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,520
you become more empowered to like make the things

2080
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,600
that you want to see happen happen.

2081
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,720
Well, of course, of course.

2082
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,680
As you gain more spells,

2083
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,320
and as you get better at doing things in general.

2084
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,000
I know, I guess it's a whole, like it wouldn't be meaningful

2085
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,640
that you can overcome a foe if you didn't have to work up to it,

2086
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:21,040
if like in a previous version of yourself

2087
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,960
would have failed at accomplishing this.

2088
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,360
I think the only, I mean, I totally get it,

2089
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:26,720
and I still love D&D on the whole.

2090
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,640
That's why I made a whole video about how it's the greatest thing.

2091
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,080
But the only issue is like, if you were playing a video game,

2092
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,680
like if you were playing Final Fantasy VII

2093
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,440
and like at level 1 through 10,

2094
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:39,040
you have like a 50% miss rate, like you'd want to kill yourself.

2095
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:42,640
And like D&D tends to have like a 30 to 50% miss rate,

2096
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,000
especially at low levels.

2097
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,400
That's true.

2098
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,520
Because you're, you know,

2099
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,280
you got to hit like 15 or something,

2100
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,640
and if you're only getting like a plus four bonus at starting out,

2101
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,880
like that leaves a lot of space for you to just fuck up.

2102
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,880
This is unrelated to my experience,

2103
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,840
because there are no levels,

2104
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,880
and I don't know how that works in normal D&D.

2105
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,800
But I probably come across as like negative

2106
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,160
or like a non-enjoying experience,

2107
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,840
but all contrary, my friend, I'm quite enjoying it.

2108
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,600
It's just, it gets my brain percolating,

2109
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,600
because it's again something that I have not experienced

2110
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,560
in really a long time.

2111
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,000
This idea of having to like work with other people

2112
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:16,720
to achieve an error,

2113
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,760
because obviously I have given my character faults,

2114
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,720
and I've given my care,

2115
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,200
I have a general idea of how I would like an arc to go

2116
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,480
for said character.

2117
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,640
But now I have to work that into what,

2118
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:27,920
what Sixen wants is DM,

2119
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,320
and what the other players do in the game,

2120
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,000
and what situations we find ourselves in.

2121
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,880
And I feel, again, it's a weird paradox

2122
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,480
where I have agency in the sense

2123
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,080
that I am controlling something,

2124
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,760
but I have such a limited agency

2125
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,560
in that I am at the whim of the DM and the other players

2126
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,000
in a lot of circumstances.

2127
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,080
And the dice, where I would want to maybe finish off

2128
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,480
a character or a fight in some way,

2129
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,880
which would be relevant to my character's arc,

2130
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,600
but I simply cannot, because I can't get a good role.

2131
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:00,000
And then I remember the first altercation where,

2132
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,240
I mean, you know, this isn't a problem or anything,

2133
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:04,560
but just this, this game, this is a good

2134
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,960
sense I have for how the game will go,

2135
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,960
where it's like I had a specific way

2136
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,520
in which I wanted to finish off the first boss

2137
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,360
that we encountered that would be relevant

2138
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,120
to the character's arc.

2139
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:18,560
But obviously, everyone else does two,

2140
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,000
because everyone else is their own character,

2141
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,080
and everyone else wants this to be relevant to their,

2142
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,320
because they are the protagonists, they are the player.

2143
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,160
So when the turns went, and I was,

2144
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:31,360
like the person right before me got the kill,

2145
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:34,160
and you know, in a particularly glorious way,

2146
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:37,280
it was like, ah, shit, I have to be like better.

2147
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,680
And by better, I mean luckier, I guess.

2148
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:42,720
It's an interesting scenario.

2149
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:46,080
I'm enjoying it, I wish Hippo was here,

2150
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,840
you know, he is a part of it after all.

2151
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,440
I want to, maybe next week we can hear his thoughts.

2152
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:51,920
Sure.

2153
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,480
You guys can fucking hash it out.

2154
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:54,880
Yeah.

2155
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,680
My, again, my thoughts may seem negative,

2156
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:59,840
but they're merely contemplative,

2157
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,400
they're merely contemplative on the philosophical quandaries

2158
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,000
they have, well, plain D&D.

2159
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,880
Contemplative, that word should be pronounced.

2160
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,040
If you're interested, there's obviously way more details

2161
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,240
that I'm sparing the audience for,

2162
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,520
because I'm sure it'll be really boring,

2163
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,360
but if you're interested, we can really wrap it up.

2164
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:13,760
Yeah, sure.

2165
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,800
I don't want to say I've been playing a game,

2166
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,480
I've been playing a game with some friends

2167
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,400
being DM'd by a friend of mine.

2168
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:24,640
It's called Dogs in the Vineyard, and you play,

2169
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:30,000
and yeah, and you play as a dog, a dog of the faith,

2170
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,120
and the faith is a, you are basically a combination,

2171
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,960
I said this before, I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself,

2172
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,560
but the audience didn't hear it yet.

2173
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:40,400
You are a combination mailman slash missionary

2174
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,520
slash detective slash lethal enforcer

2175
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,120
slash pizza hut slash Taco Bell.

2176
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,360
For the, for a fictional version

2177
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,680
in like a fictionalized United States

2178
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,600
of like the Mormon Church.

2179
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:54,240
Okay, okay.

2180
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,600
Oh, and in Deseret?

2181
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:57,600
I, what?

2182
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,640
A Deseret is the proposed Mormon super state,

2183
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,520
if you don't know what it is,

2184
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,200
obviously it does not take place there.

2185
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,360
I haven't heard that term so no,

2186
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,800
but this is like an alternate,

2187
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,720
there's a couple of things that are different,

2188
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,480
that went different, like the history of China,

2189
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,240
there was some kind of like holy rebellion

2190
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,920
in China that succeeded in this world

2191
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,120
that didn't in the real world.

2192
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:15,440
Okay.

2193
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,480
Yeah, there's more to it.

2194
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,000
There's still time, China, get to it.

2195
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,760
But yeah, and you have a big coat,

2196
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,120
you have like a custom coat,

2197
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:24,880
because this is like a part of your mark of office,

2198
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,480
like the people in your community.

2199
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,320
So you're not a literal dog, are you?

2200
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,600
No, no, no, no, no.

2201
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,080
Okay, okay.

2202
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,880
Dog is your type.

2203
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,760
Gotcha, gotcha.

2204
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,600
And you are this, you are a guy,

2205
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,200
you are a fucking going around,

2206
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,200
you're like a holy warrior for Mormonism.

2207
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:38,560
And...

2208
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:38,800
Sick.

2209
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,680
My character is Charlie Yang.

2210
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,720
That's Chinese.

2211
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:49,280
He is Chinese, he is the son of immigrant railroad workers,

2212
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,920
but he is deeply resentful of his,

2213
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,360
he just wants to assimilate,

2214
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,400
he just wants to fit in,

2215
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,400
he resents his parents for being workers,

2216
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,160
he resents them for being Chinese,

2217
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:00,400
he resents white people for not,

2218
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,240
for seeing him as different.

2219
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,240
He's a very resentful, conflicted guy,

2220
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,400
but he has a cool coat with a dragon on it.

2221
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,680
Well, fantastic.

2222
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,360
Is this like a battle series?

2223
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,520
Well, there is fight,

2224
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,520
like we came to this town for,

2225
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,440
the DM sent us to this town for,

2226
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:20,960
they were tithing too much,

2227
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,040
and we suspected that something was wrong there.

2228
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,560
And it turns out that, yeah, they were,

2229
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,240
they were overworking their,

2230
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:29,440
like there's strict strictures in the book of Enoch,

2231
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:30,880
laying out like how,

2232
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,640
basically they're laying out like workers need,

2233
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,560
you know, they shouldn't work too many hours in a week,

2234
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,920
they need at least one day off a week.

2235
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:36,760
Sure.

2236
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,240
And they were not observing,

2237
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,080
they were not observing these things.

2238
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:40,720
Those bastards.

2239
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,600
Turned out,

2240
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,440
turned out there was a cult going on,

2241
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,960
and there was like some demonic possessions,

2242
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,200
we had to baptize a baby that had a demon in it,

2243
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,640
we had to name the baby,

2244
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,360
we had to fucking,

2245
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,600
we had to, we had to fucking kill a few guys,

2246
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,800
they were doing some demon shit,

2247
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:53,760
and that wasn't cool.

2248
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:54,000
Yeah.

2249
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,400
I try, I try so hard,

2250
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,040
I am like, I'm playing my guy as like a complete conciliator

2251
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,680
who's tries to avoid conflict at all times,

2252
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,640
who just wants to,

2253
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:03,760
he just wants to save souls,

2254
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,040
he doesn't pull his gun out unless,

2255
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,400
things aren't really bad,

2256
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,120
there was a shootout,

2257
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:08,480
people were shooting at us from the windows,

2258
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,080
I had to lasso a guy out a window,

2259
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,280
you know, it was,

2260
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:11,920
you know, it was,

2261
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,280
it was pretty all right.

2262
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,120
There were hatchets were thrown,

2263
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,720
hatchets were embedded in skulls,

2264
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,400
but you know what,

2265
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,760
it's all for the king of life,

2266
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:20,800
you know, praise him.

2267
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,640
Is that the Mormon God or whatever?

2268
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:23,520
Yes, in this world,

2269
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,480
he's called the king of life.

2270
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,520
Okay, sick, sick.

2271
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:25,760
I have,

2272
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,240
there's every one,

2273
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:29,360
at one time I was like,

2274
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,200
I think I had to,

2275
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,720
I think I was trying to like,

2276
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,400
exercise a house or something,

2277
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,600
and I had to improv,

2278
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:36,880
I had to improv like a,

2279
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,520
like a passage from the,

2280
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,960
from like the holy book or something,

2281
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,560
I just came up with something on this,

2282
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,560
but that's the kind of stuff I like.

2283
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:45,200
Yeah, that's cool.

2284
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:46,400
Like what would you,

2285
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,200
what would you say?

2286
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:47,840
Like what's a,

2287
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:48,560
what's a thing?

2288
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,200
What would you,

2289
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:50,160
what's,

2290
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:51,840
what kind of thing would happen in this scenario?

2291
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,960
Blessed be the man who layeth his wife

2292
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,480
upon a green grass,

2293
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,480
only twice in the full moon,

2294
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,840
and not three times,

2295
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,760
for that would be too much for her,

2296
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:02,560
you know,

2297
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,520
womb.

2298
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,000
Right.

2299
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:04,400
Something,

2300
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:04,720
yeah.

2301
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:05,280
Something like this.

2302
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:05,600
I made,

2303
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,680
I made up a little parable about like a,

2304
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:08,080
like a,

2305
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:09,680
someone,

2306
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:10,000
some,

2307
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,400
a holy man coming on like a rich community,

2308
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,280
with like the,

2309
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:13,920
they like,

2310
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,040
they favored like the,

2311
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,320
the local authorities,

2312
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,640
they favored like earthly authority over,

2313
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,000
over the king of life.

2314
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,040
Oh no, no, no, no.

2315
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:21,760
And they were,

2316
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:22,000
yeah,

2317
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,360
and they got rich off of that,

2318
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,560
but God smote them

2319
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,320
because they had their fucking priorities

2320
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:26,720
all mixed up.

2321
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:26,960
Yeah.

2322
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:27,360
Okay.

2323
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:27,680
He's,

2324
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,000
oh yeah,

2325
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,800
he's smote him.

2326
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:28,960
Oh,

2327
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,320
he's smote him all right.

2328
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:30,960
Demons are real,

2329
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,320
so I guess God is definitely real.

2330
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:33,920
Oh,

2331
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,800
I should think so.

2332
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:35,280
Mm hmm.

2333
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:35,760
I,

2334
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,480
I,

2335
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,840
I wouldn't even question it.

2336
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,040
Sounds fair to me.

2337
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:39,680
It's a really,

2338
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:41,360
it's a really weird system.

2339
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,960
Like there's not like attack and defense.

2340
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,240
You basically just take turns

2341
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:45,520
doing shit.

2342
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,040
And like your,

2343
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,360
and like attack and defense are all like

2344
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,320
rolled into one thing,

2345
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,240
and there's just like huge dice pools,

2346
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,000
and like every turn it's like,

2347
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,720
you're bringing in,

2348
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,200
you're bringing,

2349
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,160
you choose,

2350
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,920
you roll your initial dice,

2351
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,280
and then the next turn it's like,

2352
01:43:59,280 --> 01:43:59,760
well,

2353
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,320
oh,

2354
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:01,440
I have a trait

2355
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,160
where it's like,

2356
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:03,360
you know,

2357
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:03,920
I'm,

2358
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,720
I'm,

2359
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:04,960
you know,

2360
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,240
I went to school,

2361
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,520
my character has a trait that's like,

2362
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,200
I went to engineering school

2363
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,480
so I could run railroads

2364
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,480
instead of build them like my parents did.

2365
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:12,880
So like,

2366
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,720
if there's like an engineering scenario,

2367
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:14,960
I'll be like,

2368
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:15,200
oh yeah,

2369
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,240
I'll bring that trait in,

2370
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,360
add some more dice.

2371
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:17,840
Next turn,

2372
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,560
someone shoots at me,

2373
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:18,720
oh,

2374
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:19,520
I pull my gun out

2375
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,240
and shoot back at him.

2376
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:22,320
Now I bring my guns dice into it, you know.

2377
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,440
I'm just imagining

2378
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,720
as the dice pool grows,

2379
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,320
like you get to like a giant,

2380
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,320
like there's a dark soul style giant lever,

2381
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:28,880
you need to full,

2382
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,160
a full body like pull,

2383
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,120
which opens the door,

2384
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:33,360
it's like a gigantic vat full of dice

2385
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:34,720
that all begin rolling,

2386
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,360
all at once.

2387
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:36,800
That's,

2388
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,280
that's the,

2389
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:37,840
that's the,

2390
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:38,560
that's the dream.

2391
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:38,800
That,

2392
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,680
that is the dream.

2393
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,000
So many weapons.

2394
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,120
You gotta unlock,

2395
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:42,160
you gotta turn the key.

2396
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:43,440
Oh shit.

2397
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,160
That's what it was like

2398
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:46,000
when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima

2399
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,120
for every individual person,

2400
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,560
they had to take individual damage,

2401
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:49,600
you know,

2402
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,480
you know how it was,

2403
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,440
or Dresden,

2404
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:51,920
whatever,

2405
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:52,240
it's all good.

2406
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:53,520
When the bomb starts dropping,

2407
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,320
and like the emperor,

2408
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,360
and the dice start rolling.

2409
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,960
It's like everyone roll initiative.

2410
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:58,480
Shit.

2411
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:02,080
Rat,

2412
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,800
Ratcon for D&D campaign, dude.

2413
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:06,080
Maybe.

2414
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:06,720
Hey.

2415
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:09,120
RFCK D&D campaign, dude.

2416
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:10,960
Munchy.

2417
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:11,760
Remember,

2418
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,560
remember mice,

2419
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,680
the convention?

2420
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:14,240
Of course, of course.

2421
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,440
Remember what you were thinking about?

2422
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,000
Okay.

2423
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,240
Well,

2424
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,800
it's been less than a month

2425
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,160
since the like table applications are open,

2426
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:23,360
and they're already closed.

2427
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,560
Oh, well.

2428
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:24,960
What?

2429
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,560
I checked it a little while.

2430
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,360
Yeah, like I didn't,

2431
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,160
I didn't think they'd be gone instantly.

2432
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:31,520
They opened up in April,

2433
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,640
and now it's May,

2434
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:33,600
and yeah,

2435
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,720
according to the website,

2436
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,240
they're no longer taking applications,

2437
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:37,760
so I'm very disappointed.

2438
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:38,880
I mean, what were you waiting for?

2439
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:40,720
Did you want to be in?

2440
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,080
Yeah.

2441
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:43,760
Me and,

2442
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,520
me and Kazzy talked about it,

2443
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:46,880
talked about getting the table together,

2444
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,320
and I haven't talked to her about it,

2445
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,240
but I kind of thought you were maybe

2446
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:51,120
going to join in on this,

2447
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,560
since you're like moving here.

2448
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:52,960
No.

2449
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,760
Well, I mean,

2450
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,880
to get a table there?

2451
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,240
I mean, I'm a comics artist,

2452
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,040
so why would I?

2453
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:57,440
No.

2454
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,640
Oh, okay.

2455
01:45:58,640 --> 01:45:59,520
Well, I guess I should tell her.

2456
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,440
Rest in peace, investigator.

2457
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,200
We fucked up,

2458
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,760
and that's all fucked now.

2459
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,000
And I feel terrible about it.

2460
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,040
It is life,

2461
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:09,920
and it's all my fault.

2462
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,080
You'll just know for next year, I guess.

2463
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,120
I don't know if you want to.

2464
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:15,840
There's more conventions.

2465
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,200
I guess this one's really good,

2466
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:20,480
and Casey Green was there,

2467
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,160
and Abby Howard was there,

2468
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:24,000
and I wanted to be on the other side.

2469
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:24,960
I didn't want to go there

2470
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,400
as a fucking consumer,

2471
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,520
as a fucking sheep there

2472
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,240
to spend money on this crap.

2473
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:29,760
Should I get over it complex, dude?

2474
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,440
I didn't.

2475
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:31,840
It's terrible.

2476
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:32,400
It's terrible.

2477
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,120
I don't blame him.

2478
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:33,920
I feel the same way.

2479
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,840
I, too, am a man filled with pride

2480
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,600
that is unwarranted, but, you know.

2481
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:40,000
I'm literally not even going.

2482
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,040
Like, I'm not even going.

2483
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:41,520
Oh, man.

2484
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,520
You just don't fucking see that way.

2485
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,240
It was awful.

2486
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:45,360
It was awful going there

2487
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:45,920
as a fire expert.

2488
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,440
No, you just got to take after Munch.

2489
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,960
You got to go up to Casey Green

2490
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:51,120
and ask him about the Smurfs 2 movie.

2491
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,560
That's how you get it.

2492
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,800
He'll let you on his podcast eventually.

2493
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,880
Send him some pickup lines on his Tumblr

2494
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,800
for, like, three months before the convention.

2495
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,280
It's not impossible.

2496
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,320
You're just talking about how

2497
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:06,240
fucking celebrities aren't as mysterious

2498
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,200
as they may seem.

2499
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,320
Just fucking talk to him.

2500
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,440
Just think at the end of the day,

2501
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,200
he's just like Sargon of a Cod,

2502
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,320
just a regular person.

2503
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,680
Okay, here's what you do.

2504
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,880
You go to conventions,

2505
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,680
and you see about how no one pays attention to you.

2506
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,280
And then you go to fucking whatever,

2507
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,320
the round table, and you're like,

2508
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:25,120
oh, I just won't tell anyone that I'm a comics artist.

2509
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:26,720
I just won't let them know

2510
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:27,040
about my many, many feats.

2511
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,680
It should be implied by my very presence.

2512
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:29,920
Yeah.

2513
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:31,520
You got to be more...

2514
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,800
Oh, I'll eat too much credit.

2515
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:35,520
You can't be so fucking sad

2516
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,480
that you aren't telling anyone

2517
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,280
about how great you are.

2518
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:37,840
Just let them know.

2519
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:38,720
Well, if you had a bad time...

2520
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,840
I'm not sad.

2521
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:40,960
I'm just...

2522
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,440
Also, I won't be going to that for a while

2523
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,880
because I broke my toe yesterday.

2524
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:45,360
Oh, no.

2525
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:46,560
How'd you do that?

2526
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,040
Again?

2527
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:47,600
This is a partnership.

2528
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,040
Yeah, with same toe.

2529
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:49,680
Oh, no.

2530
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:50,080
I just...

2531
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,360
With same toe?

2532
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,400
Yeah, I just stubbed it really hard into a door

2533
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,440
as I was walking through,

2534
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,560
and I instantly was like,

2535
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:57,120
that's definitely...

2536
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:58,560
Mistake after mistake.

2537
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:00,800
Ben, I would highly recommend just

2538
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,080
tilting your field of view

2539
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:04,000
like five degrees lower at all times.

2540
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,120
Do you wear slippers?

2541
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:06,000
Look lower.

2542
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:07,520
No, I don't wear slippers.

2543
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,400
I think you should.

2544
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:10,560
It's too hot.

2545
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:11,600
It's too hot to wear slippers.

2546
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,400
It is getting warm out.

2547
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,200
Okay.

2548
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:14,960
I cannot resonate with what just

2549
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:16,080
has happened at all.

2550
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:20,320
So you were walking so fucking hard

2551
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,640
into your door that you stubbed it?

2552
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,800
I was just walking at a norm.

2553
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,600
I went to my door.

2554
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,880
I opened the door.

2555
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,280
I kind of simultaneously was opening the door

2556
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:32,000
as I was taking a step with my foot

2557
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:32,960
like to walk through it,

2558
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,360
and the foot and the door just collided

2559
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,760
in the cross section with enough force.

2560
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,720
But it broke your toe?

2561
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,560
You going to the doctor or anything?

2562
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,280
Did you already go?

2563
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:41,440
I'm in bunchy.

2564
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,600
Remember last time he broke it just by like

2565
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,680
walking into a room and he was running at the time.

2566
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:46,560
I don't remember last time

2567
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,600
because I wasn't there in that house.

2568
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:48,880
I'm feeling discomfort.

2569
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,080
I was moving at a slightly faster than walk.

2570
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,680
I'm no, I'm not going to the doctor

2571
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:55,360
because every time I've broken my toe,

2572
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:56,400
I've just gone to the doctor.

2573
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,320
They've just been like, well, you can tape it.

2574
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,080
Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough.

2575
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,880
And I'm just like, I mean, I can still walk.

2576
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:03,360
Yeah.

2577
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,720
I mean, it hurts a little bit

2578
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,160
and I'm trying not to walk too much.

2579
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,920
But like, you know, I can still walk.

2580
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,040
I'm not like crippled.

2581
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,240
I just, I don't know.

2582
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:11,760
It probably in like a week or two,

2583
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,880
I won't even feel it anymore.

2584
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,800
And it'll be like, it didn't even happen.

2585
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:15,440
Well, all right.

2586
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:19,040
Well, I'm glad that the one PCB member

2587
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,680
that has an issue related to their feet and legs

2588
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,240
is going to be, you know, healed up real soon.

2589
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:26,080
Good job, Ben. You know, good job.

2590
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,400
Yep. Don't worry, everyone. I'm fine.

2591
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,320
You know what? Everything's great.

2592
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,720
Guys, can we all just give it a round of applause

2593
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,720
for this, for our state of physical health?

2594
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,800
I feel good. I'm brave. It's true.

2595
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,640
Hey, I'm a brave boy.

2596
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,520
We were talking before.

2597
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,680
I have one thing I wanted to bring up.

2598
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:46,800
We spoke briefly about access journalism,

2599
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:47,680
kind of, not really.

2600
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,080
I don't know what, I've never,

2601
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,280
I've never heard that phrase before.

2602
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,400
Well, okay. That is a phrase.

2603
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:53,040
I'm joking.

2604
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,080
What are we talking about?

2605
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:54,800
I just woke up.

2606
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,240
Like talking to celebrities or whatever.

2607
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:00,080
Okay. Well, here's my point.

2608
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,280
Here's my point.

2609
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,440
So I just hit 100,000 subs and that's cool.

2610
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:05,120
Congratulations.

2611
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:06,320
Now that I did that.

2612
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,280
Oh, yes. Thank you. Thank you.

2613
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:09,760
Now it's time to have a pro Jared style fallout.

2614
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,560
Oh my God.

2615
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,920
Cheat on the PCP with the pizza party podcast.

2616
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,920
I've been here since 100,000 subs.

2617
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,360
Can't wait for 90,000.

2618
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,720
Can't wait for 80,000.

2619
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:19,600
Looking forward to it.

2620
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,560
I'm, I'm, what was I fucking saying?

2621
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,120
Oh, right. Okay.

2622
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,360
So, so I was talking to the gaming Brit the other day,

2623
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:28,560
just passing.

2624
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,520
And I was like, yeah.

2625
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:30,560
He was like, hey, congrats.

2626
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,000
He's like, you getting your silver play button?

2627
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,680
I was like, you know, I, I don't know.

2628
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:34,400
I've been waiting for like,

2629
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:36,160
there's supposed to be like a prompt for that or something

2630
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,600
and like the thing I don't know what to do.

2631
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,160
He's like, why don't you just message like support?

2632
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:41,680
I was like, wait, you can do that?

2633
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:43,840
He was like, yeah, just like Google, you know,

2634
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:44,880
fucking support.

2635
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,520
And this is what he had to do to get his or something.

2636
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,560
And they'll hook you up.

2637
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,320
And so I was like, oh, okay.

2638
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:51,680
Now apparently, this is a support.

2639
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,760
Let me know if this works because if it does,

2640
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:56,800
I have, it's been fucking four years

2641
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,160
and that prompt never came.

2642
01:50:58,720 --> 01:50:59,520
Did you, okay.

2643
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:00,640
Did you, did you ever?

2644
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,920
Cause I have done this now.

2645
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,240
So first of all, I am now verified on Twitter.

2646
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:06,720
Cause I, sorry, not Twitter on, on YouTube.

2647
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,360
Cause I reached out to the people on this help thing.

2648
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,320
And there was a lady.

2649
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,000
I think this is only available once you have a hundred

2650
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:12,800
thousand subs.

2651
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,480
I think is literally the cutoff point.

2652
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,600
But once you have it, I just reached out

2653
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,680
and I just sent him messages like,

2654
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,440
Hey, I'm the, you know, best care for this is my channel.

2655
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:22,400
Like I've got two issues.

2656
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,920
One, I was hoping I could get verified.

2657
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,120
Let me know what I have to do for that.

2658
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:27,200
And two, dude, you got that, you got that check mark.

2659
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:30,240
I look right now in the fucking thing.

2660
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:31,600
It's a great check mark.

2661
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:32,640
It's a great check mark.

2662
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:33,760
I know it's not blue on YouTube.

2663
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:35,360
Look in the gross discussing audio links.

2664
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,000
There it is.

2665
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:36,960
There's my check mark.

2666
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:40,480
So I, so I like, that doesn't mean anything

2667
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:41,040
other than that.

2668
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,320
I'm like the real me, I guess.

2669
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,920
Like Sargon says all the time, you're now a shill

2670
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:44,960
and I can't trust you.

2671
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,080
Well that, that's on Twitter.

2672
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:48,000
It's very different on Twitter versus YouTube.

2673
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,200
It's a very different situation.

2674
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:49,440
Yeah.

2675
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:52,480
What I, I've actually tried to get verified on Twitter

2676
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,400
and I just found out they are not accepting

2677
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,880
applications for Twitter verification.

2678
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,680
So I don't think there is even a path anymore

2679
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,680
to Twitter verification of any kind.

2680
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,840
God, what's young Venus going to do?

2681
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,160
I know, I know, he never did it.

2682
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:09,760
Oh God, our dream has been shattered.

2683
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:10,400
Oh, no one tell him.

2684
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,040
I think what you need to tell him.

2685
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:11,520
No one tell him.

2686
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,760
He still hasn't verified Satan and I.

2687
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,640
There's still a path.

2688
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:17,920
You just become a journalist for some like

2689
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,720
big old world publication is what you do.

2690
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:22,320
And I think you will get verified.

2691
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,840
I just don't think there's like a process

2692
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,840
for the average person to get there anyway.

2693
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:28,160
Okay, but, but on the subject of the silver play button,

2694
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,840
so did you tell me if you've ever gotten this?

2695
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,840
Cause like she said, like I was talking to this lady

2696
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:32,960
and I'm like, hey, help me, you know,

2697
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,320
verify and then silver play button.

2698
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,600
She's like, oh yeah, no problem.

2699
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,520
Like I'll send you an email in a little bit.

2700
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:40,720
What she sent me is an email with a voucher code

2701
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:43,760
and a link to like go here, put in this voucher code.

2702
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,280
It prompts a window.

2703
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,520
It says like type of your name or it said best guy,

2704
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:48,080
but you can change it.

2705
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:49,440
I just left it best guy ever.

2706
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,120
And boom, hit okay.

2707
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,800
We're now currently processing

2708
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,240
your silver play button order.

2709
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:56,400
It will be there in like, you know,

2710
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,440
a couple of weeks or whatever.

2711
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,040
So I think it's done.

2712
01:52:59,040 --> 01:52:59,760
It's on its way.

2713
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:00,800
I think I need to go.

2714
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:01,280
Amazing.

2715
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,920
Gower, cause the email that I will help you do

2716
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,120
is the same way Brent helped me.

2717
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,200
I've only checked it like twice ever,

2718
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,800
which is when my channel got taken down

2719
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,520
to figure out why and what to do about it.

2720
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,480
So it could possibly be buried in my email somewhere

2721
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,160
ages ago.

2722
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,760
I'll show you exactly what was sent to me.

2723
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:20,880
But even beyond that,

2724
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:24,320
I will give you exactly what fucking notification thing

2725
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,560
I found and I just messaged her and said,

2726
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:27,280
Hey, I want a thing.

2727
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,560
They're like, no problem.

2728
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,840
We'll do immediately.

2729
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:30,560
Nope.

2730
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,200
Done, done.

2731
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:31,600
Yeah.

2732
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,640
And it takes a long time for it to actually process as well.

2733
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:36,880
Well, that very well may be the case,

2734
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,480
but like it is underway now.

2735
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,600
It wasn't before and now it is.

2736
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,760
So I'm, I'm feeling pretty, pretty chuffed about that.

2737
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:43,680
So yeah.

2738
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,840
Oh, and the point I wanted to make about that was like,

2739
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,360
okay, that's all well and good.

2740
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,280
But like, you know, like a months ago,

2741
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,960
my boy, a lobster boy,

2742
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:54,320
Tyrar A. Dewey, ASMR guy, he, um, no.

2743
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:58,240
It's just that he reached 100,000 subs like a while ago.

2744
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:59,760
He's like 125,000 or whatever.

2745
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,040
And like he made a video or whatever

2746
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:04,080
and just said that like once he hit 100,000,

2747
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,840
life was just so much better.

2748
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,480
Like they were so nice and they were so helpful

2749
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,600
in like the chat thing.

2750
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:13,360
And this is the thing is I never even once attempted

2751
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:16,160
to reach out to YouTube before I hit 100,000 subs.

2752
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:18,080
So I have no basis for comparison,

2753
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,080
but based on my experience now,

2754
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:22,000
it's basically been great.

2755
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:22,720
It's been super great.

2756
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:25,200
It's an, it's like an unwritten thing,

2757
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,840
but I think everybody understands that when you hit 100K,

2758
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,920
you are just treated in some way differently by the system.

2759
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,200
And like generally when people hit 100K,

2760
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:39,760
the next couple 10,000 subs come way easier.

2761
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:40,320
Yeah.

2762
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,480
Yeah, that does, it always seems to happen.

2763
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,280
And that's certainly my plan.

2764
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,120
I mean there's like tiers of YouTube, obviously.

2765
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,040
100K is one, when you hit a million,

2766
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,160
you go like super fucking pro and then like you're a god.

2767
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:52,960
Is that just, is that just from people that see that number?

2768
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,720
No, I think it changed the way that the system treats you entirely.

2769
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:58,640
Because it's where they take you seriously

2770
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,080
as a YouTuber basically.

2771
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:00,480
I had to fucking-

2772
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,000
Because you're actually making them decent money now.

2773
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,320
I am busting for a shit.

2774
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:07,040
So nobody addressed me for the next few minutes.

2775
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,400
Okay, you got it, dog.

2776
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:11,280
And the only other thing about that is,

2777
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,120
I think, did you said it's like implicit?

2778
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,480
It's like not specified?

2779
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,800
I think it is in fact 100% articulated,

2780
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,960
at least parts of it, that you just,

2781
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,440
at the very least you just don't have access

2782
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:25,280
to the support staff until you hit 100,000 subs.

2783
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,200
And once you do, then you do.

2784
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:28,400
Then they will talk to you.

2785
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,320
I want, I am games to hit 100,000,

2786
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,480
so I can just like talk to somebody in real life

2787
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,360
and just shit on them.

2788
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,200
Be like, I fucking hate your company so much.

2789
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:35,280
The only problem is-

2790
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,440
It's great that I can finally talk to someone about it.

2791
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,000
The only problem is,

2792
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,560
you're just dealing with outsourced IT people who,

2793
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,080
you know, they're not making any decisions at all.

2794
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,600
It's the closest thing I'm ever gonna get

2795
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:44,720
to Wajiski yourself,

2796
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,320
so I'll take what I can get at that point.

2797
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:47,840
I guess, but you know, honestly,

2798
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,400
I was in a Digi's podcast,

2799
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,040
the Whirling Dervish podcast the other day.

2800
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:54,000
And I was just thinking,

2801
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,320
I still resonate with his attitude

2802
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:57,840
to why he's not here to hear this praise,

2803
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:03,040
but it was just like people who have issues with YouTube,

2804
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,920
it's just like, I mean, adapt and overcome.

2805
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:07,920
I mean, you know, every job has issues.

2806
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:08,800
The particular ones on YouTube are-

2807
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,160
Of course you have to adapt or overcome.

2808
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:11,360
That doesn't mean you have to be happy about it.

2809
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:12,240
Oh, that's fair.

2810
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:14,400
That's fair, I suppose.

2811
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:18,000
I am sure this was discussed in the last episode,

2812
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,160
since it's obviously the talk of the town,

2813
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:23,760
at least in my closed off cave-like home,

2814
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,360
and never leaving the town.

2815
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:27,040
I assume that is the talk of the town.

2816
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:29,200
I mean, after the two, still ongoing,

2817
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:30,960
you were working on it just before the show, in fact.

2818
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:31,680
Oh, that's true.

2819
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:32,960
I had just finished filming,

2820
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:33,520
and we'll finish after one.

2821
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:36,720
You've only got like 10 more, 11 more videos to go.

2822
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:37,440
Yeah, pretty much.

2823
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:37,600
Pretty much.

2824
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:38,880
At the time of recording.

2825
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:42,480
The worst of it is over now, at least I assume so.

2826
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,600
It's downhill for sure.

2827
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,040
It's downhill for sure.

2828
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:48,480
So now, looking back, I'm on your channel right now,

2829
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:51,120
and the most viewed, which I don't know

2830
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:53,040
if that's the measure of success here,

2831
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,440
but if it is, then the best video is

2832
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:58,480
Weaponized Thickness, Anatomy of a Meme.

2833
01:56:58,480 --> 01:56:59,760
That is number one.

2834
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,240
It's true.

2835
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:04,480
Close behind, well, not close behind it,

2836
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:06,480
but just relatively big videos are, you know,

2837
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:10,320
the Final Fantasy VII video, the hockey rant,

2838
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:13,840
and the fairy tale is still dead video.

2839
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:16,160
Now, that fairy tale one's only been out for three days,

2840
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:20,880
but I think that will be cemented as either number one in time

2841
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,920
or number two beyond the Weaponized Thickness one,

2842
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,120
which, by the way, that Weaponized Thickness,

2843
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,280
I think it only stands on the fact that once again,

2844
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,440
I just put Galco in the thumbnail.

2845
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:32,800
I'm pretty sure that's like 99% of why anyone cares,

2846
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,880
and I guess the meme is known to some people,

2847
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,480
so I suppose, but.

2848
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:39,600
Now, obviously, you would know better than anyone.

2849
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:42,640
I want to know currently how this Meme math

2850
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:48,240
of a specifically success-wise compares to the first one.

2851
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,720
I have no reference point for these numbers here.

2852
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:55,360
I have no reference for if 10K being the standard

2853
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:58,160
or like, you know, the high to low teens

2854
01:57:58,160 --> 01:57:59,920
being the standard of view rate.

2855
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:00,800
Is that normal?

2856
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,440
Is that good?

2857
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,240
Is that fine?

2858
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,160
Is that great or is that bad?

2859
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:07,760
Compared to my, like, the generally released videos I do,

2860
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:11,760
like, 10K for a video is quite low,

2861
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:14,960
but the thing is, like, these are made very fast,

2862
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:18,880
and 10K in one day to then produce the next day,

2863
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,600
a 10K video and so on is, I mean, it's for my channel

2864
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:26,640
and for my, you know, track record is great.

2865
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:30,320
It's, I mean, this will absolutely be like a huge spike

2866
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:33,120
in both viewership and, you know, AdSense earnings and stuff,

2867
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:36,000
just for all the actual views that I'm accumulating,

2868
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,840
just from all the fucking videos.

2869
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:40,480
The cost I'm paying, however, is almost,

2870
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,000
not to mention many videos, like the Thibidus,

2871
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,560
some are like 20K, 30K, et cetera,

2872
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:46,560
but the cost I am paying is absolutely.

2873
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,880
I am losing subs.

2874
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,400
I am 100% losing subs as a result of this,

2875
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,320
but, however, the funny thing is,

2876
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,640
now we'll get to comparing it to the original Miamafa,

2877
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
is just that, like, I think that,

2878
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,120
so right before this started, on day zero when I announced,

2879
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:06,320
I'm gonna be doing YouTube full time, Miamafa 2, go.

2880
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:11,520
I got, like, a thousand and a half subs or something,

2881
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,880
and so a lot of those was because

2882
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,560
Monkey shouted me out on Twitter,

2883
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,080
and a couple other people, too.

2884
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,120
I can't remember, everybody.

2885
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:21,920
And that gave me a huge spike in subs for that day,

2886
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,160
but then I've definitely been losing some,

2887
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,760
and it's hard to know if it's those people

2888
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:28,080
who were just only there, you know,

2889
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,200
because they were told to be,

2890
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:30,480
which frankly I don't even want.

2891
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,600
I don't even, I'm happy to have people's,

2892
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:35,440
you know, pity subs or whatever,

2893
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,440
but ultimately it's basically worthless currency

2894
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,480
in my humble opinion.

2895
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:42,720
So I want much more organic accrual of views or whatever.

2896
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:45,760
But anyway, point being that it's hard to tell

2897
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,320
if this loss is just those exact same people

2898
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,680
being like, eh, whatever,

2899
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:51,440
or if it's legitimately followers

2900
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,520
who've been accrued over time who are saying to themselves,

2901
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:54,960
yeah, I've seen enough here.

2902
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,760
He's really spamming me.

2903
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,600
I'll come back after Miamafa.

2904
01:59:57,600 --> 02:00:01,760
Now in either case, I am not at all upset about,

2905
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,920
I'm losing, like, maybe like 30 to 40 subs a day,

2906
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,280
maybe 50 sometimes,

2907
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,680
and I don't even think that if that rate continues,

2908
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:10,400
I'll be below 100,000 by the end of Miamafa.

2909
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,680
I think I'll be a-okay.

2910
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:15,760
But I mean, in the question of is it worth it?

2911
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:17,360
I mean, 100%.

2912
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:20,320
Subs only exist to facilitate viewership anyway.

2913
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,400
So frankly, the only thing I'm feeling

2914
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,400
is I feel a bit of an ego attachment

2915
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:27,200
to being over 100,000 and dipping back below

2916
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:30,320
would be a somewhat of a blow to my ego.

2917
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:31,760
But then, I mean, you know,

2918
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,360
you obviously can't operate with that.

2919
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:34,480
It's your primary motivation.

2920
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:36,240
So, you know, fuck it, I've already committed.

2921
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,880
I mean, if you're losing 30 a day,

2922
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,720
you would have to go, that would be 20 more days.

2923
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,120
Maybe more like 50 to be a little harsher.

2924
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,640
I could dip back under at the end.

2925
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:45,920
It's possible.

2926
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:49,520
Yeah, yeah.

2927
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:52,560
So, you know, but that doesn't really matter.

2928
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:56,640
The net gain far, far outstrips the net loss.

2929
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:59,680
And again, this is only going on for like 12 more days,

2930
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:00,480
and then it's over.

2931
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,560
So, you know, whatever, man.

2932
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:07,920
Have, is this behalf of a easier or harder than the last one?

2933
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:15,040
Well, it is harder in some ways and easier in others.

2934
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:18,000
So, I'm working only, I'm working more than half time,

2935
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,200
but like, I don't know,

2936
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:21,920
I'm working a little bit less at my day job.

2937
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:25,360
But the thing is, I now have a dog and a girlfriend

2938
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:26,880
who both live with me.

2939
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:29,600
And that, just that, that reality of driving her to work

2940
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,960
and doing a bunch of other stuff

2941
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,960
does take up some amount of time.

2942
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:36,080
So, well, I gotta like walk him every once in a while and shit,

2943
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:38,080
you know, so, like, to be distracted,

2944
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:42,560
the other Miamafa was like a pure, just me,

2945
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:45,760
do shit, no distractions, nothing else matters.

2946
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,240
But I'm not in that exact same position now.

2947
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:49,200
So, I've got no choice,

2948
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:51,840
but to kind of do things every once in a while.

2949
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:54,000
Now, it's fine, it's not a big deal.

2950
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:54,880
I've got a little extra time.

2951
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:58,160
Just slid out a darker, browner version of the exact Popeyes

2952
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:59,600
four piece I ate yesterday.

2953
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:01,920
Fascinating.

2954
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:04,800
It's much, much spicier on the other end

2955
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,400
than it was going into the mouth.

2956
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,440
Tell me I'm not.

2957
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:07,920
Great.

2958
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,200
You are a criminal.

2959
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:10,320
How interesting.

2960
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:11,280
Okay, finish at my point,

2961
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:11,680
because I've been talking about this too long.

2962
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:14,080
Popeyes also sucks, by the way.

2963
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:15,120
They're not great.

2964
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:15,600
They're not great.

2965
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,800
I went to Red Lobster, no, not really.

2966
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:18,400
Yeah, I went to Red Lobster the other day.

2967
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,920
I was looking for an inky mageage.

2968
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:21,840
She wasn't there, but it was great.

2969
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:22,400
It was delicious.

2970
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:23,440
Love is lobster sucks.

2971
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,560
It wants you to think that it's not.

2972
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,480
Cheddar biscuits, Munchie.

2973
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:27,680
Cheddar biscuits.

2974
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:30,720
Man, fucking get that shit in a fucking box of bombs.

2975
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:32,400
If you go into a restaurant for cheddar biscuits,

2976
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:33,920
it's not a good restaurant.

2977
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:35,920
Well, people go to Olive Garden for the breadsticks.

2978
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,240
Exactly, case and fucking point.

2979
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:38,800
Yeah.

2980
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,400
All right, fair enough.

2981
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:41,760
I'm not a high-brow man.

2982
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:45,120
Me and my friend Lorenz.

2983
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,240
Me and my friend Lorenz,

2984
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:48,160
the guy who is running the dogs-

2985
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:49,360
Oh, wait, fuck you, Munchie.

2986
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:50,880
I took my parents out when they visited

2987
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:53,520
to the nicest restaurant in Cincinnati

2988
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:54,320
when they were here.

2989
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:56,320
So you don't know, you've never even seen.

2990
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:56,960
I want my fucking good boy boys with a weird monster.

2991
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:59,920
You have never seen the kind of quality.

2992
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:01,360
Oh, I want a great chocolate cheese

2993
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:04,560
and get the fucking gummies for 3,000 points away.

2994
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:05,600
I'm not a high-brow.

2995
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,120
Munchie, at this fucking restaurant,

2996
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:12,400
you order your entree, entree two and entree three

2997
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,440
and dessert and salad at the beginning of the thing.

2998
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,520
It's a whole- Lorenz, you better-

2999
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:20,720
Your pea brain cannot imagine the level of cuisine

3000
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:22,320
I have obtained in my life now.

3001
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:23,600
But what about the service?

3002
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:24,320
I can imagine.

3003
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:24,880
Fantastic.

3004
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:25,600
Incredible, man.

3005
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:27,040
Also, to agree to that restaurant

3006
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:29,200
because he was trying to court me, I think.

3007
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,400
Oh, actually, Digi.

3008
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:33,920
Actually, the precinct is one of the top restaurants

3009
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:34,640
in the city.

3010
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:36,240
That is not the top restaurant

3011
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:38,240
where I took my family later.

3012
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:39,040
That was my first thought.

3013
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:41,760
But we went one step above to this place called...

3014
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:43,760
Fuck, what's it called?

3015
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,640
It's like the Lotus.

3016
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:46,160
I can't even imagine the hotel.

3017
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:48,720
Because that was the nicest restaurant I've ever eaten at.

3018
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:51,040
I know, but I've found a way to go even further

3019
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:52,800
beyond Super Saiyan 3 style.

3020
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:53,520
And it's incredible.

3021
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:56,640
The food looks like an entree over $100

3022
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:58,000
for just like the one item.

3023
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,760
This... the meal was many hundreds of dollars

3024
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:02,480
for four of us.

3025
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:02,960
Damn.

3026
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:03,200
It was...

3027
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:04,560
Yeah.

3028
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:09,040
Not last New Year's, but the years before that,

3029
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,600
I went out to a fancy steakhouse with the Kazi.

3030
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:18,240
And I was... I basically just was like,

3031
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:20,720
what, unprepared for like what fancy restaurants

3032
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:21,600
actually entailed?

3033
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:21,920
Yeah, it was crazy.

3034
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,200
Because obviously I looked at the menu

3035
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:24,400
and I saw the price and I thought,

3036
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,840
OK, this will be a lot of money,

3037
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:26,880
but that's OK.

3038
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:28,240
Because, you know, it's a special occasion.

3039
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:31,680
And so we go out, but I don't realize

3040
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:36,960
that like you are like forced to buy like an entree

3041
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,800
and then another entree and then an appetizer.

3042
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:40,560
And like you are forced to buy all this other stuff.

3043
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:40,960
Kind of.

3044
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:42,880
Because the seats are so expensive

3045
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,040
that they are losing money if you don't buy all of them.

3046
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:45,280
So it was a...

3047
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:46,000
True, true.

3048
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,120
Like literally, I'm not saying that like you were forced to like,

3049
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:50,240
you know, it was incentivized to.

3050
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:51,760
I mean, like literally they said,

3051
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,680
unless you buy all these things, you can't sit here.

3052
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,040
That's crazy.

3053
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:55,760
Because it's New Year's.

3054
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:58,080
That's not how the 1B and 8B went to work.

3055
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:00,080
No, they're a little more cashed that place, the precinct.

3056
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:02,960
Well, well, anyway, in any case, that's how it was there.

3057
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:06,320
So we finagle the situation where we would sit at the bar

3058
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:09,600
and just pretend that we're 21 and then get an entree there

3059
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:10,800
and only the entree.

3060
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,520
So the entree was expensive, but you know, it was worth it.

3061
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:16,160
But if we had been normal,

3062
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:18,320
then it would have been like cut ruple as much

3063
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:20,000
to get all the extra bullshit.

3064
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,720
So fair enough.

3065
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:21,600
It's a scary life.

3066
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:23,840
It's a scary life out there dining.

3067
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,480
All right.

3068
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,760
This is all heresy.

3069
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:28,160
Me and Lorenz, as I was starting to say before,

3070
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:30,480
we have pooled our expertise.

3071
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:35,520
And we are making, we are starting a keto cooking collaboration.

3072
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:35,760
Our next project.

3073
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:36,400
Oh, sorry, Ben.

3074
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:40,320
I just want to say the restaurant, Orchids at Palm Court Reservations.

3075
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:41,600
Orchids at Palm Court.

3076
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:42,240
OK, sorry.

3077
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:42,720
Sorry.

3078
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:43,280
It's the best place.

3079
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:43,760
Look it up.

3080
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:44,720
Keto donuts.

3081
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:46,160
Keto donuts.

3082
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:47,360
All different flavors.

3083
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,880
We're going to make them fruit flavor.

3084
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,000
We're going to make cinnamon.

3085
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,200
We're going to make them vanilla.

3086
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,160
We're going to make them chocolate.

3087
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,360
We're going to go fucking nuts.

3088
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:54,240
We're going to fry them.

3089
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:55,520
It's going to be, it's a miracle.

3090
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,880
We're collecting all our ingredients.

3091
02:05:58,880 --> 02:05:59,360
Good.

3092
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:03,920
You're collecting all the necessary objects required for this endeavor.

3093
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:05,040
And I am so excited.

3094
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:07,920
Again, Ben, different philosophy at the beginning

3095
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:12,240
and different execution, but the end results of both of our lives

3096
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:14,480
are also delicious meals currently.

3097
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:17,120
And I'm very enamored with what you're doing currently.

3098
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:19,120
And I would love you to say, Ben,

3099
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:21,760
is much excruciating detail about these donuts as you could possibly.

3100
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,840
What are the ingredients for a keto donut?

3101
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:27,760
Okay. Well, there's a big, there's a big ideological divide.

3102
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:31,840
Lorenz is convinced that we need to go the almond flour route.

3103
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:34,960
And I believe that coconut flour is the way to go.

3104
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,280
So we're going to, we're going to experiment with each.

3105
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:39,040
We're going to maybe do a half and half version.

3106
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:44,640
I've ordered xanthan gum to add to the, xanthan gum to hopefully give it

3107
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:47,360
like a more like sticky, like actual doughy consistency.

3108
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:50,080
So they'll hold their ring shape when they're dropped in the oil.

3109
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:52,880
There's also an ideological divide between baking and frying.

3110
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:56,080
I think that if it's not fried, a donut is not a donut.

3111
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:57,840
It's just a, it's just a circular cake.

3112
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:00,320
There is, there is the possibility,

3113
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:05,520
there is the possibility of a, of a sugar-free jelly filling

3114
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,800
that might be, that might be stripping towards at some point.

3115
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:12,320
Mine, mine too, mine too.

3116
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:15,520
There's a possibility of making a, of making a sugar-free

3117
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:18,800
version variant of the Boston cream, of the Boston cream.

3118
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,120
I'm very interested in this Ben, because I'm back on keto,

3119
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:26,240
started two days ago, and I'm, I'm invested in the narrative now.

3120
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:30,160
Watch out, Tom, because there's a lot of keto-delito going on these days.

3121
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:31,440
I know, I know, I know.

3122
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:32,400
I gotta, I'm staying on my toes.

3123
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:33,760
There's a lot of kidney stones.

3124
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,840
We're, we're a person, we're a persecuted people.

3125
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:36,400
I'm like kidding.

3126
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,560
I'm staying on my key toes as it is.

3127
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:38,880
Oh, there you go.

3128
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:39,680
Make sure I don't get deleted.

3129
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:41,760
Oh, too bad I can't, because I fucking broke one.

3130
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,560
That's the first part of the deletion, dude.

3131
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:45,280
You gotta be careful.

3132
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:48,880
I flipped fucking out yesterday.

3133
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:53,760
I was listening to a podcast, and someone completely unrelated to our,

3134
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:58,480
to like anything diet related, mentioned being in ketosis.

3135
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:01,920
And I just like, I was in the kitchen, I just flailed uncontrollably,

3136
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,240
and like dropped all everything that I was working on,

3137
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:06,000
and just had like a fucking seizure,

3138
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,720
and ride on the floor for like an hour afterward.

3139
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:09,680
So it reminded me of Ben saying-

3140
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:12,240
You know, that sounds, that sounds, that sounds like a problem.

3141
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:15,840
You know what I think would give you probably increased mental clarity and focus,

3142
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,600
so that that kind of thing wouldn't happen?

3143
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,000
Please, tell me more.

3144
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,280
It's ketones, Munchie.

3145
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:22,880
It's always ketones.

3146
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:26,480
Tom, you should come, you should come over.

3147
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:30,640
You should come, you should get in here and make keto donuts with Ben.

3148
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:32,320
Yeah, it sounds actually fucking cool.

3149
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,360
You know what I'm gonna do for you?

3150
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:34,320
I'm gonna be in Boston.

3151
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:35,520
Get over here to Monkey House.

3152
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:36,240
Get over here to Monkey House.

3153
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:37,680
I'm gonna be in Boston real soon.

3154
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:39,360
I'm gonna try and find a keto recipe.

3155
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,840
I want to exchange recipes, Ben.

3156
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:44,960
I want to exchange recipes and dishes.

3157
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:46,880
I'm gonna, I'm gonna figure out how to make a keto thing.

3158
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:49,200
I've been making, I've been making keto cakes.

3159
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:50,880
I'm gonna make keto cupcakes.

3160
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:52,880
I've made keto, I've been making keto pizzas.

3161
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:53,680
That's my new thing.

3162
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,840
It is, it is a whole world.

3163
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:59,600
It's a whole world of weird experimentation that I am just,

3164
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:01,120
I was just going nuts with.

3165
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:02,240
Think we should move two points now.

3166
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:02,880
It's really fun.

3167
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:04,240
Yeah, I guess we're at that time.

3168
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:09,360
Okay, but before we do, I want to say I got something arrived in mail today.

3169
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:12,560
I ordered like this little blanket to put over my shoulders

3170
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:14,160
because my shoulders always get cold.

3171
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:15,680
It can be like in the heat of the summer,

3172
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:17,280
but if I don't have something on my shoulders,

3173
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:18,480
I just feel uncomfortable.

3174
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:20,400
And it's like the cutest, softest thing.

3175
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:21,760
And I'm just so happy.

3176
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:24,880
And I'm just like, I just, I shove my face in it

3177
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:26,160
because it's just so soft.

3178
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:26,720
How nice.

3179
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:27,360
And I-

3180
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:28,560
Mages, sounds like you need a cake.

3181
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:29,360
It's from age.

3182
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:29,760
New cake.

3183
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,400
You need to put on a fucking shirt question mark.

3184
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:34,560
No, why are you wearing a shirt?

3185
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:37,520
I think you need, you need big world of Warcraft shoulder pads.

3186
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,440
That's the answer.

3187
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:39,920
Good idea.

3188
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:40,480
For sure.

3189
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:42,480
It's just, it just makes me so happy.

3190
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:43,600
And I love it so much.

3191
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:45,520
And I've been wearing it throughout the whole podcast.

3192
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:47,840
And I just, I just, it's, I, I've been petting it

3193
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:48,960
because it's just so soft.

3194
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:49,760
It's so soft.

3195
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:51,360
We got to put that in the shirt.

3196
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,240
I, uh, I initially-

3197
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:53,680
Mages, line us.

3198
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:56,960
I initially heard I bought a little blind kid

3199
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:57,520
to put on my-

3200
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:58,960
Ha ha ha ha ha.

3201
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:01,600
No, no, did you know?

3202
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:04,640
Yeah, even, even, even Mages servant

3203
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:05,920
can't see what she looks like.

3204
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:06,960
Had to be a blind kid.

3205
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:07,600
No.

3206
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:10,320
But can he see why kids love the taste

3207
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:11,440
of cinnamon toast crunch?

3208
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,080
No, she can.

3209
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:12,720
He's blind.

3210
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:13,280
No.

3211
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:14,320
I'm sorry.

3212
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:16,480
He can see it with his mind's eye.

3213
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:19,360
Well, hey, team, it feels like a good place

3214
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:20,720
to transition to voicemails,

3215
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:21,760
if I could say so myself.

3216
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:22,480
Yeah, you can do it.

3217
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:24,160
Munchy, do you have those prepared?

3218
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:24,480
Indeed it does.

3219
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:26,000
Of course I do.

3220
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,600
I, speaking of cooking,

3221
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:32,160
there is a productive teen

3222
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:33,920
that would like to have a word with us

3223
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,040
on that issue.

3224
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,080
Just, you know.

3225
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,120
Teenagers.

3226
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:38,960
To, to, to continue it.

3227
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:40,080
Let me go over to Techno.

3228
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:40,560
Here we go.

3229
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:43,920
I'm looking at the charts for anal circumference by the way.

3230
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,360
Hey, what's up, PCP?

3231
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:47,600
I am the productive teen, 17,

3232
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:50,400
and I hear to tell you that I like

3233
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:52,800
that you talk about food sometimes.

3234
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:53,360
Yeah.

3235
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:55,360
I'm a culinary student,

3236
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:57,840
so that's pretty self-explanatory.

3237
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,800
Keep up, keep talking about food.

3238
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:01,520
Well, lucky you.

3239
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:04,080
Well, just, done and done, done and done.

3240
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:06,400
I just, I want to say someone in the comments

3241
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:10,080
last episode said something about the teen CP,

3242
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:13,840
but they didn't spell it T-E-E-N-C-P.

3243
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,760
They spelled it teen-C-P.

3244
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:16,480
What?

3245
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:18,000
As in like teen-C-tiny.

3246
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:18,960
The teen CP?

3247
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:20,800
Yeah, the teen CP.

3248
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:24,560
Well, teen CP is the son of Zoomer Joe,

3249
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:25,280
as we all know.

3250
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:25,760
As we all know.

3251
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:26,800
Shout out to that guy.

3252
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:28,640
I'm going to finally pull the trigger,

3253
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,240
just because of that voicemail on a vlog

3254
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:32,160
I've been meaning to do for a while called

3255
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:33,120
How to Food,

3256
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,120
an instructional guide to millennials on how to food.

3257
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,120
I don't think that's interesting.

3258
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:40,320
What's the general thesis here?

3259
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:41,360
It sounds scary.

3260
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:44,960
Just basically, if you want to eat food,

3261
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,560
here's how you should do it.

3262
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,000
You open your mouth, you put the food in.

3263
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Do you follow this advice or is this aspirational?

3264
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:50,560
Yes.

3265
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:52,400
No, it's advice I follow.

3266
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:53,920
Okay, okay, cool, cool.

3267
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:55,760
Well, give us the deeds, dude.

3268
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:56,400
Don't fuck with me.

3269
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,360
I'm going to make a video about Jesus.

3270
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,960
He's going to make a vlog about it, god damn it.

3271
02:11:58,960 --> 02:11:59,840
No spoilers.

3272
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:00,800
Oh, god.

3273
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,640
Maybe, I hope, my hope is that I vehemently disagree

3274
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:06,320
and I can make a response video,

3275
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:07,440
calling you.

3276
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:07,920
Oh, good idea.

3277
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:08,720
No, man, you'll love it,

3278
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:11,040
because I'm going to start off by ranting.

3279
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:12,640
Like, I'm just going to, for no particular reason.

3280
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:14,800
By entering ketosis live on camera.

3281
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:20,480
For no reason other than to make it more clickbaity,

3282
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,880
I will start off by just shitting on HelloFresh.

3283
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:24,000
Hey, fair enough.

3284
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:24,640
Yeah.

3285
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:26,320
All right, well, that's exciting.

3286
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:28,000
Nightmare.

3287
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:28,480
Nightmare.

3288
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:29,600
Capitalist nightmare.

3289
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:34,960
God, I still like get like seething mad,

3290
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:37,200
like opening my fridge, like thinking about food,

3291
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:39,520
just thinking like, how is he so fucking stupid?

3292
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:40,560
How does he not see?

3293
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:41,600
How does he not understand?

3294
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,320
And as stated last time we had this debate,

3295
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:49,040
I don't even like HelloFresh.

3296
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:50,080
I don't even like it.

3297
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:53,440
You're supposed to be so mad that you don't like it vehemently.

3298
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:56,000
Wait, speaking of food delivery services,

3299
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,000
someone on Twitter added me in response to a picture

3300
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,600
of Asterios Cocanos with Nathan fucking What's His Name

3301
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:05,120
from Garfield Eats.

3302
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:05,600
What?

3303
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:10,320
Apparently Asterios brought up Garfield Eats on a podcast as well,

3304
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:14,720
and he fucking met Nathan something.

3305
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:16,080
I don't remember his last name,

3306
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:17,840
but the guy with the tiny edited mouth.

3307
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:19,920
God, our clout is pathetic.

3308
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:21,040
We really need to get it up there.

3309
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:23,360
We got to get the Garfield Eats guy on a PZP.

3310
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:24,960
Imagine.

3311
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:25,520
Whoa.

3312
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:26,400
Imagine.

3313
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:27,920
All right, all right.

3314
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:31,920
Guys, well, Nate, I'm sorry, Ben, I just want to say

3315
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,080
that you're a nightmare, and I hate you,

3316
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:38,080
and I think that this person living under your brutal political regime

3317
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:39,040
will agree with me.

3318
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:40,080
This is Kill Ben.

3319
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,080
Pain, misery, and more pain.

3320
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:47,600
It's the year 2021 in the Ben St. Imperial Calendar,

3321
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:49,840
month three, day 13.

3322
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:52,800
After his kidney stone yielded many clones,

3323
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:55,440
they proceeded to rape and pillage our lands.

3324
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:56,640
Governments fell apart.

3325
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:58,240
The world collapsed.

3326
02:13:58,240 --> 02:13:59,760
World order is in chaos.

3327
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:00,960
We all live in shacks.

3328
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:03,040
Me, my neighbors, everyone lives in shacks.

3329
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:06,480
He sends his clones out twice a week to piss test everyone.

3330
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:10,720
If you find someone not on keto, he takes a finger,

3331
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:13,200
but he's really into the inter-agagement life.

3332
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:16,080
So he tells you a knock, knock joke while he's taking your fingers.

3333
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:20,000
Oh, but it's the same fucking knock, knock joke every single time.

3334
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
He doesn't get any new material.

3335
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,400
I was out looking for food scrounging the lands yesterday.

3336
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:26,080
I came across a water fountain.

3337
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:28,320
I think to myself, you know, water's keto friendly.

3338
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,360
I get some fresh what?

3339
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:32,960
No, no, more monster zero, more fucking monster zero.

3340
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:34,800
He's always drinking bang energy.

3341
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,080
We just get monster zero.

3342
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,160
Nate, you should be the most worried.

3343
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:41,840
After everything collapses, he takes your enterprises,

3344
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:44,000
becomes best guy ever, locks you in a cell,

3345
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,280
and you only get carbs.

3346
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:46,320
And he laughs every time.

3347
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:47,280
He loves it.

3348
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:49,280
No, in my protein.

3349
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:50,560
Destroy his kidney stones.

3350
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:52,400
Kill Ben St.

3351
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:53,200
Save the future.

3352
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,920
Will do.

3353
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:58,080
And with that, I would like you to direct you

3354
02:14:58,080 --> 02:14:59,440
to the link in the description to a free text.

3355
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,360
You can play entirely with your superpower

3356
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,680
and enlist fucking Rowdy.

3357
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,520
Kill that piece of shit.

3358
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:08,800
Ben St. in real life.

3359
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,800
I am ordered a direct attack.

3360
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,240
Ratties, no more video games.

3361
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:17,520
Get a real gun in real life and shoot him in Boston, Massachusetts.

3362
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,160
I beg you, please don't let this happen to you.

3363
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,600
Do not let him take over the world.

3364
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,800
Get fucking Rowdy.

3365
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:24,240
Hey, Munchy.

3366
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:24,960
Hey, Munchy.

3367
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,160
So I'm not sure.

3368
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:29,280
I could save this for RFCK on Wednesday.

3369
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,800
If you can, you definitely should.

3370
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:32,720
Okay, well...

3371
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:34,560
You can give me a teaser, but don't spoil it or anything.

3372
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:38,800
I sampled some new energy drink flavors.

3373
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,560
Ooh, oh yeah, that's RFCK.

3374
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:41,120
Okay, yeah.

3375
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:42,080
All right, no more, no more, no more.

3376
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,360
Hey, specifically...

3377
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,400
Okay, I have a bunch to...

3378
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,120
I have much to...

3379
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:45,920
Before we start the next...

3380
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:46,400
I do too, actually.

3381
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,040
I do too.

3382
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:47,600
Oh my god.

3383
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:50,640
I'm just thinking about how there's those people

3384
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:53,280
who are like the psychotic fans who think that

3385
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:57,680
that they're being sent messages to kill the president in media.

3386
02:15:57,680 --> 02:15:59,840
And if Munchy had one of those fans,

3387
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,440
it would not be secret messages.

3388
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:03,440
They would just be like, oh, kill Ben St.

3389
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:04,240
Okay.

3390
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:06,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3391
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:07,280
Exactly.

3392
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:09,600
Guys, Munchy, before you go on,

3393
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:12,000
I've got a fascinating thing that just happened to me.

3394
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,360
And it's just that on Twitter,

3395
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:16,320
someone sent me a message of the kind that I've long dreaded

3396
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:18,240
and I finally just got one.

3397
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:21,600
This is a message from someone who's essentially saying

3398
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:23,760
that they are disappointed with my newest video

3399
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,440
about the One Piece manga, in effect.

3400
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:27,200
It's about manga, but I talk about One Piece, of course.

3401
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:30,400
He's disappointed because I'm so adamant

3402
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:33,200
about reading manga solely through scan relations.

3403
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:36,400
And if I really loved manga as much as I say I do,

3404
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:38,640
I should support the industry

3405
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:41,520
and should give this media their two dollars

3406
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:42,880
to read it monthly or whatever.

3407
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:47,200
One Piece is like a super mega corporation.

3408
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:49,360
It's like it doesn't need any more money.

3409
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:54,640
I mean, Oda is fresh beyond his fucking wildest imagination

3410
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:58,720
and he's the only person in the machine of One Piece

3411
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:00,800
who you should give any fuck about.

3412
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:03,280
So at this point, it's like Oda's spoken for.

3413
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:04,880
Anything else you're spending on it

3414
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:06,880
is just going into the machine.

3415
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,400
I mean, there's something to be said for...

3416
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:14,000
I support the peons who help bring the manga to me weekly

3417
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,120
in the magazines and whatnot.

3418
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:15,680
I suppose.

3419
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:18,160
But like, so that's all cool.

3420
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:21,680
And I support the industry, I don't know,

3421
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:23,600
like obviously I'm in favorite existing.

3422
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:25,680
But like, I don't think this man's understanding

3423
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:28,320
the context of me having read this series.

3424
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,640
When I first started reading One Piece,

3425
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:31,760
what was I supposed to read?

3426
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:34,000
The non-existent English releases?

3427
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,240
And now look, okay, maybe I'm behind the fucking times

3428
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:38,640
and I should catch my moral compass up to the real world.

3429
02:17:38,640 --> 02:17:42,080
But I've made basically my entire One Piece career

3430
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:43,760
has been in scan relations.

3431
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:47,040
I'm ass deep in the scanlation world.

3432
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:50,480
And I'll just say, I frankly just don't care that much.

3433
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:51,520
I mean, that's totally true.

3434
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:54,880
If I can save a buck by doing something for free,

3435
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:56,160
I will absolutely do it.

3436
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:57,200
I don't even fault you, dude.

3437
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,040
I think your position is totally fine.

3438
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:00,480
It's just that I just don't care.

3439
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:01,280
That's my position.

3440
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:03,600
All right, I mean, that's it.

3441
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:04,720
I just thought that was interesting.

3442
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:07,840
I've been expecting something like that for a long time,

3443
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:10,880
or perhaps my rampant video game piracy,

3444
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:11,920
or I don't know,

3445
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:15,360
I stole Sony Vegas to make videos with all these things.

3446
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:18,080
What, Nate, I understand that you're witnessing.

3447
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:22,000
Boy, isn't it nice that content on the internet

3448
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,920
is freely distributed

3449
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:27,440
and not bound up in the hands of big corporations

3450
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:29,200
and the people that have all the money?

3451
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,560
Like, isn't it nice that these things

3452
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:32,720
are just available to the public to be used freely

3453
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:33,200
for the betterment of time?

3454
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:36,160
I recognize, I am doing something wrong.

3455
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,080
I simply accept my immorality.

3456
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,360
That's how I feel about it.

3457
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:41,040
I don't think it's necessarily wrong.

3458
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:43,600
Nate, I understand that you enjoyed the first episode

3459
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:45,760
of my Whirling Dervish podcast.

3460
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:46,240
I did.

3461
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:47,360
I was talking about it before.

3462
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:50,080
I very much enjoyed, especially,

3463
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:51,120
my favorite part was your,

3464
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:54,320
just talking about how people who do YouTube

3465
02:18:54,320 --> 02:18:57,040
and then are overly critical of it

3466
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:59,680
as if they have no control over being involved with it.

3467
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:01,600
I was just kind of agreeing with that.

3468
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:03,840
You'll enjoy the second episode

3469
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:08,240
because I go on a long tirade about how physical media needs to die

3470
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:10,400
and how supporting,

3471
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:13,200
like, I don't want to support an industry

3472
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:17,200
that gives me anything less than the best possible experience

3473
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:18,000
because it's like,

3474
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,160
I'm always going to choose the best experience.

3475
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:23,600
If downloading Torrance is the best experience,

3476
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:26,240
why would I pay for something worse

3477
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:29,520
when they have the option to offer me something better?

3478
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:30,880
Which is what, you know,

3479
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:34,080
it's the classic game, Newell Piracy is a,

3480
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:36,000
what was the service problem?

3481
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,120
Service problem, yeah.

3482
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:38,480
And, you know, to that point on this

3483
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:39,600
Viz Media thing or, you know,

3484
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:41,120
by paying for One Piece or whatever,

3485
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,400
when it is literally infinitely easier

3486
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:46,800
for me to just Google Read One Piece Online,

3487
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:48,000
bam, there's MangaReader.

3488
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,200
Like, I don't, oh, great.

3489
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:51,760
I don't have to like sign in or give money to someone.

3490
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,280
I would, yeah, I'd argue, again,

3491
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:54,720
this is a service problem.

3492
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:56,080
I know Gabe's kind of shifted on that

3493
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:57,280
over the years, I guess, but.

3494
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:00,080
Imagine if you typed into Google Read One Piece Online,

3495
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,160
the first result was Viz.

3496
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:04,160
You clicked on it and you read it right there

3497
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:05,280
and at the bottom of the page,

3498
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:07,520
there was just a fucking tip jar

3499
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:08,880
and it's like, it just says, like,

3500
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:11,120
click this button if you loved this chapter

3501
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:15,840
to donate a dollar to, you know, to it.

3502
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,680
And then you just, like, people would just do it

3503
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:19,840
because they're like, oh, this chapter was great, click,

3504
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,320
you know?

3505
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:24,160
Now, considering my own, would I ever, ever click that?

3506
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:26,800
The answer is no, I will never click that button

3507
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:28,880
to give money I don't have to, but other people will,

3508
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:29,760
but other people will.

3509
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:32,240
I would be surprised if you never had a moment

3510
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:34,400
where you read a chapter and you were just so excited

3511
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:36,720
and the button was right fucking there

3512
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,920
I mean, maybe, if I knew it was like going to Oda

3513
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:41,280
or like the editor, whoever,

3514
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:42,720
the people actually making the product.

3515
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:45,120
You guys are witnessing the fall of Titans right now.

3516
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:48,160
Ben St. obliterated, literally killed, hopefully.

3517
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:48,560
Yeah.

3518
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:51,200
Nate, his moral compass shattered.

3519
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:51,840
Shattered, yeah.

3520
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:52,880
He obliterated.

3521
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:55,760
And now the third in this building trilogy,

3522
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:56,560
Tommy Oliver.

3523
02:20:57,280 --> 02:21:00,240
This next tape has only one track.

3524
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:04,720
I'm gonna write it all the way to the Poly Station.

3525
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:08,880
Oh, it's been too long, hasn't it, Tom?

3526
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:11,040
Percy?

3527
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:12,640
Percy?

3528
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:14,240
Yes?

3529
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:16,720
Have you seen Thomas?

3530
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:18,880
He's late with his shipment.

3531
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:22,240
Oh, oh, no, your grace.

3532
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:24,960
In fact, I heard he drove off a cliff.

3533
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:26,960
Suicide, eh?

3534
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:30,880
The butt controller scratched his toby belly.

3535
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:34,160
I suppose it was only a matter of time.

3536
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:38,080
You'll have to work double shift to make up for his absence.

3537
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:43,440
Well, uh, you see about that, sir, I...

3538
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:44,560
What is it, Percy?

3539
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:46,160
What's the matter?

3540
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:51,280
The fat controller leaned in and Percy whispered.

3541
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:54,640
Well, I, uh, I suppose I'm a conch.

3542
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:01,600
The station's empty.

3543
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:06,080
I thought you would be here, Tom.

3544
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:11,600
I long for the touch of your feminine fingernails on my back.

3545
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:19,600
I guess there is no manicure for depression.

3546
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:24,000
Wow.

3547
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:25,680
Okay.

3548
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,240
That was a journey.

3549
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:26,800
Holy shit.

3550
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:28,320
Oh, the fuck was that?

3551
02:22:28,320 --> 02:22:29,520
I just went on a journey.

3552
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:31,680
It's, it's, it's a fourth loss tape.

3553
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:32,880
This is the fourth loss tape.

3554
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:34,320
Incredible.

3555
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:36,240
Center around Tom, obviously.

3556
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:39,600
Would you like to explain what has happened here, Tom?

3557
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:41,200
Because obviously you would know better than anyone.

3558
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:43,920
Um, I, I...

3559
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:44,320
Would he?

3560
02:22:44,320 --> 02:22:45,200
I don't even know.

3561
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:47,040
I just, I just went on a journey there.

3562
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,200
Uh, I guess...

3563
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,360
I mean, I mean, we're hearing these voices,

3564
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:52,880
voices from your past, I assume,

3565
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:54,640
or were you a train conductor of some sort?

3566
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:56,000
Did you have an associate with a blue in some way?

3567
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,200
I mean, back, back in, back in the day, I...

3568
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:58,240
I think he was a train.

3569
02:22:58,240 --> 02:22:58,960
Back in the day.

3570
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:00,960
I was all about that shining time station.

3571
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,800
Maybe I'm just an actual projection

3572
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:05,040
of Thomas the Tank Engine all this time.

3573
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:05,680
Yeah, probably.

3574
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:06,560
Probably.

3575
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:08,480
I legitimately couldn't tell if that was a clip

3576
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:09,840
from an old show at first.

3577
02:23:10,480 --> 02:23:11,120
I mean, parts of it were...

3578
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:13,200
So well produced and acted.

3579
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:14,320
No, I don't think it was, dude.

3580
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:14,800
I think it was all good.

3581
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:15,360
No, I think that was just...

3582
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:17,520
The acting on Percy's accent.

3583
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:19,360
And I mean, the fat controller.

3584
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:20,320
Incredible.

3585
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:20,880
Incredible.

3586
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:21,360
No.

3587
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:24,880
Uh, I, uh, there's a new storyteller video

3588
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:26,320
after this episode goes up.

3589
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:28,160
It's just a face reveal.

3590
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:30,080
It's Tom this entire time.

3591
02:23:30,080 --> 02:23:33,200
Oh, are you saying that that was supposed to be a video

3592
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,480
by the new storyteller?

3593
02:23:34,480 --> 02:23:35,920
Is that what was going on there?

3594
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:37,120
Well, no, that was a hidden...

3595
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:39,680
Well, I mean, for, for all intents and purposes,

3596
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:40,080
it could be.

3597
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:40,160
Okay.

3598
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:40,720
We don't know.

3599
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:41,520
I mean, it's a lost tape.

3600
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:44,640
The Lost Tape Archive, he finds ancient secret tapes

3601
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,960
recorded by us exposing our histories.

3602
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:47,280
Okay.

3603
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:48,880
And in this one, in this ancient tomb.

3604
02:23:48,880 --> 02:23:50,960
So, I mean, if Tom is indeed the new storyteller,

3605
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:52,160
it will reveal.

3606
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,440
I'll stick it to the video.

3607
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:56,640
Was this because we did the whole Thomas the Tank Engine

3608
02:23:56,640 --> 02:23:58,320
joke last week?

3609
02:23:58,320 --> 02:23:59,600
I don't fucking know, dude.

3610
02:23:59,600 --> 02:23:59,920
Maybe.

3611
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,920
I don't even remember what I had for breakfast this morning.

3612
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:04,400
Oh, wait.

3613
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:05,120
Yes, I do.

3614
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,000
It was nothing.

3615
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:08,640
Well, there's one thing we've learned.

3616
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:10,400
It's that Percy is a cunt.

3617
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:12,000
And, uh...

3618
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,200
Alright, so what else, Tom?

3619
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:14,880
Even back when I was like five, I knew that.

3620
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:19,120
Oh, by the way, I just want to say, Lost Archives,

3621
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:23,920
this and all the other ones have been absolutely fucking primal.

3622
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:29,280
I think we have a contender for the voicemail grail.

3623
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:30,560
Oh, yeah, I think we've got to add it.

3624
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:31,680
Yeah, I think we've got to add it, yes.

3625
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:34,480
Now, you know, I forgot to add someone last week, I think.

3626
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:38,480
People in the comments were making suggestions

3627
02:24:38,480 --> 02:24:40,720
about who should be on the Hall of Fame,

3628
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:42,480
and I agreed with every single one.

3629
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:43,120
Oh, yeah, okay.

3630
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,320
I think we shouldn't get too much in the business

3631
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:49,280
of retroactive ones, but maybe the next two.

3632
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:51,280
Well, let's see if we have something.

3633
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:53,760
Let's see if we have any more contenders, shall we?

3634
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:54,160
Yeah.

3635
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:55,760
Oh, yes, I agree.

3636
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:57,680
And I think we might, right here,

3637
02:24:57,680 --> 02:25:01,040
with a humble lad by the name of John.

3638
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:04,320
Let's see what John has to say, or rather, sing.

3639
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:09,200
One, two, this one's a question for the whole damn PCP.

3640
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:11,680
That is, I want to know your favorite song.

3641
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:16,320
But that's too easy, so we'll turn it up a notch.

3642
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:19,040
Find the truth of the good and something wrong.

3643
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,880
Sometimes great music can exist.

3644
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:26,880
In media, you'd otherwise resist.

3645
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:29,120
Where have you seen put to waste?

3646
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:31,840
Good music that's locked in a cage.

3647
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:35,760
The source, of course, it blinds you with rage.

3648
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:36,560
I've heard this before.

3649
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:39,760
This is Adrenaline by Tricell.

3650
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:41,280
It's a kick-ass song.

3651
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:44,000
It ends the arrow among a sense and an amaze.

3652
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:44,960
That's, that's the one.

3653
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:47,920
Subjectively I say this show is not okay.

3654
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:51,920
But the song is so good, it takes the pain away.

3655
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:55,520
The washer spins, you hear the bass, a giddy does her dance.

3656
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:58,640
Her brother doesn't get to wash her underpants.

3657
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:00,400
It puts me in a trance.

3658
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:04,000
The brainwashing sits in, I drink my gin.

3659
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,160
New episodes begin.

3660
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:09,360
So what's your favorite song you know?

3661
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:12,560
That comes from a bad movie, Game or Show.

3662
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:15,760
John, that was great.

3663
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:16,800
Oh, that's amazing.

3664
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:18,560
That was better.

3665
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:20,400
What was that even better than?

3666
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:23,040
I want that set to the actual E.D.

3667
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:25,440
So I could watch the Geary Dancer sexy little

3668
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:26,640
lolly ass to that song.

3669
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:29,440
What, what was the, I don't know.

3670
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:32,560
Before we even get to the question,

3671
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:34,080
before we get to the question, I just want to say

3672
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:36,720
the dichotomy, because I picked out the show notes

3673
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:39,120
because Nate was doing the math of the things.

3674
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:42,160
And I did the voicemails for this.

3675
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:45,840
And the dichotomy, there was an entry to the voicemails

3676
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:49,360
of a dude saying, if anyone else other than Nate

3677
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:51,200
picks the voicemails this episode, this won't get in.

3678
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:53,360
But smoke weed, dude.

3679
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:56,720
And that literally would have gotten in.

3680
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:57,840
It would have gotten in.

3681
02:26:57,840 --> 02:26:58,960
Dude, it would have gotten in.

3682
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:00,960
You say blame Munchie that you weren't.

3683
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:02,320
Yeah, so your spotlight.

3684
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:04,640
Fuck you, you're, I'm not even going to name you.

3685
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:07,280
So die, just fucking die.

3686
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:08,480
So there's just FYI.

3687
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:10,640
John, John in parentheses, Ori Emo,

3688
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:12,880
and I guess I'll put Aromanga, already got in

3689
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:15,360
last episode into the PCP Grail.

3690
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:16,720
But so, so he's a legend.

3691
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:17,440
He's a legend.

3692
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:19,280
What is the name of the Hall of Fame?

3693
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:22,160
We call the voicemail Grail, as we're calling it.

3694
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,000
It's just the Grail slash jail.

3695
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:24,400
And you're in jail.

3696
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:26,480
It's the voicemail versus the voice jail.

3697
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:29,360
The only man in jail right now is the Japanese man, Yuta.

3698
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:30,400
And he'll never get out.

3699
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:33,840
I'm, I'm trying to, I'm going back.

3700
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:35,760
I'm trying to find where people made recommendations.

3701
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:38,000
So are we going to answer that guy's question?

3702
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:38,720
Yeah, yeah.

3703
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:40,000
Of course.

3704
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,960
I mean, if we're sticking with like anime EDs,

3705
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:44,000
if that's something that could count,

3706
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:48,400
the OP to the show, Denpa Onato Seishun Otoko,

3707
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:51,520
or electric, wait, I don't even remember

3708
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:52,720
what the fuck that translates to.

3709
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:54,640
Denpa means train, I think?

3710
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:55,040
I don't know.

3711
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:57,200
It's, no, Denpa.

3712
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:59,680
Denpa Onato Seishun Otoko.

3713
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:02,560
It's, it's the opening theme is by a band

3714
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:04,240
called Shinsei Komate-chan.

3715
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:07,520
It introduced them to me and they became my favorite band.

3716
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:10,080
I dropped the show after the first episode,

3717
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:12,800
but I've come back to that OP countless times.

3718
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:13,920
That's cool.

3719
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:17,360
There's a difference between a song from media

3720
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:19,520
that you hate or media that you haven't seen.

3721
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:23,120
And while there, I can't really think of any songs of,

3722
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:24,640
for media that I hate.

3723
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:26,880
I can definitely think of songs that I love

3724
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:27,840
from things I'd never played,

3725
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:31,360
which I think is arguably way more embarrassing

3726
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:34,240
where you start humming a song and then someone's like,

3727
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:36,720
uh, you know, oh, you like a cave story.

3728
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:39,360
I'm like, uh, no, I just got recommended the theme song.

3729
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:40,000
Egg passage.

3730
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:40,560
And I really like it.

3731
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:41,520
That's like it in my head.

3732
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:42,720
Yeah.

3733
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:42,960
Yeah.

3734
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:45,040
Oh yeah.

3735
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:46,080
So fucking good.

3736
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:48,960
So there's a lot of instances where I, uh,

3737
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:52,240
shamefully listen to music, uh, of things I've never seen.

3738
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:53,520
Like again, cave story.

3739
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:55,520
I listen to the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack a lot.

3740
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:56,640
Well, that's just based.

3741
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:58,800
I know it's all, it's all good.

3742
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:01,120
I mean, the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack shows up on like,

3743
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:03,600
recommended lists of just good jazz albums.

3744
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:05,760
Like, I don't think there's any shame in listening to that.

3745
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:08,320
Even though fucking Kano learned how to make jazz

3746
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:09,200
for that album.

3747
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:09,600
Incredible.

3748
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:13,120
But, but I literally don't even know what Cowboy Bebop does,

3749
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:14,960
or if it's like a Doctor Who scenario.

3750
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:15,760
Who is this man?

3751
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,560
There is no Cowboy Bebop.

3752
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:18,160
What are his credentials?

3753
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:18,800
Where is he?

3754
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:19,840
Get him out of here.

3755
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:21,040
Does he even bebop?

3756
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:26,960
All right.

3757
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:27,440
I don't know.

3758
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:29,360
I mean, here's just an easy example.

3759
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:31,600
I mean, I love a lot of the music in MLP,

3760
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:33,120
but I also love MLP.

3761
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,720
So, I mean, it's not embarrassing at all,

3762
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:36,320
but a lot of people might think it is.

3763
02:29:36,320 --> 02:29:37,040
So there you go.

3764
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:37,840
There's my answer.

3765
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:38,640
That's a flaccid shit.

3766
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:42,160
I really have to wreck my brain to find a show I dislike,

3767
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,600
but I also like the music of.

3768
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:46,800
So, I can't really answer it completely,

3769
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:51,440
but one song that comes to my head is of a show I haven't watched,

3770
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:54,320
but I didn't hear good things about it.

3771
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:55,760
But I kind of like the opening,

3772
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:00,000
but I think I like the opening music in addition to the visuals.

3773
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:02,160
So, if I haven't seen the visuals,

3774
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:03,760
I probably wouldn't like the song as much,

3775
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:04,800
but I still like the song.

3776
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,760
Sure, sure.

3777
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:07,600
Is of Maria Holik?

3778
02:30:08,480 --> 02:30:09,040
I think that's.

3779
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:10,880
Yeah, Maria Holik OP.

3780
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:12,160
That would be my number.

3781
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:13,920
Same studio as Denpo.

3782
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:15,120
Oh, another one I brought up.

3783
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:17,440
And yeah, I mean, all their OPs are fucking amazing.

3784
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:18,640
Every Shaft OP is.

3785
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:19,680
Shaft kills it, though.

3786
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:21,840
So, whether the show itself is good.

3787
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:23,360
Oh, you know, I could say.

3788
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:25,040
I also dropped that one.

3789
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:26,160
On the Shaft subject.

3790
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:28,400
Yeah, like, did you say, like, all their openings are great.

3791
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:32,160
Everything for, god damn it, Zetsubo Sensei.

3792
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:32,400
Oh.

3793
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:33,840
Like, I've only finished.

3794
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:35,600
I've only finished season one and, like,

3795
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:36,960
maybe a little bit of season two,

3796
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:39,040
but I've listened to every OP and they're all incredible.

3797
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:40,640
I love Zetsubo Sensei.

3798
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:47,120
Have you listened to the Otsuki Kenji and Zetsubo Shojo Tachi album?

3799
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:48,480
No, I definitely have not.

3800
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:52,320
So, the guy who sings in all the OPs is a guy named Otsuki Kenji.

3801
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:55,680
He's a frontman of a band called Kiniku Shojo Tai,

3802
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:59,040
or the, like, bodybuilding women's club or something like that.

3803
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:05,040
And they did a whole album of songs in the style of the OPs.

3804
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:07,040
It has the OPs on there and then, like,

3805
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:09,920
just a bunch of other tracks of him and all the girls singing,

3806
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:11,840
and it's a good time.

3807
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:12,800
It sounds incredible.

3808
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:15,200
I mean, the best thing about it for me is that it's,

3809
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:17,920
you watch the show, you get used to the voice actors and whatnot,

3810
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:19,440
who are, you know, they're in the fucking show,

3811
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:21,120
all the girls and the main guy and whatnot,

3812
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:23,600
and they just sing in the fucking opening and ending,

3813
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:24,880
and it's, like, the best thing ever.

3814
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,160
It's so fucking sick.

3815
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:27,520
And then you go listen to the full songs,

3816
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:28,320
it's, like, even better.

3817
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:29,440
They're so good.

3818
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:31,760
But, yeah, I mean, I should definitely check that out.

3819
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:33,120
Tom, Benny Boy.

3820
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:34,960
Yep.

3821
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:35,600
Any answer?

3822
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:36,080
Any, any?

3823
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:37,200
Um, I guess...

3824
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:38,720
Oh, no.

3825
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:39,600
I can't think of anything.

3826
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:40,320
I'm sorry, Normie.

3827
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:42,080
The only thing I can think of right now is...

3828
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:43,440
Tisk, tisk, tisk, tisk.

3829
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:45,120
The only thing I can really think of is,

3830
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:48,000
I wasn't a huge fan of the game, Crypt of the Necrodancer.

3831
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,280
I couldn't get into the game,

3832
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:50,880
but the soundtrack is fucking sick.

3833
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:52,080
Oh, that's a good video game!

3834
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:54,480
Okay, well, I'll agree with that, except that's a great game.

3835
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:55,840
I'm, I just...

3836
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:56,240
Yeah, punk.

3837
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,520
It's funny you say that, Tom, because...

3838
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:58,720
I haven't played a lot of it.

3839
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:01,600
My buddy, we did co-op, and I couldn't really get into it.

3840
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:04,880
I hate these SJW games with female protagonists.

3841
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:06,240
Like, what the fuck, guys?

3842
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:08,000
Just shut it down now!

3843
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Who are you, Sargon of a God?

3844
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,240
It's really funny that you, that you,

3845
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:14,000
that, like, the music is what stuck out to you,

3846
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,160
because to me, the appeal of that game was that I could

3847
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:17,440
dance to my own music.

3848
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:23,200
You know, that's cool, but I've tried it, and it, it, it, it...

3849
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:24,400
You have to find the right song.

3850
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:25,440
Like, sometimes, like, it...

3851
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:25,840
Yeah, yeah.

3852
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:27,200
You need to find the right song.

3853
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:29,840
But, that game has such a good soundtrack on its own

3854
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:32,080
that I have, like, no real desire to replace the music.

3855
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:34,640
It's not really my genre, I guess.

3856
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:38,880
I, I was, I just, I put in music by the band Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,

3857
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:42,560
which is, like, like, heavy metal dance music, basically,

3858
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:45,680
and, um, that made it, like, it was just so funny

3859
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:48,160
to play along to that I made it worth it.

3860
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:52,800
Oh, I, on a, on a stream, twitch, twitch.tv slash stank comics,

3861
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:55,840
I put in, I put in some Hilary Duff Nightcore as a...

3862
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:56,160
Excellent.

3863
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,080
As the, uh, as the sound backing sound.

3864
02:32:58,080 --> 02:32:59,600
It didn't work very well at all.

3865
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:02,160
Actually, no, the thing is, it was just so fast.

3866
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:02,400
Yeah.

3867
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:04,480
It was, like, this insanely fast beat.

3868
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:06,080
Yeah, you really gotta know the beat.

3869
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:09,760
You know what would probably help a lot is, uh, there's a website called...

3870
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:14,400
There's a website called Songkick that tells you the BPM of any song.

3871
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:15,840
Oh, good, yeah, yeah.

3872
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:16,640
That's what you need.

3873
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:17,040
Yeah.

3874
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:18,160
Yeah.

3875
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:19,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

3876
02:33:19,440 --> 02:33:21,120
We have fun here at the PCP.

3877
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:22,640
But you know what else is fun?

3878
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:24,000
Having sex with animals.

3879
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:27,760
Well, there may be some animals you aren't really sure about how to have sex with.

3880
02:33:27,760 --> 02:33:32,000
Well, luckily, we have an ice member teaching us how to have sex with hyenas.

3881
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,600
So about hyenas.

3882
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:35,680
Hyenas are my jam.

3883
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:39,360
So I know a lot about the hyena penis situation.

3884
02:33:39,360 --> 02:33:40,560
Very cool.

3885
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:44,560
So yeah, it's called the pseudo penis despite actually being a slitheress.

3886
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:48,800
But you'd be surprised to know that it functions more like a penis than like a clitoris.

3887
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:50,480
I am surprised.

3888
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:52,000
Hyena is actually...

3889
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:53,440
I'm a rouse.

3890
02:33:54,080 --> 02:33:55,600
Their sex is like docking.

3891
02:33:55,600 --> 02:34:00,720
Like the male has a penis inside the female pseudo penis, which has a canal.

3892
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:01,200
What the fuck?

3893
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:01,920
What?

3894
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:05,680
For this sort of like the vagina like is in the clitoris.

3895
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:06,480
It's very strange.

3896
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:07,120
OK, sure.

3897
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:08,960
What the fuck?

3898
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:11,440
When people say, oh, it's a pseudo penis, but it's actually a clit.

3899
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:13,040
It's like it's really just a dick.

3900
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:14,880
Like, I don't know what else to tell you.

3901
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:18,480
But like, which is why hyena society is so female dominated.

3902
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:21,520
It's because the males can't assert their dominance on the females via sex.

3903
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:24,800
Like, if the females aren't into it, like the males aren't going to snake their dick

3904
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:25,680
into the lady's dick.

3905
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:26,640
It's just not going to happen.

3906
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:31,280
But yeah, actually, they also give birth out of their pseudo penis.

3907
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:33,360
And that's just a glory mess.

3908
02:34:33,360 --> 02:34:34,800
So you can make up videos if you want.

3909
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:36,240
I guess that would be the yikes.

3910
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:37,280
That's what I have to say.

3911
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:38,400
Hyenas are pretty neat.

3912
02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:40,480
Just don't touch their penises.

3913
02:34:40,480 --> 02:34:41,680
OK, bye.

3914
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:46,320
Boy, we really fucked up when we opened this rabbit hole.

3915
02:34:46,320 --> 02:34:48,400
I'm the one who opened up this mystery box.

3916
02:34:49,360 --> 02:34:50,480
I'm about to do it.

3917
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:56,960
Sorry, I was just clapping really fast.

3918
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:00,960
In triumph.

3919
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:02,000
In sheer triumph.

3920
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:04,560
Also, I came on really bad.

3921
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:07,600
Well, hyenas are sick.

3922
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:08,240
I feel bad.

3923
02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:09,440
I guess I feel bad for the women.

3924
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,400
Hyenas are sick.

3925
02:35:10,400 --> 02:35:12,880
I feel bad for the men and the women.

3926
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:14,400
Like, the men are, you know, whatever.

3927
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:17,920
They can't get their shit going because they're smaller and they got small dick.

3928
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:19,680
They got to insert in female dick.

3929
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:22,640
And women, like, have to birth out of their fucking female dick.

3930
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:23,360
That sounds horrible.

3931
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:24,800
Birth out of their dick, dude.

3932
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:25,440
It's made for it.

3933
02:35:25,440 --> 02:35:26,080
Holy shit.

3934
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:26,560
I guess.

3935
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:27,120
I guess.

3936
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:27,680
They love it.

3937
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:28,800
Guys, I love it.

3938
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:30,000
Nature's M-Preg.

3939
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:31,680
Radcon 4.

3940
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:34,480
First stretch goal, docking.

3941
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:36,080
Second stretch goal, live birth.

3942
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:38,960
Stretch goal 5.

3943
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:39,600
M-Preg.

3944
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:42,080
Et cetera, et cetera.

3945
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:42,720
By the way, guys.

3946
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:43,920
We can combine all these.

3947
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:44,800
Are you right?

3948
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:45,840
Thank you, Yeen girl.

3949
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:47,200
There's synergy here.

3950
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:52,560
And speaking of, speaking of Yeen girl, I just want to say you've heard of Yeen.

3951
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:54,640
You've heard of SNEP.

3952
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:58,560
Get ready for the third furry term in this trilogy.

3953
02:35:58,560 --> 02:36:00,560
And this is an open letter to every furry.

3954
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:01,280
What is Yeen?

3955
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:02,080
I don't know what I didn't know.

3956
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:03,200
SNEP is Snow Leopard.

3957
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:03,680
Oh, OK.

3958
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:08,320
It's really funny because that girl's voice sounded like Kaze.

3959
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:08,720
And it made me assume.

3960
02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:09,760
I thought it might have been her.

3961
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:10,160
Did it?

3962
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:11,200
Did it really?

3963
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:12,000
I, yeah.

3964
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:12,720
Yeah, a little bit.

3965
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,000
I think it might just be that furry.

3966
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,840
Like, is furry kind of like being gay?

3967
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:16,560
They're cut from the same claw.

3968
02:36:16,560 --> 02:36:18,160
Like a voice.

3969
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:19,680
You know what I mean?

3970
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:20,880
I've got big furry voice.

3971
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:22,480
Kind of like tranny voice, you know?

3972
02:36:22,480 --> 02:36:23,200
Furry voice.

3973
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:23,440
Muffled by fur.

3974
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:25,680
We will let the audience decide in the comments.

3975
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:28,400
You know, comment is furry a choice like being gay.

3976
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:28,800
Yeah, OK.

3977
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,160
But also in that.

3978
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:31,120
Say a choice.

3979
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:32,160
I said a voice.

3980
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:34,640
Is it a choice like being black?

3981
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:35,120
Both are open.

3982
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:35,840
OK.

3983
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:37,520
So post in comments.

3984
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:40,960
Any more of these abbreviation for animals like SNEP or Yeen.

3985
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:44,560
And we have, yote.

3986
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:47,120
For coyotes, yote.

3987
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:48,240
Yote.

3988
02:36:48,240 --> 02:36:49,440
Use this sentence.

3989
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:52,400
Want to fuck that yote real bad.

3990
02:36:52,400 --> 02:36:55,920
Maybe I'll put some yeens later and maybe a SNEP.

3991
02:36:55,920 --> 02:37:00,480
But first, I want to deal with this yote.

3992
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:00,880
Wow.

3993
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:01,920
That's all I wanted to say.

3994
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:03,680
That's good.

3995
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:05,920
I love these terms so much.

3996
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:08,480
Please, I fucking beg you.

3997
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:10,640
I'm sure there's a gold mine of them that I, we aren't.

3998
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:11,200
You know, OK.

3999
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:14,720
You know how when you're speed running Pokemon red or blue,

4000
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:16,320
you choose like one character?

4001
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:18,880
Because the sheer number of times that your character's

4002
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:20,400
like name is said in text box.

4003
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:22,800
Imagine the sheer number of frames you're saving

4004
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:25,760
by only referring because we know how many times per day

4005
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:28,240
you're going to talk about a coyote and how much you want to fuck it.

4006
02:37:28,240 --> 02:37:31,120
You're saving so many frames by a briefing that you're saving.

4007
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:31,840
Two syllables.

4008
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:32,240
So many.

4009
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:33,040
Every single time.

4010
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:33,440
That's right.

4011
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:37,360
Hey, if you're, if you're, if you're a coyote, if you're a coyote furry

4012
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:38,960
and you're like a bear, right?

4013
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,880
But like not like a bear bear, like a muslin.

4014
02:37:41,440 --> 02:37:43,280
You're like getting, you're getting fucking jacked.

4015
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:45,360
You're fucking getting, are you a yoke to yoke?

4016
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:47,040
A yoke to yoke for show.

4017
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:48,240
A yoke to yoke.

4018
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:50,000
Oh, my new Twitter handle.

4019
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:54,640
Well, move on.

4020
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:55,360
Let's go.

4021
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:57,280
Guys, this, I'm, there's going to be hours.

4022
02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:59,360
I know, I need a fucking, I need a fucking cold shower after this.

4023
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:00,720
Hours of content coming from this.

4024
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:01,680
OK, all right.

4025
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:04,320
Now, speaking of D&D, we were talking about earlier,

4026
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:07,440
there's someone who would like to play a game with us as well,

4027
02:38:07,440 --> 02:38:10,240
but not a role playing game, rather a board game.

4028
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:11,600
This is the game board, Gaylord.

4029
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:13,600
Game board, Gaylord.

4030
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:14,960
Attention, PCB.

4031
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:17,040
This is the game board, Gaylord speaking.

4032
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:17,360
Wow.

4033
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:19,760
I challenge you to beat me in a board game.

4034
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:22,320
Let's play battleship on a five by five grid.

4035
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:29,120
We will be using one, four-tall ship, one, three-tall ship, and two, two-tall ships.

4036
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:32,320
Please place your ships now, and I'll begin my turn.

4037
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:34,800
A four.

4038
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,440
You suck my battleship.

4039
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:38,160
Will you hit me?

4040
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:39,120
Who knows?

4041
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:41,680
This has been the game board, Gaylord.

4042
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:42,320
Good luck.

4043
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:44,640
And remember, I won't fucking cheat.

4044
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:47,840
I swear, please trust me for the love of God and everything, holy.

4045
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:53,040
Well, OK, so we are in a dice scenario right now.

4046
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:55,840
We are on a five by five grid right now.

4047
02:38:55,840 --> 02:38:58,400
He's attacked A, what was it?

4048
02:38:58,400 --> 02:38:58,880
A-F.

4049
02:38:58,880 --> 02:38:59,840
A four, I think.

4050
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:00,480
A four.

4051
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:01,600
A four, A four.

4052
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:02,800
All right, A-F.

4053
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:06,800
And he is, let's see, guys, did he sink our battleship?

4054
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:07,600
Let's see.

4055
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:13,840
Look, the game board, Gaylord, is a fool because he told us where he's going to attack before

4056
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:15,600
we even had time to place our ships.

4057
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:17,360
Now I can dodge it perfectly.

4058
02:39:17,360 --> 02:39:18,800
OK, OK, so how much?

4059
02:39:18,800 --> 02:39:21,600
OK, we have a three-tile ship, a four-tile ship, and a two-tile ship.

4060
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:22,880
Two two-tiles, I think.

4061
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:25,200
Pretty sure.

4062
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:27,440
We are attacking C-six.

4063
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:28,640
There you go.

4064
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:29,040
Damn.

4065
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:30,880
Wait, no, it's a five by five.

4066
02:39:30,880 --> 02:39:32,320
Six is off the grid, god damn it.

4067
02:39:32,320 --> 02:39:32,800
Yeah, yeah.

4068
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:34,000
C-five, C-five.

4069
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,960
Wait, how can you fit that many fucking boats on a five by five grid?

4070
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:38,400
I think you can.

4071
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:38,960
You can.

4072
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:40,400
The biggest one's four, so it doesn't have to be a hit.

4073
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:44,000
Well, we're just hitting constantly, and it's just a race to see if you can sink.

4074
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:47,200
Like, who makes the mistake of missing once and therefore losing?

4075
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:48,560
I mean, that's battleship for you, I guess.

4076
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:50,960
That's a great game.

4077
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:53,440
Well, good luck with that.

4078
02:39:53,440 --> 02:39:53,840
Hell yeah.

4079
02:39:54,480 --> 02:39:59,360
I've never played battleship before, but let us just show that we will kill you and all of your boats.

4080
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:00,240
You don't need to play the game.

4081
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:01,440
Just watch the movie.

4082
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:02,320
Yeah, that is right.

4083
02:40:02,320 --> 02:40:03,760
Is there a movie for battleship?

4084
02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:05,200
There is a battleship movie.

4085
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:06,080
Rihanna, I think.

4086
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:06,880
Fuck.

4087
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:09,440
Rihanna starts at the battleship.

4088
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:09,680
Right?

4089
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:12,720
It was like a Michael Bay style movie.

4090
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:16,080
Yeah, it was a Michael Bay style theatrical release starring Rihanna.

4091
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,120
Hell yeah.

4092
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:18,800
Yeah, as the titular battleship.

4093
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:22,560
That's crazy.

4094
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:26,080
Well, guys, we seem to have reached it in here.

4095
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:26,320
Wait.

4096
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:30,000
Could there be?

4097
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:31,760
I think there's someone.

4098
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:35,040
I think there's something that needs

4099
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:40,400
to be concluded in arc that needs to be satisfied.

4100
02:40:40,400 --> 02:40:40,960
What could it be?

4101
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:46,240
Someone's been building up for months at this point for weeks.

4102
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:51,680
And that's the end of the riddle my ass Batman arc.

4103
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:52,240
Oh no.

4104
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:54,880
There are three voicemails.

4105
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:56,160
I've not listened to any of them.

4106
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:58,000
So we're going to experience them together.

4107
02:40:58,720 --> 02:40:59,040
Okay.

4108
02:41:00,400 --> 02:41:01,280
Here we go, boys.

4109
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:04,800
Well, you all have been waiting for it.

4110
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:07,360
If you want to dumb, I've got what you need,

4111
02:41:07,360 --> 02:41:10,240
because the next voicemail is from a riddle my ass, Batman.

4112
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:13,280
Batman who vapes Ben Saints.

4113
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:14,000
Yeah.

4114
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,360
We're not doing well.

4115
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:15,600
We're not doing well.

4116
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:17,040
Why does it sound like he recorded this?

4117
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:17,600
Yeah.

4118
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:18,240
Do not speak.

4119
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:19,040
I'm sure he did.

4120
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:19,760
I'm sure he did.

4121
02:41:19,760 --> 02:41:20,640
I'm going to have a man more.

4122
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:25,200
VG also stands for best guy.

4123
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:28,000
Woo.

4124
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:28,320
Yay.

4125
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:29,680
Yay.

4126
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:31,600
Why are we getting a recap episode?

4127
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:34,480
You got to have the clip episode before the finale.

4128
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:36,320
Joe, I've never heard about this.

4129
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:38,560
You know, he really should have worked on his recording.

4130
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:39,520
God, they stuck.

4131
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:40,240
They really stuck.

4132
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:41,600
You just skipped the head.

4133
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:42,640
No, no, no, no.

4134
02:41:42,640 --> 02:41:43,440
No, I like this.

4135
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:45,040
You got to have Bill that.

4136
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:46,000
He's a man of all names.

4137
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,440
First member riddle my ass, Batman.

4138
02:41:47,440 --> 02:41:47,920
Yeah.

4139
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:49,040
Welcome to the stand.

4140
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:49,360
Woo.

4141
02:41:52,240 --> 02:41:53,120
Oh, Batman.

4142
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:55,280
Oh, Batman.

4143
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:56,240
He's a sheep.

4144
02:41:56,240 --> 02:41:56,960
He's Batman.

4145
02:41:56,960 --> 02:41:58,080
I said sheep.

4146
02:41:58,080 --> 02:42:00,240
Oh, I remember when he saved me.

4147
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:01,520
Oh, that was good.

4148
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:03,360
I can't even tell what the fuck he said.

4149
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:05,600
So God, this is shitty recording.

4150
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,040
Oh, I got room to cook.

4151
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:12,720
Oh, yeah.

4152
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:19,440
I just want you to know that when a day in sim comes out,

4153
02:42:19,440 --> 02:42:20,800
I'm using you as my lover.

4154
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:21,440
It don't work.

4155
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:22,960
Yay.

4156
02:42:22,960 --> 02:42:23,680
I remember that.

4157
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:24,320
He's never fucking had.

4158
02:42:24,880 --> 02:42:25,520
I think so.

4159
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:28,400
It's a sign of inclusion of real my ass, Batman.

4160
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:29,760
Oh, thank God.

4161
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:30,080
Oh, yeah.

4162
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:31,440
There it is.

4163
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:32,000
Okay.

4164
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:32,400
All right.

4165
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:32,640
All right.

4166
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:33,120
All right.

4167
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:34,240
Well, that was the entirety of.

4168
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:34,400
Okay.

4169
02:42:34,400 --> 02:42:34,560
Okay.

4170
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:34,880
Okay.

4171
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:36,320
Here we are.

4172
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:37,920
The end of an era.

4173
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:38,720
The final battle.

4174
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:39,520
Are you guys ready?

4175
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:40,640
Because, frankly, I'm not.

4176
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:41,440
I feel like I'm underprepared.

4177
02:42:41,440 --> 02:42:42,320
I'm not going to battle.

4178
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:44,240
Only Digi remains to be saved, I think.

4179
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:47,200
Well, let's see if he will be.

4180
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:47,920
Batman left.

4181
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:52,240
So members of PCP, are you ready for a final riddle?

4182
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:54,080
Question first.

4183
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:54,320
Yes.

4184
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:56,880
Since there's only one member left,

4185
02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:59,920
can we just say it's Digi and go away pretty easily?

4186
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:01,280
Wait, guys, don't do that.

4187
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:01,600
Huh?

4188
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:02,960
Hear me out.

4189
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:05,920
You guys know my lifelong dream has become a loli.

4190
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:07,520
Well, this is my chance.

4191
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:11,280
My ass is so fast that I already have tits.

4192
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:14,240
And I got to do this and get rid of my digging balls now.

4193
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:15,520
This is a perfect opportunity.

4194
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:17,120
Please, help me be a loli.

4195
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:17,600
Are you sure, Digi?

4196
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:18,320
I guess if you eat the balls.

4197
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:18,960
Yes.

4198
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:19,280
Wow.

4199
02:43:19,280 --> 02:43:20,160
Okay, Digi.

4200
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:23,520
Riddler, our answer is the riddle you have not yet answered.

4201
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,720
Question is...

4202
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:27,360
Jeff.

4203
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:28,880
Wrong.

4204
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:29,280
Yeah.

4205
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:30,320
Oh.

4206
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:33,600
Put him in the testicular tenderizing tuna now.

4207
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:35,600
Thank you, guys, so much.

4208
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:36,240
And this is...

4209
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:38,160
Oh, my God, the pain.

4210
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:40,080
The pain is so unbearable.

4211
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:41,920
Oh, my God, the pain.

4212
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:42,880
Oh, no.

4213
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:43,920
Oh, no.

4214
02:43:43,920 --> 02:43:45,120
Not the pain.

4215
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:46,560
Oh, my God, the pain.

4216
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:47,520
This is a mistake.

4217
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:48,800
Not the pain.

4218
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:50,240
Oh, my God, the pain.

4219
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:52,160
The pain is unbearable.

4220
02:43:52,160 --> 02:43:53,360
Oh, my God.

4221
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:54,480
No.

4222
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:56,800
I'm sensing some pain here.

4223
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:57,600
Balls and dick?

4224
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:59,040
Help, help, help.

4225
02:43:59,040 --> 02:43:59,840
Help, please.

4226
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:00,480
Help, please.

4227
02:44:00,480 --> 02:44:01,600
This is indulgent.

4228
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:02,720
Let me do this.

4229
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:03,680
Guys, help.

4230
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:05,280
Help, help, help.

4231
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:06,320
Anyone else?

4232
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:08,000
Oh, my God, the balls and dick.

4233
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:08,640
Oh, shit.

4234
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:10,800
Gratuitous.

4235
02:44:12,320 --> 02:44:12,640
Damn.

4236
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:13,040
Okay.

4237
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:13,600
What is that?

4238
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:14,000
That was...

4239
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:14,560
Next one.

4240
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:14,960
Next one.

4241
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:15,520
Next one.

4242
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:16,640
All right, all right, all right.

4243
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:17,280
Well, I got...

4244
02:44:18,080 --> 02:44:20,800
I hate to say it, Digi, but I guess you don't got a dick anymore.

4245
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:21,520
Was that me?

4246
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:22,000
Balls.

4247
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:23,120
Yeah, that's you.

4248
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:23,760
That's you.

4249
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:24,320
That was you.

4250
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:26,720
I feel like I just listened to someone's manic episode.

4251
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:28,160
I have no fucking idea what's going on.

4252
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:31,200
No, Digi doesn't even know what's happening.

4253
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:35,760
Okay, you were over a pit of dick eating piranhas,

4254
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:37,280
dick and ball eating piranhas,

4255
02:44:37,280 --> 02:44:39,440
and you told Batman to not save you

4256
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:39,600
by solving all the Ask Batman riddles.

4257
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:40,560
No, no, Batman left.

4258
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:41,920
It's just the PCPs.

4259
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:42,160
Batman and peace.

4260
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:44,160
And therefore, you were dropped into the pit.

4261
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:44,800
It burns.

4262
02:44:44,800 --> 02:44:45,360
Right, right.

4263
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:46,320
To become a loli.

4264
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:47,520
Yeah, duh.

4265
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:48,720
Okay, so here we go.

4266
02:44:48,720 --> 02:44:49,280
So is there one more?

4267
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:50,480
There's one final thing, right?

4268
02:44:50,480 --> 02:44:51,040
Yeah, there's one more.

4269
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:55,520
I just want to say this is real my Ask Batman.

4270
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:58,240
Thank you, PCP, for playing my shitty show

4271
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:00,000
every week, week after week.

4272
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,840
You and the audience at home seem to have

4273
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:03,280
really loved this show,

4274
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:04,080
and I appreciate your support.

4275
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:05,360
You did.

4276
02:45:05,360 --> 02:45:07,440
A quick apology to Mage and Digi

4277
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:09,440
for dropping you in the dick eating worms.

4278
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:10,800
I had to switch it up every once in a while,

4279
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:12,240
you know, even we had some.

4280
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:13,120
I keep them on their toes.

4281
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:14,160
Yeah, absolutely.

4282
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:14,640
Don't worry.

4283
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:16,960
Riddle my Ask Batman isn't canceled yet.

4284
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:18,480
I am just getting started.

4285
02:45:18,480 --> 02:45:20,240
Look forward to new content,

4286
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:22,160
such as silly songs with Batman.

4287
02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:24,080
Who wants to be a PCP millionaire?

4288
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:26,960
And reading from Riddle My Ask Batman's fan fiction.

4289
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:29,760
Look forward to all these next time on the PCP.

4290
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:32,640
Same PCP time, same PCP channel.

4291
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:33,120
Yay!

4292
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:34,400
Oh my god!

4293
02:45:34,400 --> 02:45:34,800
Oh my god!

4294
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:35,360
The legend.

4295
02:45:35,360 --> 02:45:36,320
When are we going to get a...

4296
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:37,360
The legend walks off into the sun.

4297
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:39,680
When do we get family feud in Batman's ass?

4298
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:41,520
Oh, silly life.

4299
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:43,360
In Batman's ass, hell yeah.

4300
02:45:43,360 --> 02:45:45,680
So I want to remind everyone

4301
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:49,600
that Riddle My Ask Batman has a work of fiction

4302
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:53,440
on Wattpad called PCP, The Ultamite Fanfic.

4303
02:45:53,520 --> 02:45:55,200
The Quest for Cold Corona

4304
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:56,720
by Riddle My Ask Batman.

4305
02:45:56,720 --> 02:45:58,160
I'm going to read

4306
02:45:58,160 --> 02:45:58,200
a passage from the first chapter called

4307
02:45:58,200 --> 02:45:59,920
a Passage from the first chapter called

4308
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:03,760
PCP Guy Origins.

4309
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:33,760
1.1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111

4310
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:39,760
I hear you scream in your most annoying of high-pitched, glass-shattering, screechy ones.

4311
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:43,760
Fear not, for there were just enough freaks and weirdos to make all the anime and comics,

4312
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:46,760
you know, actual cool stuff that your heart could ever desire.

4313
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:49,760
On this planet there lived in an old, run-down apartment,

4314
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:53,760
one man who swore he would not subcome to the life of a normie

4315
02:46:53,760 --> 02:46:56,760
and sought to make his living as an artist.

4316
02:46:56,760 --> 02:47:00,760
He had tried many disciplines drawing comics, playing music, mostly raps,

4317
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:04,760
and even writing his world's equivalent of My Little Pony fan fiction.

4318
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:07,760
Always putting his OC in the middle of a love triangle

4319
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:10,760
of whatever characters he happened to be feeling a fancy for the week.

4320
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:14,760
However, his favorite thing to do was to make analytical YouTube videos about his favorite anime.

4321
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:18,760
Well, it is actually rendered to a looser tube on this planet.

4322
02:47:18,760 --> 02:47:19,760
Two as a... okay.

4323
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:21,760
They were a bit more self-aware.

4324
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:26,760
Our beloved original handboy, PCPGuy, also known by the name Crass,

4325
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:29,760
short for pro-crass to his internet friends.

4326
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:31,760
He had no real life to speak of.

4327
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:33,760
So that's your tool.

4328
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:34,760
I want to know.

4329
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:35,760
Link in the description.

4330
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:36,760
The stage has been set.

4331
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:38,760
I hope that that's just enough to whet your whistle.

4332
02:47:38,760 --> 02:47:39,760
I'm intrigued.

4333
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:41,760
I want to know more about this cast of characters.

4334
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:42,760
Well, there's only one, but you know.

4335
02:47:42,760 --> 02:47:44,760
I have a question.

4336
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:47,760
Is there, like, somewhere where you would listen to, like,

4337
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:50,760
a real me as Batman's all of the story,

4338
02:47:50,760 --> 02:47:52,760
like in a chronological order?

4339
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:55,760
I mean, they're all on episodes?

4340
02:47:55,760 --> 02:47:58,760
Or, I mean, they're in the South Club?

4341
02:47:58,760 --> 02:48:00,760
Though, things are getting deleted from the SoundCloud,

4342
02:48:00,760 --> 02:48:03,760
so, you know, they're little by little.

4343
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:04,760
But they're all in the episodes.

4344
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:05,760
Archive, people, it's up to you.

4345
02:48:05,760 --> 02:48:07,760
It's up to you to save FlashPlayer.

4346
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:08,760
Maybe...

4347
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:12,760
Wait, I mean, are they all still in the speak pipe?

4348
02:48:12,760 --> 02:48:13,760
I suppose that's true.

4349
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:15,760
I haven't deleted any from speak pipe.

4350
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:18,760
Maybe I'll just go in and make a compilation.

4351
02:48:18,760 --> 02:48:20,760
You know, I've been working on that editor,

4352
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:21,760
that editor show case.

4353
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:22,760
Right, how's that going?

4354
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:25,760
It wouldn't be the same to just listen to the...

4355
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:27,760
Like, surely if you wanted a compilation,

4356
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:29,760
you would want to clip it from the episodes

4357
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:31,760
so that you get the reaction as well.

4358
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:33,760
That's probably true, honestly.

4359
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:35,760
Probably be better that way, significantly so.

4360
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:36,760
Yeah.

4361
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:38,760
I think so.

4362
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:40,760
I think it adds something.

4363
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:44,760
Well, commenters, let us know in the comments

4364
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:46,760
if you want that.

4365
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:48,760
Or just do it for us.

4366
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:49,760
Yeah, that's true.

4367
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:51,760
Or yeah, yeah, that's true.

4368
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:53,760
We've come to the end of Real Me As Batman,

4369
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:56,760
and we've come to the end of this week's PCP.

4370
02:48:56,760 --> 02:48:57,760
How do we all feel?

4371
02:48:57,760 --> 02:48:59,760
How do we all feel about how we did it this week?

4372
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:00,760
Hungry.

4373
02:49:00,760 --> 02:49:01,760
It was long.

4374
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:02,760
Review, review.

4375
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:03,760
They're always this long now, Nate.

4376
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:04,760
This is just how they are.

4377
02:49:04,760 --> 02:49:05,760
That's true.

4378
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:06,760
You're not wrong.

4379
02:49:06,760 --> 02:49:07,760
You're not wrong.

4380
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:08,760
They've gotten longer.

4381
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:09,760
Almost three hours.

4382
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:10,760
I'm also hungry.

4383
02:49:10,760 --> 02:49:11,760
I'm hungry.

4384
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:12,760
Maybe I can go...

4385
02:49:12,760 --> 02:49:16,760
Maybe before my stream at twitch.tv slash stcomics,

4386
02:49:16,760 --> 02:49:18,760
I can go and maybe I can...

4387
02:49:18,760 --> 02:49:20,760
There's probably not enough time to view keto donuts.

4388
02:49:20,760 --> 02:49:21,760
Perhaps not.

4389
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:22,760
My...

4390
02:49:22,760 --> 02:49:23,760
Damn.

4391
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:25,760
Next time you hear from me, boys,

4392
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,760
you'll see in Boston, Massachusetts,

4393
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:29,760
possibly have met with Ben.

4394
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:30,760
Oh, okay.

4395
02:49:30,760 --> 02:49:31,760
And Tom, if he's...

4396
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:32,760
How's his journey?

4397
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:33,760
Yeah, we'll have to hang out again.

4398
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:34,760
Yes.

4399
02:49:34,760 --> 02:49:36,760
Yeah, last time was a bust.

4400
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:39,760
Now there will be a bust out of a nut.

4401
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:41,760
You know what I'm trying to say?

4402
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:42,760
Yeah.

4403
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:43,760
Are you saying, Mitch?

4404
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:47,760
Don't set any toes on your way there.

4405
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:48,760
Don't worry.

4406
02:49:48,760 --> 02:49:53,760
I don't walk extremely angrily and also am stupid.

4407
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:57,760
His legs flailing wildly in all directions as he walks.

4408
02:49:57,760 --> 02:49:59,760
Like kicking the air each time he lifts his legs.

4409
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:00,760
Like as hard as you can.

4410
02:50:00,760 --> 02:50:01,760
Like he's going to punt like a football.

4411
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:02,760
Just begging for it.

4412
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:03,760
Just begging for it.

4413
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:04,760
Get the...

4414
02:50:04,760 --> 02:50:05,760
Get the fucking...

02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:06,760

Yeah.

And another one coming before too long.

4421
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:17,760
So keep your eyes fucking healed.

4422
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:18,760
Also, the last one...

4423
02:50:18,760 --> 02:50:20,760
I'm really happy with the last one.

4424
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:22,760
I thought it was really, really funny and good.

4425
02:50:22,760 --> 02:50:24,760
And we learned a lot of the dark truths about it.

4426
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:25,760
We did.

4427
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:27,760
I realized that I just initiated the close out of this podcast.

4428
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:32,760
But I have to also ask, did anybody on this podcast ever address that I did in fact find

4429
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:34,760
and talk about the pizza party podcast?

4430
02:50:34,760 --> 02:50:35,760
I'm sorry.

4431
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:36,760
What?

4432
02:50:36,760 --> 02:50:37,760
Was this addressed on a PC?

4433
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:38,760
Question mark?

4434
02:50:38,760 --> 02:50:39,760
I don't...

4435
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:40,760
No.

4436
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:41,760
That can't be true.

4437
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:45,760
I went on Who Are These Podcasts and did a whole podcast about the pizza party podcast.

4438
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:46,760
What the fuck?

4439
02:50:46,760 --> 02:50:48,760
Well, frankly, I think you're talking out of your ass.

4440
02:50:48,760 --> 02:50:50,760
How did you find out about that?

4441
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:52,760
It was not easy.

4442
02:50:52,760 --> 02:50:54,760
I had to go into the heart of Tibet.

4443
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:55,760
I found them.

4444
02:50:55,760 --> 02:50:56,760
I had to climb a mountain.

4445
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:57,760
I had to find Shambhala.

4446
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:00,760
I had to play Uncharted 2.

4447
02:51:00,760 --> 02:51:04,760
This has opened up a whole new avenue.

4448
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:05,760
A whole new avenue of X and Y.

4449
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:06,760
We have to drive in this.

4450
02:51:06,760 --> 02:51:08,760
I feel like the mystery has only deepened.

4451
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:10,760
We were so concerned.

4452
02:51:10,760 --> 02:51:12,760
We were so concerned if we could find the podcast.

4453
02:51:12,760 --> 02:51:14,760
We didn't find out if we should or not.

4454
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:17,760
The answer is we definitely shouldn't have.

4455
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:19,760
It was a huge mistake.

4456
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:20,760
We should keep going.

4457
02:51:20,760 --> 02:51:21,760
We should keep going.

4458
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:24,760
Yes, someone was concerned if the pizza party podcast got the food.

4459
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:25,760
That's why he's not here.

4460
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:26,760
Oh my God.

4461
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:27,760
Oh, God.

4462
02:51:27,760 --> 02:51:28,760
No.

4463
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:29,760
We can't let this happen.

4464
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:31,760
Another lost soul.

4465
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:32,760
All right.

4466
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:33,760
Well, I guess that's it.

4467
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:34,760
I don't know.

4468
02:51:34,760 --> 02:51:35,760
Shirts or something.

4469
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:36,760
I don't even know what we do.

4470
02:51:36,760 --> 02:51:37,760
There's a Patreon.

4471
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:38,760
I know that exists.

4472
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:39,760
Patreon.com.

4473
02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:40,760
The Procrastinators people.

4474
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:41,760
We love the money.

4475
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:42,760
Please give us.

4476
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:43,760
And bonus episodes.

4477
02:51:43,760 --> 02:51:44,760
Those are the main drive.

4478
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:45,760
25 fucking episodes.

4479
02:51:45,760 --> 02:51:46,760
That's so many.

4480
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:47,760
Jesus Christ.

4481
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:48,760
All right.

4482
02:51:48,760 --> 02:51:49,760
We're at TPCrastinators on Twitter.

4483
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:51,760
Updates, releases, et cetera, et cetera.

4484
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:52,760
General upkeep.

4485
02:51:52,760 --> 02:51:53,760
There you go.

4486
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:54,760
Hey, you know what?

4487
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:55,760
Okay.

4488
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:56,760
Okay.

4489
02:51:56,760 --> 02:51:57,760
New plug thing for me specifically.

4490
02:51:57,760 --> 02:51:58,760
All right.

4491
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:00,760
I like like comments.

4492
02:52:00,760 --> 02:52:02,760
Not as in I want you to comment for like the algorithm.

4493
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:03,760
I don't even know if that works.

4494
02:52:03,760 --> 02:52:04,760
I don't know if that's the thing.

4495
02:52:04,760 --> 02:52:05,760
Probably is.

4496
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:06,760
It's better for you.

4497
02:52:06,760 --> 02:52:07,760
Probably is.

4498
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:08,760
I just like reading them.

4499
02:52:08,760 --> 02:52:13,760
So no, just make your comments not shit and also do more of them because I like to hear

4500
02:52:13,760 --> 02:52:14,760
from you.

4501
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:19,760
Like, I think the only, it's a weird feedback loop where I think that the PCP comments are

4502
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:22,400
terrible because they think we don't read them.

4503
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:25,120
The reason we don't read them is because they're terrible.

4504
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:31,080
So just assume we're reading them and make them better and then I think they've gotten

4505
02:52:31,080 --> 02:52:32,080
better.

4506
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:33,480
I haven't looked in a little while.

4507
02:52:33,480 --> 02:52:38,560
So for me, I never really read the PCP comments too much, but it's just that for now, like

4508
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:43,600
I consider my job, my job is done once I've released the episode for the month or like

4509
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:45,240
it's scheduled ahead of time or whatever.

4510
02:52:45,240 --> 02:52:48,600
I mean, I care about what people think and I want to, you know, whatever, fix things

4511
02:52:48,600 --> 02:52:49,600
if they're bad.

4512
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:50,600
Make no mistake.

4513
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:51,600
This isn't for intergagement.

4514
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:57,160
It just makes me feel good that I have made an impact, good, positive or negative.

4515
02:52:57,160 --> 02:53:00,320
I don't even know if the comments are good or bad, so I'm neutral, but I guess be good

4516
02:53:00,320 --> 02:53:01,320
if you want.

4517
02:53:01,320 --> 02:53:05,640
Typically, anything I release, I check comments for at least a day afterwards and the PCP,

4518
02:53:05,640 --> 02:53:10,160
it feels like comments from people who are assuming that no one's reading them.

4519
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:11,160
Okay.

4520
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:12,160
Okay.

4521
02:53:12,160 --> 02:53:13,160
Well, be advised people.

4522
02:53:13,720 --> 02:53:17,680
We've been saying, I do read the comments most weeks.

4523
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:18,680
I do as well.

4524
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:19,680
Yeah.

4525
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:20,680
Well, there you go.

4526
02:53:20,680 --> 02:53:21,680
There you go.

4527
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:22,680
Be good, ladies and gentlemen.

4528
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:23,680
I don't think they're that bad, honestly.

4529
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:24,680
I think they've improved a lot.

4530
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:28,640
There's probably a couple of people out there listening who think, I always comment nice.

4531
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:29,640
Okay.

4532
02:53:29,640 --> 02:53:30,640
Yeah, but it's not everybody.

4533
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:31,640
Have a good night.

4534
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:32,640
Bye.

4535
02:53:32,640 --> 02:53:33,640
We'll see you next week.

4536
02:53:33,640 --> 02:53:34,640
Bye.

4537
02:53:34,640 --> 02:53:35,640
Bye.

4538
02:53:35,640 --> 02:53:36,640
Bye.

4539
02:53:36,640 --> 02:53:37,640
Bye.

4540
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:43,640
I'm supposed to be working right now.

4541
02:53:43,640 --> 02:53:48,640
I'm supposed to be working right now.

4542
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:51,640
But I'm not working.

4543
02:53:51,640 --> 02:53:54,640
I'm doing nothing.

4544
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:57,640
My dick, I'm jerking.

4545
02:53:57,640 --> 02:53:59,640
Myself, I'm sucking.

4546
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:02,640
I am an asshole.

4547
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:05,640
I am a stupid.

4548
02:54:05,640 --> 02:54:07,640
I've got a deadline.

4549
02:54:07,640 --> 02:54:10,640
Don't want to do it.
