00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm supposed to be working right now, I'm supposed to be working right now, but I'm not working, I'm doing nothing, my dick I'm jerking, myself I'm suiting, I am an asshole, I am a stupid, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,220
got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick,

3
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:58,900
I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got

4
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,700
couple times. Maybe maybe had a larger health bar. Maybe CEO

5
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,340
shouldn't make all this money. If that's all they do is

6
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:13,060
welcome. No, they're welcome. Welcome everybody to the Amazon

7
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,100
Prime podcast. I'm your host, Jeff Bezos. I just made $20

8
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,740
million in the time it took me to say that sentence.

9
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,020
They're in a lot of zoom meetings, though. It's it's rough.

10
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,700
The life of a CEO. It really is. You don't understand. You

11
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,260
couldn't. You can't even jack off during them. Though they

12
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,460
can't. They can't. Yeah. They can't jack off because they

13
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,100
have their like hired whores sucking their dicks. I mean,

14
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,020
they can't. They can't. It's just a little risky, but like

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,220
that kind of makes it harder though. These guys are getting

16
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,940
off in ways that we can only dream of. We could never

17
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,700
understand the release. Well, we used to be able to not

18
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,220
understand. Now, now we know all about it. We know exactly

19
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,180
how they jacked off. We're jacking under the table while

20
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,500
in a call where if anyone discovers what you're doing,

21
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,740
it'll cost you the million dollar yo play deal is just

22
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,380
AK 0.0001% of your net worth. So you're risking really

23
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,380
nothing. Exactly. Exactly.

24
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,020
That's okay. Okay. Am I wrong in thinking 0.001 is still

25
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,980
like a lot of money for like a billion?

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,700
It is, but they don't care. I mean, 0.001 of a billion would

27
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,100
be a million, right? It's a thousand. So yeah, something like

28
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,420
that.

29
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,060
Did we start the podcast? I feel like that was the beginning.

30
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,580
No. Well, we can tell we can tell Elia's are to put it in.

31
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,220
Okay. Oh, because the Craig recording will have it.

32
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,940
But I just started Audacity. Do you want to, we can sync now?

33
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,580
Oh, I guess we probably should sync. Recording.

34
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,460
Oh, I wasn't, I was only recording with Craig. I just started

35
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,100
recording right now. Elia's are please and thank you. Make it

36
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,140
work. Just make it work. Fix it in post. Okay. That's what we

37
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,100
pay you for. Just make it work. On the count of three, say

38
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,220
sync. One, two, three, sync. Sink. Sink. One, two, three,

39
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,060
sync. Sink. Sink. Wow, you're like way behind. Am I way behind?

40
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,620
That was some buffering. That was some real buffering.

41
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,940
I think I heard you buffering, Ben. Okay, let's do it again.

42
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,020
Let's do it again. One, two, three, sync. Sink. Sink.

43
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,980
No, that's just how it is today, I guess. Yeah, we're just

44
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,820
getting that high ping over there from over the pond.

45
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,660
Based. Elia's are make it work. I told Elia's are the other day

46
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,740
that thanks for being the editor because you're a good

47
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,820
editor and you indulge my whims and when I say hey, make it a

48
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,260
new background, use new graphics, he just says okay and does

49
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,980
it and it's pretty based of him in my humble opinion. Thanks

50
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,820
Eleazar. Let's give a shout out. Thanks, Eleazar. And thanks, bro.

51
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,740
Okay, a mystery was solved for me this week. Have you noticed

52
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,740
that recent episodes have had a strange hashtag on them?

53
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,140
Oh, I think I know where you're going to go with this already,

54
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,340
but yes, the yeah, the hashtags Eleazar's discord handle,

55
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,660
right? That's what it turned out to be. Yeah, the episodes have

56
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,740
had this hashtag like they've been tagged like hashtag 7532,

57
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,940
I think, and I didn't know what it was. And it turns out it's

58
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,540
Eleazar's discord number, which he like he includes his

59
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,820
discord info in the description, which makes sense. But it was

60
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,060
showing up as a tag on the video and you could see it. So if

61
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,140
anyone noticed that, that's what that was. But he says he's

62
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,540
fixed it in the description and it won't show up anymore. Yeah,

63
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,020
lol, major, I mean, that's not so bad. It could be like a craftsman's

64
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,820
mark on each episode. Keep an eye on everybody for the Eleazar

65
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,540
discord t-shirt coming soon to the PCP. Yeah, we will we will

66
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,780
profit and not share any of it with him. And he will get it in

67
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,580
notifications. He will be, I mean, he'll get so much exposure

68
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,700
for people wearing his discord shirts. I saw a number on a

69
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,060
person's shirt and I'm crowded like in public and I just

70
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,580
thought I should say hi. I just thought I should contact Eleazar

71
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,980
for all my editing needs. That's what it made me think.

72
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,100
Yeah, so I don't know. This week, I think this week, Bitcoin

73
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,140
Bitcoin went well off down the tubes and it hasn't

74
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,060
been well. Welcome everybody to the procrastinators podcast.

75
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,620
We didn't even say that I'm to see you know now because I

76
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,380
said it before anybody else did. That's true. That's true. We

77
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,940
got Ben Saint and give and take on this episode. Anyways,

78
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,780
Bitcoin's shit now apparently it's down to 43k. Last I

79
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,460
checked it went it went down. Yeah, I bought this isn't I'll

80
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,340
just tell you I bought some when it was like high I bought some

81
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,940
at at 58k lol and then I bought some more after it fell. I

82
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,900
bought at like some more at like 40 48 I think I bought it

83
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,740
48 as well. Yeah. So they average out I think the amount

84
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,500
that I've got is averaged around like 52 and now it is down

85
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,260
to 44 and a half. So I mean it's not doing great but like you

86
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,020
know that's that's like a week. I'm like not that stressed

87
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,220
about it this time. I'm not well feeling as constantly

88
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,420
anxious as I as I was before. I feel I mean when it started

89
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,340
going down from like the peak the most recent peak mine says

90
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,140
like 41k as in pounds sterling. Yeah. So I don't know what it

91
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,980
is for you but like it started going down then it went back

92
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,620
up and I was just gonna come right back up and go even higher

93
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,420
and it has not done that. Yeah. So I'm losing money but like

94
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,020
I'm not cashing out ever so I guess I'm not losing anything.

95
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,020
I'm sad that Ethereum is down so much but I'm not super sad

96
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,180
because I haven't bought any Ethereum. I just got my

97
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,060
Ethereum for free. So who cares then. Dude 69 Ethereum. I want

98
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,020
that to be more. I want to get even bigger returns. It was

99
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,980
up to over 300. Now it's back down to 228 which is just

100
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,380
not. Okay. The worst thing that one voicemail said like

101
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,500
index funds is a good thing. Was that the thing he was

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,340
saying? Minerva. I forget who but was it an index fund?

103
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,700
Yeah. That was that was Minerva and I think she said it was

104
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,340
an index fund or something. Yeah. I was I've been meaning to

105
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,180
go back and listen to that segment again because she

106
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,500
seemed to have some good advice not for like from a vault

107
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,220
not for like fucking buy in the dip in a volatile market

108
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,940
like cryptos but just in like solid like long term

109
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,420
investing strategy. Yeah. Just kind of better like fuck this

110
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,100
up and down. I remember the name and I looked it up but

111
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I wasn't sure if that was the thing they said but index

112
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,340
funds are like kind of like a stock that replicates like

113
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,140
sort of mimics the market as a whole. So if it's not one

114
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,500
particular thing. So if things are it's really safe bet

115
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,100
because it's very unlikely that everything goes down

116
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,100
such as in a 2008. Well, I think it kind of did like I

117
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,620
think I think like this week this the market just kind of

118
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,260
took a hit and sort of took Bitcoin down with it. That's

119
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,900
what I was reading. I don't actually know if that's true.

120
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,300
I could be totally wrong. That's what people on our

121
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,740
slash Bitcoin were saying. I will have to mention that this

122
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,020
is not a money show. We never understand money ever and we

123
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,140
will never understand Bitcoin. I understand I understand

124
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,620
money and I don't even don't even pretend that we're

125
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,620
trying to be smart about it. I'm not the worst thing that

126
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,700
happened this week though. This made me so angry. It was so

127
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,860
infuriating. I finally sold my GameStop only for it to

128
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,940
suddenly shoot up again. I had finally it was no like days

129
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,340
before like you know I bought it like at the beginning of a

130
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,220
month and I was like okay it like rose for like a couple days

131
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,540
there and then it settled back down and it had like not moved

132
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,180
and I was like okay it was just a meme. It's not going

133
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,300
anywhere and then like later that same week it suddenly

134
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,220
shoots up to like 180. Literally it went up to 200.

135
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,940
Yeah I would have I actually would have made money. If I had

136
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,620
sold to 200 I actually would have made money but no I lost

137
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,100
like most of it because I sold it 50. I sold it 160. I bought

138
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,620
it at 210 so I still lost a lot of money but like way better

139
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,180
than like I was considering just like getting rid of it.

140
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,060
So I'm like uh no but I was like no I'm going to hold.

141
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,020
I did just because you got to hold and in the game of Stonks

142
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,420
you either hold or die. No I don't believe you have to sell

143
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,620
eventually. You have to sell eventually. The key is timing

144
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,980
when and yet and I fucked it up. I just there were no

145
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,100
indications that anything else is going to happen with it.

146
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,580
I know because like because like they they had the the trial

147
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,060
or whatever or the the hearing with that guy with deep fucking

148
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,340
value and like I saw a little graph like when he said that he

149
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,940
was still bearish on GameStop apparently it had like you know

150
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,180
I was still even saying oh the the the stock shot up the

151
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,860
stock shut up and it looked and it went up by like eight

152
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,220
dollars. I was like okay so it's not really moving that much

153
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,780
and I was like fucking I'm selling and that only for to

154
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,660
like quidruple overnight. Yeah I was watching it happen in

155
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,460
real time like what is happening because like I'm in like I'm

156
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,780
in a discord server with like Saber Spark and a couple other

157
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,940
guys just talking about the stock stuff we're all just like

158
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,020
what is going on right now just watching it go up in real time

159
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,500
was crazy. Just. We decided that the stock market's not real

160
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,660
and it's fake and it'll never be understood ever by anyone.

161
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,980
I mean it's it's like it's it is gambling the whole thing the

162
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,460
Bitcoin the stocks the whatever you put in money. Saber was

163
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,420
mentioning something like options like do you know anything

164
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,060
about options? I think it was who's called option that I was

165
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,020
only half paying attention because like I used to know

166
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,980
you make like a bet that a stock is going to be at a certain

167
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,660
price by a certain time or you lose your money. I'm like how

168
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,460
is that not like why not just why not just invest in the

169
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,740
stock? I don't I don't know I don't get it but like just

170
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,300
explaining the concept I'm like isn't this just like like

171
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,380
betting on horses or something but you're just betting on

172
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,340
stock like literally I guess I guess people would bet that

173
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,220
the stock would go down and so they wouldn't want to have the

174
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,660
stock. I don't know. I don't understand. Well, she's short

175
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,620
it then. Like over that over that. Somebody in the in the

176
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,940
chat who's smart explained to me what why how that's not

177
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,900
gambling. I know in way too smooth brain to understand. I

178
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,500
know in theory how shorting a stock works. I have no clue

179
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,860
how one would actually go about doing it. So I don't know

180
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,300
maybe that's like an easier way of you just need a big bunch of

181
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,300
money. You you buy a bunch of stock. Okay. You buy a bunch of

182
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,980
stock. You borrow the stock and then you borrow it. The the the

183
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,140
key is no so that then you have to I hate you. I hate you.

184
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,540
You're explaining what it is in theory but how do you actually

185
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,660
do it? How do you actually do that? Just go to Google search

186
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,540
how to short stock and I'm sure wiki how will tell you exactly

187
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,980
how to do it with pictures. No, you don't know. I have no idea.

188
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,220
Yeah. Of course not. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't imagine that's what

189
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,860
I'm saying. I'm on a podcast on the internet. You think I know

190
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,780
anything of substance? If I did, I'd be doing that instead of

191
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,020
being on the procrastinators podcast. Okay. Well, you're

192
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:56,020
right. Obviously. The thing with all of this though is it's

193
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,460
like I put the money in and yes, technically it's you have to

194
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,260
cash out but I don't see any reason to cash out until you

195
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,340
can make a profit. Like if it never because if you die, I mean

196
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,420
it's so you can make a profit. Yeah, but like I don't know.

197
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,340
Whoa. It's like imagine if you spend like like like I don't

198
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,700
know a hundred pounds, a hundred dollars on food and then

199
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,020
that money is spent, the food is eaten, life goes on. In this

200
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,500
situation, you throw it down a well and in the future, it may

201
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,300
come back. I don't see much of a reason to like it's

202
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,180
reductive. I don't know. The reason is because there are

203
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,940
people who put money into stock market, they can't afford to

204
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,380
lose. That's why. It's all about opportunity cost, right?

205
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,260
Because like, okay, say you have, I don't know, Bitcoin and

206
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,740
Bitcoin is going, I mean, if Bitcoin goes down and Ethereum

207
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,860
goes up, then hypothetically, you would have made more money

208
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,940
if you had sold your Bitcoin and bought Ethereum. So like even

209
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,260
if you weren't like even if you were selling the Bitcoin of

210
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,500
the loss, you could be reducing your loss and maybe turning

211
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,300
loss into gain if you sold at the right time and did the

212
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,380
right thing with the money. It's about maximizing.

213
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,620
I know that the min-maxing of it is much more efficient at

214
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,180
like actually making the gains, but I don't like the lifestyle

215
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,180
and the, you know, I've said this before. Like to play it the

216
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,660
way I'm playing it, it's only useful to take out money when

217
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,380
there's a profit. Until then, it's gone and that's fine, but

218
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,020
it's like a ghost. You could revive it.

219
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,860
But if you, but only if you expect there to eventually be a

220
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,100
profit, right? Yeah, that might be, and that might not be, but

221
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,940
like, yeah, I invested in the first place on the assumption

222
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,060
that it would make a profit. My assumption, okay, I have, I

223
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,980
am not worried about the dip because I invested this, this

224
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,580
time I bought some Bitcoin with a solid, wait, who just left

225
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,140
the fucking call? Was that Craig? I fucking hate Craig.

226
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,820
Did Craig just abandon us? I, like he always does, yes.

227
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,540
He always, he always does this. Craig's the worst guest on the

228
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,380
PCP. He just doesn't work. Why doesn't he just fucking work?

229
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,620
Oh boy, I'm mad. He comes on here and he doesn't say

230
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,620
anything. Freeloader. And then when we, and when we have to

231
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,620
pay him, and we have to pay him 25% of the, of the, of the

232
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:41,620
cut, because he's so big. Man, it's a good thing we don't

233
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,660
rely on Craig and still record locally. Imagine if we just

234
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,540
lost everything. Lol. Yeah, I mean, yeah, sure. And then we

235
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,060
won't even, okay, whatever, we got the beginning. Okay, I'll

236
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,220
try and get him to come back in. It doesn't matter. Um, was,

237
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:03,060
wait, he's messaging. Oh, he said, okay, I fucking, I say,

238
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,900
hey, Craig rejoined the call and he DMs me to say, I'm already

239
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,300
recording that channel. No, you're fucking not Craig.

240
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,340
You're a liar, Craig. Fail to join. This is gaslighting.

241
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,380
I hate you. I hate you, Craig. I hate him so much. I hate his

242
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,140
stupid fucking bare face. It is like the worst illustration

243
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,500
ever. That's not true. But it's up there. It's up there.

244
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,820
It's very, it's poor. It's a poor. Um, okay, anyway, whatever,

245
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,220
I'll try and get him back in. If, uh, what was I saying? Fuck.

246
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Something, something, something money, something, something

247
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,900
stonk, something, something Bitcoin, I don't remember.

248
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,300
No, no, no, I had a point I was gonna make. Uh, we were talking

249
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,940
about, what did you just say, Gib? I just said that there's

250
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,260
no reason to, like, like, you should always only sell it at

251
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,220
a profit and never sell it before that point. I remember.

252
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,940
I remember. Okay. I bought Bitcoin this time because I had

253
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,780
a notion and I still think it makes sense and is probably

254
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,540
true to some extent. And that is that everyone said that the

255
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,740
stimulus package, the money printers go, is going to, if

256
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,100
not cause inflation, it will at least create concern about

257
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,940
inflation and Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against inflation.

258
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,300
And therefore it makes some amount of sense to think that the

259
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,220
price of Bitcoin will rise in response to the stimuli and

260
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,020
also that people will be putting their stimmies into Bitcoin

261
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,180
because a lot of people want to invest and that'll be their

262
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,540
first opportunity to do so. So I think it makes logical sense

263
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,020
and I could be wrong. Well, it kind of did. I guess I think it,

264
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,500
I think it kind of did happen with previous stimmies, but so

265
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,660
I'm expecting that it, that, that there will be a jump in

266
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,460
response to the stimuli and I, I, I'm just going to hold it

267
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,780
until then. And if it crashes to zero and I lose everything,

268
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,420
well, fuck it. I won't starve. So, you know, it's fine. It's

269
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,180
fine. But it is, I do think it'll, I do think it'll crash

270
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,020
eventually. It won't stay at like 40 or 50 forever.

271
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,380
I think it might, like, my imagination really is just

272
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,340
saying, oh, patterns, huh? It went up real big from nothing.

273
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,980
And then it went back down and stayed down, but then it went

274
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,060
back up again and it went even higher. This means it will

275
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,740
absolutely go even higher than this time. And that's like my

276
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,780
stupid like a monkey pattern seeking brain is like, yes,

277
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,220
there's absolutely a chance that it will get even bigger than

278
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,300
this.

279
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:45,620
Yeah. You know, I did, I was, because I watch a YouTube

280
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,540
channel called Clear Value Tax where Brian explains how to

281
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,980
make money to me. Thanks, Brian. Love you. And he, this is

282
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,860
Donate to my Patreon and I'll tell you all about it. In

283
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,660
hindsight, in hindsight, I'm so infuriated because there was a

284
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,100
video that he, that he put out advising like how you should

285
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,380
like invest like specifically it was called When You Should

286
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,820
Sell Bitcoin. And basically his thesis was this thing about,

287
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,620
in response to the stimulus is probably gonna, he says like it

288
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,900
lines up timing wise with the time frame of like previous

289
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,580
Bitcoin crashes. And also the stimulus seems like it's a

290
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,220
promising thing that'll cause a rise. And so he's planning to

291
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,340
like start trickling his out around then. But he released that

292
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,700
on February 8th, literally the day that Tesla spent the like

293
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,340
billions of dollars on Bitcoin and it exploded. Like he

294
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,780
released it that same day. But I didn't watch it then. I

295
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,260
didn't watch it until several weeks later. And when I

296
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,380
watched it, I was like, he's right. And I invested and that

297
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,900
was the day it fucking crashed. It was so bad. Always. I hate

298
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,660
you, Brian. I hate you. You betrayed me.

299
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,100
Uh, brutal. Absolutely. I feel like the the Bitcoin era of

300
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,860
the PCP, um, it was pretty stupid. Oh, yeah. We never talk

301
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,620
about it ever again. Ben, you're just too lefty for stocks

302
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,020
that they just they just inherently it's like oil and

303
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,180
water. They hate me. Every time you get into the market, it

304
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,620
just pushes away from you. I I hope that's true. I wish I

305
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,580
had the power. If I if I had known that, okay, if you had

306
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,180
told me Ben, you actually have the power. If you invest in

307
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,780
Bitcoin, it will go down. You will lose your own money, but

308
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,460
it will destroy Bitcoin. I would have done it anyway just to

309
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,340
fuck Elon Musk over. I would have considered I would have

310
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,220
considered it to be a worthwhile investment. So in that

311
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,380
sense, I'm not too bothered about it. That might have lost

312
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,860
tons of money on Bitcoin, but he has the moral victory and

313
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,980
that's all that really matters. If if I had known that it

314
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,460
would have happened, I think I would have done it. Of

315
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,140
course, in reality, the drop would have happened without

316
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,420
me investing. So I wish I hadn't. And then I could have

317
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,500
just laughed at the dip without cringing in pain. But

318
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,780
it's not a perfect world. It's not a perfect world. I'm not

319
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:20,580
a perfect person. Oh, God. In a perfect world, men like me

320
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,540
would not exist. In a perfect world. You wouldn't exist.

321
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:30,500
What is that from? It's from the potion seller guy.

322
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,300
From what? He made a video where he was like, oh wait, the

323
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,380
thing you said? I don't know what that thing you said. No, what

324
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,380
you said. I was talking about the thing I said. Is it a

325
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,300
YouTuber? It's it's the guy who goes, you know, with the

326
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,780
funny face filter thing and he's like, potion seller, I

327
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,580
need one of your strongest potions. It's like my potions

328
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,220
are too strong for you, Trevor. You know that guy? I think

329
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,940
I know that guy. I think I'm only familiar with it second

330
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,300
hand. Oh, well, he's funny. And he makes those videos all

331
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,060
the time. Like just like fucking around with face filters.

332
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,700
And he did one where he was like, let me just find the

333
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,500
link. You can put it in the description. I learned a lot

334
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,660
today. Yeah. Post the link. Is Craig, Craig says he's in

335
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,660
here. What is he? Craig, we came and left like four times

336
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,780
during your tirade on easy Bitcoin. It was very strange. Oh

337
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,580
yeah, I've seen this video. Here's here's the video. It's

338
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,660
53 seconds long. That's too long. That's one whole voicemail

339
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,140
we could be listening to instead. It's not a perfect

340
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:50,020
world. Okay, okay. It's like pretty old, right? I remember

341
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,460
watching this seven years old. Yeah, okay. That's about

342
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,060
right. Oh, 2013. This filter is really good. It's really

343
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:06,660
working for me. That fucking Mac webcam filters going on

344
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:13,780
right now. I told Craig to join again. If he tells me he's

345
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,980
already recording, I'll know. I'll know that he that I

346
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,140
succeeded. He says he's in the call. He says a lot of

347
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:27,460
things. Not a very trustworthy narrator. No, terrible.

348
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:34,740
Yeah, go on. Funny videos. I think I was gonna say I think

349
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,580
okay, fine, okay. No, it's it's because of the lag. Like

350
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,700
every time I open my mouth, you have begun something and I

351
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,420
was like, oh, I should stop speaking and then every time

352
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,460
you hear me going, you're like, oh, Gabe wants to say

353
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,180
something. I should stop speaking. Look at this. I tell

354
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,060
it's it's in the call. I tell it to leave the call. It says

355
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,020
I'm not recording. It's not in the call. I say join the call.

356
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,100
He says I'm already recording. Curse him. Okay. We need to

357
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,500
stop talking about Craig. I'm sure the audience is not

358
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,060
super invested in our frustrations with a 12th member

359
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:15,060
of the procrastinators podcast, Craig. Or are they?

360
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,780
The commenters, let us know. Yeah, I guess so. I don't think

361
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,260
I've seen a single comment talking about Craig. The Craig

362
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:27,220
is in full swing. Bummer. It's like a sleeper arc. Yeah, I

363
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:33,140
think I am done. Not done, but I think I'm over my my deepest

364
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,140
obsession with Noida at this point. I think I've I think I

365
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,900
was going I think I was way too hooked on Noida for a

366
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,700
little bit there. But I had a I had a run I got them I got

367
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,260
one of the endings. I got the not the like get every orb

368
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,700
ending, but the get every orb just from like the normal

369
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,940
world ending, which is like almost the best ending. It's

370
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,860
like the second best one. So I feel like I've done a lot

371
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,220
with it. And maybe I can be a little free of its malign

372
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,820
influence now. I was I was trapped in its world, like

373
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:21,700
Jumanji. But now I was in there, mixing potions and

374
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:29,380
shit. Building wands. I was today I was today I was rambling

375
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,260
in my discord server about a wand crafting theory. No one

376
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,340
was interested. But I just wanted to explain about how an

377
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,260
autocast laser wand is actually really good because that

378
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,140
applies. It's a cast delay modifier without its mana

379
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:51,460
consumption. So just just think about that. Think about

380
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,300
that if you will fast. I'll think about it. Okay. Okay,

381
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,340
good. Okay, good. Well, that's me. That was that was my

382
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:08,500
week sick based. Love it. Me too. I have this music club

383
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,260
thing, where in a discord, we say to each other, let's

384
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,620
listen to these albums, we like bring an album forth, and

385
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,380
we vote on which ones we want to listen to, and then we

386
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,620
listen to them, and we talk about them. And the last

387
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:30,180
week, a pro mayor. Like the anime? Like the yeah, like

388
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:36,500
death note, like, like, like, like Naruto. He was a Naruto.

389
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,820
She was a Kunuichi. Could it be anymore obvious? I love that

390
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,420
song. He was a Naruto. She was a Kunuichi. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

391
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,180
yeah, yeah, yeah, stuff like that. I was like, I really

392
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,260
like that. I've heard that. I have no I have no idea what

393
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,860
you're talking about. Promare is like emo girl, singing

394
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,180
about feelings in the early 2000s band. Wait, isn't

395
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,220
pro-marine? Isn't pro-marine? Paramore. Paramore.

396
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:12,260
Okay. Paramore is a band. I know, sorry. It is an anime.

397
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,740
Okay. All right. I know. So, Paramore. So, Paramore AMV2

398
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,700
Paramore. Make it happen, people. Yeah, and if I can, it's

399
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,420
like Gun Girl Accord. It's like, that's good. That's what I

400
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,140
want. I want to be into that. I think the greatest human

401
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,620
achievement I can ever like achieve is to be unironically

402
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,460
into like Paramore and Evanescence and just be a big

403
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,340
actual fan of those sorts of things. That's a really lofty

404
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,020
goal you've set for yourself. I know. I'm trying. I don't

405
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,500
know. I'm struggling every day. I support this. I mean, it's

406
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,500
about the journey. It's about the climb. If you never make

407
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:54,580
it, it's okay. Yeah, so I listen to that. That was good. Do

408
00:27:54,580 --> 00:28:00,500
you, like I, I, I, I, I missed out on, oh yeah. I, I, I don't

409
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,780
know much about that sort of music other than I've heard

410
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,580
bits of it in YouTube videos and I knew that emos were a

411
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,420
thing, but I never really saw any at school and I sort of

412
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,340
missed the boat on all of that stuff. I mean, but I kind of

413
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,900
feel like I like it. I kind of feel like I wanted to be that.

414
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,660
I, I not ironically enjoyed Evanescence first album and

415
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,260
even listening to it recently, as in recently being a few

416
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,500
years ago, still slaps, still like it. Did they not have,

417
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,380
were there no like emo or goth kids at school, Gib?

418
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,180
No, there must have been a few. There was one guy. But they

419
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,980
were all black so you couldn't see them. They were invisible.

420
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,420
Well, not, not like they wore all black. Yeah, that's what I

421
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,660
mean. Oh, the, the African American students. Oh, the

422
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,300
African American goth. They're completely invisible. That's

423
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,860
why, that's why they're so rare. It's a rare sighting. The

424
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,420
African British population just loves Paramores. I don't

425
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,740
know why even if they're wearing black, they would be

426
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,180
invisible because the, the world is like, it's the sun's out.

427
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,620
It's daytime. Um, you can see them. Only really. Maybe that's

428
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,460
why I never saw them. There was a girl in my photography

429
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,620
class who had like, seen girl hair without the, uh, like

430
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,140
hair dye. Yeah. And I was like, oh, she's, uh, pretty.

431
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,820
Yes. But she was a lesbian apparently. Of course. They

432
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,020
all are. Fuck up. She was, she was really cool. You can't.

433
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,460
That's the problem. No. No. But that, that was the only

434
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,260
person who was even remotely in that sort of thing.

435
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,860
Cool woman. Pick one. That's what I'm saying.

436
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,500
How about both? That's my official statement. No.

437
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:47,940
No. What if Dora the Explorer was a goth? Yeah. What if she was?

438
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,740
What then? Dora the Explorer, goth blingy gift circa 2001 on

439
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,380
MySpace. It exists somewhere, I'm sure.

440
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,820
Yes, I'm Dora the Explorer. Yes, I'm goth. We exist.

441
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,340
We should be, uh, goth. We should like do a goth rad con.

442
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,500
I already was. I already was goth. I mean, we're, we're, we're

443
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,260
like tombstones right now. Right now we're dead. Like tombstones.

444
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,300
We should be skeletons as well. There should be bats and spiders.

445
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,460
Think about the Halloween episode we're going to have with

446
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,700
these images. It's going to be so aesthetic. Oh my God. Yes.

447
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,340
The Halloween episode, we're going to be like fucking

448
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,900
Five Nights at Freddy if I'd.

449
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,820
Ooh. Do you see that new Five Nights at Freddy's game for PS5?

450
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,940
It's like full 3D now. Like it's pretty weird. It's pretty crazy.

451
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,300
Uh, no. Yeah, I saw that. There was a Sony, like Nintendo Switch

452
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:47,140
Direct, but Sony version. They should make the Five Nights at Freddy's in VR.

453
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,780
I mean, I'm sure they have Five Nights at Freddy's. They already do.

454
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,300
Oh, well, you know, it was really strange about that new Five Nights at Freddy's game

455
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,740
that like fucked with me. Is that like they had like actual,

456
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,660
like human characters in like third person you could see the people

457
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,300
and they looked like cartoons. I'm imagining they look like the doll people in Toy Story,

458
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,540
like Andy. Yeah, it kind of was like that. And I'd always just kind of assumed it was just like

459
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,580
photo realistic humans and only the animatronics. That's, that's why they're animatronics.

460
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,580
That's why Five Nights at Freddy's like works and is good because you don't see any humans.

461
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,140
And the only characters you see are the animatronics, which are made according to

462
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,460
what's his name's like, what's his name is just he's only, he's only good at making like terrible

463
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,980
looking animatronics, which just happens to work with a game that's about being hunted by evil

464
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,980
animatronics. Yeah, if, yeah, there's a reason it's minimal. That's terrible. I didn't,

465
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,100
I didn't think, I didn't think that was a good call. I think it should have,

466
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,060
should have been real looking humans, but you know, it's like, yeah, so they don't care about

467
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,100
what I think, I guess. Yeah, it should have had like FMV actors or something. That would have been

468
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:02,900
sick. Yeah, that's what I, that's what I would have done. 480p, 124p, video file, human actors on

469
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:10,660
a green screen. Yeah, like a Sega CD. Yeah, like 12 FPS. Sega CD shit should come back. It was

470
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:16,580
terrible, but I like looking at it. Yeah, yeah, it's good stuff. But good, I mean bad. Yeah,

471
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,980
because the only human you see in a Five Nights at Freddy's game is you. Well, I mean, and you

472
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,940
don't see yourself. So it's just assumed that you just look like yourself. And you're just in this

473
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,580
place with these robots. And the robots look like they look because they're designed to be like

474
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,620
cartoony looking. And yeah. And then they got blood, they got red blood coming out. And it's like,

475
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:44,580
it's like a creepypasta. And they got big teeth. I've probably talked about, I've probably talked

476
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:51,220
about it before, but when I get, I get inspired whenever I think about that, how like, I mean,

477
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,340
you know, like his Scott Cawthorne's game, like before Five Nights at Freddy's, like the kind

478
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,660
of stuff he made. It's like a cute animal platform where they got tore to shreds because it looked

479
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,580
creepy. So he was like, all right, let's just roll with it. And he made it creepy. Yeah, because

480
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,060
when he tried to make animal characters in 3D, his aesthetic was just like just bad and looked

481
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,780
gross and creepy. So we just leaned into it and made a game about creepy looking animal characters.

482
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:19,300
I like unironically love stories like that. Yeah. It's like, I'm bad at everything. I'm bad at

483
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,860
everything except this one thing. So let me make a game that's completely about that and it works

484
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,660
and it's genius. A story that vaguely reminded me of that because like, you know, like Daft Punk,

485
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,380
you know, you know how Daft Punk, like they're dead, they die, they're gone. I heard they're dead.

486
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,340
Yeah. Sad face, press F in the chat for Daft Punk. I was reading an article about like Daft Punk,

487
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,460
because, you know, in regards to them, like no longer being a thing. And I guess like before

488
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:50,100
Daft Punk, they had like another like band with like a third guy and they got a really bad review

489
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,980
and someone called it like Daft Punkish or something or other. And they took that and made

490
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,340
a new band called Daft Punk and it blew the fuck up. That guy must be like an idiot.

491
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,260
That's great. That guy, that guy is the is the TJ Henry Yoshi of music reviews.

492
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:10,660
You know, he said an A-press is an A-press. You can't tell it's only a half. Well,

493
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:16,500
shows what you know. An A-chord is an A-chord. You can't play only a half A-chord. You can.

494
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:24,020
I saw a gif or I saw a video showing the original song that the one more time

495
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,820
chorus was sampled from and like how it was. Yeah. Yeah. It was like stretched out and like

496
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:35,940
pieces cut out of it and, you know, cycled around. Super cool. I kind of, I mean, when has

497
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,500
Daft Punk like put out a new album in years? I mean, I know they weren't dead. Random Access

498
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,260
Memories was the last one. They felt pretty dead to me for a long time.

499
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,780
You know, they felt like something that used to make, somebody that used to make music.

500
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,180
Yeah. I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't, they weren't really on my radar until Random Access Memories.

501
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,940
I think I'd maybe heard of them before once or twice. I love to describe it.

502
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,500
And then that was like an incredible album that's like, oh, wow. I can't really see if they do

503
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,260
anything more. And then like that came out in 2012 or something. Have you seen, have you seen

504
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:17,300
Interstellar 5555? Hell yeah. Love that movie. Yeah. It's great. Do you know what it is?

505
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,060
Is it when they go back in time because there's this space and there's a time vortex and they

506
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:29,700
No, they don't go back in time. They go to like a different galaxy or a different universe.

507
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:37,220
They get like abducted for something, right? Yes. They get abducted from like an Earth guy.

508
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:44,020
Abducts these alien, these aliens of bands. Daft Punk made an album called Discovery and

509
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,940
Interstellar 5555. And like Discovery is like their big one that has like one more time and stuff.

510
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,100
Yeah, that's the album that this movie is based on because they took the entire album

511
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,620
and they animated like an anime movie to all the songs in succession.

512
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,540
And the plot is like, it's like these alien band and like they get abducted by some Earth

513
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,460
people and like reprogrammed to think they're like an Earth band, like they look like humans.

514
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,300
And it's a lie. Literally this guy, he's just a music executive and he's like, hmm,

515
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:20,020
I gotta chomp on his cigar. I gotta find some talent. I gotta moichandize something.

516
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,460
It's like Space Jam, except it's at a basketball. It's music.

517
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,660
It's like Space Jam in reverse. Pretty much.

518
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,260
Oh, she's like, oh shit, but the best band in the universe is on another planet.

519
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,820
Can't make money from that.

520
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,580
I know, I'll steal him and I'll paint him to look human and that's what he does.

521
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,180
It's really a euphemism for capitalism and how it's exploitative when you really think.

522
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,180
Doesn't he? Is that the blue people in the music video?

523
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,260
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

524
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,020
It was on that tsunami back in the day.

525
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,980
He literally like puts them through a machine that like splats them with like human colors,

526
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,100
skin, goo and makes them look like humans.

527
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,300
Harder, better. I don't forget what it's actually called.

528
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,420
Yes. Oh God.

529
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,340
I think it's called Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.

530
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,020
Yeah, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.

531
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,340
It's legendary. It's great. Definitely worth watching. Check it out.

532
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:21,780
The best one. I like the one where the space, the alien like army guy who is sent to rescue them

533
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:28,340
is like looking at the poster of the girl and it might not be the right one.

534
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,980
It might not be the right time, but there's something about.

535
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,780
Yeah, that one's a, I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting all emotional.

536
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,660
That's pretty good.

537
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,220
What interested me about the Daft Punk like epilogue video was the,

538
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,020
you know, the two guys Daft and Punk.

539
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:55,140
Daft kept walking and Punk was just like, no, I've had enough. I want to stop.

540
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,460
And then the other, you know, Goldilocks, Golden Manhead, he,

541
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,860
he blew up his friend because he wanted to stop making music.

542
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,340
Obviously the metaphor is that I want to stop being in the band,

543
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,020
but the other guy just keeps walking.

544
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,020
So I wonder if like there's going to be more of his music.

545
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,980
I didn't know there was a video. I haven't seen this.

546
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,060
Oh yeah. Oh, it's, it's a really cool video.

547
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,580
It's super cool. It's like a little short film.

548
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,460
Oh, okay.

549
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,380
To like announcing there.

550
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,580
Yeah, they put it up on YouTube.

551
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,540
Yeah. It's, it's, it's a wordless announcement.

552
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,580
Like it's, it's very well put together.

553
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,900
It's just like body language tells the entire story.

554
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,780
And one of them blows up.

555
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,220
And an explosion, a very sick explosion.

556
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,260
Completely final, like, like the helmet is destroyed.

557
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,220
It's gone. He's gone.

558
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,940
Oh.

559
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,660
Say my final message.

560
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,820
It's actually like, maybe feel a little bit.

561
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,860
Maybe feel a little bit.

562
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,260
Watching the Silver Man get blown.

563
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,260
It wasn't good, but like it was well done.

564
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,700
I was like, oh man, goodbye.

565
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,660
He like takes, he like stops and like takes his jacket off.

566
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,580
And there's a self-destruct button on the back.

567
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,580
And like the gold guy presses it and he just walks.

568
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,140
And there's this long shot that lasts way too long.

569
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,260
And then he blows up.

570
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,860
It's fucking sick, but sad.

571
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,100
And made me feel like really like bad.

572
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,220
Gold guy has to go on to join a steam powered giraffe now.

573
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,780
He has to join up with the only other robot band in existence.

574
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,060
It's the only place for him.

575
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,660
He keeps walking in the desert and he bumps into,

576
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,260
can guess it on the lizard wizard.

577
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,500
Gold's going to make a cameo in the Five Nights at Freddy's

578
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,220
video game coming.

579
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,500
He's going to come into like the next Gorillaz album.

580
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,020
Got to make money somehow in the interim.

581
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,340
He takes his like dome screen face off

582
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,620
and it's just teeth under there.

583
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
And he used the Five Nights at Freddy's all alone.

584
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,260
That was Freddy.

585
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,860
Oh, he was Freddy.

586
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,740
Of course.

587
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,780
Of course.

588
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,860
Freddy Fazbear under there the whole time.

589
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,940
Doftpunk at Freddy's.

590
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,140
Mm.

591
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,980
I'm glad we figured that out.

592
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,220
How unfortunate that our specific expertise,

593
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,220
we can figure out that deep mystery,

594
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,780
but we can't figure out the stock market or Bitcoin.

595
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,620
It's because there's not enough funny things

596
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,980
in the stock market.

597
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,780
It's just numbers.

598
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,180
Where's the pixels?

599
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,300
Where's the fucking high res bloom effect?

600
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,540
I don't like looking at it.

601
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,700
Where's the contrasting colors?

602
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,980
Oh, never mind.

603
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,420
It's here on my price chart.

604
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,740
There's the red candles and the green candles.

605
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,860
It's a masterpiece.

606
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,580
Yeah, never mind.

607
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,220
Never mind.

608
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,500
Bitcoin is actually the greatest work of art

609
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,660
of the 21st century.

610
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,220
It's true.

611
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,980
I think those like fake like CG renderings of a Bitcoin,

612
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,740
if it were physical, does a lot to sell people on the idea.

613
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,300
Like way more than people would imagine.

614
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,380
You mean the one that the slime coin is based on?

615
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,540
Yeah, those like fake like, what if Bitcoin was real?

616
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,340
I mean, there are real coins like that.

617
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,940
They're like, they're just collectible.

618
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,060
But like, the idea to make that at all

619
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,060
is like a really good publicity thing.

620
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,580
Because I don't know what the fuck a graph coin looks like.

621
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,620
I mean, I watched it.

622
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,740
I think I mentioned that someone sent me a video explaining

623
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,340
what it actually is and it's not what I thought it is at all.

624
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,300
It's literally a Bitcoin is literally like a record of transactions.

625
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,900
Basically, that's encrypted.

626
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,780
It's like the very basic version that leaves out a lot.

627
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,780
There was a guy linked me a really good video about it.

628
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,860
And I think I mentioned it on a previous episode,

629
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,300
but now I forget what it was called.

630
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,300
Yeah, it's hard to visualize and it doesn't matter really.

631
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,500
Because like at the end of the day,

632
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,180
it's just the same as any other stock.

633
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,580
Like I pay money in and the number goes up or down

634
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,460
and then I get money out and it's more or less and yay.

635
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,940
That's all it really means to me.

636
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,660
Yeah, I guess it's better than trading with loaves of bread

637
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,580
because those go moldy.

638
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,220
I can't store those in a bank.

639
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,060
Those aren't a secure store of value.

640
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,140
You got to read debt.

641
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,500
Gib, did you ever read debt by David Graber?

642
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,020
No, I heard about it.

643
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,740
I was in the book reading club with Munchie and I was like,

644
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,860
ah, you know, this sounds like something I should do

645
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,660
and I didn't do it.

646
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,820
Debt is one of the most interesting books I've ever read.

647
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,500
I recommend it to everyone.

648
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,540
It's fascinating.

649
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,820
I feel like it'd be a huge downer if I read it though.

650
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,740
It's not that much of a downer.

651
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,340
It's not even that like.

652
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,340
But I'm in so much debt, Ben.

653
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,260
Would that make it a downer?

654
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,340
Oh, um, I mean, yeah.

655
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,700
You're a downer no matter what.

656
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,580
You know, that's fair.

657
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,940
That might be a little upsetting.

658
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,700
That might be it might be a little irritating.

659
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,980
But I mean, what it what it really does is it like money

660
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,300
doesn't come from where you think it comes from basically.

661
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,820
And like the the idea that like the idea that like.

662
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,900
It's a talk about fractional reserve banking

663
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,660
and how the U.S. government buys bonds

664
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,540
from the Federal Reserve in exchange for reserve notes.

665
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,860
And then a little banks can like loan it out.

666
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,980
But every time they make a loan,

667
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,940
they actually can like loan out 10 times the amount of money they have.

668
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,260
Well, I mean, it's it's more about like the historical like development of it

669
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,500
and how like pre industrial cultures have things that are like money,

670
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,340
but are really not used in the same ways that we use money.

671
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,900
And and how like people just kind of assume that like before money,

672
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,940
there was a sort of there like the barter system was used.

673
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,820
And there was like an exchange, you know, a certain like number of loaves of bread

674
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,340
equal like a number of, you know, like clay bricks or whatever.

675
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,420
But like, it's not really that simple.

676
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:59,460
And like the idea of like payment and exchange and owing sort of like came after money,

677
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,420
like the money was invented and it wasn't like there was no.

678
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:03,940
I don't know.

679
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,100
It's more complicated than I'm I mean, that that would be interesting.

680
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,740
Like the fucking missing link between bartering and money.

681
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,540
Like yeah, like it's not as it's not.

682
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,540
There was there wasn't it's not like, oh, we used to barter,

683
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,740
but then money was invented.

684
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,660
And that just simplified bartering like no money kind of came first.

685
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,780
It's in a in a way.

686
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,220
It's pretty long book.

687
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,740
There's a lot I should reread it actually,

688
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,660
because I'm sure there was stuff I missed on the on the first go.

689
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,500
Not as long as, um, oh God, what was that other one?

690
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:46,180
Oh, fuck, there was one like 17 hour one was like an old historical book

691
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:51,700
by a guy like a nobleman who visited the United States in like its slavery times

692
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,580
and wrote about it.

693
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,580
Oh, that one was boring.

694
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,060
That one was boring, but I stuck it out.

695
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,780
I listened to the whole thing and now I can't remember what it was called.

696
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,220
No, sorry, I fucked up.

697
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,500
How unfortunate.

698
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,260
Very sad, sad.

699
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,620
Wow.

700
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,260
What are there?

701
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,820
What else happened this week, guys?

702
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,140
Any any news?

703
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,220
Do we want to talk about?

704
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,740
No, OK, go on.

705
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,300
Go on.

706
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:25,700
I was just going to talk about how I'm really sad that computer parts are forever

707
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,100
gone.

708
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,220
Like it's never going to happen.

709
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,500
I wanted to buy a new graphics card.

710
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,100
I wanted to play some new video games and super high frame rates.

711
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,900
And you just can't you just can't do it.

712
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,260
And it really sucks.

713
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,660
And it's really bothering me because I keep thinking like, oh, I can't.

714
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,180
How much longer can it last?

715
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,820
How much longer can this chip shortage last?

716
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,220
How much longer can these scalpers continue to win?

717
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,820
And now everyone's saying like it's probably going to go through 2022.

718
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,100
I'm like, oh, I didn't know.

719
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,580
I didn't even know that was happening.

720
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,540
It's so bad.

721
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:05,380
So like there's there's been like a huge shortage of just like like chip manufacturing

722
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,820
because like basically everybody gets their chips manufactured through a company called

723
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,420
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing or TSMC.

724
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,780
So they're getting slammed with all these like orders like you got to make the fucking

725
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,740
all the new consoles.

726
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,900
You got to make all the fucking Apple iPhone things.

727
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,420
You got to make all the AMD process.

728
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,580
You're going to make all the Nvidia graphics cards.

729
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,900
And like, well, actually, Nvidia makes goes to the Samsung.

730
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,860
But that's besides the point.

731
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:31,860
So like there's just a huge shortage of just like chips, like computer components.

732
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,660
And so we're at the point now where the shortage is getting so bad

733
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,460
that even like car manufacturers can't finish making cars because like the computers that

734
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,540
run cars like you can't make them anymore.

735
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,060
And so like new graphics cards and stuff launched like six months ago and they're

736
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,900
still impossible to get a hold of.

737
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,140
And it's at the point where like at first, like there's like this whole like

738
00:46:54,100 --> 00:47:00,580
gray market of people who would like buy shoes with like like computer like algorithms,

739
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,260
like immediately buy all the stock and then flip them and like scalp them for like way

740
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,380
higher prices.

741
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,740
And I guess someone, some of them figured out, Hey, why don't we like start scalping

742
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,260
video game consoles and computer components because they're way more expensive.

743
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,020
And so all these cards are being immediately bought by like algorithms

744
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,980
and sold for like triple to quadruple what they're supposed to cost.

745
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,180
And it's been that way since like September when all the shit launched.

746
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,260
And now like they just released new cards, like a $300 graphics card and video did.

747
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,300
And now the stores are just like, fuck it, we're going to scalp it.

748
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,460
So the stores are listing them at $600.

749
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,140
I just cut out the middle man.

750
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,340
Like this, the retailer.

751
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,820
So now selling them for double the cost of what they're supposed to be.

752
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,780
And it's just like the nightmare is never going to end.

753
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,340
And it's like, I just want a PS5 and they're still not in stock and they won't be until next year.

754
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,980
That sucks so bad.

755
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,940
No, you know what the worst thing is?

756
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,900
You know what the worst thing is?

757
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,340
I had a 30, 60 TI in my house.

758
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,300
I bought one.

759
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,180
I paid $200 more than I should have for it.

760
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,860
And it was broken.

761
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,540
I had to send it back.

762
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,860
The one card I could actually get was defective and I had to return it.

763
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,940
And New Eggs specifically was like, we don't have a return policy on this.

764
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,860
You have to get it replaced.

765
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,500
I'm like, good.

766
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,460
I want it replaced.

767
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,500
And they're like, we don't have any stock.

768
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,220
Where does she find you?

769
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,220
I'm like, fuck, it's gone.

770
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,700
And now I'm not going to be able to get one until next year.

771
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,580
It's truly a nightmare.

772
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,060
It sucks.

773
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,540
How can anybody be letting this happen?

774
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,940
Like so many people are involved in computers.

775
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,900
Well, how do you stop it?

776
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,860
Well, how do you stop it?

777
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,820
I mean, increase the supply, I guess.

778
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:47,220
But the scalping thing is like, you take all of the stuff away from the hands of the consumers.

779
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,300
Yeah, you would think that market forces would increase supply in exchange.

780
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,420
Like this obviously represents a surplus of demand.

781
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,780
Well, the problem, I guess, right now is because of COVID and shit.

782
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,420
And because there's only like all these all these fucking companies use one company to do all their

783
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:08,340
manufacturing TSMC does like all the manufacturing for AMD, all the manufacturing for Apple,

784
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:14,100
you know, like even even like, I think even Intel now, they usually do their manufacturing

785
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,420
in-house, but they're starting to move to TSMC as well.

786
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,580
So like they're just like slammed and there's just too much demand and there's not enough supply.

787
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,580
And it's just bad.

788
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,700
It's really fucking bad.

789
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:30,980
That one guy who like he had like 500 PS5s or whatever, he was going to scalp them for

790
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,500
higher price and then he got robbed.

791
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,260
I remember that.

792
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,060
It's pretty funny.

793
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:35,940
That was based.

794
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,740
It was pretty based.

795
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,620
There was like a thing for a while back in like I think December.

796
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:45,060
I don't know whether I like the idea that like this situation should be happening at all.

797
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:45,700
No, it should.

798
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:50,820
Scalping PS5s doesn't bother me as much as like people that were scalping like toilet paper

799
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,820
and hand sanitizer because those are like those are like necessities.

800
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,620
Yeah.

801
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:00,740
Yeah, but like still, I mean still fuck scalpers, but like, you know, not as much.

802
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,020
I'm more insulted that stores are just scalping now.

803
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,140
I'm just like, yeah, it sucks.

804
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,180
It's super gross.

805
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:16,580
I just like this is a serious problem because like if people need stuff and there's just some

806
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:21,540
like a very small minority of people who have all of the things from the stores,

807
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,300
then the stores are just what they're going to.

808
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,420
This can't be sustainable.

809
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,020
I mean, Nvidia is now selling like five year old graphics cards again,

810
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,620
just to have something to sell.

811
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,220
And those are selling for way more than they cost when they first came out

812
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,180
because the demand is just there and people are just buying whatever is there.

813
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:40,980
It's really dumb.

814
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,540
But I don't know.

815
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,020
I guess I guess cap free markets.

816
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,980
Like if they'll pay for it, let them buy it.

817
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:49,940
Question mark.

818
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,180
Like I bought my old ass graphics card like three years ago for like $180.

819
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,220
It's selling for like 400 plus used right now.

820
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,820
Hey, I got good news though.

821
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,420
Bitcoin, Bitcoin's up to 45.

822
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,100
Oh God, fuck you.

823
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,940
Holy shit.

824
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,540
That rose a whole five hundo.

825
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,100
1.28% according to Robinhood.

826
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:12,660
It's up.

827
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,220
Very nice.

828
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,380
Oh yeah, I can see it.

829
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,220
It's interesting how like all crypto moves at the same time.

830
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,220
Like I'm looking at Dogecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin and like the trends are all identical.

831
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,460
Like the market moves together for the most part.

832
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,180
It's very strange.

833
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,660
Seems to you.

834
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,460
Too large.

835
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,980
Dogecoin is still just kind of, how is it?

836
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,940
It's fucking around.

837
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,180
It's just kind of tipping off for a while.

838
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,540
Yeah, it's just kind of hanging out.

839
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,780
My investment in Dogecoin was pretty good.

840
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,100
I'm up 100% on Dogecoin still.

841
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,460
I invested a little too late.

842
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,140
I have, what do I have?

843
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,140
Like 600 Dogecoin or something?

844
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,260
I have 5,597 Dogecoin currently.

845
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,340
I mean, I would say I wouldn't expect it, but you know,

846
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,660
that's coming from the guy who sold his GameStop.

847
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,700
So what the fuck do I know?

848
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,180
Did you, someone was telling me,

849
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,980
I don't remember if I mentioned this last time on the podcast,

850
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,620
how Elon Musk wants saying like,

851
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,620
Oh, I want to send Dogecoin to the moon.

852
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,180
I want to invest in it big time,

853
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:23,780
but it's really kind of not cool that a small amount of people own almost all the Dogecoins.

854
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,100
So you got to sell off your Dogecoin first, then I'll invest.

855
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,940
And it's like, says the richest man in the world.

856
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,580
Like what are you talking about?

857
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,540
What a fucking dick.

858
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,180
I hate him.

859
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,540
I hate him so much.

860
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,220
I only heard that second hand, so it could be completely full of shit.

861
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,900
I will believe literally anything you tell me about Elon.

862
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,060
There's nothing that I would put past him.

863
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,860
He's a good guy.

864
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,380
You're right.

865
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,820
There's a fucking thing that Ben won't believe.

866
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,780
Yeah, I think I saw those tweets.

867
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,900
He was just, I didn't, maybe I didn't comprehend it correctly,

868
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,700
but the gist I was getting was like,

869
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,500
he was hyping up Dogecoin like,

870
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,340
Hey Dogecoin, and everyone was like,

871
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,700
Oh yeah, Dogecoin, then it went up.

872
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,820
Wait, so he's saying sell your Bitcoin so he can make it.

873
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:07,940
Sell your Dogecoin.

874
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,500
What?

875
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,700
Yeah, so we can make it go up.

876
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:09,940
Why?

877
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,020
I don't know what that was.

878
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,980
I think that narrative is that it's supposed to be like the people's crypto

879
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,100
because it's so inexpensive to get into as opposed to something like Bitcoin.

880
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,740
But if you heard that, why would you then sell it?

881
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,780
I don't know.

882
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,620
He's saying he's going to make it go up.

883
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,100
I don't.

884
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:24,740
So sell it?

885
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,380
Like no.

886
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:31,060
I interpret it as him like super transparently just trying to make money

887
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:34,740
of the people who he knows he can influence to make something go up.

888
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,580
That's what I figured.

889
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,980
It seemed like if selling it, because if you sell,

890
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,740
if all the people who hold Bitcoin sell, the price will go down,

891
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,660
then he can buy it all up and get rich.

892
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,580
Yeah, I swear to God with what I remember seeing.

893
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,060
But I don't know.

894
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,420
I'm making things up.

895
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:52,820
I don't know.

896
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,460
It could be totally wrong.

897
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:59,780
When I encounter an Elon guy on the internet,

898
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:05,620
and once in a while I find them and they are, they're just Vincent,

899
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,060
and it makes me so mad.

900
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,740
I'm so angry every time I talk to one.

901
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,940
Like they're not human.

902
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,820
They're subhuman.

903
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,620
They're monsters.

904
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,300
They're demons.

905
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,740
I think they're the worst.

906
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,980
If it's the next issue, the vapor is going to be all about

907
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,780
Vincent investing in crypto.

908
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,700
I kind of thought that like, you know,

909
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,380
maybe Vincent would be an Elon guy.

910
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:25,780
I don't know.

911
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,460
Maybe there's a story there at some point.

912
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:28,820
I don't know.

913
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:33,700
No.

914
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,420
No, thank you.

915
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:35,700
Love it.

916
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:40,900
What else?

917
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,380
What else?

918
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:43,940
Okay.

919
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:44,980
Okay.

920
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,580
I guess now's a good time as any.

921
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:52,580
I want to talk about yesterday in the Radcon.

922
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:59,140
Yesterday in the Radcon of Discord server.

923
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,660
Last week to everybody listening.

924
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,780
Because it's last week.

925
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,780
This would have been a week in some ago.

926
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,500
Yeah.

927
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,140
This was a Saturday.

928
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,860
So we had been talking to Trixie about the Brony lecture.

929
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,820
And without going into too much detail,

930
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:22,660
Trixie adamantly would not said no,

931
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,060
she will not release the Brony lecture as it is.

932
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:29,620
Not only that, she will not allow the raw footage to be seen

933
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,260
even by backers.

934
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,820
And we said backers should maybe see it

935
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,740
because it's like behind the scenes footage.

936
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,340
And that's kind of it's rad content.

937
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,060
And she said no, no, I won't do it.

938
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,660
And she made a number of statements in the Discord server,

939
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,180
which made me very upset.

940
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:56,020
And I in which I want to disavow specifically

941
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,780
as not representative of the PCP ethos.

942
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,660
And here are some of those.

943
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,420
Oh, you have them prepared.

944
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,620
I have them prepared.

945
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,580
Oh, God, all right.

946
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:11,380
One, I'm trying to do a Trixie voice.

947
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,500
And you won't tell me what to do

948
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:18,740
because I don't respect you on the basis of having given me money.

949
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,500
I think that's disgusting, reprehensible human behavior.

950
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,500
I believe, I respect you a lot if you give me money.

951
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,860
Let's see here.

952
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,500
A backer says, we were invested and we trusted you.

953
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,380
Trixie responds, yeah, well, guess what?

954
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,940
I can't afford to make good on your investment.

955
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,620
The fact you made a faulty investment

956
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,300
doesn't fund me to pay for it.

957
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,220
I would disavow that.

958
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,300
You giving me money to do something does fund me to do the thing.

959
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,700
I said, this is just kind of a big middle finger

960
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,900
to all our supporters.

961
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,260
Trixie said, if this is how they act, then yes,

962
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,860
I am giving them the finger.

963
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:02,900
I don't have to respect people just because they gave me money,

964
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,940
to which I would say I do respect you if you give me money.

965
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,460
There's a lot of that sentiment.

966
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,300
There was a lot of that sentiment going around

967
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,220
that like, fuck you if you give me money.

968
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,940
I just want to say, no, please, please give me money.

969
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,580
Fucking aside, please.

970
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:24,580
The general consensus here, I believe,

971
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,100
is that we don't really stand by anything

972
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,060
that was said in the heat of the moment yesterday.

973
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,780
No, it was a shit show.

974
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,740
It was a real shit show.

975
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,540
It was not good.

976
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,420
It was bad and then I went to go play D&D

977
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,620
and then I came back and I realized

978
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,820
for like the four hours I was there,

979
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,340
it was still going on and got worse.

980
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,380
I'm like, oh my god.

981
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,860
I kind of saw it going on and I did,

982
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,140
but I didn't say anything until someone like added me

983
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,940
about something in the conversation

984
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,660
and then I felt obliged to enter into it and I did

985
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:03,860
and I got very upset and I said some things

986
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,660
that I don't apologize for, Lamal.

987
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,260
I mean, I think it goes without saying

988
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,420
that everybody here wants to get everything

989
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,260
that was promised from Radcon delivered

990
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,740
in a timely fashion as best to our abilities.

991
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,900
Unfortunately, the Brony Lecture may be trapped

992
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,340
in a way that we can't access,

993
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,380
but everything within our power will be released

994
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,300
in A's timely fashion as possible.

995
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:39,140
Yeah, I mean, you made the Kickstarter update post today.

996
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,980
Yes, and I have breaking news

997
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,900
that the animated OP is done.

998
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,260
So the OVA can get finished.

999
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,580
Literally like an hour after I posted the update

1000
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,740
when I said, because you had just said that's right.

1001
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,340
It'd be like a month and change and like literally an hour later.

1002
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,380
You said they said before, like maybe end of February

1003
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,660
and yeah, it's the last day of February and here it is.

1004
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,100
So good on them.

1005
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,220
Yeah, but now we've got a-

1006
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,100
It looks pretty cool.

1007
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,620
It looks pretty cool.

1008
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,380
It looks good.

1009
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,700
I mean, it looks better than I think it's-

1010
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,460
Better than it has any right to be.

1011
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,060
Yeah, yeah, for real.

1012
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,420
I'm excited for people to see that.

1013
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,540
I'm not sure if there's anything we need to release before

1014
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,180
that comes out like the Brad Lecture.

1015
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:32,580
I think-

1016
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,100
We'll have to double check the order,

1017
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:40,020
but I think the OVA was like in terms of the editing things.

1018
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,700
That was like the biggest roadblock

1019
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,380
because that was something we couldn't do ourselves.

1020
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,220
But like the OVA and the Brad Lecture

1021
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,420
and even the music video for the diss track

1022
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,340
are all, we can do all those directly.

1023
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:50,900
So hopefully-

1024
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,620
I think, wait a minute.

1025
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,940
I think that the OVA isn't like canonically,

1026
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,620
doesn't the OVA immediately follow the Brad Lecture, right?

1027
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,140
I believe so.

1028
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,220
Oh, wait, the Brad-

1029
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,020
It's been a year.

1030
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:16,580
No, no, it's the music video for the diss track

1031
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,180
that follows the Brad Lecture.

1032
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,980
Yeah, it's the Brad Lecture, then the diss track,

1033
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,820
and then the OVA after.

1034
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,140
The OVA is the story of what happens

1035
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,500
when we go on summer break from the lectures, which is school.

1036
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,060
That is true.

1037
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,900
Wait, yeah, but the last lecture was the Brad Lecture.

1038
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,260
Okay, then is that, I don't know.

1039
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:42,020
Yeah, I haven't looked at the footage in a long time.

1040
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,740
I mean, me either.

1041
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:44,740
I haven't looked at it at all.

1042
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,020
I just lived it.

1043
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,500
No, you don't want to look.

1044
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,900
It really does feel like a fever dream.

1045
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,060
I mean, that was-

1046
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,580
It can't possibly have happened.

1047
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:00,660
It's strange to think that the last thing we did in a pre-COVID world

1048
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,420
was fucking RatCon 4.

1049
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,140
I'm convinced it caused COVID.

1050
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,740
Yeah, I mean, we used COVID's name in vain quite a few times

1051
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,260
and summoned its wrath.

1052
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,220
We upset it.

1053
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,540
We didn't think it was real.

1054
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,540
We thought it was just a joke.

1055
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,780
I don't want to say anymore to spoil it.

1056
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,980
But I think it has only gotten funnier in hindsight,

1057
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,300
in my opinion.

1058
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,300
Unfortunately, we are the reason people are dying

1059
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,340
in more ways than one.

1060
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,340
No, well, maybe.

1061
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,580
No.

1062
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:41,620
No, no.

1063
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,460
Rat COVID-19.

1064
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:43,780
Yeah.

1065
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,180
Rat.

1066
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:52,260
What you said, you hit the nail on the head.

1067
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,860
What a joy.

1068
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:56,980
You know, I'm so excited.

1069
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,500
I'm so excited for it to come out.

1070
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,980
I really do think it's even funnier a year later.

1071
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,300
I really do.

1072
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,820
Yeah, the joke's old and nobody cares anymore.

1073
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,740
And that just makes it better.

1074
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:17,060
Honestly, I mean, it shouldn't have taken so long.

1075
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:21,300
But I kind of, with the COVID and everything involved

1076
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:26,180
in between in 2020, it's a little understandable

1077
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,980
that it took so long for all this stuff to get

1078
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,540
to this point was really done.

1079
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,300
I think when people see the OP,

1080
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:36,340
they will understand why it took this long.

1081
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:40,020
Yeah, I mean, it was a double whammy of adding

1082
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,700
so much stuff at the 11th hour that's

1083
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,940
beyond the scope of what we usually do for these

1084
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,540
and COVID being a thing.

1085
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,100
That's true.

1086
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:50,420
So, you know, we're still making it happen,

1087
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:50,660
though.

1088
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,260
Progress is being made.

1089
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,700
We have not abandoned anything.

1090
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,220
So, stay tuned, my dudes.

1091
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,180
Yes, yes, yes.

1092
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,380
You heard it here first, folks.

1093
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,580
Ben's done with Noida.

1094
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:08,100
That means CWC 102 any day now, I'm sure.

1095
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,940
We respect you for giving us money.

1096
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,980
No statements to the contrary apply

1097
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,820
or are officially acknowledged in any PCP context.

1098
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,780
I mean, unironically, it's really humbling to think,

1099
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,940
like, oh my God, that was a lot of fucking money.

1100
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,140
Yeah, no, it was so crazy.

1101
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,500
It's crazy.

1102
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,060
I couldn't believe that it was still going out.

1103
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,740
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1104
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:35,860
Like, that livestream was-

1105
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:39,220
There's a huge, like, humbling and responsibility

1106
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,220
to make sure that this stuff is done

1107
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,500
to the best of our abilities.

1108
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,700
So, for sure.

1109
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,980
I mean, I mean, I don't know.

1110
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,380
I think it's, I think we've hit a point where,

1111
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,260
I mean, there's probably a lot of people,

1112
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,260
honestly, a lot of people that probably, like,

1113
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,820
haven't even kept up with the PCP since then.

1114
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:04,260
And I think a lot of people might just not expect

1115
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,820
of it to come out anymore.

1116
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:08,580
And I feel like when it does come out,

1117
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,900
and there's like, oh my God, there is actual content.

1118
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,260
It was produced.

1119
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,540
It does exist.

1120
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:16,100
I think people will be shocked.

1121
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,380
And I think we've hit a point where now it will feel

1122
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:22,420
like it's just free, like they had already given up on it,

1123
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,620
but now it does exist.

1124
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,140
And it's like, oh, this is just free.

1125
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,460
I expected nothing at this point, but now I've got this.

1126
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,700
Yeah, the Kickstarter backers,

1127
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,020
they backed the crypto, the PCPenny,

1128
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,540
and it crashed immediately.

1129
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,140
It's been low the entire time.

1130
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,980
But now, now it's going to surge.

1131
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,260
It's going to go right to the moon.

1132
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,580
Just like, good ol' XRP.

1133
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,940
It's time to go to patreon.com.

1134
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:45,380
That's the procrastinators and invest in the PCPenny.

1135
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:48,420
You will not be able to exchange it for USD.

1136
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,380
You won't need USD soon.

1137
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,380
When the entire American economy crashes,

1138
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:54,740
you're going to be happy that your assets

1139
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,740
are locked and safe in PCPenny's.

1140
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,020
It's a great hedge against inflation.

1141
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:01,860
The People's Currency.

1142
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,020
That's what the PC stands for, the People's Currency Penny.

1143
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:07,220
People's Currency Penny.

1144
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,420
It's the People's Currency Penny, Penny,

1145
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,220
because it's a...

1146
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,500
Wait, no, it's PCPenny.

1147
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,700
No, I'm sorry.

1148
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,220
It's not the PCPenny.

1149
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,740
Yeah, you got it.

1150
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:17,380
You got it.

1151
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:21,060
Do we want to go to voicemail?

1152
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,100
Is it too early for that?

1153
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,780
I mean, we'll be going for like an hour.

1154
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:25,060
Yeah, we'll be going for an hour.

1155
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:26,900
Hmm.

1156
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,740
Do I have anything else to say?

1157
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:32,020
I could read more shitty stuff that Trixie said.

1158
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:35,380
I mean, I've got more screenshots of shit that made me mad.

1159
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,740
I feel like we've made our point.

1160
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,060
As much as it was like a shit show.

1161
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,820
Oh, but there's some good stuff here, though.

1162
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:43,460
Oh, but there's some real infuriating shit here, though.

1163
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:44,900
I mean, it's all in the chat

1164
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,740
if anybody really wants to dig into it.

1165
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,700
Well, only Kickstarter backers are in that chat.

1166
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,500
So, like, we're broadcasting it to a large audience.

1167
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,780
I guess I just assumed everybody

1168
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:56,340
who's listening to it at this point is a Kickstarter backer.

1169
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:00,740
Somebody said, like, this is the content we paid for.

1170
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,460
And you know what?

1171
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:06,020
If they feel that way, then I condone that.

1172
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:08,260
Enjoy it.

1173
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,140
Lol.

1174
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,020
Okay, all right.

1175
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,180
Pulling victory from the jaws of defeat.

1176
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,140
I like that attitude.

1177
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:18,500
That's, yeah, that's really making lemonade, you know?

1178
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:19,620
It's true.

1179
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,500
Yeah.

1180
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,580
Like that girl with brain cancer.

1181
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:24,980
Uh...

1182
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:25,780
See that?

1183
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,500
There was a...

1184
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,380
I don't know if it was in Brain Can.

1185
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:30,500
There was some feel-good story going around Twitter

1186
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,340
about, like, this girl needs, like, multiple brain surgeries

1187
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,180
because she's got, like, horrible seizures

1188
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,020
that are going to kill her if she doesn't get them.

1189
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:41,140
So, she's selling lemonade to pay for the operation.

1190
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,980
What a heartwarming story.

1191
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:43,700
Wait, what?

1192
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,580
Yeah, this was, like, all over this week.

1193
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:47,940
This week?

1194
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,020
Yeah, brain surgery, back lemonade.

1195
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,620
Is terrifying.

1196
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,380
Alabama girl, seven years old, selling lemonade

1197
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,300
to help pay for her brain surgery.

1198
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,820
Holy shit.

1199
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,340
Liza Scott.

1200
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,460
Yeah, I hope, quote, I hope I make it.

1201
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,780
Yup, me too.

1202
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:10,660
Fuck yeah.

1203
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,140
You can't see it, but I'm, like, I'm making a very shot.

1204
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,420
USA.

1205
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,620
USA.

1206
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,500
USA.

1207
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:18,420
Fucking epic.

1208
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,020
US game.

1209
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,460
I can see it on, like, ABC.

1210
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,860
Like, heartwarming, you know, and then the title

1211
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,500
of the article.

1212
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,260
That's what you call picking yourself up by your bootstraps.

1213
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,220
You know what else is heartwarming?

1214
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:35,300
An iron, like, heated, what do you call it?

1215
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:35,780
Swarm.

1216
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:38,020
An iron poker to the heart, like, stab?

1217
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,500
Like, it's heartwarming.

1218
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,700
Okay, that was, I failed the time.

1219
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:42,180
No, I got it.

1220
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I get it.

1221
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,500
No, it was good.

1222
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:45,620
No, no, no, no.

1223
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,340
No, it was funny.

1224
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,220
No, it was just shivering.

1225
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:47,700
Come on, it was funny.

1226
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,180
It was good.

1227
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:48,820
No, you did.

1228
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,780
No, I got it.

1229
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,660
Now I'm going to cry.

1230
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:54,860
I'm gonna cry and it's your fault.

1231
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:55,860
Yes.

1232
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:56,860
Yes.

1233
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,860
Yes.

1234
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:58,860
Um, voicemail?

1235
01:07:58,860 --> 01:07:59,860
We could start.

1236
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:00,860
Yeah.

1237
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,860
Yeah.

1238
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,860
Okay.

1239
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:03,860
Are you ready?

1240
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:04,860
You got them up?

1241
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:05,860
I gotta go get a speed pipe.

1242
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:06,860
Okay.

1243
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,020
It looks like the first one here is called Dag the Food Science Guy Solves Your Gummy

1244
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:16,300
Worm Woes, which I hope to God means he's going to tell me where I can affordably purchase

1245
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,300
some fucking-

1246
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,300
Oh no, I'm not logged in.

1247
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,300
Uh.

1248
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,300
I am you fuck.

1249
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,300
You bitch.

1250
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,300
Yeah, no, it's completely warranted.

1251
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,300
I'm sorry.

1252
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:33,300
Eleazar, put some cool elevator music while I'm trying to get the password again.

1253
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,300
This always makes me chuckle.

1254
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,300
Put in um-

1255
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,300
Please add more storage to your account.

1256
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:44,300
You've used one gigabyte of the 100 megabytes total.

1257
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:48,300
Eleazar, put in the song with me and Gib samples.

1258
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,300
That one.

1259
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,300
Play that.

1260
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,300
That's the waiting song.

1261
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,300
Remember that one?

1262
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,300
Huh?

1263
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:01,300
The one that's like, I don't even remember what we're saying in it.

1264
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,300
Yeah.

1265
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,300
All right, I did it.

1266
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,300
I did it.

1267
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,300
I found it.

1268
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,300
Okay.

1269
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:10,300
Okay, Dag the Food Science Guy Solves Your Gummy Worm Woes in three, two, one, go.

1270
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:16,300
All right, when people are giving advice and they wait until the very end of something

1271
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,300
like this to give the useful bit of information.

1272
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,300
So right up front.

1273
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,300
Oh, you?

1274
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,300
Okay.

1275
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,300
All you need to know is that, Ben, your gummy worms are not coming out consistently because

1276
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,300
you are measuring by volume and not by weight.

1277
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:33,300
Conceptually, it's kind of hard to wrap your head around at first.

1278
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,300
No, it's not hard to wrap my head around.

1279
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,300
I understand the differences.

1280
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,300
Different substances are going to be ground to different levels of fineness.

1281
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,300
I hate you.

1282
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,300
I hate you.

1283
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,300
And so more, the finer it is ground.

1284
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,300
I have a fucking degree in physics.

1285
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,300
I understand the difference between volume and mass.

1286
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,300
Bits.

1287
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,300
To be fair, that is hard to believe.

1288
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,300
Things can affect this.

1289
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,300
Like, if you live in a particularly humid climate.

1290
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,300
No, okay, that's it.

1291
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,300
No more particles.

1292
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,300
No more.

1293
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,300
I get it.

1294
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,300
I get it.

1295
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,300
I know the difference.

1296
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,300
Was I being sloppy?

1297
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,300
Yes.

1298
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,300
We got to be more science.

1299
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:16,300
But if I'm using, okay, if I'm using the same like brand of sugar, say, same brand of sugar,

1300
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:21,300
for instance, and I, and I'm at the same altitude, right?

1301
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:29,300
And I take like a scoop, like a half cup of sugar is not going to radically change you

1302
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:35,300
like one day to the next, like what the mass of that is, you know?

1303
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,300
I don't know.

1304
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,300
Maybe I'm just making excuses.

1305
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,300
Yeah, just put in a measuring bowl, idiot.

1306
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,300
Well, that would be fine.

1307
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:46,300
Not a measuring bowl and a scale.

1308
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:53,300
I do actually have, I did buy, I did buy a new mini scale, not for worms.

1309
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:59,300
Actually, I bought a scale for weighing packages and envelopes so that I would know how much

1310
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:05,300
postage to use for RFCK merch stuff and vapors stuff.

1311
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,300
So I have a scale.

1312
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,300
So, you know what, Dag?

1313
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,300
I'll give it to you.

1314
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,300
You're probably right.

1315
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:14,300
You're probably right that I should be measuring by, by mass.

1316
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,300
Yes.

1317
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,300
Fine.

1318
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,300
Very well.

1319
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,300
Next one is called Origin of Lol Cow.

1320
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:24,300
Three, two, one, go.

1321
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,300
The term Lol Cow actually comes from farming.

1322
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,300
You see, there's this thing called the rape rack or they used to call it that.

1323
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:33,300
Now they're shifting to more PC terminology, but you know, it's the rape rack where once

1324
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,300
a year dairy cows, they're tied to it.

1325
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:39,300
The farmer forcibly impregnates them, shoves their whole arm inside, you know, squeeze

1326
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,300
a little syringe of bull semen.

1327
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,300
And you may think, oh, it's a little harsh to call that rape.

1328
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,300
I mean, like technically, and you're right to say that actually because when it happens,

1329
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,300
the cows go, lol, because they think it's really funny.

1330
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:54,300
That's where the term Lol Cow comes from because cows like it when we rape them over,

1331
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,300
over again every year.

1332
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,300
Wow.

1333
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:00,300
And what's even more funny to them is that once the calf is born, after like three days

1334
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:04,300
or not even, sometimes immediately, we just take the calf away and the mom is like,

1335
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,300
wailing.

1336
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,300
But it's not actually wailing.

1337
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,300
It's that she's laughing really hard because she thinks it's so funny that we do this to

1338
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:15,300
them over and over on an annual basis until they die.

1339
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,300
That's cool.

1340
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,300
Pretty funny.

1341
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,300
Pretty good.

1342
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,300
I'm all on about it.

1343
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:26,300
I'm having a, I'm having a sensible chuckle over here.

1344
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:32,300
The more you know you, I'm looking at this diagram like Googled rape rack.

1345
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,300
I guess it is a thing.

1346
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,300
Why?

1347
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,300
Why would you?

1348
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,300
And this is a diagram of a cow's innards.

1349
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:43,300
That just seems like a dangerous term to search for just in general.

1350
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:48,300
You know you're right, but it's too late and I can't unring this bell.

1351
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,300
Thank you.

1352
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,300
Thank you for posting that in the chat.

1353
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,300
I didn't need to see it, but.

1354
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:57,300
Amazon's already like suggesting you to buy your own.

1355
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,300
My own what?

1356
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,300
Rape rack?

1357
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,300
Yeah.

1358
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,300
Okay.

1359
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:07,300
Well, hmm, you know, I mean, well, I mean, maybe if I make enough Bitcoin, uh, profits

1360
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,300
than, uh, okay.

1361
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,300
Next one is called Ben.

1362
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,300
This is an intervention.

1363
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,300
Your alcoholism is killing you.

1364
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:19,300
Three, two, one, go.

1365
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,300
Ben, this is an intervention.

1366
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,300
Your alcoholism is killing you.

1367
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:26,300
If you die, it won't even be based.

1368
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:32,300
I feel like this is old because I have not been drinking, uh, recently.

1369
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:38,300
Like a few months ago, I was drinking a lot, but mostly this year I have not been.

1370
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,300
So.

1371
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,300
Sounds like, uh, like an alcoholic in denial.

1372
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,300
Ben.

1373
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:46,300
No, no, you gotta, you gotta be lucid to make those like quick trades, uh, for Bitcoin.

1374
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,300
You got, you guy comes in.

1375
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:52,300
He's like, Oh, I haven't been drinking and you're just like, Hmm, this is an alcoholic

1376
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,300
in denial.

1377
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,300
Quit denying it.

1378
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,300
Don't hold them down and pour a beer down a store.

1379
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,300
Accept it.

1380
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,300
Accept your alcoholism.

1381
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,300
Stop denying it.

1382
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:04,300
So you're doing right now.

1383
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,300
Don't accept who you are.

1384
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,300
Exactly what an alcoholic would say.

1385
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,300
Just be the best.

1386
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,300
If I drink in a beer.

1387
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,300
Just be the best alcoholic you can be.

1388
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,300
Uh, next.

1389
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,300
Drink all the alcohol.

1390
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:21,300
Next voicemail is called, I, I was tempted, I was tempted this weekend.

1391
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,300
I was tempted this weekend.

1392
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,300
Want to drink heavily.

1393
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:24,300
Ben, I kept.

1394
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:30,300
Yeah, I was tempted to go get another, another, my, my classic two bottles of barefoot bubbly

1395
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,300
brute cuvée.

1396
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,300
Fucking alcoholic.

1397
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,300
Fucking alcoholic.

1398
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,300
I didn't do it.

1399
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,300
I didn't do it.

1400
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,300
Something distracted me.

1401
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,300
Probably, probably Noida.

1402
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,300
You know what?

1403
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,300
I, I is Noida.

1404
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:44,300
Well, you know, now that I'm over Noida, um, back on the sauce, I'll probably get, I'll

1405
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,300
probably get back on the sauce.

1406
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:49,300
By the way, um, tectonic improv.

1407
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:56,300
Uh, recommended me a video by a discount gum shoe about Noida where he talks about

1408
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,300
it and its themes.

1409
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,300
And I thought it was a good video.

1410
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,300
And so I guess I might as well shout it out.

1411
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:10,300
Um, go, uh, it's, it's called, um, I don't remember what it's called, but it's by discount

1412
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,300
gum shoe.

1413
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:18,300
Uh, I liked it because he was like, lol, good game.

1414
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,300
Sounds good.

1415
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:28,620
No, cause he talked, he taught, he talks about, I mean the, the, the, the, the coolest thing

1416
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,940
about it is he says like, yeah, I was playing the game.

1417
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:31,940
I was trying to win.

1418
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:35,820
I was trying to win, but then it was too hard and I gave up on winning.

1419
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,220
So I just was like, fuck it.

1420
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:41,340
And I didn't go down the main path and I went exploring again and I went like, hmm, what

1421
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,500
if I don't go into the mountain?

1422
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,500
I'll just go left.

1423
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,500
Oh my God.

1424
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,500
What the fuck is over here?

1425
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,500
I'll just go right.

1426
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Oh my God.

1427
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,100
I can go up like, oh my God, there's shit up here.

1428
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,860
Like what the fuck?

1429
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,700
There's so much more to this game than I thought.

1430
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:58,180
Like this, this world is like bigger than I thought it was.

1431
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:02,940
And now like the next time I go and I go down the holy mountain, it's like, I have a completely

1432
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:03,940
new outlook on it.

1433
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:08,620
I, I Google one that is like, uh, discount gum shoe on YouTube and I can't see their

1434
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,620
account.

1435
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:12,620
Is there a way to spell it?

1436
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:14,700
Um, I think it's all one word.

1437
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,340
Oh, maybe that's it.

1438
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,660
Oh, there it is.

1439
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:20,660
Yeah.

1440
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:26,020
It's, it's called, wait, no, I didn't mean to make this like a whole diversion, but

1441
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,020
now I'm, I'm irritated.

1442
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,020
Wait.

1443
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,020
That was a year ago.

1444
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,220
No, it's the author as God.

1445
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:34,220
Yes.

1446
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,220
That's it.

1447
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,220
Um, yeah.

1448
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:37,740
I didn't, he made that video.

1449
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:43,660
It's from like, like early 2020, uh, I guess it's been out for a while.

1450
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:48,700
I see videos sometimes talking about like features and like, yeah, I guess it was like

1451
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:52,660
an early access for a while and I guess it's been out for a bit.

1452
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:58,180
They keep adding stuff, uh, and actually there's more stuff being added now, like on the beta

1453
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:02,900
branch, there's all these new like structures that are being added to old biomes and there's

1454
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,660
like new spells and spell modifiers and stuff.

1455
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:09,620
And there's like new secrets and, uh, it's pretty cool, but I'm not playing the beta

1456
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,620
branch.

1457
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,620
So I haven't really fucked with any of it.

1458
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:18,260
Um, okay, uh, no, no more noise to talk enough, enough.

1459
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:24,820
Um, this next voicemail is called PCP crunch mail three, two, one, go.

1460
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:25,820
Okay.

1461
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:30,540
So I don't know if I'm a bigot, but something about Digi not wanting to be called Digi anymore

1462
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:35,260
and deleting all of her videos makes me like viscerally angry.

1463
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:36,540
Like no, you're dumb.

1464
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,820
Just be called Digi something Digi.

1465
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,820
Nay.

1466
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:40,820
I don't care.

1467
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,820
I'm going to end this voicemail by eating chips.

1468
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:44,820
Nice.

1469
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,820
Very good.

1470
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:55,740
Um, well, the, the, I think the only thing that's bad about the taking down of all the

1471
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:59,420
videos is that she said three weeks and it wasn't three weeks.

1472
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,420
Oh, that's really bad.

1473
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,420
Yeah.

1474
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:03,420
She said that happened.

1475
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,420
Yeah.

1476
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:08,020
She said, she said three weeks and then after like 11 days or something, she just like,

1477
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,020
ah, fuck it.

1478
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,020
She just did it.

1479
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,020
Lol.

1480
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:19,380
Which is like the, you said, you just, you said it like you give people the time.

1481
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:23,300
And then, okay, since, since you bring that up, I got to mention the thing she said in

1482
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:28,060
the radcon server where someone was like, Hey, you said that and you broke your word.

1483
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:35,380
And she said, uh, she said, uh, uh, you should never take anyone at their word.

1484
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,980
Like why didn't you just like, why didn't you just expect me to lie?

1485
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,140
Like what are you stupid?

1486
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,580
Like it's your fault for believing me, idiot.

1487
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,580
Lol.

1488
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,580
Uh, really cool.

1489
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:45,580
Disavow.

1490
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:46,580
Disavow.

1491
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:50,260
It was, it was just like, I don't know, the, the taking down of all the videos because

1492
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:51,860
you don't feel right having them.

1493
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:58,540
I always, I'm always on the side of the person to be able to do that at any time.

1494
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:06,540
There's no, there's no like, um, you know, obligation, moral or legal or anything to keep

1495
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:09,700
yourself broadcasting forever.

1496
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,820
You can just stop and delete it all.

1497
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:16,260
Um, I just disagree with the whole not doing the one thing you said you would do to allow

1498
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,500
people to save the videos they like.

1499
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:25,780
I think, I mean, I think deleting the videos is cringe.

1500
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:29,100
It's not that she can't, it's that I think she must not do it.

1501
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,580
I think it's cringe.

1502
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:33,740
I also think it doesn't make any sense because it's going to cost her a lot of money for

1503
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,300
no gain at all.

1504
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:42,100
Uh, and I mean, that's, those are my thoughts on channel deletion.

1505
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:46,700
We don't know exactly what the gain is in, in like, I don't know, mental state or whatever,

1506
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,300
but you know.

1507
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,300
I suppose.

1508
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,300
Yeah.

1509
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:51,300
Yeah.

1510
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,300
Yeah.

1511
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,300
That made sure whatever.

1512
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:59,540
And I mean, uh, she, uh, I don't, I mean, I disagree that she doesn't have to keep going

1513
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,940
by Digi if she doesn't want to.

1514
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:05,300
You know, if she, I mean, I can understand if they're named people change their brand

1515
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,300
all the time.

1516
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,300
Yeah.

1517
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,460
I mean, if like, it's a, it's a brand that's been around for like what, like a decade at

1518
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:11,460
this point.

1519
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:15,940
So of course, like if you've been following, you know, Trixie's content for this entire

1520
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:20,580
time, like it's probably going to be weird to be like, Oh, like, like I'm just mentally

1521
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:25,660
like associating this person with Digi bro, like that's just just, that's just ingrained

1522
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:26,660
in my head.

1523
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:31,060
But like, that's not too hard to get over, um, you know, like we've been saying Trixie

1524
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:37,300
this whole time and like we've known them for like 10 years, like literally talk pretty

1525
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,300
frequently.

1526
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,060
So, um, but I don't know.

1527
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:45,700
I mean, in terms of like deleting the videos and stuff, like that's obviously, you know,

1528
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,900
her prerogative, do whatever you want with your content.

1529
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:52,980
I think it was probably not a great call to delete it early.

1530
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:57,780
And I'm also not really sure why, like a lot of people were saying, like in the comments

1531
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:00,340
of that video, why not just start a new channel?

1532
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,620
That's what I would have done.

1533
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:06,700
And I don't understand the, I don't, because you just want to keep that sub number around.

1534
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,700
Yeah.

1535
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,700
Okay.

1536
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,700
Sure.

1537
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:16,380
I understand that, but it's like, okay, I want to shed my old audience and get a new

1538
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:17,380
audience.

1539
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:21,100
It's like, well, then what is more sensible audience that you are?

1540
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:25,580
Cause like the only thing you're doing is inviting, inviting, you know, people to like

1541
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,140
react badly to the new content.

1542
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,740
Whereas we have a new platform from scratch.

1543
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:29,740
You're starting fresh.

1544
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:30,860
Yeah.

1545
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:34,980
That's literally saying I want the old people to see the new content by putting it here

1546
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:35,980
where they are.

1547
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:40,400
Maybe there's something I'm missing, but it seems like it seems we're going against

1548
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,900
the stated goal.

1549
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:46,500
But like, I mean, it's nice that 300 K numbers really comfy and you don't want to let it

1550
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,500
go.

1551
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,500
So I get that.

1552
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,500
Sure.

1553
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,500
Sure.

1554
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,220
But functionally at this point, it probably doesn't mean much, you know?

1555
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:58,260
I mean, practically, if I were just trying to, if I were in that situation and I were

1556
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,220
just like, okay, I don't want to be Digi bro anymore.

1557
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:02,460
I don't want to be Digi anymore.

1558
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,740
I want to rebrand.

1559
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:08,420
And I also don't want to be fucked.

1560
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:14,900
What I would do is leave that channel, could just, just continue to accrue, you know, ad

1561
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:19,940
revenue from views on that old channel and start a new channel and just like leave it

1562
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:20,940
there.

1563
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,180
Like, yeah, that's Digi content.

1564
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,180
That's what it was.

1565
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,460
I'm not Digi anymore.

1566
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:26,300
I'm over here doing this thing.

1567
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:30,060
But like that stuff is still benefiting me.

1568
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:34,660
I mean, even if like you're uncomfortable, like with like that, you know, phaser life

1569
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:38,660
being active on the internet, like you can, you can private all that still, but like I

1570
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:42,580
would still start a new channel as opposed to like trying to keep that one going at this

1571
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,580
point.

1572
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:50,820
I gotta say, I agree, but it's hard to get that being said, hope it works out.

1573
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:56,100
Like I think maybe it was like, oh, in order to get a monetization on a new channel, you

1574
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:00,660
have to get a certain amount of views and over a certain time and it was just easier

1575
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,980
to use a currently existing channel.

1576
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,620
So I don't know.

1577
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:11,020
She could get, she could get thousands of views, which is what she's getting on her void

1578
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,860
gazer stuff on the old channel.

1579
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:17,420
She could get thousands of views on any new channel she made just by tweeting about it,

1580
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:22,340
just by like saying or making a video on the old channel saying, I'm here now.

1581
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:25,980
Like I don't know that audience, that core audience that will watch that will follow

1582
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:29,820
her to any new place she goes, it is there.

1583
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:33,220
So I forget the point I was making.

1584
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,220
It doesn't matter.

1585
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:36,220
Is it?

1586
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,220
Yeah.

1587
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:38,220
Yeah.

1588
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:39,780
Whatever.

1589
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,780
Was there anything else about that voicemail?

1590
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:44,540
No, I think we said it all.

1591
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,900
I'm glad you enjoyed your chips.

1592
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,940
I'm like he was enjoying those chips at the end.

1593
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:52,220
So I got some, I got some chips today.

1594
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,740
I got some Parmesan crisps.

1595
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:57,100
Oh, I had some of those literally earlier today.

1596
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,100
Are you keto?

1597
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,620
I'm back on keto.

1598
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:00,620
Yeah.

1599
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:01,620
Nice.

1600
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,620
I got.

1601
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,620
Okay.

1602
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,700
Last time I ordered from Costco, I got some stuff that I'd never had before and it was

1603
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,700
really good.

1604
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,700
It was called moon cheese.

1605
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,700
Do you know what that is?

1606
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,580
No, I've never heard of that.

1607
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:15,660
It's literally just like freeze dried cheese, but it's not cold.

1608
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:19,380
You know, it's room temperature, but it's like dried into these sort of little like

1609
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:23,660
puff like balls, but it's just cheese that's been sort of like flash frozen into these

1610
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:27,940
little like crunchy pieces and you just eat it and it's good.

1611
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,940
But then they were out.

1612
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,260
I tried to order some again and they were out.

1613
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:33,060
So instead I got these Parmesan crisps and they're pretty good too.

1614
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,060
They're good.

1615
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:41,740
The next voicemail is called bane will find him three, two, one, go.

1616
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:48,780
You're probably wondering who would come in a man before throwing him out of a plane.

1617
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,100
That would be the league, of course.

1618
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,100
Oh, no.

1619
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,100
No.

1620
01:24:54,100 --> 01:25:02,260
No matter who we are, really, what matters is our plan, our plan to fuck Nate.

1621
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:14,740
You see, once I find him, it will be very painful for Nate.

1622
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:20,460
These guys are always talking about their plans to fuck Nate and they haven't done

1623
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:21,460
it yet.

1624
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,460
They haven't even approached him.

1625
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:26,380
Are these guys just at the league of incels like Nate incels?

1626
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:28,700
Where's their game?

1627
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,700
You know?

1628
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:30,700
Where's their result?

1629
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,900
If they want to threaten Nate, shouldn't they be like messaging content?

1630
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,100
Nate's not around these parts anymore.

1631
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:43,220
We've been sending them over in like paper or plain form.

1632
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:44,220
I don't know.

1633
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:47,900
I'm wondering now if maybe it is, maybe it's all just a bunch of empty posturing.

1634
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:51,140
At some point, you have to put up or shut up.

1635
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:55,020
After a while, if Nate remains unfucked, I have to question your dedication.

1636
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:59,980
There's a whole league behind this and he's just too, like, too.

1637
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:00,780
What's the word?

1638
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,180
He's unfuck, he's unfuckable.

1639
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:02,780
He's unfuckable.

1640
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:08,180
He's like the Chastity Belt, like is like like 10 psych locks.

1641
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:12,420
Nobody knows that reference.

1642
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,180
I don't.

1643
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:14,740
Damn.

1644
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:17,780
People in the comments say, say, lol, if you, if you lulled.

1645
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:19,940
Do you want to?

1646
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:21,220
What is it?

1647
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:21,820
It's Phoenix, right?

1648
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:22,820
Psych locks?

1649
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:23,620
Phoenix, right?

1650
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,900
OK, like a personalized, then the psych locks.

1651
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,100
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, I remember.

1652
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,100
I remember.

1653
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:37,460
We got to grab, we got to grab one of my thirty five cans of Coke Zero that I got

1654
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:38,940
from Costco today.

1655
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:40,940
This is number.

1656
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,700
Oh, God, I'm on five already.

1657
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:44,300
Hmm.

1658
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,940
Yikes, Coke Zero.

1659
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:47,700
Ben still does have a drinking problem.

1660
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,540
It's just not alcohol anymore.

1661
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:51,340
Glad we cleared that up.

1662
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:52,380
Absolutely.

1663
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,140
He just loves those liquids.

1664
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:54,900
You can't get enough.

1665
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,020
Oh, I bought.

1666
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,740
I bought some.

1667
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:04,060
I keep going on these keto tangents, but I ordered some like non-sugar candy from

1668
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,980
a brand called Behave.

1669
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:10,260
I ordered like a box of them and didn't like them.

1670
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,820
Smart sweets are better, I think.

1671
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:15,940
So Behave is like, it's fine, like it's OK.

1672
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:21,300
I try not to buy any specifically keto branded product because they're always way

1673
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,540
too expensive.

1674
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:23,980
Well, these are not called keto.

1675
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:27,100
They're just low, low sugar.

1676
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:29,980
But I mean, they are overpriced for what they are.

1677
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:35,460
Yeah, it was it was literally it was like $48 for like twelve bags of the stuff.

1678
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:37,700
Oh, my God.

1679
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:41,100
It's like, have you seen the ads for that like keto cereal that's like seven

1680
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,460
dollars for a tiny box?

1681
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:44,940
And I'm just like, how dare you to sell my intelligence?

1682
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:45,940
I haven't seen those.

1683
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:50,620
And all I can think is like boxes of cereal are so small to begin with.

1684
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:55,260
Right, like I in the past I have bought a little box like you can buy the big

1685
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:58,940
like family sized ones, but if you just buy like a normal box of cereal,

1686
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:02,980
like the meat, the normal size, that's like three bowls for me.

1687
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,940
It really is. Yeah, it's not much.

1688
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:07,860
And I'm sure that these fucking keto cereals are even less.

1689
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:13,260
So I can only imagine like spreading that across like two breakfasts.

1690
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,740
It's probably like two bowls at best.

1691
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,060
Yeah, yeah.

1692
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,900
Uh, the next bowl.

1693
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:24,060
This is this capitalism, am I right?

1694
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:25,620
Yeah, fuck them.

1695
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:30,900
Next voicemail is called Jenkins jinkies three, two, one, go.

1696
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:36,940
Shekels for heckles when asking for a friend.

1697
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:41,140
Oh, we haven't done one in like three weeks or something.

1698
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:44,220
I'm so busy.

1699
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:49,780
Oh, I mean, I can I can always do one, but I haven't been thinking about it.

1700
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:52,580
I haven't been thinking about it.

1701
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,260
I think I said this last time.

1702
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:55,220
How did you play so much?

1703
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:57,380
Noida and not Shekels for heckles it at all.

1704
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:59,420
You know, you know what?

1705
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:00,020
You know what?

1706
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:02,540
I would love to do a Noida Shekels for heckles.

1707
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:04,220
That would be fun and cool.

1708
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,380
Let's do we want to do that maybe this week?

1709
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:09,460
I don't have the game, so I'll just be sitting in the cool watching.

1710
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:11,740
But yeah, I can I can stream it.

1711
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:13,380
Yeah, I mean, it's a single player game.

1712
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:17,580
Uh, if we want maybe if we want to do it this.

1713
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:25,460
Should wait, we should say let's say that we'll do it the week after this comes out.

1714
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,300
All right. Sure.

1715
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:31,820
So we want to say like the the Wednesday after this episode airs,

1716
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:34,340
we will do a Noida Shekels for heckles.

1717
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:35,460
I can I can.

1718
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,380
So the 10th, March 10th.

1719
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:41,660
Yes, March 10th.

1720
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:45,500
Noida Shekels, baby.

1721
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:47,900
That's so far in the future.

1722
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:50,940
Ha, ha, I'm going to sneak up on you.

1723
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:54,140
No, no, no, never forget, never.

1724
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:55,340
I can never forget Noida.

1725
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,300
By then, I'll be a God.

1726
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,340
I'll be such a guy.

1727
01:29:58,340 --> 01:29:59,820
Wait, I got to tell you about this one.

1728
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,940
I got to tell you about this one I found.

1729
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:04,020
Got to save it for the stream.

1730
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:08,420
No, OK, I will probably rave about this.

1731
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:10,940
This was like this was an incredible early game find.

1732
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,260
And I still lost.

1733
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:17,540
Well, next voicemail is called Blingus Keningus.

1734
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,580
Three, two, one, go.

1735
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:22,980
Konichiwa.

1736
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,420
During last week's episode, it seems our friend

1737
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:29,340
Kringus Bingus was facing a bit of an existential struggle.

1738
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:31,620
Ganbare, Kringus Bingus.

1739
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:32,540
Yeah.

1740
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:34,860
Questions you pondered once stuck out to me.

1741
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:39,420
What do Martin Lawrence and Sonic the Hedgehog have in common?

1742
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:43,860
Well, Fred, no more for this is one predicament I can lay to rest.

1743
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:48,700
What Martin Lawrence and Sonic the Hedgehog have in common

1744
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:53,140
is that they have both starred in a feature titled The Black Knight.

1745
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:58,220
Anyway, pledge to my Patreon at Patreon dot com slash PC Minecraft

1746
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:01,220
and follow me on Twitter at Procrastinator's Minecraft.

1747
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,940
Until next time.

1748
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:04,860
Say, oh, no.

1749
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,820
Oh, no.

1750
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:11,060
Nala, what was he saying?

1751
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,100
I don't know.

1752
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,300
I guess they were both in Black Knight.

1753
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:18,620
He said Martin Lawrence, but I pictured Lawrence Fishburne,

1754
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:22,700
who is basically similar, essentially.

1755
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:30,340
PC Minecraft, guys, I don't want to alarm you.

1756
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,900
OK, forty five, forty five, three fifty five.

1757
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,180
We're up another three hundo.

1758
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,300
We're up another three hundo, baby.

1759
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,340
Wait, huh? What?

1760
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:43,420
Bitcoin, Bitcoin.

1761
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,580
Sorry, I'm not glued to the Bitcoin screen.

1762
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,220
I'm glued.

1763
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:50,620
Thirty thirty five, thirty five.

1764
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:51,780
Look, look at this.

1765
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,300
Look at this.

1766
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,300
Oh, yeah.

1767
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,860
Look, look, look at this.

1768
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:56,460
Look at this.

1769
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,980
Until it's breaking fifty K again, I'm not interested.

1770
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,940
Let me know when it hits fifty K again.

1771
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:04,780
When I'm making a profit again, look, look at that meteoric rise.

1772
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,380
I mean, look at it in the context of the week, though.

1773
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,340
And it's like it's a snow.

1774
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,380
I'm not going to do.

1775
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:13,700
I'm not going to look at it in that context.

1776
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,060
Like you, I choose not to do so.

1777
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:19,140
Even for today, it has fallen so much.

1778
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:22,260
No, shut up, shut up.

1779
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:24,420
Wait, is that true?

1780
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,260
What did it start the day at?

1781
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:28,820
The day it started at fucking.

1782
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:30,780
No, it's about it's about where it started.

1783
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:34,060
It's gone down, but yeah.

1784
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:39,740
Yeah, next voicemail is called Brony lecture correction.

1785
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:43,180
OK, three, two, one, go.

1786
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,660
Just want to clarify the voicemail I said last week

1787
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:49,140
about the releasing the original blown in the lecture.

1788
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:52,660
I didn't mean now and I didn't mean unedited.

1789
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:58,380
What I meant was just don't get rid of or throw away

1790
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:02,460
any of the original footage from what was recorded at Radcott.

1791
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,300
That's all I was referring to,

1792
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:07,580
because it's I'm sure that it's good shit and it's yeah, it is good shit.

1793
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:09,700
We want like that's what everyone wants.

1794
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:12,580
Everyone wants to see it is what everyone the lecture

1795
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:15,420
that was recorded at Radcom with all of you guys there

1796
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,660
listening in on the lecture.

1797
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:17,180
That's what we want.

1798
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:17,820
That's what it means.

1799
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:20,380
Yeah, don't get rid of any of that shit.

1800
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:23,740
Yeah, I'm I'm sorry.

1801
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,140
I don't know what to tell you.

1802
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:28,100
I've even I'm sorry that I can't do anything.

1803
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:30,820
Yeah, I mean, it feels like that battle has been lost.

1804
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:35,220
Digi has not in any way implied that she is getting rid of

1805
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:38,460
the original footage that she she said over and over again.

1806
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:43,740
She's going to no incorporated into a second video with new footage as well.

1807
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,980
Lol, I don't know exactly what that's going to look like.

1808
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:50,540
But you know, well, it won't look like the original,

1809
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:52,580
which is what everyone wants.

1810
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:55,500
I guess I guess the and also it will never happen.

1811
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,460
Lamar, it's confusing how it's like all the original footage

1812
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:03,300
is going to be in this new version, but you can't see the original footage.

1813
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,340
It's like it's it's it's it's I mean, literally.

1814
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:08,260
It doesn't make any sense.

1815
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:11,500
We still don't have what these edits are totally insane.

1816
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:14,420
So maybe it'll make sense five years from now.

1817
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:15,780
When there were actually comes out.

1818
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:18,540
But if it were ever going to come out in any form,

1819
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:22,460
there would be no problem showing the backers the raw footage, you know.

1820
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:25,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1821
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,700
Sorry, everyone. I'm sorry.

1822
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:31,580
I wish I could do something, but I can't.

1823
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:37,820
Well, next voicemail is called any hole is a Smeagol.

1824
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:41,900
Three to three to one go.

1825
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,260
Words to live by.

1826
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,260
My precious.

1827
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,740
Oh, my precious is gone.

1828
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:52,580
I miss my precious.

1829
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:54,820
I know where this is going.

1830
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:58,180
Yeah. Miss you, Nate.

1831
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:00,980
You're delicious.

1832
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:02,900
Vain cook.

1833
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,340
I miss it.

1834
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:06,420
I'm shaving pure.

1835
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:09,340
It's really sexy.

1836
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:11,860
My precious.

1837
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:17,140
Nate, I miss that one stray hair

1838
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:19,340
hidden underneath the hood.

1839
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:23,460
I miss the crustiness of the forest.

1840
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:25,460
It's too real.

1841
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:28,660
If you're listening, please tell me.

1842
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:34,460
Do you want my pinkies in your urethra's?

1843
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:37,780
Do you want me to slide my

1844
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:41,380
ricofinger into your cock hole?

1845
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:43,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's see where this is going.

1846
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:49,020
A precious cock wheel for Nate.

1847
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:51,500
The one you mean.

1848
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,380
My anus

1849
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:59,100
forged in the fires of Mount Coombe.

1850
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:04,420
That was too good of an impression.

1851
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:06,260
I'm saying all of that.

1852
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,980
Oh, I could see it.

1853
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,540
I can see him saying it.

1854
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:12,020
Yeah, unfortunately, I can see it.

1855
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:13,980
I could smell his breath

1856
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:18,620
and crawling all over me and delivering this monologue.

1857
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:23,460
It's like all the voicemails to be highly produced

1858
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,340
that had to be that one.

1859
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:27,220
It's like it's like that ride at Disneyland

1860
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:30,500
when the Disney World where the alien breaks out of the thing

1861
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:33,380
and like the like the the the the leathery wings

1862
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:35,260
and like it breathes on you.

1863
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:37,740
It's like that. It's like that.

1864
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:40,980
Thanks for the voicemail.

1865
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:44,340
You know, he didn't he didn't say he was part of the League, though.

1866
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:45,260
That's true.

1867
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:47,260
He could be a competing force.

1868
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:48,300
Smeagol and Gollum.

1869
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:49,820
They were always on their own.

1870
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:51,300
Yeah, I select it.

1871
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:53,340
Yeah, renegades.

1872
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:57,140
Precious cock ring.

1873
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:01,820
Like my anus forced in the fires of Mount Coombe.

1874
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:03,660
Mount Coombe's pretty good.

1875
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,060
Salvaged it right at the end.

1876
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,220
That was pretty good.

1877
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,180
Yeah, a real cherry on top.

1878
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:09,420
No pun intended.

1879
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:12,740
I just want to listen to it like a sex ridden load of the rings.

1880
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:17,620
No, no, no, no, get out of here.

1881
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:19,580
No, it's just you really want that.

1882
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:20,820
I'm sure it already exists,

1883
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:22,740
but it's just so silly.

1884
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:24,460
OK, fine.

1885
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:26,820
I don't I don't I don't plan to enjoy it.

1886
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:28,380
I just is funny. OK.

1887
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,740
Sherry, I just want to watch it ironically.

1888
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:34,420
Promise. Hmm.

1889
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:38,660
Next voicemail is called you're the reason I can't stop stealing.

1890
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:42,140
I'm not meming three, two, one, go.

1891
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,740
Hey, I just wanted to let you know,

1892
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:49,020
Ben, at one time that you talked about a shoplifting

1893
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:55,020
made me rethink the way that I go about my spending my money.

1894
01:37:55,540 --> 01:37:59,100
And now, whenever I need food,

1895
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:04,100
I tend to have a kleptomaniac problem.

1896
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:09,380
So, yeah, ever since then, I haven't spent any money on food.

1897
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:12,500
Any. See you. How?

1898
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:15,580
I mean, that's that's a power move, my dude.

1899
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:18,540
If you can if you can steal all of your food,

1900
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:21,180
I'm impressed. Yeah.

1901
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:27,820
I I mean, I have I have not been in any like stores in a while.

1902
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:31,060
So like, I haven't stolen anything.

1903
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:35,300
Yeah, for online shopping, you you go to checkout

1904
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:38,460
and then at the last second, you like

1905
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,420
void your credit card as as you do the thing.

1906
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:45,100
And then it's like it goes through like, oh, oh, it's already being shipped.

1907
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:48,500
Just like you place order and then you immediately go to your bank

1908
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:51,220
and with half an A press, you file a fraudulent report

1909
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:52,340
and you get your money back.

1910
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:54,220
You have to hold down the mouse click

1911
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:58,380
between when you say buy and then you go and you hold it down to your bank

1912
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,460
and you say like dispute transaction.

1913
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,580
It's got to be in one swift motion.

1914
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,820
You have you have to do it in a single frame. Yeah, yeah.

1915
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,860
Stealing stealing all of it.

1916
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:13,940
Like, how do you do that? Like is he just eating like an apple?

1917
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,300
That's it.

1918
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:21,860
I mean, I mean, don't steal from mom and pops, preferably.

1919
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:27,460
Yeah, don't I mean, don't get caught, I guess.

1920
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:31,540
And if you can do both of those things, I say steal away.

1921
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,740
Stealing is good. Thumbs up.

1922
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:37,940
I was thinking about this.

1923
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:40,420
I was thinking about this

1924
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:42,660
just like yesterday, I was like,

1925
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:47,420
I've talked about stealing before and how it's good.

1926
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:48,740
I should say that again.

1927
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:50,380
I should reiterate that, by the way,

1928
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:54,860
don't forget that I think stealing is good, but I do.

1929
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,740
So thanks.

1930
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:59,820
Thanks, caller, for giving me the chance.

1931
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:03,020
Next voicemail is called.

1932
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:04,820
No, it's good. Not not.

1933
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:06,340
Hey, no, what are you? What are you chicken?

1934
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,260
What are you, pussy, huh? We not cool.

1935
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:11,180
I think it's like morally OK to do that

1936
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:17,140
if it's a large food business huge thing as opposed to a proper store.

1937
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:21,460
The only like moral qualm I have about saying stealing is good

1938
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:25,980
is that I worry that someone like this, who has by his own admission

1939
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:29,300
was inspired to steal by me, might get in trouble if they get caught.

1940
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:32,180
Like, I would I would really feel terrible if that were to happen.

1941
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,500
Like, please.

1942
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,980
Yes. Well, the more you say it, the bigger the chance

1943
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,700
of that happening becomes.

1944
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:40,580
So I know. And I'm saying like.

1945
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:45,220
The most important thing is don't fucking get caught.

1946
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:47,820
La Mal. Just just eat it in the store.

1947
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:53,540
Yes, it's true. It's not a bad move.

1948
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:57,540
Next voicemail, microphone, Michael, three, two, one, go.

1949
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:04,700
Well, if it isn't me, microphone, Michael.

1950
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,020
Damn, what a mic on this guy.

1951
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:07,660
Am I right?

1952
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:10,740
Me microphone named.

1953
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:14,700
Michael. Yeah.

1954
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:22,060
Microphones are slightly phallic shaped.

1955
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:27,180
And you know what rhymes with shape?

1956
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:32,580
Ben, shut the fuck up.

1957
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:35,020
I'm going to fuck you for ever.

1958
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:42,740
You're going to regret letting me on to this show.

1959
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:47,660
I will fuck your brother in dough.

1960
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,460
Oh, my God. In what?

1961
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:54,740
Microphone, Michael turned into a fucking Palpatine at the end there.

1962
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:58,300
He seemed like such a nice guy at first.

1963
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,620
But then things took a turn.

1964
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:01,460
Turn for the mic.

1965
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:04,540
Give a shout out to the original microphone, Michael.

1966
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:06,780
Mike, the microphone of Brony fame.

1967
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:09,300
Oh, is that a musician?

1968
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1969
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:12,580
I remember the name.

1970
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:13,900
I don't even.

1971
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,220
It rings a bell.

1972
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:18,460
I've heard the name, but I can't say I've ever met the man.

1973
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:21,180
Remember, remember that?

1974
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:22,900
Remember when that guy said that?

1975
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:24,460
I remember somebody referencing it.

1976
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:26,260
I don't know. It's from.

1977
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:29,020
That's that's what that's what someone that's what Dr.

1978
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:32,940
Wolf said when someone asked him about Endless Jess, he said, I've heard

1979
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:34,740
no drowning in horseshoes.

1980
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:37,300
I have heard the name, but I've never met the man.

1981
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,820
I feel like he would have been referencing something else.

1982
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:41,820
That's oh, my God.

1983
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:43,220
You know what we didn't talk about?

1984
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:45,060
Have you guys seen anything about G5?

1985
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,900
G5 exploded this week.

1986
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:48,180
Oh, wait.

1987
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:52,620
I think I saw the like a screenshot and I hate how it looks.

1988
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,820
There's tons of animated gifts and everything.

1989
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:57,380
Yeah, I hate that it just it just looks like any.

1990
01:42:57,380 --> 01:43:00,060
It looks like some your normal Pixar shit.

1991
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:01,060
Everything looks like that.

1992
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:02,580
Every fucking movie looks like that.

1993
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:03,100
And I hate it.

1994
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:07,580
There's like one artist in the industry that does the eyes for every 3D thing ever.

1995
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:09,700
They're exactly the same.

1996
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,260
They did it to VeggieTales.

1997
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:12,540
They did it to VeggieTales.

1998
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:13,860
They gave them those same eyes.

1999
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,660
It's fucked up.

2000
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:15,780
There's do you remember?

2001
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:18,460
Like God, this is going to be such an obscure reference

2002
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,180
because I didn't even remember till someone pointed out.

2003
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:23,860
Do you remember that like that like weirdly detailed painting of like

2004
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:28,540
Celestia with like the really derpy looking face from like way back in the day.

2005
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:30,900
It kind of had this like God, I'm never going to be able to find it.

2006
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:35,740
It just like looked really stupid, but it was like a overly detailed painting.

2007
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:38,660
God, I don't know. Maybe.

2008
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:40,580
I'm not going to be able to find it.

2009
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:42,020
I don't remember.

2010
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:44,340
All I know is that the person who made that painting

2011
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,860
worked on designing the ponies and this G5.

2012
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:49,460
So let me we've really gone.

2013
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:50,900
We've gone places.

2014
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:53,380
I guess it's not that crazy to imagine.

2015
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:56,180
Bronies from Gen 4 will be working on Gen 5.

2016
01:43:57,180 --> 01:43:58,940
It's been a 10 years.

2017
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,300
I'm never going to be able to find it.

2018
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,180
I'm really mad.

2019
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:04,740
Yeah, but it was on Twitter and now it's just gone.

2020
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:10,420
The I was looking at the they said there's a movie I'm right.

2021
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,260
I'm right, though, right?

2022
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:13,300
Like G5 just looks really generic, right?

2023
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:17,900
It looks way less, way more generic than than G4, that's for sure.

2024
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:23,780
The they had like a small post exclusive to some website.

2025
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:26,500
And they had like a brief little bit of information

2026
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:28,580
about the fact that there's going to be a movie coming out

2027
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:31,340
and then a series to follow in the same animation style.

2028
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:36,180
And the director is the guy who made cop out or something.

2029
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:38,340
Cop out?

2030
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:40,180
It's I don't know.

2031
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:42,420
The movie, I think so.

2032
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:44,420
I was looking at the names of the people involved.

2033
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:49,740
The one the one that Mr. Plinkett like shield that one time

2034
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:52,100
for the check in that joke with the fucking.

2035
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:54,580
Oh, yeah, that was the one.

2036
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:59,780
Or is it like a cop cop dog more like cop out?

2037
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:02,340
I don't even know what that means.

2038
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:04,660
Here is my only that's my only touch.

2039
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:07,060
That's my only touch point for cop out.

2040
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:11,380
Yeah, so I just wanted to know if like if there's any chance of it being good

2041
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:15,180
because the only reason the Gen four was good was because Lauren Faust

2042
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:18,660
really wanted it to be a good show and she pushed hard for that to happen.

2043
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:22,620
So without her, without a similar voice in the next one,

2044
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:25,980
it's probably just going to be exactly the same shit as, you know,

2045
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:31,100
the the unwatchable garbage that was, well, I don't know, Gen three.

2046
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:36,740
I never watched it, but I caught glimpses and it was not interesting.

2047
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:40,540
I mean, I mean, it looks it looks it looks in motion

2048
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:42,900
just like I thought it would from the screenshots.

2049
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:48,780
I don't like the 3D look nearly as much as the 2D.

2050
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:51,860
Oh, I don't think anyone would say that this looks better than Gen four.

2051
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:53,300
Oh, found it.

2052
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:55,380
All right, this is the picture I was talking about.

2053
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:57,540
Let me get this, please, please.

2054
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:01,700
I feel like I can almost picture what you're talking about.

2055
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:07,100
I had to scroll up through another chat, but yeah, here we go.

2056
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:09,460
That image.

2057
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,820
Oh, my God.

2058
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:15,100
That was wasn't that the the the logo for some musician, right?

2059
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:16,700
I think it was at some point.

2060
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:20,220
I don't know. It was that the fucking double chin or no chin, Celestia.

2061
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:26,580
Some it was that one musician that Trixie was a big fan of who deleted

2062
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,260
all their so powerful.

2063
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:32,860
Yeah, yeah, so maybe I don't know if that was their icon,

2064
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:37,740
but that so gap was the one I associate this image with that person.

2065
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:41,100
But I could have misfired somewhere, I don't know.

2066
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:44,900
Neat, neat.

2067
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:47,500
This is like a haunting image, actually, it's great.

2068
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,300
It's really good.

2069
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:51,780
I unironically like it.

2070
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:54,700
It's a little bit like, I don't know, like Richard's scary.

2071
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:57,780
It's got that cursed image kind of vibe to it.

2072
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:00,540
It just looks like deliberately made to be a little unsettling.

2073
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:02,620
And I'm like, hmm, yeah, well done.

2074
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:04,420
You did it like cryptid Celestia.

2075
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:06,300
Yeah.

2076
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:10,380
But yeah, like the response is pretty good so far.

2077
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,060
Like people are making fan art for everything.

2078
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:16,980
Like the fandom may rise from the ashes or the show could suck.

2079
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:18,260
It'll be a fan.

2080
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:20,020
I mean, it looks.

2081
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:26,780
You know, I mean, it looks to me like it's high enough quality.

2082
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:32,540
And it like, no, I can totally see the old bronies just jumping on this new bandwagon.

2083
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:34,900
I don't. Yeah, like, why not?

2084
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:35,380
Maybe.

2085
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:38,580
Hmm.

2086
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:44,060
I mean, if I were if I were still a brony and I saw this, I'd be like, yeah,

2087
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:47,260
it's different, but it's still more pony stuff.

2088
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:48,980
I'd be I'd probably be into it.

2089
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:51,380
Yeah, it makes sense.

2090
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:56,420
I really, really don't like the Pixar look, though.

2091
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:58,060
I really hate that.

2092
01:47:58,060 --> 01:47:58,860
I might check out.

2093
01:47:58,860 --> 01:47:59,900
Shit, I might check out.

2094
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:01,380
It's very derivative.

2095
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:02,860
I want to I want to know.

2096
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:05,780
I want to know if I like the new one just because why not?

2097
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:08,220
Oh, I'm definitely going to watch the movie for sure.

2098
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:10,220
Like I'm contractually obligated.

2099
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:12,060
Why? I don't know.

2100
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,100
Hey, though, I'm curious.

2101
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,020
Brony curious.

2102
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,420
Brony curious.

2103
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:17,340
I'm for you.

2104
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:18,740
Yes. Yeah, that's true.

2105
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:20,620
That's true.

2106
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:21,300
It's no shame.

2107
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:24,380
There's no shame in watching a pony show just because it's an extreme.

2108
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:28,300
No, there's no shame in it, but I wasn't going to do it.

2109
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:29,140
Maybe it'll be good.

2110
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:30,780
I don't know.

2111
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:32,740
No, it's not.

2112
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:34,100
Why would you think it would be good?

2113
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:35,500
I've why would it be good?

2114
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:39,340
There is a statistical chance that it could be good as small as it may be.

2115
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:41,380
Yeah, we don't know everyone who's working on it.

2116
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:44,580
It could be the people from the show or us.

2117
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:46,500
I mean, actually, I don't know.

2118
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,580
I think it's a different animation studio, a different studio altogether.

2119
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:55,500
Yeah, last time a pony movie came out, we did a a PCP episode about it,

2120
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:58,260
where we should we should do one about Gen five on our own.

2121
01:48:58,260 --> 01:48:59,620
I'm I'm ready.

2122
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:01,820
I'm ready and willing to do another one.

2123
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:04,220
When is it coming out?

2124
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:05,780
I don't know, actually.

2125
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:08,540
I don't think there's a really state is so little information.

2126
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:10,420
I think it's soon.

2127
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:14,780
It sounds like they're ramping up advertising, assuming it's not too far from now.

2128
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:20,980
Fascinating. OK, well, we'll have to.

2129
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:24,060
Offer roll up the old OCs for that one.

2130
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:25,460
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.

2131
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:26,540
We should make three.

2132
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:29,700
Tom, you can make 3D version of your Bernie Currier.

2133
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:32,100
So see tall tales. Yes, yeah.

2134
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:34,580
You can do that. You can make them all of us for free.

2135
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,740
All right. Correct.

2136
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:38,460
That's that's how it works.

2137
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:40,180
Yeah. Nice.

2138
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:44,700
It's like a low poly tall tales makes 3D video like with 3D glasses.

2139
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:49,060
But then you I will pay you by the polygon.

2140
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:53,380
OK, I'll just make a really low poly throw like a sub div on there.

2141
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:55,980
Multiply it by like 15 X and charge you per polygon.

2142
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:58,500
Just just make it a perfect sphere.

2143
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:02,540
OK, that's still a lot of perfect smooth.

2144
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:04,860
Yeah, exactly. That's how you would maximize profit.

2145
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:07,180
You just make the smoothest sphere you can.

2146
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:09,980
But I don't have my RTX 3060 Ti.

2147
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:12,340
It won't handle those polygons. God damn it.

2148
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:15,180
Oh, you're that's you fucked up.

2149
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:16,940
You don't own the means of production.

2150
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:18,340
Yeah, I know, production.

2151
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:20,660
Yeah, you've been you've been hamstrung.

2152
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:24,740
Scalpers is what globalism is bad.

2153
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:27,860
It's time to next voicemail.

2154
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:29,580
Yeah, let's let's go on.

2155
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:34,660
Next voicemail is Error Array and Bear Investment Classroom.

2156
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:38,660
Help. He can't count three, two, one, go.

2157
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,500
He's nice.

2158
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,500
Spare the bear.

2159
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:01,260
Making investments in teacher callers.

2160
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:05,260
The bear needs more than just table manners.

2161
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:08,700
How can I teach him about investment?

2162
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,700
Why is this a song?

2163
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:16,580
Well, it's just how they speak.

2164
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:23,420
Yeah. Why would you be asking us for how to learn about this episode?

2165
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,060
This episode is proved definitively.

2166
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:26,980
We are not the people to talk about this with.

2167
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:29,540
I've just do the opposite of what we say.

2168
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:35,860
Lost hundreds of thousands of dollars every second.

2169
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:37,980
I'm like the I'm like the reverse Jeff Bezos.

2170
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:45,340
I lose ten million dollars a second by not having been part of the original Bitcoin people.

2171
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:48,300
Yeah, exactly.

2172
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:51,860
Oh, I like that.

2173
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:54,020
I think that's a funny that's funny.

2174
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:56,300
I like it. I'm very proud of myself.

2175
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,060
Good job.

2176
01:51:58,060 --> 01:51:59,660
Thanks.

2177
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:03,660
Next voicemail is from Keyblade Spirit.

2178
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:09,180
Well, I like that he invested in t-shirt callers, not in t-shirts,

2179
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:11,540
specifically in t-shirt callers.

2180
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:13,180
That's called Division of Work.

2181
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:14,580
That's called Division of Labor.

2182
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:16,980
That's a post industrial society.

2183
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:19,100
That's called technology.

2184
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:21,340
Next one is Keyblade Spirit.

2185
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:24,180
Three, two, one, go.

2186
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:26,820
Hey, PCP, here's how to truly enjoy Mindsweeper.

2187
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:28,740
But first, a brief history lesson.

2188
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:36,580
Oh, you see, Mindsweeper and all the other default games that came with Windows, whatever.

2189
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:44,580
Those were designed specifically to teach people how to use the mouse.

2190
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:52,420
And this is crucial because in order to enjoy Mindsweeper in the form that it was originally intended,

2191
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:57,540
you just have to completely forget every single thing you know about using a mouse.

2192
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:04,340
And that will make it a perfect 100% keynote experience.

2193
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:10,180
I know this because this is how I learned how to use a mouse in Microsoft Windows back in the day

2194
01:53:10,180 --> 01:53:11,700
when I was a toddler.

2195
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:13,620
I don't.

2196
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:14,020
Good night.

2197
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:22,020
Okay, I do not follow the logic of why do you why do you need to forget everything about

2198
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:25,060
how does that improve the Mindsweeper experience?

2199
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:29,940
Is it because the wonder of being able to affect things on screen with a mouse,

2200
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:32,420
that's where the true joy of Mindsweeper comes from?

2201
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:35,700
Is that what's being applied here?

2202
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:36,660
I can't unlearn it.

2203
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:40,820
My mouse is a wireless Bluetooth mouse.

2204
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:46,260
I need to go get a ball mouse from 1995 in order to truly enjoy Mindsweeper as intended by this logic.

2205
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:51,380
The tactility of the little rubber ball moving the X and Y values

2206
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:54,580
is the only way to play Mindsweeper properly with original hardware,

2207
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:57,700
this emulation with Bluetooth technology, you're just not cutting it.

2208
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:05,780
I must acknowledge that I made a complete fool of myself last week in talking.

2209
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:10,820
There were comments addressing this and Gib, you explained it to me as well,

2210
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:21,380
that you can in fact deduce a lot more about Mind Locations than I was seeing at the time.

2211
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:25,940
Obviously, I am terrible at Mindsweeper.

2212
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:32,980
But now I get it, if you're like cross-referencing multiple squares with numbers,

2213
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:35,300
you can give it, oh, if this one's got two next to it,

2214
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:38,340
but that one's only got one next to it and it can't be either of these,

2215
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:42,420
this must be a safe square and the mind must be here, if these both are next to one.

2216
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:48,660
I just wasn't thinking.

2217
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:54,820
You just thought it was too much like a real Mindsweeper, in real life with a mind detector.

2218
01:54:54,820 --> 01:55:00,100
Where you just go willy-nilly and just jump wherever you are looking.

2219
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:05,060
Yeah, they get all that expensive equipment, they just like long jump into the thing, see what happens.

2220
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:10,660
I think it's just because I played Mindsweeper since I was a little baby,

2221
01:55:10,660 --> 01:55:15,060
and I just thought it was like a baby game, and I didn't think about how like, no,

2222
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:18,100
it actually is kind of like a puzzle, sort of like PyCross,

2223
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:19,700
where you sort of like logic it out.

2224
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:23,460
I just have never approached it that way, and I've seen it for so long.

2225
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:28,980
It was a different way of conceiving of the game.

2226
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:35,620
You know, briefly, mentioning like the Windows, like the game package with Windows,

2227
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:41,540
to teach people about the mouse, I remembered the joy of turning on the mouse trails,

2228
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:46,020
so that when you move the mouse, like a after image of your cursor is left,

2229
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:50,260
and I found the settings in Windows 10, so now I can just, I have thing now.

2230
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:51,460
I remember.

2231
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:53,060
Why would you want to do that?

2232
01:55:53,060 --> 01:55:56,500
Because I remember it, I remember like moving it one pixel at a time,

2233
01:55:56,500 --> 01:56:02,740
and you can like make it look cool, like it's 3D, or like a mouse-shaped prism.

2234
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,460
Ooh.

2235
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:07,380
I'm making swirly's right now.

2236
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:10,980
Wow, that's amazing.

2237
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,860
Fuck Mindsweeper, fuck playing Mindsweeper during the podcast.

2238
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:17,860
I'm just gonna make mouse swirly's.

2239
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:19,140
Just make mouse swirly's.

2240
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:21,300
Is better.

2241
01:56:21,380 --> 01:56:26,180
Uh, next voicemail is called Max L Clutch.

2242
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:28,260
Three, two, one, go.

2243
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:34,420
Hey PCP, it's time to shift these voicemails up a gear, with me.

2244
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:35,300
Max Clutch!

2245
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:36,980
Oh my god.

2246
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:39,860
It sounds like he's actually-

2247
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:42,820
All right, give me your fastest speeds in the car, each of you.

2248
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:46,340
Adam up, divided by three, that's the speed I'm going on my next voicemail.

2249
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:52,420
Wait, your fastest speed in a car?

2250
01:56:52,420 --> 01:56:56,340
No, he says give me numbers, and then I'll calculate them,

2251
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:58,740
and that's the speed I will go in my next voicemail.

2252
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:01,060
I don't want you to die though.

2253
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:03,700
Oh, I kind of want him to die though.

2254
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:06,180
Wait.

2255
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:12,980
He said, yeah, give me your fastest speeds in the car, each of you.

2256
01:57:13,940 --> 01:57:17,060
I don't know what the fastest speed I've gone in a car.

2257
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:19,460
I mean, I've definitely done over a hundred.

2258
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:21,700
I might have done-

2259
01:57:23,780 --> 01:57:25,940
I feel like I might have done 120 one time.

2260
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:28,900
Is that a thing you can do in a car?

2261
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:29,780
I don't-

2262
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:31,140
Yeah, in some cars.

2263
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:32,420
I've gone on a motorway.

2264
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:33,380
What is a motorway?

2265
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:36,500
I've definitely done at least 90.

2266
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:39,940
I think I've gone up to 110 at one point, but never more than that.

2267
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:41,540
I've definitely gone over a hundred.

2268
01:57:41,540 --> 01:57:44,500
I'm not sure if I've ever actually done 120.

2269
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:44,900
Maybe.

2270
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:47,700
If we've all done a hundred, this guy's pushing a hundred next voicemail.

2271
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:49,300
There was a-

2272
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:58,260
I drove from Idlewild, California to Las Vegas and back one time,

2273
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:03,140
and that is a bunch of long, featureless roads through the fucking desert.

2274
01:58:03,940 --> 01:58:07,860
And I did it in just a fucking sedan, and I shit you not.

2275
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:09,060
There was-

2276
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:13,140
I literally raced a guy on the highway.

2277
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:18,420
My car was not cut out for it, but there was another guy in-

2278
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:20,740
I don't know what model it was, but it was a red-

2279
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:27,140
It was a sports car, and he was passing people.

2280
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:31,060
He was ducking and weaving, and I just did it.

2281
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:35,140
And I followed him, and we just kind of stayed neck and neck.

2282
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:38,980
We kind of stayed neck and neck with each other,

2283
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:40,740
and just kept passing people together.

2284
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:45,700
And I think I eventually just let him go, because I didn't want to keep doing this.

2285
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:54,100
But I did that one time, and I went really, really fast.

2286
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:56,980
Pretty zoomy, I hope you-

2287
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,980
Next voicemail is called-

2288
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:02,500
Wait, I just want to say 17.

2289
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:06,340
I've been- I haven't driven a lot, but I have taken some lessons,

2290
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:09,380
and I went on a motorway once, and it says,

2291
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:12,020
Do the motorway, 70 miles per hour.

2292
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:16,660
Okay, I said, tears running down my face, expecting to die every any second.

2293
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:18,500
So that's my number.

2294
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:19,940
Cool.

2295
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:21,300
Do you not drive?

2296
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:22,100
I don't, no.

2297
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:24,580
There's no reason to where I live.

2298
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:26,100
I mean, I don't really eat anymore.

2299
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:29,620
I used to, because I used to live in places that required it more.

2300
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:34,020
God, I'm jealous of your ability to not need a car.

2301
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:36,740
I hate driving, it's the worst.

2302
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:44,660
That, well, that's why I wanted to live in the greater Boston area,

2303
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:48,660
which was great until COVID, and then I don't want to take any transportation,

2304
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:49,300
any public transit.

2305
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:54,340
I just had to pay my excise tax, and every time I have to pay my excise tax,

2306
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:56,100
I see the with rage.

2307
01:59:56,660 --> 01:59:58,180
What is an excise tax?

2308
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:01,060
An excise tax is a Massachusetts only tax,

2309
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:07,700
where they tax your vehicle for using the roads, and we're the only state that has it.

2310
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:11,620
So it's a tax on your car, basically just for having a car.

2311
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:12,020
Correct.

2312
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:13,380
Okay.

2313
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:18,020
And it's really, it's not expensive, mine was like $50, but it's just like,

2314
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:22,980
it's the principle of the matter, that like every year I have to pay an additional tax,

2315
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:27,620
just for having the fucking car, and where the only stateship does it,

2316
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:29,780
yeah, yeah.

2317
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:33,220
And it's just like, fuck you.

2318
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:39,140
Yeah, like auto insurance, and like all the associated,

2319
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:44,020
even if you don't use the car, it costs you money, plus it's expensive just to buy one.

2320
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:47,860
The problem is if you don't use the car, the car will break down, and then it's dead.

2321
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:51,300
So like, it's a liability any way you cut it.

2322
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:55,860
I hate it, I hate car ownership, and I'm glad that I don't do it.

2323
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:59,780
Uh, well, although sometimes I do,

2324
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:03,300
sometimes I think about maybe getting a Vespa or something one day, I don't know.

2325
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:06,100
I could do that, I could get a Vespa.

2326
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,140
It's tempting.

2327
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:11,540
Might be funny, might be funny.

2328
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:14,980
Finally live out your FLCL fantasies, all those years ago.

2329
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:19,780
You know, you know, the thing about it though, is that

2330
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:25,140
Haruka rides the Vespa like you would ride a motorcycle, like she does it cool.

2331
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:29,940
But like a real, like that's sort of, I didn't really think about it at the time,

2332
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:32,660
because I had never really seen a Vespa in real life.

2333
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:37,700
But sort of the joke of that, is that an actual Vespa is not cool, and like doesn't

2334
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:40,580
fucking do anything, which, yeah.

2335
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:44,500
An anime Vespa, in all sense of the word.

2336
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:47,780
You should never, never the less, I mean,

2337
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:52,180
never the less the idea of like a small motorized vehicle still has its appeal,

2338
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:56,660
even if it's fucking dweeby and doesn't go fast or anything.

2339
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:59,300
Like still, maybe.

2340
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,260
I'd think about it.

2341
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:03,140
Moped's can be cool, in a cringe kind of way.

2342
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:07,700
Night based.

2343
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:14,820
A next voicemail is Cross, literally my first acapella, but I think it's okay.

2344
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:17,300
Three, two, one, go.

2345
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:25,940
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2346
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:30,900
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2347
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:35,860
But I'm not working, I'm doing nothing.

2348
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:40,900
My dick, I'm jerking, myself, I'm suiting.

2349
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:46,580
I am an asshole, I am a stupid bomb.

2350
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:51,860
I got a deadline, don't want to do it.

2351
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:55,140
That was pretty good.

2352
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:58,100
Yeah, that should be the theme song for this episode.

2353
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:01,140
I agree, I was gonna say the same thing.

2354
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:05,620
Eleazar, make it happen, make it work.

2355
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:10,740
Cut it, crop it, chop it, and send it to the press.

2356
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:15,780
Next voicemail is called, hey, a couple of questions.

2357
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:17,620
Three, two, one, go.

2358
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:24,020
You guys like macaroni salad?

2359
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:25,700
Yeah.

2360
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:26,100
No.

2361
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:27,060
I don't know what that is.

2362
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:27,300
No?

2363
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:31,220
Shit, just dropped some on my floor.

2364
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:32,900
Fuck.

2365
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:35,300
Only one question so far, genius.

2366
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:38,420
You know, isn't Speakpipe supposed to be like charging you money?

2367
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:39,300
You just never did.

2368
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:40,980
I don't know.

2369
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:43,540
That is correct, and that is technically a couple of questions.

2370
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:44,900
Okay.

2371
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:46,420
We do know that, yes, it's funny.

2372
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:51,460
I'm shocked that you, Tom, don't like macaroni salad,

2373
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:53,140
and that you, Gib, don't know what it is.

2374
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:54,660
I know what macaroni is, I think.

2375
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:56,660
It's like a little pasta shape.

2376
02:03:56,660 --> 02:04:02,180
Okay, if you told me that you didn't know what macaroni was, I would freak out.

2377
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:04,020
I think I've had macaroni before.

2378
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:09,220
What do you mean you think you've had macaroni before?

2379
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:12,180
Well, I mean, I've had pasta before, I don't know.

2380
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:14,740
I think, like, think back to it.

2381
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:15,860
Wait, pause.

2382
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:17,220
What?

2383
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:20,260
What is happening?

2384
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:22,980
How do you not know what macaroni and cheese is?

2385
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:24,420
Is that like an American thing?

2386
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:25,140
That's impossible.

2387
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:26,100
That's impossible.

2388
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:27,860
It might be an American thing.

2389
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:30,580
I've never heard of it growing up until-

2390
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:31,620
What?

2391
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:35,780
Okay, Radcon 5 mac and cheese.

2392
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:36,420
I don't like cheese.

2393
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:39,220
That's unbelievable.

2394
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:41,060
I'm just trying to think of like times where I,

2395
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:46,260
like I know it's like small tiny little bits of pasta as opposed to like-

2396
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:50,180
No, literally having a mental breakdown right now.

2397
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:51,780
What is so strange about this?

2398
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:54,420
It's like saying the sky's blue, I never knew.

2399
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:56,900
That's literally, that's like, you know, bread?

2400
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:59,780
I think I tried that one time and it was like, it was decent.

2401
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:06,260
No, that would be like saying, I've heard of pasta, like as a whole food group.

2402
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:07,460
Okay, yes.

2403
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:09,860
Macaroni is a food group in America, let's be real.

2404
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:11,540
I mean, okay.

2405
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:13,620
It called it macaroni.

2406
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:15,700
That was the first time I heard the word, but I didn't know what it was.

2407
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:24,340
I mean, macaroni and cheese, other than like spaghetti, is like the most common pasta dish.

2408
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:31,460
Spaghetti is the most, yeah, that's, that's like, if I said, I think I've had spaghetti, like-

2409
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:32,980
No, no, no, it's the same.

2410
02:05:32,980 --> 02:05:34,420
That's, that is what you're saying.

2411
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:35,620
I guess I can understand if that's-

2412
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:39,460
That's literally on the level, that's literally on the level of what this feels like to me.

2413
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:41,060
Not over here.

2414
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:46,260
Okay, yeah, macaroni and cheese is like a, is like a staple over here.

2415
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:48,660
I mean, it explains a lot.

2416
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:52,980
It's very American, high in fat, high in carbs, not good for you at all.

2417
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:57,620
When I think of like default pasta, I think of spaghetti and then I think of frisilli,

2418
02:05:57,620 --> 02:05:58,820
which is like the twists.

2419
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:03,620
Those are like the number one and number two normal pasta things.

2420
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:10,580
I mean, yeah, I mean, macaroni is probably not the most common pasta that I eat.

2421
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:14,820
It's just, it's just such a staple of the, because it's macaroni and cheese.

2422
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:18,580
According to Wikipedia, it's called macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom.

2423
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:20,180
So it exists where you are.

2424
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:24,100
Well, they cut out, they cut out the and, oh, they're too good for the and, okay.

2425
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:26,180
I mean, I mean-

2426
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:28,820
Wait, no, I haven't had these little, these little tiny tubes.

2427
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:29,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2428
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:33,380
But I don't think, I haven't had macaroni and cheese because I just, I don't like cheese.

2429
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:38,420
Practically speaking, macaroni and cheese, I mean, well, technically it's, you know,

2430
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:39,860
traditionally made with macaroni.

2431
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:45,140
I mean, if you made mac and cheese with fusilli, you'd still call it macaroni and cheese, probably.

2432
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:46,260
Yeah, cool.

2433
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:49,940
Kind of like how you still call it Jell-O, even if it's something else,

2434
02:06:49,940 --> 02:06:52,020
even if it's some other brand, or you still call it,

2435
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:57,140
they still call it Coke, right?

2436
02:06:57,140 --> 02:07:00,020
Like in the South, is that where they call it Coke?

2437
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:01,140
They call it every soda Coke?

2438
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:01,540
Yeah, some places.

2439
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:03,060
Some places they call every soda Coke.

2440
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:05,220
Um, what was the other-

2441
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:10,420
I mean, macaroni salad is like, it's cold, it's like cooked macaroni, but it's cold,

2442
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:16,020
and it's usually got like a mayonnaise-based kind of sauce with like herbs maybe in it,

2443
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:17,300
and like vegetables.

2444
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:19,460
Yeah, I'm not a mayonnaise fan in general, so.

2445
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:22,100
I, I like, I like mayonnaise, so.

2446
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:26,260
You know, it's like a, you know, it's like a barbecue staple, you know, like you go to a

2447
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:30,020
barbecue and you got like, you know, your dogs and your burgers and maybe like your ribs and

2448
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:34,420
your sausages, and then you got your side dishes, and you maybe got like your potato salad,

2449
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:35,620
and your macaroni salad.

2450
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:36,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2451
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:38,340
Oh, I love, I love potato salad.

2452
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:43,140
It's, it's usually not macaroni, but I, I think I've had salads like that at barbecue and things.

2453
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:46,180
Yeah, it's, it's, it's okay, I can't do the mayo, just not a huge fan.

2454
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:49,380
I made a, I made a BLT the other day.

2455
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:52,020
It sucks, it's keto, it's good keto food.

2456
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:58,660
It is, I made a, I made a BLT on some keto bread the other day, and it was, uh, it was, uh,

2457
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:00,260
have you, have you found keto bread?

2458
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:01,860
Have you been, or have you looked for any?

2459
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:06,420
I've seen a couple, but they all have like still a lot of carbs, even net carbs.

2460
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:07,540
It's like over 10.

2461
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:09,060
I'm just like, no, die.

2462
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:10,100
And that's for one piece of bread.

2463
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:13,620
I'm like, that's my entire day's carbs in one sandwich, not worth it.

2464
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:16,980
If you can find, if you can find love and fresh, love and fresh is like all wheat,

2465
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:21,300
like wheat starch, it's all, it's all fiber, like it's all fiber.

2466
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:22,180
Okay.

2467
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:22,820
And it's good.

2468
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:24,180
If you can find it anywhere.

2469
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:24,820
Where do you get it?

2470
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:26,500
Aldi.

2471
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:27,300
Oh, wow.

2472
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:29,940
Didn't you say that like they just closed the Aldi near you?

2473
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:31,140
They don't, they don't deliver it.

2474
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:34,820
They, yeah, they'd close it temporarily to remodel and then they don't deliver it anymore.

2475
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:40,340
But I go there and like their selection has shrinked significantly in the last like couple

2476
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:41,540
of weeks, which really sucks.

2477
02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:45,940
I feel like I've said this before, but I'm shocked.

2478
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:48,180
I'm shocked that they have it at my Aldi.

2479
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:54,100
Cause when I think of Aldi, I think like kind of a crap selection, uh, place.

2480
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:57,940
And yet they have these like very specific like specialty breads

2481
02:08:57,940 --> 02:08:59,380
that I can't find anywhere else.

2482
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:01,860
So it's really just the best of both worlds.

2483
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:02,100
Yeah.

2484
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:04,100
It's, it's cheap and exactly what you need.

2485
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:06,260
Cheap and niche is not usually something that goes together.

2486
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:10,020
Spag ball, spag, spag ball is, is what people call it.

2487
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:11,860
Whoa.

2488
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:13,220
Spag, spag ball.

2489
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:14,260
I never called it that.

2490
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:16,740
What is it?

2491
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:17,140
What is it?

2492
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:21,220
Spaghetti bolognese is like the colloquial term for that.

2493
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:22,180
Oh, spag ball.

2494
02:09:23,140 --> 02:09:24,820
Wait, spag.

2495
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:26,820
Okay.

2496
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:30,180
Spaghetti bolognese, bolognese is like a tomato meat sauce, right?

2497
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:30,580
Yeah.

2498
02:09:30,580 --> 02:09:34,980
That, that's what I think of like is maybe the equivalent of mac and cheese.

2499
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:40,340
Like in terms of like ubiquitousness among English families.

2500
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:41,460
This is weird.

2501
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:47,780
I mean, we have, like we have spaghetti bolognese, but I mean most we, I mean,

2502
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:50,100
spaghetti and meatballs would be more classic.

2503
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:51,620
Yeah, maybe that fair.

2504
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:52,740
Yeah.

2505
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:54,660
I mean, I would, yeah.

2506
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:58,660
I've never heard anyone call it spag ball, but I guess it's.

2507
02:09:58,660 --> 02:10:00,180
It was a few people at school called it that.

2508
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:03,220
I was like, wait, people, that sounds gross.

2509
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,100
Why would you call it that?

2510
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:04,900
It does sound gross.

2511
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:07,700
But it does sound gross, but I like it.

2512
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:10,660
I, um, I like a good spag ball.

2513
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:16,500
Um, I don't, uh, yeah, it's good.

2514
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:19,140
It's probably not something I would like make.

2515
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:20,820
I mean, not, I mean, I'm keto now.

2516
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:24,660
So, uh, I've never been much of like a spaghetti guy.

2517
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:25,860
It's fine.

2518
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:26,340
It's okay.

2519
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:28,180
I'll take it.

2520
02:10:28,820 --> 02:10:30,340
Um, next one.

2521
02:10:30,340 --> 02:10:31,140
Yep.

2522
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:31,780
Yeah, suit up.

2523
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:32,020
Okay.

2524
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:34,980
Next one is called mentally challenging game.

2525
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:36,660
Three, two, one, go.

2526
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:42,260
So Gibbs said she wanted a game that can mentally challenge her.

2527
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:42,500
Yes.

2528
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:46,100
You know, look no further than Phoenix rights trilogy.

2529
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:49,700
It's just been released on the PlayStation five and switch and PC.

2530
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:54,020
Or you can just emulate the original Game Boy or DS games.

2531
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:55,620
They are fantastic.

2532
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:58,180
I, I don't know if I talked about this on the PCP,

2533
02:10:58,180 --> 02:11:04,980
but I had recently booted up my old DS and replayed the original trilogy just for,

2534
02:11:04,980 --> 02:11:07,540
because it was, I felt like it, and it was great.

2535
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:09,140
It was so good.

2536
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:09,460
I did.

2537
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:13,380
I think this guy's, this guy's recommending games and his

2538
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:17,860
and his recommendation is just, oh, games on the Game Boy.

2539
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:21,700
Like no, that's not specific enough.

2540
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:23,780
Say Phoenix, right?

2541
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:26,260
I guess he did say Phoenix, right?

2542
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:27,140
But series.

2543
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:29,140
I mean, it's on Game Boy and DS.

2544
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:31,940
So like, but Gibbs already played all those.

2545
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:36,100
She's like, she's talked, she's talked about it many times and she's a big fan of that series.

2546
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:36,260
Yeah.

2547
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:36,980
I guess, right?

2548
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:37,940
I guess he just didn't know.

2549
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:39,940
Maybe he didn't know.

2550
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:42,100
Um, I mean, I don't know if you've played it,

2551
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:45,140
but like a game that I remember being like kind of like thinky and heady,

2552
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:46,420
even though I haven't played it in a while.

2553
02:11:47,220 --> 02:11:48,660
I played it after Phoenix, right?

2554
02:11:48,660 --> 02:11:51,620
It was Hotel Dusk Room 215 for the DS.

2555
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:55,860
Oh, is that the guy with the meme face where he's like smiling and he's like, yeah.

2556
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:57,620
I have no idea.

2557
02:11:57,620 --> 02:12:01,700
It's like, it's like a, you hold the DS sideways and you go through like a 3D rendered hotel,

2558
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:04,340
but all the characters are drawn in like pencil sketch looking things.

2559
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:04,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2560
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:06,100
Hotel Dusk meme face.

2561
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:08,340
What's the one?

2562
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:11,860
Nate used it in one of the Smash reveal videos.

2563
02:12:12,900 --> 02:12:15,140
I can't find it, but it's fun though.

2564
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:16,180
It's a good game.

2565
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:17,380
Yeah, I think I have that.

2566
02:12:17,380 --> 02:12:19,220
I don't remember beating it though.

2567
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:20,420
So I could, I could boot that up.

2568
02:12:20,420 --> 02:12:20,980
It's this guy.

2569
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:23,860
It's not that.

2570
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:26,180
That's not the face that is the meme face.

2571
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:26,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2572
02:12:26,660 --> 02:12:27,460
That's the guy though.

2573
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:28,420
Oh, there it is.

2574
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:29,140
It was a fun game.

2575
02:12:29,860 --> 02:12:30,260
That's it.

2576
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:31,300
That's my recommendation.

2577
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:32,820
That's the one.

2578
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:34,100
There it is.

2579
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:36,180
He's so satisfied with whatever that is.

2580
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:41,380
Someday I hope to feel satisfaction to that level.

2581
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:45,060
Oh my God, I just got a fucking, this sucks.

2582
02:12:45,940 --> 02:12:49,140
I just got a fucking notification that I guess there's,

2583
02:12:49,140 --> 02:12:52,500
I have a family Zoom meeting at 5.30.

2584
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:53,300
What does that mean?

2585
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:55,140
What the fuck?

2586
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:56,740
I mean, I'm glad we're almost done.

2587
02:12:56,740 --> 02:13:02,580
I guess, I had no idea, but I guess I'm supposed to have a family conference call

2588
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:06,420
with my family in eight minutes.

2589
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:08,100
They really need to sit down and talk to Nate

2590
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:09,540
about this league of Nate fuckers.

2591
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:12,500
It's just, it's getting a little out of hand and they're concerned.

2592
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:13,780
No, they've joined the league.

2593
02:13:15,940 --> 02:13:18,260
Okay, I'm going to tell them that I'll be there soon.

2594
02:13:19,060 --> 02:13:20,180
If I'm a little late, it's fine.

2595
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:25,380
Sorry, I got a little distracted there.

2596
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:26,980
Next voicemail?

2597
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:27,380
Yep.

2598
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:27,620
Yeah.

2599
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:28,820
Okay.

2600
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:32,820
It's called Love the New Segment 321 Go.

2601
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:34,260
Hey, it's that part of the podcast

2602
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:36,020
where Oblivion followed those funny voices.

2603
02:13:36,340 --> 02:13:38,820
Yeah.

2604
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:44,020
Smeagol must have been Oblivion's fall, right?

2605
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:47,620
There's no way to know.

2606
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:48,820
Who's Smeagol?

2607
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:50,820
I mean, like in this, in a voicemail.

2608
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:52,980
I mean, no, Smeagol, Smeagol.

2609
02:13:52,980 --> 02:13:53,540
Smeagol.

2610
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:54,180
Oh, yeah.

2611
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:55,060
Yeah.

2612
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:58,020
No, actually no.

2613
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:00,740
That was Smeagol from Lord of the Rings.

2614
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:02,340
It was just Smeagol, yes.

2615
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:03,540
Yeah.

2616
02:14:04,580 --> 02:14:05,940
I mean, it is a good new segment.

2617
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:07,060
I enjoy Smeagol.

2618
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:11,140
What?

2619
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:12,260
I don't know, what is this?

2620
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:12,740
Is this a joke?

2621
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:14,980
Like, yes, I ironically do love the new segment.

2622
02:14:14,980 --> 02:14:15,620
Fuck you.

2623
02:14:15,620 --> 02:14:18,020
This guy thinks he's too fucking cool for school.

2624
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:18,740
Yeah, yeah.

2625
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:25,860
Next voicemail is The Lord of North Fearwell 321 Go.

2626
02:14:32,340 --> 02:14:39,060
The Lord of North Fearwell, it has come to our attention,

2627
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:45,620
that I'd like to say, does the Dark Lord have to play mine, Smeagol?

2628
02:14:45,620 --> 02:14:46,180
I know.

2629
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:51,060
I think this guy chooses his way in the game,

2630
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:54,260
instead of improving his skills.

2631
02:14:55,540 --> 02:14:58,420
This guy, this like the lot of girls suck.

2632
02:14:58,420 --> 02:15:04,740
If it was a day, so early on the walking day,

2633
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:07,460
and the Lord of North Fearwell 321 Go.

2634
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:08,340
Shut up.

2635
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:11,540
Who fucking cares about mine, Smeagol?

2636
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:13,460
Apparently, it's a big deal.

2637
02:15:13,460 --> 02:15:14,660
I don't give a fuck.

2638
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:18,580
It's a baby game for idiots.

2639
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:22,260
Stop.

2640
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:22,740
Stop.

2641
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:23,060
No.

2642
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:25,060
No!

2643
02:15:25,060 --> 02:15:27,060
No!

2644
02:15:27,060 --> 02:15:29,060
We are the Lord of North Fearwell 321 Go.

2645
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:30,340
I'm so scared.

2646
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:33,060
I hate you.

2647
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:40,420
Is this a little too thick on the effects now?

2648
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:43,300
I could not understand most of it,

2649
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:45,700
but like the point came across loud and clear.

2650
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:49,620
It's like if a Dalek was at the bottom of a well.

2651
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:55,060
He's so upset that I didn't play minesweeper, right?

2652
02:15:55,060 --> 02:15:58,100
He's just like incoherent with rage.

2653
02:15:58,100 --> 02:15:58,420
Really?

2654
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:01,220
You really stuck a nerve with the minesweeper community.

2655
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:02,020
I did.

2656
02:16:02,020 --> 02:16:02,900
I did.

2657
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:04,500
I triggered them, you might say.

2658
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:05,780
I trolled them epically.

2659
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:08,740
I was only pretending to be an idiot,

2660
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:12,420
and you are the fool for being upset about it.

2661
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:21,460
Next voicemail is called TheMainAlien at MoonAnion.com.

2662
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:26,660
It's called AmoonAnion 321 Go.

2663
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,140
Oh, Christ.

2664
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:36,260
MoonAnion, mainly AmoonAnion.

2665
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,140
I can't hear them.

2666
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:41,380
No, you know what?

2667
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:42,660
You know what?

2668
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:52,820
MoonAnions are the most numerous of the aliens.

2669
02:16:52,820 --> 02:17:02,420
You could even say that mainly MoonAnions are the main aliens.

2670
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:08,980
Look at what we've cultivated.

2671
02:17:11,380 --> 02:17:12,980
Oh, my God, why?

2672
02:17:12,980 --> 02:17:17,700
I'm going to brownmate in his butthole.

2673
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:31,460
Night, night, boy, pussy, night, boy, pussy, oh, wow, yeah, boy, pussy, boy, pussy.

2674
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:32,500
Oh, my God.

2675
02:17:37,060 --> 02:17:37,460
You know what?

2676
02:17:37,460 --> 02:17:38,980
Oh, my God, there's so many of them.

2677
02:17:38,980 --> 02:17:40,740
They really are the main aliens.

2678
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:43,220
You know what?

2679
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:46,580
That Love the New Segment guy, he was prophetic.

2680
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:49,700
He knew exactly what he was talking about.

2681
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:52,180
He had it exactly right.

2682
02:17:52,180 --> 02:17:54,100
The New Segment sucks, and I hate it.

2683
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:56,260
Thanks.

2684
02:17:56,260 --> 02:17:59,540
I like the reference to the MoonAnions.

2685
02:17:59,540 --> 02:18:02,820
It's a Gib reference, a very ancient Gib reference.

2686
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:05,620
Wait, is it?

2687
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:08,660
Yeah, mainly MoonAnions are the main aliens.

2688
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:16,180
It's from a video where me and my brother were in the park late at night hunting ghosts.

2689
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:18,020
Ghosts?

2690
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:18,580
Ghosts.

2691
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:26,980
We're ghosts watchers, and we were in the park, and we found evidence of alien life forms,

2692
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:28,100
the MoonAnions.

2693
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:30,580
Yes.

2694
02:18:30,580 --> 02:18:31,060
Nice.

2695
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:31,460
That's good.

2696
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:32,100
Okay, you know what?

2697
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:34,740
That does ring a bell, actually, vaguely.

2698
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:38,500
Um, well, thanks for the fucking voicemail.

2699
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:39,540
I liked it.

2700
02:18:39,540 --> 02:18:40,340
Next one, wait.

2701
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:43,940
Yeah, it had its charms.

2702
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:50,180
Next voicemail is called Bward Co-op number three, and this time I remember it's Ben,

2703
02:18:50,180 --> 02:18:54,180
weekly reminder to catch up on One Piece number three.

2704
02:18:54,180 --> 02:18:55,540
Three, two, one, go.

2705
02:18:56,420 --> 02:18:58,100
Ben, Ben, Ben.

2706
02:18:58,100 --> 02:18:59,220
Here we are once again.

2707
02:18:59,780 --> 02:19:00,980
I'm disappointed in you.

2708
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:04,180
Once again, it's Ben.

2709
02:19:04,180 --> 02:19:06,020
You can weekly reminder to catch up on One Piece.

2710
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:06,500
How do you know?

2711
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:07,940
Maybe I caught up on One Piece.

2712
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:10,180
It's very good, and should only take a few days.

2713
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:11,460
Thank you, bye.

2714
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:12,340
A few days.

2715
02:19:13,140 --> 02:19:13,860
A few days.

2716
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:17,460
Very presumptuous of him to assume that I haven't caught up on One Piece yet.

2717
02:19:17,460 --> 02:19:19,460
Are you presumed too much about Ben's reading level?

2718
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:19,860
No.

2719
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:21,060
Take him a lot longer than that.

2720
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:24,820
I am very stupid.

2721
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:33,300
I'll get around to it.

2722
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:34,420
It's fine.

2723
02:19:34,420 --> 02:19:35,140
It's good.

2724
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:37,780
It's the best show on the internet.

2725
02:19:37,780 --> 02:19:39,860
It's the Procrastinators podcast.

2726
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:40,340
That's it.

2727
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:41,060
That's the end.

2728
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:41,860
We did it.

2729
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:43,060
Oh my god.

2730
02:19:43,060 --> 02:19:43,700
Right?

2731
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:44,340
We made it.

2732
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:46,500
We made it to another end of an episode.

2733
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:49,540
You procrastinated with us for two hours and change.

2734
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:50,100
How does it feel?

2735
02:19:50,100 --> 02:19:53,460
We listened to all the voicemails.

2736
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:56,100

02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:05,700
It's finally out.

2740
02:20:05,700 --> 02:20:09,140
I said it was out before, but I was misinformed.

2741
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:10,500
But now it's out really.

2742
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:13,380
I feel like I've said that every week for years now.

2743
02:20:13,380 --> 02:20:15,140
It's the behind the scenes episode.

2744
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:17,060
But actually it's out now.

2745
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:18,340
Thank you, Tom.

2746
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:22,100
Check us out.

Check out Shekels for Heckles.

We'll do the Shekels for Heckles this Wednesday, March 10th.

2749
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:32,420
In the evening, probably like 6 p.m. ish EST.

2750
02:20:32,420 --> 02:20:35,700
I'm sure we'll have a more solid announcement on Twitter.

2751
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:39,700
Patreon or the TP Crastinators on Twitter.

2752
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:41,220
We'll have an actual announcement.

2753
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:42,660
I did it.

2754
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:43,460

2757
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:56,740
and the time of the audience and we love it.

2758
02:20:56,740 --> 02:20:57,220
Thank you.

We are at 45331.

2761
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:12,340
Okay, so we've pretty much just hung in there for the last hour or so.

2762
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:12,980
That's fine.

2763
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:13,460
That's good.

2764
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:18,180
Is that everything?

2765
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:18,660
Are we done?

2766
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:19,780
Yes.

2767
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:20,820

02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:34,820
Okay, bye.

2773
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:35,620
Thanks.

Love you very much.

2777
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:39,140
I disavow this podcast.

2778
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:39,540
You're very special.

2779
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:45,540
I disavow this podcast.
