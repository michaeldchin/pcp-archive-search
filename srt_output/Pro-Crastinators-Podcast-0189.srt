00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. You

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,360
are greeted by me, Besty Boyman. And who else is here? We've got Gibbontake.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,240
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,240
It's that time of year, everybody. We've got other reindeer pulling the sleigh, Tom Oliver.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Oh what fun it is to be super fucking gay, dab. As expected, there's Ben Saint.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,240
That's me here.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Christmas, fuck. And Mage, our purple-nosed reindeer, leading the pack.

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,240
I wish you a Merry Christmas. This is actually a very funny song once you know all the lyrics.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
Why's that?

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,240
Because they ask for figgy pudding, and I didn't know what figgy pudding is, and it just sounds so funny to me.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,240
It sounds like baggy pudding, it does.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
It's just pudding with figs in it.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:10,240
But it sounds so funny when you say, like, oh give us some figgy pudding, oh give us some figgy pudding.

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
It is an amusing word.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,240
Give us a break, give us a break, at our own like Christmas.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Break me off the piece of that Kit Kat bar.

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Let me see, today, people will be hearing this on Friday the 13th, which is a fucking way.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,240
This is the last time people are hearing me on the public podcast this year.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Are you going to go back to the North Pole and be Santa?

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Yes, that is my plan.

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
You're going to be very busy.

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:56,240
When this comes out, shortly after this, I think on this day, we are doing a PCP Minecraft stream on this very channel, so you will see it here shortly after this episode goes live.

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Maybe you're listening to this episode while playing in the Minecraft server with us right this moment.

24
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
I hope so, I hope so.

25
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:17,240
There's an event going on, people have to have like their little houses and they put in their wish lists for the Santa of the server and they might get some things from their wish list.

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:26,240
And the deadline is the 15th, so if you want to get some free goodies right off the bat, feel free to join.

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
How exciting.

28
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,240
I'm going to put the top of my wish list to be banned from the server.

29
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:41,240
If you want to join, go to athtrend.com slash PCP Minecraft everybody, go join the good times.

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,240
If you've been a good little boy or girl, then perhaps.

31
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Who's going home for Crembus?

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Me.

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
I will be going home for a few days.

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
I mean, I'm not going home, I'm going to my parents.

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
I am going.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm here, I'll be home, but it's not that far for me.

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
It's like an hour's train ride.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Right, right.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
That'll be good.

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
That'll be good.

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Check in with the folks.

42
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Christmas Eve will be a party time.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
You know, Ben, we did a little shopping for you.

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,240
We have a gift that we have acquired that you shall receive in the near future.

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,240
The joke is you're going to be given the gift and then Nate is going to take it when he leaves.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,240
And then I'll wear it on my feet and you'll see how you like it, Ben.

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Okay, what is it?

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
No one knows.

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
It's a mystery.

50
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Oh, okay.

51
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Is it a toothbrush?

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Someone said, here's a gift that you don't know what it is.

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Purchase it.

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,240
And then, oh, actually, here's a brand new concept that I'm selling to everyone right

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
now.

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,240
It's you buy an item from me, you don't know what it is.

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
The person you're giving it to doesn't know what it is.

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,240
So when that person opens it, it's a surprise for everyone there.

59
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Now that's fun.

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
That's double the fun.

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
You know what you should do?

62
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,240
You should go to a shop on the high street, close your eyes and just charge, run in some

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
random direction.

64
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Charge the money held out in front of you.

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,240
The first thing you fucking smash into and fall over on, that's the present.

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Keep your eyes closed, grab it with both hands.

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,240
We have only the moment of impact to determine what it is.

68
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,240
You just keep bumping into things until the amount of money you're holding out exceeds

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
the value.

70
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,240
So until you hear a shop keep yell sold and then you grab whatever you got, stuff it in

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
your pocket and run away.

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:32,240
It's a brand new fucking electric toothbrush.

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,240
We partner up with, I don't know, I'm picturing the setting at some cheap porn movie.

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,240
I don't know why, but that seems appropriate for it.

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,240
In the setting, it's like a panic room or one of those event rooms, escape room.

76
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
That's the word I'm looking for.

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Kind of a porn has a panic room or escape room.

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
What kind of shit are you into, Nate?

79
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,240
That's where I go before I'm about to film my scene where everyone will see my

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
ween and how nervous that makes me.

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,240
He has this emergency coomer panic room.

82
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm just wondering what about this is porn at all?

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm just picturing like a shitty room.

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
That's all it is.

85
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
That's the only connection here.

86
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
There's shit on the walls as well.

87
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
What the fuck?

88
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
There's shit on the walls.

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Oh yes.

90
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,240
The distinctive thing about porn is that they take place in rooms.

91
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,240
That's the main defining characteristic of most of the films I watch.

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
I've talked a lot more porn than I thought I did then.

93
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Here's the deal.

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,240
This is a new product I'm going to be selling with my services.

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,240
You hire me, Nate, to find you a cheap porn room that's just been used to film porn.

96
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,240
In that room, on the casting couch, we sit down you and your whole extended family.

97
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,240
And on this casting couch, we're given a lump sum of money by you and your group beforehand.

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,240
We go out and we buy the gifts and we give them to everyone.

99
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,240
And then you people, you lowly creatures engaging in this voluntary exchange of goods and services,

100
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
get to open the gifts and nobody knows what they're getting.

101
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,240
We as the service providers get the gifts so everyone gets surprised things that hopefully are at least kind of nice.

102
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
I bet some people would be into that.

103
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
I bet someone would like that.

104
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,240
I know if there's any goods, but there's certainly a service being provided of dubious quality.

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
It is.

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Well, I mean, hopefully we'll get some good Yelp reviews and then we'll work our way up the corporate ladder

107
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,240
and we'll be doing it for Steve Jobs next year.

108
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Everybody in hell.

109
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Everybody hates white elephants, but we all do.

110
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
We all do.

111
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
We do white elephant.

112
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
What's a white elephant?

113
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
I don't know what that is.

114
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
What?

115
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
It's the Yankee Swap.

116
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Oh, okay.

117
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,240
I feel like more people know it is a white elephant, but we here in New England call it a Yankee Swap.

118
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,240
I've never heard the term white elephant ever.

119
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Is that like a Republic or a Democrat thing?

120
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
No, it's a God.

121
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:58,240
It's the thing where everyone buys a gift and then you pool them all and then you draw a lotteries and then you see for Santa.

122
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Not quite, but then you go around in the order that you drew the lots and then the next person picks one from the pile, opens it

123
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,240
and then gets to choose someone else who already opened one and they get to switch with them.

124
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Right.

125
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,240
So the whole plan will be like one good gift that everyone keeps trading for usually.

126
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,240
It's basically the worst idea ever and I don't know if people do that.

127
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,240
It's just like how to guarantee yourself disappointment and a shitty gift.

128
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
It's kind of fun.

129
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Is this a Nintendo 64 game?

130
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
It rattles the box.

131
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,240
I guess it's something to do for an hour.

132
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,240
You're thinking about this as like a game to win the best gift.

133
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:49,240
What it really is, is a game to spend the time that you're forced to be with your family and friends in some way that can be, you know, have a conversation about.

134
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Win or lose, it sounds like evil corporations win by making us buy more useless shit that we don't actually even want.

135
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Well, there's definitely that of the whole consumerism game.

136
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Well, I think the concede is that if you weren't doing the Yankee swap, then...

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
You have to talk to them and...

138
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,240
You know, then you would have to pick out a gift for someone.

139
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
But you're not doing that.

140
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
We're sidestepping the need to do that.

141
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,240
You can find as generic a gift as possible.

142
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
You just get something and throw it into a pool.

143
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
It's like a monkey's paw thing.

144
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,240
You don't have to worry about picking a gift, but you don't get a good one either.

145
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
So it's like everybody loses.

146
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,240
One person gets a good gift, basically.

147
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,240
I got the best gifts for my immediate family, my brothers and my mom and dad.

148
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,240
They're going to be like, oh, nice.

149
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
And I'm going to be the cool guy.

150
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I'm going to be the best son.

151
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
That is good.

152
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
I got gifts, sort of kind of as well.

153
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
I can't believe you fuckers got gifts. I don't have any gifts.

154
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,240
To be fair, I guess I'll have to get some, but like, whatever.

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Michelle's the one who picked out the stuff that we got so far.

156
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,240
I have not done anything, including by anything for Michelle.

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Actually, technically I did, but that was like a side thing.

158
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
So I'm still high and dry.

159
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
It is a nightmare.

160
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
I don't want to have to think about it, but I do.

161
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,240
And the date creeps ever closer that I'll have the gun in my hand soon.

162
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
What happened to our pact?

163
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,240
We used to get each other nothing as our mutual Christmas gift.

164
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,240
You could still get me nothing. I don't care.

165
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Michelle took it upon herself to buy something.

166
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Okay.

167
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
So blame her. Put the gun to her head.

168
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
I do.

169
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Alright.

170
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Fair enough.

171
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
My present is the one bullet.

172
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Please give it back.

173
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Oh, fancy that.

174
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
I rented you a gun.

175
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Oh no.

176
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Now neither of us have what we want this Christmas.

177
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,240
I sold all my ammunition to buy this ammunition.

178
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I sold all my guns to buy this ammunition.

179
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Now what are we going to do?

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,240
The tail is all this time.

181
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,240
What if I sold all my time to buy this pocket watch?

182
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Oh, alas, no time is left, so it has no function.

183
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Wait, isn't a watch?

184
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
No.

185
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,240
A watch is already part of the original story, Claude.

186
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Well, shit.

187
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Okay, I forgot.

188
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,240
What did the other guy sell in the watch?

189
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,240
The woman sells her hair to buy the guy a watch chain,

190
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,240
and the guy sells his watch to buy her combs for her hair.

191
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
And then he uses the chain to strangle her.

192
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
But just strangle to just shitty gift.

193
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,240
He used to strangle first himself and then his wife.

194
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Yes.

195
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Yeah, that's right.

196
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
As he fell, the chain wrapped around his throat.

197
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
That's a happy holiday ending.

198
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,240
They both said thank you, sir.

199
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,240
And then they fused together and became the super rat

200
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
that dominates the streets underneath

201
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,240
in the sewer system below Gotham City.

202
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
I believe that's what led to the creation of the superhero

203
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
known as The Rat Man.

204
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
That's my favorite villain.

205
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
He's got a deep floor.

206
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Deep.

207
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
It runs deep.

208
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Hey, you know, while we're on this tangential subject,

209
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
I have a public service announcement to make

210
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,240
because it's been quite entertaining for me to watch.

211
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
And this is a Michelle thing.

212
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,240
And it's that there have been quite a number of people.

213
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
It's been quite staggering to see

214
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
who have just been kind of assuming,

215
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
and this does relate to me,

216
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
that Michelle does not have a job

217
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
and is simply leaching off of me,

218
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
like as her whole lifestyle.

219
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
And look, we all know she gives off that vibe.

220
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
We're all very well aware

221
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
that Michelle certainly comes across that way.

222
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Yeah, I think I saw this on Twitter.

223
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
I don't remember when it started,

224
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,240
but I've seen her get annoyed about it.

225
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
And this was partially used as an insult to me.

226
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Nate, why don't you, what a loser,

227
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,240
stand up for your principles and blah, blah, blah,

228
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
and stop letting your girlfriend leech off you.

229
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
But I'm not gonna get into all the details

230
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
because whatever, it doesn't matter.

231
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,240
But Michelle financially more than pulls her weight

232
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
and has two jobs right now.

233
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
She definitely works, yeah.

234
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,240
And I mean, I hate to rush to this,

235
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,240
but it seems like a lot of people might think,

236
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
we got a pretty girl here,

237
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
we're just making some assumptions about,

238
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
no, she definitely doesn't work,

239
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
but she does is the thing.

240
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
So perhaps these people should perhaps check

241
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
their own assumptions before running away.

242
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Maybe they should check their own no job privilege.

243
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Actually, you know what was funny?

244
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
The person that Michelle was really fighting with on Twitter,

245
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
clearly was an unemployed person.

246
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
It's something along the lines of...

247
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Was he trying to build no job solidarity with her?

248
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
No, no, it was like,

249
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Michelle is such an asshole on Twitter,

250
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
which absolutely can be at times.

251
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Their case was that Michelle's such an asshole,

252
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
of course no one would hire her for any job,

253
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,240
and it just calls into question this person's understanding

254
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,240
of the nature of employment itself.

255
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,240
So I just assume they don't have jobs.

256
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Yeah, like a store would look up your Twitter profile.

257
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
They'd search your Twitter, like if you're a cashier,

258
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
they're going to be on your account.

259
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,240
Yes, I do, but like so many people don't give a shit.

260
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Yeah.

261
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Like the vast majority of jobs do not really care at all.

262
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,240
I mean, it's easy to pretend to be nice for like an hour

263
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
when you take a fucking job interview.

264
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Of course, and like all our parents tell us as we're growing up,

265
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
like, oh, I mean, I remember this like,

266
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Nate, there's a picture of you like at a party.

267
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Do you really want that on your Facebook?

268
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
What if an employer looks there one day?

269
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Oh my God.

270
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,240
I mean, sure mom, I suppose that's theoretically possible.

271
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
Remember when dad told us that we shouldn't swear on T-Bat?

272
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,240
I mean, based dad, right once again.

273
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
But you know.

274
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,240
He knew all those years ago that you're going to get demonetized

275
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
if you fucking did that shit.

276
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
We're at the very beginning.

277
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
We're not Compa compliant, dude.

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
No, we're not.

279
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
$46,000 video.

280
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I hope that T-Bap, you know, a channel that's been dead for years,

281
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,240
technically a new video last year, that was this year, okay.

282
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,240
But I hope we get sued for every single video on T-Bap

283
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,240
and we owe, you know, millions all told for $42,000 each video.

284
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
One can only hope.

285
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
One can only hope.

286
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Slime and punishment to pay for it all.

287
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
You know, I think we were going to name our channel,

288
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,240
like the channel name is Two Best Brothers Bitch About Ponies.

289
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Nobody gets it right.

290
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Even everybody spells it.

291
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
That's shocking.

292
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,240
It is shocking because it's so easy and it's obvious

293
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
if you think for a fucking second about it,

294
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
but everybody spells it with two Bs.

295
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Even people I would expect to understand.

296
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
It's true.

297
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
It's true.

298
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Three fucking Bs people.

299
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Are you just learning this now that that's the meaning of T-Bap?

300
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Yeah, I had no idea you guys bitched.

301
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
No.

302
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Okay.

303
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
I thought for a second.

304
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Because I've been shocked before by people that don't know.

305
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,240
It's on, like, it's on YouTube.

306
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
It's in words.

307
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Like, I can read.

308
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
It's in, like, every video we say the name of the video.

309
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
I had trouble pronouncing it.

310
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Not a single fucking comment on YouTube has ever spelled it right.

311
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
It is amazing.

312
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
I mean, I know three Bs.

313
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
You don't see it in words in English.

314
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,240
That's true, but this is an acronym and it means something.

315
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
I used to say T-Bap-Bap.

316
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
You did.

317
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Which was one B short, frankly.

318
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
I remember that.

319
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
It should be T-Bap-Bap-Bap.

320
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
And while it's not how I personally chose.

321
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,240
T-Bap-Bap-Bap is correct.

322
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Yeah, it's correct.

323
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
It's T-Bap-Bap.

324
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
And then back.

325
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Yeah, it's T-Bap-Bap-Bap.

326
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
T-Bap-Bap-Bap.

327
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Yeah, that's the right one.

328
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Thought went into it.

329
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Some.

330
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Some.

331
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Well, glad we cleared that up.

332
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Guys, stop being misogynistic against Michelle.

333
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
It's, you know, it's important.

334
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
Stop being misogynistic against T-Bap as well.

335
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
That's my job, guys.

336
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I give her enough of that at home.

337
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I give that for, you know, for when it really counts.

338
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
That will really get it to her.

339
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
That'll be good.

340
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Hey, while I'm speaking of domestic life, I'll spill my guts on my other thing I wanted

341
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,240
to bring up, which is just that perhaps you guys would be proud of me.

342
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,240
And it's that I've been a, call me a Britbong, because I've been a curry making fiend these

343
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
last several weeks and months.

344
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Is curry a British thing?

345
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
I too have been playing Pokemon.

346
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,240
It's like an adopted British thing.

347
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
There's a lot of Indian people in England.

348
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
And it's become a national dish.

349
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Did you culturally appropriate that?

350
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm so mad about this culture.

351
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,240
I'm so disappointed that the fucking, that fucking the white, that the great replacement

352
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,240
took place and now British culture doesn't exist anymore.

353
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
It is unfortunate.

354
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,240
In the Pokemon game, I don't know if you've played it yet.

355
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
You make curry.

356
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,240
It's like the thing you do in, like instead of poffins, there's curry.

357
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Yeah, it's kind of like how Chinese food in America is not the same as Chinese food

358
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
in China.

359
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
Like Indian food in England is not really right.

360
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,240
When I was in Germany, I remember I asked like, what's like some German food I should

361
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
try while I'm here?

362
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,240
And natives told me, how about curry worse?

363
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
And I was like, what curry?

364
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Like the Indian stuff?

365
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
And they're like, yeah, but like on a worst.

366
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Go get some.

367
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I had some of that.

368
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Sure.

369
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Cool.

370
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
And it was fine.

371
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
I don't like curry.

372
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
I don't think.

373
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
At least not the ones.

374
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
That's too bad.

375
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Yeah, I know.

376
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,240
I kind of, I want to like it, but it doesn't taste so good.

377
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Whatever in the same area.

378
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
You should let me make curry.

379
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Yeah, I was going to say it depends on the type because I've had Indian curry.

380
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,240
When you say curry, do you mean like the stew?

381
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Basically that's like a curry stew with like potatoes and meat and stuff.

382
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Okay.

383
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Let me tell you.

384
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Let me tell you.

385
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,740
So it's just, remember how I've talked about in the past, how about when I was in Japan,

386
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,240
I had curry and I love it and I miss it and I want all the time.

387
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
I made it.

388
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
I made it myself.

389
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,740
I found the solution because I'm not having an Indian curry, which is good, but not like

390
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,240
what I wanted.

391
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,840
I've been buying like a couple of types, but like golden curry, it's specifically the Japanese

392
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,240
curry brand and with that, what it is, it's still, I mean, okay, so you fry your meat.

393
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,240
You can get that stuff in, you can get that stuff in like, it comes in like, in like rectangles.

394
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
You can get it like Asian markets here.

395
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Yeah.

396
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Yeah.

397
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Absolutely.

398
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Absolutely.

399
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,240
You can get some like other, you know, types or different flavor, but this like, this is

400
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
the flavor I've been seeking.

401
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,740
So let me just tell you what I put in this.

402
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
I've used pork on Thanksgiving.

403
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,240
I made turkey curry and it was fucking delicious.

404
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
We, what else do I use?

405
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
I like that.

406
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Thinking outside of the box.

407
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
Right?

408
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
That's what we were doing.

409
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,560
Always after like Christmas, all the leftover meat gets turned into a big curry that is

410
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,680
used for weeks on end because it's so much usually.

411
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
It's so good.

412
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
It's so good.

413
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
I love it.

414
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
I mean, here's the X factor.

415
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
I bet you're going to get into this.

416
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,680
So we put potatoes and onions and all those delicious things in and what's the other one,

417
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Michelle?

418
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,480
Like cabbage, but, but what we did on Thanksgiving and we've been doing a lot, we've been chopping

419
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,160
up sweet potatoes and putting sweet potatoes into the curry.

420
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,200
And boy, when you bite into these fucking sweet potatoes, I'm on the fucking moon.

421
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,080
It's, it's so delicious and I made it.

422
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
I'm so proud.

423
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,880
We put it over delicious white rice cooked in my white rice cooker.

424
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,480
Well, it's just a rice cooker, whatever.

425
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,280
And you, you pour your slop on there.

426
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
And you put rice into this.

427
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
God damn it.

428
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,240
It's so delicious and I've been making it, it is great.

429
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
It is.

430
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
And here's what you do.

431
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,960
I mean, in your rice cooker, you make it once, you've got rice to last you like a couple

432
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
days.

433
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,080
You make your big batch of curry.

434
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,680
You make like two batches at once and that'll last you several days, like several meals.

435
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,680
And we just sit down and we eat it at our little Japanese table, uh, you know, sitting

436
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,280
a fuck, uh, say is a style or whatever with our chopsticks in hand.

437
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
You sit on your knees.

438
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
And shovel it down.

439
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,040
I don't fucking tatami mats.

440
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
I try.

441
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
You can't do it for long.

442
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,880
I don't know how the fucking way to manage it.

443
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Jesus Christ.

444
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Michelle insisted she wanted a Japanese table, so I bought it for her for her birthday.

445
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,680
Do you have like the, do you have like the, what's it called, the, the mat, the, the,

446
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,520
the, no wait, not the mat, the, the, the cushions, it's the heater, the thing.

447
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
A futon.

448
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,400
We do not have a, uh, what's it called, the thing they sit under.

449
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
No, we don't have that.

450
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,000
Look, we're not that deep into this.

451
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's just a low table.

452
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Okay.

453
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,120
Just sitting with your Japanese table, eating your Japanese curry.

454
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,560
Well, speak of the Japanese tongue and make videos about the Japanese anime and record

455
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
your Japanese podcast.

456
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,080
People have been mocking me lately for my less than fluent understanding of the Japanese

457
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
language.

458
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
And you know what?

459
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Fair, fair.

460
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
I've, uh, you know, I'm not, not the best.

461
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,720
Uh, anyway, uh, just, I've been actually cooking.

462
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,840
It's been curry.

463
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,400
It's been the taste that I've been seeking in my life and I brought it back through my

464
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
own effort.

465
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Yeah.

466
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Thank you, Mage.

467
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
It feels great.

468
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,320
I've been cooking packs so I can keep making curry every damn day.

469
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
It's been a revolution.

470
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,120
Was this inspired by playing Pokemon or was this completely coincidental?

471
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,840
It was completely coincidental.

472
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
What is Pokemon?

473
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,920
And your Pokemon instead of puffins, they have curries.

474
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,360
You make curries to feed your Pokemon when you do camps.

475
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
So.

476
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Oh, got it.

477
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Indeed.

478
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Yeah.

479
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
Hence Brit Bung thing.

480
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,720
You know, I'm trying to think, but I don't know exactly what inspired it or made me think

481
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
of it.

482
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,160
I guess we just had rice and I was like, what should I put in this rice?

483
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Curry maybe?

484
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
I don't know.

485
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Wow.

486
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,120
Got to be in that scene from Fully Cooley where they eat the really hot curry.

487
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,400
Oh yeah.

488
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
You know what?

489
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,120
Like Indian curry is like spicy.

490
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,360
This shit's not spicy at all.

491
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
I don't like spicy.

492
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
It's like cinnamon flavor.

493
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Kind of.

494
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
What?

495
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
It's like sweet curry.

496
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Interesting.

497
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
It's not.

498
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,520
It just has like elements of that.

499
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,640
It's still, I don't know, curry flavor, whatever that is.

500
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Well, I know.

501
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
It's just got like no taste.

502
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,280
No, it's just like to tell them like.

503
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,720
I guess my brain immediately went sweet.

504
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
You said cinnamon for something.

505
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,240
I think it's American re-associated.

506
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,520
I think like cinnamon gets put with a lot of sweet things because it works.

507
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Yeah.

508
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
Exactly.

509
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Exactly.

510
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Well, there you go.

511
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Life update.

512
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
All right.

513
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
You're welcome.

514
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
All right.

515
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Cooking more.

516
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
It feels good.

517
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,120
Well, I got a story for you this week.

518
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm having a shit week so far.

519
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I did some hard drugs.

520
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Oh, no.

521
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
I did some hard drugs.

522
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
No, I didn't.

523
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
I did some real shit.

524
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

525
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Was that a PCP?

526
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
No.

527
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
No, I did Molly.

528
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Which one of us is going to do it first?

529
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
Someone has to.

530
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
At some point.

531
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
No.

532
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
No, I did.

533
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
What's Molly?

534
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
I did Molly and it sucked.

535
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
I believe you.

536
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
It's what they call a marrow wound.

537
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
I don't know.

538
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Maybe.

539
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Molly is slang for it.

540
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Oh, God.

541
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
An illegal street drug.

542
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Oh, yes.

543
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Oh, no.

544
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
I guess it's MDMA.

545
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
A commonly known as.

546
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Joe Rogan says I should do that daily or something.

547
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
So.

548
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
No, that's MMA.

549
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Oops.

550
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Oh, yeah.

551
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Oh, God.

552
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Commonly known as ecstasy.

553
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Oh, God.

554
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
So I guess I did ecstasy.

555
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
It wasn't even good.

556
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
I didn't even like it.

557
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Okay.

558
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Okay.

559
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
You want to describe the sensation?

560
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
I just made a fool of myself and embarrassed myself and felt bad about it.

561
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
So it was just a normal day.

562
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Still do it.

563
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Yeah.

564
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Pretty much.

565
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:40,420
Well, I went to a friend invited me out to a thing of just like a bunch of guys sitting

566
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,720
around someone's house just like fucking around drinking whatever, smoking weed, vaping.

567
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,120
I don't personally smoke weed.

568
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
So I didn't do that.

569
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
But whatever.

570
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,420
Just drank a bunch of hard seltzers, you know, like my man, baby Yoda.

571
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,320
You guys see that baby Yoda holding a white claw tattoo?

572
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Yeah.

573
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,420
No, but I can imagine a tattoo of it.

574
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
What the fuck?

575
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:06,120
A tattoo of baby Yoda holding a white claw seltzer that is culture in a nutshell right

576
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
there.

577
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:16,620
Oh God, someone got that tattoo and then, oh fuck, it's one of the, shit, is it one

578
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:23,920
of the guys on Come Town or one of the guys on Chapo Trap House or some like Twitch streamer

579
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,020
collective, like one of them just like pretended it was his and like all his friends, people

580
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,860
that there's a big joke is like, oh yeah, this guy on this podcast, like he totally

581
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
got that.

582
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,280
He was so great with his new baby Yoda holding a white claw seltzer tattoo and the guy with

583
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:43,120
a real tattoo was like really mad that this guy is like stolen his thunder.

584
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Now that's stolen valor right now.

585
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,160
He had a chance to dodge this bullet and he's not.

586
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
What a fool.

587
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,360
I could have pretended it never happened, but no.

588
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,520
Okay, but anyway, so we're there and then like one of these guys and this guy, he's

589
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,600
got long hair, he wears a beanie so you know he's a fucking, you know what, you know the

590
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:09,420
type, you know the type and I'm a few hard seltzers in at this point and he's just like

591
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,860
hey dudes, whoa or something, I forget what he says and he drops these two like bright

592
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:19,340
green pills on the table and I'm like what the fuck is that and he's like it's Molly

593
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,820
and I'm like and I think back and I lived in California, I lived with a guy and one

594
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,340
day him and his girlfriend did Molly and I saw them later and all it did, the guy was

595
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,720
just really, he was just really smiley, he just seemed like he was like super happy and

596
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,000
he just kept telling his girlfriend how cute her babies would be and I was like that seems

597
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
pretty fun.

598
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Unrelated to him I assume.

599
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,080
Yeah, so I was like that seems fine and I was and I'm like okay guys, how much is this

600
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,920
gonna fuck me up and they're like okay just take half, if you've never done it before

601
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:57,040
just take half and I'm like okay great compromise, so I take half anyway shouldn't it done it.

602
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,900
It was a nightmare, what was bad about it is that I felt at all times like I was perfectly

603
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:08,740
in control of myself, I didn't feel, I mean I guess I felt kind of warm and tingly but

604
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,300
I didn't feel like I was high or fucked up but at the same time I could tell from the

605
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,540
reactions of people around me that that was absolutely not the case, I was being super

606
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:25,740
weird, I walked home, okay people told me a bunch of different things, people told me

607
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,840
that I kept asking the same questions over and over again, like I would get an answer

608
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,480
and then I would ask the same thing like a minute later.

609
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,520
Someone else told me that apparently like all night I was like stomping around the kitchen,

610
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,000
I was like stomping around the kitchen talking to myself, apparently I would walk to the

611
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:55,320
fridge, open the refrigerator, look inside, say vile and then like do it again on loop.

612
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:03,060
As a post food boy that's my general experience, I would believe you do, that sounds so me,

613
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:08,780
that sounds so me, none of this is keto, someone else told me that I like alternated between

614
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:14,620
cackling and weeping, which also sounds totally me but like in a very embarrassing and shitty

615
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:22,340
way, eventually one of my friends like fucking yelled at me like go fuck to bed, like fuck

616
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,800
you I have work in the morning and I'm sure even at the time I was like okay obviously

617
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:34,560
I'm acting like a fucking moron and I'm being obnoxious, I feel terrible but wait there

618
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,960
was one more thing, there was like one, oh okay the worst thing about it was in the middle

619
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,040
of it right, like four in the fucking morning, I am just like stomping around presumably

620
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,960
thinking like I'm a perfectly cogent actor at the moment and I'm like hey we live in

621
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:58,540
a neighborhood and I don't know my neighbors, why don't I introduce myself to my neighbor,

622
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
what time was this?

623
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:06,580
Like four in the morning, okay, so I just walk to the, and I'm zoning to say I'm possessed,

624
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,740
like the problems I keep at 300, I just walk to the neighbor's house and I just go up to

625
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,660
their porch and I just knock on their door and I'm just like standing there like yeah

626
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,860
I'm just gonna say hi, I'm Ben, nice to meet you, I live next door, what a great time,

627
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,800
but one of my roommates sees me from his window I think and he like comes out and gets me

628
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,080
and is like dude what the fuck are you doing, it was miserable, it was totally miserable.

629
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,720
That's one of those things that under normal circumstances, in a normal time of day is

630
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,140
a perfectly nice thing to do, but I've given this, I just didn't get it, I just didn't

631
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,040
understand and then the next day, so yesterday, they did actually, they came and they knocked

632
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,720
on my door and they were like well someone knocking on our door yesterday and I had to

633
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:55,540
be like I'm sorry, that was me, I was high and I thought it would make sense, I apologize

634
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,740
and won't do it again and there was a guy and a girl and the girl was just like making

635
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:07,740
a very concerned face like oh okay, but the guy behind it was like yeah man, I get it,

636
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:14,820
that's like our feet sweet, at least it always makes sense, we've all been there, so at least

637
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,240
one of them got it, so it's fine.

638
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
That's good, that's good.

639
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,160
And that's how I got to 50% of my neighbors to like me.

640
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,280
So that was my weekend.

641
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,200
Have you felt sense, like physically?

642
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,680
I was kind of hungover the next day, but I think it was just because of, and it wasn't

643
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,800
even that bad, I didn't even have a headache or anything, all told it was pretty, I mean

644
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,320
I just felt morally, I just felt morally bad, morally hungover.

645
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,100
Be careful man, the moral high grounds, all you have left at this stage of the game.

646
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:51,500
Just because I had annoyed and been a nuisance to all my roommates and shit, so that sucks.

647
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,260
I still have to apologize to a few of them.

648
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,420
Like you came on Discord, presumably right after.

649
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,540
Yeah, I saw that and I was like oh Jesus, why did I do that, I'm such a fucking loser.

650
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,540
What happened, what happened?

651
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,060
Well he just came on and explained that and I was there and I was talking to him and I

652
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
realized that he was still high.

653
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,240
Oh I was still high, I was still high as bald.

654
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,160
But like now I'm thinking about, you didn't mention, cause obviously you weren't like,

655
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,040
you didn't know all the facts at the time, but you may have been like standing out front

656
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,400
of the door like knocking repeatedly over and over again in a loop.

657
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,280
No, no, that was inside, I had already come inside at that point I think.

658
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,200
No I mean like afterwards, like you were talking on Discord, but like when you went to knock

659
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,500
on the neighbor's door, like if you were doing other things in a loop, maybe you knocked

660
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,900
on their door for like 10 minutes.

661
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,900
I might have done it multiple times, a lot of it is a blur.

662
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,740
Shit, fair enough.

663
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
So you know.

664
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,900
That's pretty epic by the way.

665
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:57,460
So the thing about it is like, what's annoying about it is that it was a shitty trip because

666
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,660
I didn't even realize I was high at the time, I didn't feel like I was doing anything weird,

667
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,420
it felt normal and like, what's the point of that?

668
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
What's the point if you feel normal?

669
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
It's all downsides to me.

670
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Yeah, so I don't know, not the best, whatever.

671
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,040
Right, I mean now I suppose you know your neighbor and one of them at least thinks he's not really

672
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
worse.

673
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
It's like ignorance anyway.

674
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
They know that I'm a fucking weirdo.

675
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,520
Oh yeah, yeah, well that was inevitable I suppose, unless they just never met you.

676
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,640
It's like nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?

677
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
I guess so.

678
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,240
So you're known as the Molly Knocker.

679
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,240
I'm saying audience to Molly Knocker, I guess.

680
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
Ooh, yeah.

681
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,060
Catchy, catchy.

682
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,060
Not bad.

683
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,060
Urban legend.

684
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,060
Incredible.

685
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,060
This fucking, the legends tell of a guy who at four in the morning would be like, hey

686
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:52,660
I'm your neighbor, how's it going?

687
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,540
It sucks because lately I've been thinking like I should introduce myself to my neighbors,

688
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,180
maybe I should like get a pie, like bring a pie over or something, be like hi, what's

689
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,180
up?

690
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,180
Well now I fucking blown it.

691
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,680
You know, I don't think that's necessary.

692
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,000
I think where there's a will, like okay, is this a problem just theoretically to examine

693
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,600
if one could perhaps make any kind of way to be like positively know your neighbors?

694
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,480
Like is it potentially possible?

695
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Yes.

696
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,520
Would it take perhaps more effort than it would have from the start?

697
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
That's possible.

698
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
That's possible.

699
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Now it's going to take two pies.

700
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
It might take two.

701
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
It might take two.

702
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,520
It might be worried about what's in the pies at this point.

703
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,580
The store bought pie and still sealed up.

704
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,580
Have it sealed?

705
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Yeah.

706
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
Yeah.

707
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,380
They'll notice a few syringe holes in the side as they're opening it up.

708
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:46,100
So that's my fucking weekend story.

709
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,340
What do they call it?

710
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,540
That like curve or whatever where there's a certain time when, like I just had a neighbor,

711
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,500
like one of the neighbors in the house I live in, he moved out recently.

712
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:02,800
I had had a handful of exchanges with that guy and the vast majority of them were as

713
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,400
I was moving in because I just was outside the most inevitably he like couldn't help

714
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,360
but interact with me a little bit as he went into his place or whatever.

715
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,920
I was moving my shit in like since then we've exchanged like maybe a dozen words.

716
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,800
And then after like over a year of living here, he moved away and he seemed like a pretty

717
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
cool guy.

718
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,560
I think it was like a military guy.

719
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,740
He was like Asian or something.

720
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,940
And frequently I would see him playing his computer.

721
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,100
I think World of Warcraft late into the evening and also so he wasn't a total loser.

722
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,940
I don't know, maybe like once a month or whatever.

723
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,580
He would bring like a bunch of friends into like this little like kind of glass, kind of

724
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,700
like a little, I don't know, like a little glassed in area that kind of stuck out of

725
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,260
his apartment, which was a nice area.

726
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,860
He would sit there with a bunch of friends and they would all play board games together.

727
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,980
And I thought many times, it is neat.

728
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,640
I thought I should just go down to that guy, knock his door, so like, hey, dude, you know,

729
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,440
couldn't help but notice you play games or something.

730
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,280
How would you feel about like me and Michelle bringing a pie and just hanging out?

731
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Because I don't know.

732
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,680
Yeah, like I've seen our neighbors like through their way, like we see, we see him play Smash

733
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Bros and stuff.

734
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Yeah.

735
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Yeah.

736
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,720
They just seem like dudes like of like similar age to like the people that live in this house.

737
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,320
We could probably hang out if we wanted to.

738
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,760
We just nobody does.

739
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,420
We're just all cowards these days and we're too stuck in our Amazon Prime machines.

740
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,620
We're too busy on our Samsung Galaxy and playing Pokemon Go.

741
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:30,260
I mean, on the one hand, like Calidus, but on the other hand, we can speak to people

742
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,180
through a wire, so we don't need to go outside to talk.

743
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,260
Like if we're lonely, we could just have a chat.

744
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,660
I think there are important things that you get through a face-to-face interaction that

745
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,460
cannot be replicated through a digital.

746
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
It is true.

747
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
The lessons.

748
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
It's hard.

749
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
It's hard to feel that.

750
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,860
It's like some reason for you to stay inside compared to us.

751
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
It's kind of like the same thing.

752
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,660
You don't need courage when you have fucking Molly.

753
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Like courage, yeah.

754
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,260
So pop some pills and go say hi to your fellow man, I guess.

755
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:01,380
I think of these things and I would encourage others to think of it as well as like socialization

756
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,260
in general is very much like exercise.

757
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,400
It's something that doesn't exactly feel good to start to do, but once you've got going

758
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,060
and especially after you've done it, you feel really good about it and it's definitely

759
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,260
good for you.

760
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,500
So you know, I should do more for sure.

761
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
I should, exactly.

762
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
I mean, I should have done with that guy.

763
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
He moved away.

764
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Whatever.

765
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,060
I guarantee there will be a million other chances in my life to say hi to a neighbor or something.

766
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,860
But I mean, I live in a really poor neighborhood right now, so he was kind of the only one

767
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,780
that I was even thinking of doing that with.

768
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,700
So I mean, I don't interact with the poor, as you know me.

769
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,700
No, no, no.

770
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,700
So I would never.

771
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
No value to extract there.

772
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
No, sir.

773
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Yeah.

774
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:45,340
I wanted to talk a little bit about crochet.

775
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,340
Please do.

776
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,340
Oh, yeah.

777
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,940
Oh, I saw you did the thing.

778
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
Oh, yes.

779
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,940
Talk about it.

780
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,100
So last year I was getting into crochet and I was crocheting a few things and it was it

781
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
was really nothing.

782
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:05,860
It was I had this Christmas gift from a while ago, which was like a Star Wars Yoda crochet

783
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,860
Christmas gift.

784
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
Baby Yoda.

785
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
Yeah.

786
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,020
No.

787
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,100
It was a pre baby Yoda, pre baby Groot.

788
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,740
And I didn't want to make a Yoda.

789
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,980
So I just used the yarn to make whatever and I discovered that I like crochet.

790
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,100
The book that it came with was too hard to follow.

791
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,460
So I looked at YouTube tutorials, obviously really, you know, much better and I learned

792
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,620
how to do a basic crochet and I made it like an arm bracelet, which I gave to Munchie, which

793
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,620
he still has.

794
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,620
And that's cool.

795
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,980
I asked for some yarn for for that Christmas and then I didn't use it.

796
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,740
It's just been sitting on my desk, but bullseye and I was like, finally, just decided to

797
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,060
start using it again.

798
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,580
And it's it's really fun.

799
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,140
I'm not really doing anything like I posted on Twitter.

800
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,620
I made a big rectangle, which is basically just a repetitive repetitive task, making

801
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,900
a crochet in a line and turning around and going the other way and just going this way

802
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
in that way.

803
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,700
And I made a rectangle and it was cool and I can use it to put pins on.

804
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,860
So now I have a place for my pin collection.

805
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,060
It's not it's the Puba.

806
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
It's Puba pin.

807
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
Yeah.

808
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
All on there.

809
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,260
Dude, speaking of pins, I think my fucking heart pins are due to arrive any day now.

810
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,860
Fuck fucking I'm fucking juiced.

811
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,860
What about the other pins?

812
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Did you already have the book ones?

813
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,700
I already I already have the book pins and the Puba pins.

814
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,620
I've just I've got enough left over from the last one.

815
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,100
I didn't have to order anymore.

816
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Oh, OK.

817
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Miraculously.

818
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:43,100
And I'm thinking like the the the the stereotype is like grandma knitting like Christmas sweaters

819
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,620
for all of her grandkids and they hate you because they suck.

820
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:53,460
I'm not really into like knitting, you know, entire sweaters yet also take a while, but

821
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,420
I am thinking like I could maybe knit like this is really gay is really really gay, but

822
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:06,180
I'm thinking of knitting like clothes for like the brisker and punk plush that I have

823
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:12,420
like a little like a little like little mittens or something just as a like a little project.

824
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,420
He's kind of gay.

825
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,420
It is.

826
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,420
It's pretty sick.

827
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,420
No, it's precious.

828
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,420
Do it.

829
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,420
It's precious.

830
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,940
Like that's not that's not a good look.

831
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
That's not good.

832
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,940
Like for a man.

833
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
I get fucking crucified.

834
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,180
No, I mean, I mean, I'm I'm about results.

835
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,820
So like if knitting is the fastest and most efficient way to achieve whatever ends you're

836
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:37,660
looking for in this case, I guess to obtain highly specific cloth goods, then like I would

837
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,020
say absolutely go for it.

838
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,700
It's the only thing that makes sense.

839
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,740
I am thinking like eventually eventually I want to be I was like making this rectangle

840
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:51,140
and I was learning a few basic crochets like the crochet, the half double crochet, which

841
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,020
is cool, the double crochet, which is even cooler, and then the triple crochet, which

842
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,220
is a little bit a little bit too far.

843
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,700
And I was doing those and I was like, OK, this is pretty good.

844
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,420
I want to learn some new patterns.

845
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,780
I want to learn some something that isn't just a rectangle, something that's slightly

846
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
more complex.

847
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,860
And I looked on you on online, found a bunch of things.

848
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:18,300
But there was like this one blog, I mean, all the all these blogs, they're all very feminine,

849
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,100
very gay, very girly, very pink and very pointless.

850
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:29,580
There was so much of like stupid shit that no one would ever need.

851
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,900
Is it like, is it like how when you look up a recipe, every fucking recipe you find is

852
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:41,140
preceded by like 14 paragraphs of like some wine mom explaining about how she was struck

853
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:46,620
for inspiration for this thing, like while she was like hiking in the Alps or something.

854
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,180
White middle class wine mom crochet is like they've got the market corner.

855
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,500
There's no cool crochet guys.

856
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,260
I couldn't be the only man who don't crochet.

857
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:02,420
I want to like I want to like use the white yarn I have and make a skull, a 3D skull and

858
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,860
that's going to be really difficult.

859
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,700
But like there's no fucking plans like that I can blueprints for a skull I can find.

860
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:16,380
I can make like I can make like a mermaid dress for a baby, but I don't want to do that.

861
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,780
That's a stupid idea.

862
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,940
Babies want to eat stuff.

863
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,300
They want to put plastic in their mouths and throw it.

864
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
That's what they want.

865
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,500
You don't make them yarn while like your blanket would be nice.

866
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,300
It'd be cool to make the skull and then like have that like plan available to others who

867
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
were similarly predisposed to want that.

868
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,340
You can make little hats for babies if you want to make something for kids.

869
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Fuck babies.

870
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,340
Nobody likes babies.

871
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,980
They should all die and burn and you know.

872
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,900
I don't know any babies' personalities and agree with it.

873
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:52,540
But yeah like the next step I guess is like finding baby clothes but just making them

874
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,660
like fit the plushies I have which is again really gay.

875
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,060
I don't want to stress that I know how gay this is.

876
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,420
I just like crocheting so I don't care.

877
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,420
Okay.

878
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,420
Well it makes sense to me.

879
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,420
That's like not gay at all.

880
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,100
That's the opposite of gay.

881
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:10,900
Like I'm just I'm going to do it fuck what everyone else thinks that's big dick energy.

882
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,900
Go for it.

883
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,300
Make it happen.

884
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,100
I think if you if you want the final product then it only makes sense.

885
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Yeah.

886
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,860
It's totally totally reasonable to me eventually.

887
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,340
Eventually I may be at a point where like I like it enough and I'm good at it enough

888
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,060
to like be an Etsy boy dude like Etsy things.

889
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,060
Sure.

890
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:36,260
Like hey I'll make like obscure weird masculine things but in crochet form if you want instead

891
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:41,380
of like gay bears and and and smiley phases that everyone else does I'll make a skull

892
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,300
for you I'll I'll do that and ship it to you and you'll I'll make I'll make a skull cozy

893
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:55,620
for your Dan Ackeroids crystal skull I'll make a fucking coffin for you a coffin cozy

894
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:02,660
for my deceased baby who Nate aforementionedly was going to incinerate and you know providing

895
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,540
a service people need here mage well if you're going to incinerate it and earn cozy would

896
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,060
probably you know you're right much much simpler design yeah let's not be on the subject

897
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,500
of the masculinity of such activities it's I mean it sounds to me like at least part

898
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,900
of the inspiration here seems to be that like the sheer enjoyment of kind of having a repetitive

899
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:27,820
task is is kind of relaxing I don't I don't have that much time to do a lot of repetitive

900
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:34,900
tasks but you know because it's like I'm either drawing or I'm working I'm writing when I'm

901
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,420
listening to something that I could turn my brain off at right which is why I had to stop

902
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:45,980
yarn for a bit and I want to get back into it to do to do some sort of pen but it is

903
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,540
very nice it's like it takes a while which is kind of the the toughest thing about it

904
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:56,100
because you need you need time obviously there's loads of there's lots of content there's lots

905
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:02,540
of content and there's podcasts that I can listen to for that but it's like an issue

906
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,700
of like time in the day right you have to dedicate that time to doing that thing even

907
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,540
if you have plenty to listen to it's hard to like do any other like obviously you're both

908
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:17,140
your hands are being used up but I can't even really think of like my own projects because

909
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:22,740
that's like strenuous so I have to just sort of veg out and do yarn for a whole day and

910
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:29,860
it's I mean it kind of reminds me of I just think of like I mean I now I'm a capital

911
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:35,020
G gamer and there's nothing more masculine than that but after a hard gaming sesh I mean

912
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:41,620
what do I have to show for it you know only the sick trophies on your Xbox live yeah that's

913
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:49,540
the thing and there's nothing more masculine than that I'll make a PS4 cozy for you so

914
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:54,340
that it can warm up and overheat so it'll overheat yeah it's just like make a CPU cozy

915
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:01,020
for me so it can get way overheated and burn up while I'm playing burn out paradise overclocked

916
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:07,340
oh hey you know what oh yeah going on video games are you gonna talk about cross crisis

917
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:12,940
cringe cringe okay well you cross code this game I've been enjoying so much I mean I could

918
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,700
say yeah I talked about last time they still still going strong recommended for everybody

919
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,460
but that's that's it same for me with Divinity Originals in two also still playing still

920
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:32,220
fun I had to restart the game now instead of eight buckets I had 16 so there you go buckets

921
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,300
of blood yeah and I'm still going I'm I still gathered by because sadly I had to sell some

922
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:44,780
of them off because they were taking up inventory but I still keep gathering them now I mean

923
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:51,220
and you gave him playing your own big ol video yeah so I obsessively I've been like I finished

924
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,660
the yarn and then I immediately filled my time with some other bullshit which was a video

925
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:02,700
game called Nino Kuni 2 Revenant King he don't try and try not to spoil because I'm gonna

926
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:09,180
play it as soon as I'm done okay first one yeah that they are not related story wise

927
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:14,420
whatsoever as far as I understand so but I won't spoil any of the story but the the basic

928
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:23,140
gist of this is that it's like an RPG about a little boy prince who is overthrown his kingdom

929
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:29,100
his cat kingdom he's a cat boy and there are cat people there's a lot of furries in this game

930
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:37,340
they're all very nicely drawn and 3d rendered so it's not like gross or anything totally cool

931
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:41,940
yeah so it's totally cool they're all smooth there's no there's no like fur physics involved

932
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:49,140
it's great god this prince was like attacked his kingdom was attacked and he was thrown out

933
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:58,100
ready to run away and in it he he wants to try and get back his kingdom but he can't like you

934
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:03,260
know do anything by himself because he's on his own and so he has to try and build a kingdom

935
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:11,140
himself but with the intent of like because he's you know born to rule in it literally because he's

936
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,660
a prince and he's like I'm gonna be born to rule the world is I'm gonna be a 10,000 dead cops

937
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:24,900
right understood and your mission or your your quest is about building a kingdom and then

938
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,780
uniting the kingdoms together in peace and it's you know beyond that is a very basic RPG

939
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:41,060
cultural victory of civilization yes right okay and so it's it's it's a good game I'm

940
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:47,300
trying to think of I'll just talk about gameplay it's action RPG you run around and you you see

941
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:53,260
monsters in the field there's like the world map is your tiny chibi people and you run around you

942
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:59,420
see them and you see the monsters you run into them you can run away from them and then there's

943
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:07,980
in 3d whoa can you still recruit the monsters or did they get rid of that you can't recruit

944
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:13,220
monsters the the whole thing is the monsters are you know just monsters you kill them but you

945
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:20,580
recruit people in villages and towns for your kingdom that is its own like mini game large

946
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:26,900
part of the game but like mini game thing so it's a town building game where you have Kings

947
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:33,260
Guilders which is like currency for spending on building projects and fortifications and army

948
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:40,620
stuff and research on new technologies so that like if you get your if you want like a specific

949
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:46,540
character to have a really powerful ranged weapon you build your research ranged weapon stuff

950
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:53,620
upgrades in your armory weapon shop and then you can go shop there and you can buy it and it's all

951
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:58,140
it's it's it's real so you have to put in resources to research your thing and now and then you

952
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:03,340
don't even get it you have to buy you yeah yeah it makes sense it makes sense that's how

953
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,380
people should probably be aware as well it's by level five who made dark cloud and what not

954
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:14,780
yes yes I was speaking about this tonight a few days ago it's it's it feels a lot like dark cloud

955
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:22,180
three because there's the whole dungeon crawling or monster slashing action stuff what what is it

956
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:27,780
called it's like action RPG where you run and roll and dodge and you press the buttons in real time

957
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:35,300
I guess action RPG is the best one we got for that Dark Souls-esque perhaps it's it's like it's like

958
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:42,540
it's like Kingdom Hearts and Dark Souls and a little bit of Okami it's turn based isn't it

959
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:48,700
the Dark Souls of Kingdom Hearts it is it is it is real time action RPG you run around right like

960
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:56,980
the first one yeah you you kill you kill and you gain power and that's why I like to hear that's

961
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:02,100
all I needed to hear I mean yeah the thing the thing that I really like it's got the endorsement

962
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:09,260
there's all the different nations there's this ocean nation where everybody's a blue fish person

963
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:17,500
and a lot of the blue fish ladies also have red hair so undyne is in this game oh and you can

964
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,660
recruit a few undynes to add to your army and your kingdom and they all have different skills some

965
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,220
of them are good at you know spell stuff others are good at weapon things and there's loads of

966
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:32,020
different buildings you can get and then you upgrade your kingdom it starts as a like a little

967
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:42,460
sort of wooden sort of thank you a rustic wooden like Viking town hall thing yeah few tents and

968
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,740
then you upgrade it to level 2 and it's got walls and there are buildings with bricks and then the

969
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:52,540
music changes and it's more bombastic and now level 3 it's like a huge sprawling thing you've got a

970
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:57,020
shipyard you've got this and then that and then the music is even more bombastic and level 4 is

971
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,980
just around the corner so basically you lose your kingdom you make a new kingdom you make a new

972
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:07,260
kingdom and then I don't I don't I don't want to spoil but there's a really cool thing with what

973
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:16,060
happens with the guy who overthrows you because the choices are make peace with him or go to war

974
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:21,420
with him and it's like ooh what's gonna happen wait we're quite interesting Nino Kuni to Revenant

975
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:28,100
Kingdom yeah it's on it's sounds like a very satisfying gameplay loop it is a it is a very

976
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,580
satisfying gameplay loop I haven't explained it the best because I don't think some of these things

977
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,620
are hard to just know I want to look up some images so I can look at look at trailer footage

978
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:43,260
it that the thing that really got me into it was like why does it look like Ghibli it I think it's

979
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,340
a lot of Ghibli people the guy who does a lot of good reason why it looks like a fucking Ghibli

980
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:55,300
because Ghibli people are involved the guy yeah that the guy who does most of the Ghibli music

981
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:01,300
soundtracks does the soundtrack for this game and it's very nice the art direction is really good

982
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:07,620
and it has art direction which you can't say for every game every every some games they just want

983
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:14,180
to be like let's put a lens flare in there and I hate it turn it off this game has bright colors

984
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:19,700
beautiful designs of things the one thing I would say is that the story is a bit basic and

985
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:27,380
like baby's first RPG the bad guy is just bad and you go and kill and it's it's simple simplistic

986
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,820
there's not a lot of like hard questions being asked about the politics of like starting a kingdom

987
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:38,420
in a place and disposing like bandits who used to live there and and but you know is it is it

988
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:42,980
whimsical because I really love the first one because it was so whimsical and there's so many

989
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:48,900
puns and stuff and I love it I've heard well it is whimsical it's funny and cute and it's very

990
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,740
wholesome it's a very very wholesome feeling thing oh I'm glad um I have want to play it now I have

991
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:00,020
heard a little bit that there are maybe due to the scope of like the amount of people there's a

992
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:07,460
lot of side quests to get people in your kingdom um I don't know for what reason but people have

993
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:12,900
said that the first game has a lot of cutscenes and a lot of writing prowess there's a lot of

994
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,060
really in you know you really care about the characters a lot and the story is good sure

995
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:23,060
nino kuni two people say it sort of falters in the story department and the characterization

996
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:27,300
and a lot of there's not that many cutscenes there's one there's a few big ones at the

997
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,820
beginning and apparently some of the end I haven't eaten it yet but most of like the story stuff is

998
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:40,100
like characters standing around talking in text which I don't mind personally because like I'm

999
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:46,180
used to I'm used to old games where fully voice acted stuff was just not a thing so I still like

1000
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:51,220
that right I mean these days a lot of that can be more trouble than it's worth and be more of a

1001
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,180
downside than anything if it like stops you to try to watch a cutscene that's so good I don't know

1002
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:01,060
so it depends I mean yeah it's it's not like a terrible thing like I didn't know that the first

1003
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,780
game had better writing and I was perfectly satisfied with what I'd been experiencing so

1004
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:10,900
it's it's a good good good time just just because something is supposedly better doesn't mean the

1005
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:16,100
other thing is bad no I like this little I like this little Lisa Simpson ass bitch oh yeah I kept

1006
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:21,700
calling him Lisa Simpson he's the king maker every every host and I don't know what you're

1007
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:27,060
talking about every it's the cute animal sidekick is like a spiky-headed like yellow blowfish thing

1008
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:32,020
and like a red robe and it looks it's it's literally Lisa it looks I believe you but yeah

1009
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:38,260
paste it in the damn chat all right fine that guy that guy's called lofty and he is um the king

1010
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:45,460
maker of young evan every king has to have a king maker in order to be recognized as such

1011
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:51,940
and so there's like every kingdom has their king maker and a huge massive grandiose beasts and

1012
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:58,020
then Evan gets this tiny little Lisa Simpson guy who has like a Welsh accent like a very strong

1013
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:04,740
Welsh accent it's kind of it's kind of hard to like parse some of the text because they do a lot of

1014
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:12,420
like um English accents in like phonetically written and his well stuff is a bit hard to

1015
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:20,420
parse sometimes and there's these very up north like Manchester sort of characters who are um

1016
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,420
like shipwrights and it's kind of impossible to tell what they're saying you have to really

1017
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:31,620
go over it like okay you're just saying thanks you ever play you ever play poacher what's that

1018
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:38,260
it's it's it's one of the games but that yatsi made and it's Ryan Ryan well it's the only one

1019
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,740
that I have any interest in playing because it's a Metroidvania and not like some weird adventure

1020
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:49,460
thing um and it's super good and it just reminds me like the the guy you play as is like this like

1021
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:54,500
hunter guy who's from who's up north and like he speaks in like such a fucking thick ass accent

1022
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,820
that like other people can't understand him but he's really funny that's a really fucking good

1023
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:05,220
game by the way and it's free um it's free just what metacritic thinks of it yeah speaking of

1024
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:11,220
accents and voice acting as if Divinity original sin and original sin too I haven't fully played

1025
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:15,300
the first one I only played a little bit of it a better guy distracted by the fact that could be

1026
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:21,300
a bush and I just walked around being a bush a while and then I became a rock and then a box

1027
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:31,060
it's a good game I swear but like the thing about the games um they're very much voice acting even

1028
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:36,020
even like the little animals that you might not be able to ever speak to ever if you don't take

1029
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:40,820
the skill pet talk or something like that they all they're also fully voice acting and it's just

1030
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:45,940
amazing how much work they put into this game and it doesn't feel like they had to restrict

1031
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:50,900
themselves due to the fact that they had to voice act things uh the main character is mute so you

1032
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:56,420
know main character isn't voice acted uh but other than that I think like every single thing has a

1033
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:04,580
voice to it and it's really cool and it's very British accent te so neat that's pretty cool

1034
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:09,220
that's pretty cool actually such a good game speaking of game development and and yacht this

1035
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,220
just reminds me of one other thing I was going to mention this episode which is just so the the

1036
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:18,020
game development pcp bonus episode came out uh beginning of the month or whatever so you should

1037
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:24,100
go listen to that but now that a time period has elapsed uh because I put effort into this I want

1038
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,300
to do this I uh one of the things we talked about that I brought up on that was this demo of this

1039
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:33,860
game I made with my friend Jonos uh this music jumper demo featuring qt bass drop blah blah blah

1040
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:40,100
etc etc um I'm just I was so proud that because while we were recording that I didn't have a

1041
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:46,340
working demo and I tried to find it after that episode ended I went I found the code and I attempted

1042
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,300
to get to work it didn't work I had to actually dig in and fix some broken things in order to get

1043
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:57,220
an exported working executable for the game and I did that and I exported it and now like the one

1044
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:01,940
level you can play actually works and I linked that in that episode and I was just so proud of

1045
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,860
myself for figuring that out and getting it working it didn't take me long but I had to put

1046
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:11,700
some effort in that uh I wanted everybody to play it and see the cute girl qt bass drop in there

1047
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:17,220
so uh link in the description too to the extremely short demo of that game uh by me and my buddy

1048
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:24,340
Jonos but hopefully you will enjoy you indeed very very proud very strong very powerful me curious

1049
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:31,700
it's good speaking of the video games speaking of video games I've I've been playing or I played

1050
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:37,780
briefly yesterday after seeing it on twitter a bunch of the time have you seen uh the talkings

1051
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:45,780
about AI dungeon 2 nope no okay so uh AI dungeon 2 has been popping up all over like my game dev

1052
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:52,660
twitter because that's the people I follow uh I guess so you guys are aware of you know uh text

1053
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:58,340
rpgs you know that that old classic genre where you just type commands and you play the rpg

1054
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:05,700
you know with no like uh I mean I know text-based adventure games or is it like that plus like hp

1055
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:10,820
and stuff well just just like a text-based adventure game you know okay like that that

1056
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:18,580
oft neglected genre yeah so some guy I guess decided I'm going to combine that style of game

1057
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:26,820
with AI so you just it just randomly generates an adventure and it'll accept any command you

1058
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:31,620
type in just in normal English and we'll parse it and try and continue the story based on it

1059
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:36,100
and so it has like an infinite number of like scenarios and stuff and it just generates I assume

1060
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:41,940
it uses AI to like figure out what you're saying and yes like your mileage perhaps may vary based

1061
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:47,540
on the strengths and weaknesses okay I guess you like you can choose the genre of style adventure

1062
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:52,820
you want from a couple options in the beginning okay it recommends fantasy I'm assuming probably

1063
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:57,300
because that's the one that's it's the most competent in but you can also do like post apocalyptic

1064
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:02,180
and things like that like a different or like a mystery I haven't dealt delved too deeply into it

1065
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,980
but I was interested because it's like starting to address something I've always kind of dreamed

1066
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:13,140
about about games because like one of the if you watch the uh the the video that I did a long time

1067
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:20,180
ago on the pcp responding to ben about why dnd is so cool right the idea I was saying is that

1068
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,420
tabletop allows you to do anything you know because you have another human being to listen

1069
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:29,860
to what you're doing and I've always wondered when is technology going to get good enough

1070
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:35,620
that video games will be able to do something similar no longer constrained by a particular

1071
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:42,100
particular rule set and this is like that as well I just like your first step towards that is this

1072
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:47,780
game like that's kind of a coward's pitch is that you can say whatever you want and uh so I played

1073
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:53,620
a little bit of it yesterday uh before I went to bed this is called AI dungeons AI dungeon yeah um

1074
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:59,940
two two so I can find a link for it I don't have it on hand because playing on my laptop and it works

1075
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:06,100
to a degree I mean okay um I think it's probably because a lot of what I was doing I was trying

1076
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,660
to like push the engine and see how far it works so instead of like typing good I'm glad you did

1077
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:16,820
commands like because when you the situation I got I was talking to some guy outside of a bandit camp

1078
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:22,100
and I was just speaking in English like in response to the queries as opposed to trying to talk

1079
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:28,180
as you would in a traditional text adventure game and there were a couple like kind of like

1080
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:32,100
assumptions it made about what I was saying but like the game continued regardless of whatever I

1081
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:37,460
said uh so it's interesting and I definitely want to play around with it more I was thinking maybe

1082
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:42,740
doing an iam games video on it just because I think the concept is so novel and like that's cool

1083
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:48,820
people interested in it sadly so we cannot play at this every moment any uh any highlights from

1084
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:54,900
your experience during it notable experiences I gave you or anything I guess I mean I didn't get

1085
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,300
super far into it so I can't say like I have a breath of experience of the game but just the

1086
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:05,140
fact that like it's so approachable you know like there's nothing to learn there's no like it's

1087
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:12,180
just like you speak English and the game responds and it's it's it's still like a lot a lot to go I

1088
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:16,900
guess to make it like truly natural but I think this will be an interesting starting off point

1089
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:23,700
because like if you can get to a point where you can have an AI basically DM a game for you it opens

1090
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:28,500
up a lot of possibilities uh even if it's just like a behind the scenes thing in a more traditional

1091
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,660
game so uh yeah that's definitely true and I mean one of the one of the I mean I'm sure of course

1092
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:39,860
you're aware but it's like uh the main issue of like when you can play a game with another human

1093
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:44,420
they have like all their the the bind is a is a powerful machine for coming up with information

1094
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:49,460
and stuff I mean I think humans are just robots but really advanced robots that do this stuff really

1095
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:54,420
well and like we've got we've got definitely a long way to go before a machine is capable of

1096
01:00:54,420 --> 01:01:00,500
handling things to the same degree of flexibility that your human mind on average is able to

1097
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,580
but uh yeah I mean any any step forward sounds like a cool one so I would be

1098
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,940
fascinated to hear if other people have played as well with their experiences nobody's safe

1099
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:12,900
from the robots taking over even DM right there's not even our video games the small window of time

1100
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,980
in between where we are right now when the robots kill us all that we'll have perfect video games

1101
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:24,340
I'll have to just like really enjoy that brief window I heard like there was a line I heard

1102
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:29,140
something about perfect video games like perfect entertainment the other day I was like some dystopian

1103
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:32,660
line about once we have like perfect video games there's no point in doing anything anymore

1104
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:37,300
because I mean what is a perfect video game except like an infinite pleasure machine I guess basically

1105
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:43,060
so uh yeah we're all fucked when we get there but in the meantime uh keep it keep it tight lads

1106
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:48,580
keep going to the gym but by the way while I was googling AI dungeon 2 uh it brought me to

1107
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:53,700
like a kotaku article about it and and this and then from there I saw linked another kotaku

1108
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:58,500
article that I think you guys should definitely take a look at and uh I'm a little distrustful

1109
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:03,940
of kotaku generally but I had heard about this elsewhere so I think this is accurate and okay

1110
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:10,740
take a look at this the article title is vaping congressman who spent campaign funds on steam

1111
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:17,620
games resigns okay so this guy this guy Ben I didn't know you were a member of congress oh

1112
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:23,620
I thought vaping wasn't a crime what happened fuck this guy is a republican that's not okay he is a

1113
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:30,980
republican from california and listen to this he so he misused apparently uh $250,000 in campaign funds

1114
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:39,540
including out of that $1,528 spent on steam games now that's not a massive amount of money but it

1115
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,900
is a sizable amount of money to spend on okay it is a massive amount to spend on steam games how

1116
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:51,140
many yeah that's so many fucking games I mean the question is did he spend that during a steam sale

1117
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:59,060
or no I mean that's less than one percent of the total amount that was misused it is uh see

1118
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:03,300
that they're a little bit exaggerating like gamer guy but I mean he definitely isn't a video games

1119
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,940
if you spent that much um there's there's like I'm curious where he spent the rest of it probably

1120
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:14,660
in like I don't know houses and travel and who knows who knows but it is funny and he is vaping

1121
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:20,180
in congress as we see well I'm mad that he's gonna cost us our our vape representation

1122
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:26,180
damn it we had one at last apparently he was vaping during a transportation committee hearing

1123
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:31,860
about whether to ban e-cigarettes on planes so okay you know what that may have been a deliberate

1124
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:38,740
statement it sounds like like it sounds like it can't have been an accident no of course not he's

1125
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:44,340
vaping pretty no he knows what he's doing look at that image look at how smart he looks he knows I

1126
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,820
mean someone's probably going on about how like oh we don't know what they're doing as he just blows

1127
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:53,780
a fat cloud in their face um and take that madame speaker or you know whatever the fuck he's clearly

1128
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:59,220
doing it on purpose to try and undermine vapors everywhere unfortunately oh yeah well it's

1129
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:04,100
succeeded and now I see some high jewel pods in massachusetts anymore I guess vaping is a crime

1130
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:10,020
now legally I'm just curious okay no only buying them is a crime right no no sorry they're selling

1131
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:15,860
them is a crime now I haven't looked into the details of this at all uh and like so okay miss

1132
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:22,340
spent $250,000 it sounds like he resigned like surely you must go to jail when you miss spend

1133
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:29,700
$250,000 of other people's money right yeah politicians don't uh they they make the laws

1134
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:34,740
they don't live by them I guess it depends like how maybe he just like bought way too many like

1135
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:39,700
reelect me signs for himself like if that's the issue I mean like okay I guess it doesn't

1136
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:44,980
matter what you spend it on I don't know you know it okay surely it matters to some degree

1137
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:49,300
like the steam games thing I mean that's in no way helping the people unless he's the game

1138
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:53,460
a representative he's trying to get in touch with his constituents man in which case this

1139
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,940
politician shit when are we gonna talk about the new jesus video game do you guys see that

1140
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:05,300
I have seen that wait I saw Jim's video and like the the other game he talked about seemed way

1141
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:12,660
more interesting Jim sterling Jim sterling uh tell me about the jesus game I guess I haven't

1142
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,220
seen it it's just it looks this is weird I think it's a pre-rendered trailer there's no way the

1143
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,620
game's gonna look like it's what it's called I am jesus christ and it's like a first person game

1144
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:26,420
where you just bomb around as jesus jesus has a mana bar and you perform miracles or something

1145
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:31,540
I did just see a gif of it and it looked like shit yeah yeah it's bizarre well but I can't believe

1146
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:38,580
it's real it's gotta be made by like some kind of like I'm not sure if this is like a legitimate

1147
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:44,820
like christian game or if it is a meme I haven't I haven't parsed it but the the pre simulator

1148
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:50,020
looked a lot more funny and interesting like the satan just comes in and just right strangles you

1149
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:55,060
which is funny it's all about the name on it's all in the name like I am just it gets the clicks

1150
01:05:55,060 --> 01:06:00,020
you know so mission successful I wonder how much money that will be uh converted into you know

1151
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:04,980
probably not much but I was thinking about like the whole like oh dude you get to play as Jesus

1152
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,100
being crucified

1153
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:15,460
game of the year game of the year confirmed crucifixion or are you saying game I was I was

1154
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:22,180
thinking about like the the fundamental problem with politicians always being led to corruption

1155
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:27,940
because it's just sort of a fun like it always seems to happen no matter what system power corrupts

1156
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,620
people find ways to because they're making the laws and they can break them because they're

1157
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:37,140
making them essentially they can find loopholes because they make the loopholes for themselves

1158
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:43,940
and for their friends and I just it really just comes down to the power of being in power

1159
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:51,460
comes with a lot of money and I think if we put if some if some Jesus christ superstar man

1160
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:59,460
got into power and then made a law that means that you have a like you only get minimum wage

1161
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:05,060
if you're a politician mm-hmm like you can't get higher than minimum wage that's what you get

1162
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:10,260
you don't get money for being in power because you already have power hey donald trump gave up

1163
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:14,260
his whole salary as president that's why he's the best we've ever had right well he gets work the

1164
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:20,420
system works but he gets his his like $200,000 salary is that's correct yeah he did I think he

1165
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:26,900
donated it I don't know how generous it's kind of an impossible problem because like it is it is

1166
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,260
well the reason there's no perfect system the people like

1167
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:36,580
like politics doesn't necessarily mean you are corrupt if you're a politician there are people

1168
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:41,940
trying to do good things it's just that mixed in with those people are so many other people who

1169
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:46,900
just like the money and the power and if you take away like the incentive for those other people

1170
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:52,740
you'll be left with only people who care about making their country better or whatever for sure

1171
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:59,540
it's just it's just not possible to like it like make that change because the people who

1172
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:05,460
stay in power are usually the people who are the most aggressive and like you in order to stay in

1173
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:10,180
power you need to be focused on staying in power and not focused on I mean helping people who are

1174
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:15,940
going to be the most motivated to stay in power are the people for whom is the thing that gets their

1175
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:21,380
dick hard so you know it's going to be a bunch of fucking psychopaths well I mean it's it's like

1176
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:25,380
this is the argument for term limits like this for at least here in the US for like congress and

1177
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:29,940
stuff because like you have people who just like get paid a fuck ton of money they get tons of like

1178
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:34,340
bribes and you know lobbying money and there's no term limit so they don't have to deal with the

1179
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:38,980
consequences of their legislation and this is the argument for having term limits so if you have

1180
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:43,540
like a two term limit like whatever fucked up shit you do you have to live by once your terms are up

1181
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:49,780
but like the issue right now of course is just that like the people in the with the authority

1182
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:53,460
to change society for the better are the ones benefiting from keeping it the way it is so no

1183
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,860
one has any incentive or any means to change society which is why we have to murder everybody

1184
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:02,740
makes sense time for a revolution time for a revolution boys vote burning

1185
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:08,020
time for a 360 revolution no scope kill the president

1186
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:15,700
dude if the person who kills you know the next president donald trump or whoever comes next

1187
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:21,380
uh those like a 360 no scope then i think he should be allowed to not die i think he should

1188
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:26,420
be allowed to go free in fact anyone who kills anyone with a 360 no scope in real life the person

1189
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:32,580
who does the best 360 no scope is the next president that yeah dude 360 no scopes i've been

1190
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:37,540
training for us my whole life i wonder if anyone has actually 360 no scope in real life like in

1191
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:43,380
war you know i i wouldn't be i wouldn't be surprised if like some superman like some

1192
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:50,660
gamer god played our like cola duty what got into army because of cola duty and then tried it

1193
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:55,620
and then he got told off but he's like yeah he got fucking immediately like like court marshaled

1194
01:09:55,620 --> 01:10:01,140
because he likes spun around in his target with his sniper rifle does it count if you do it just

1195
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:06,980
like at a range or something uh is that if you turn around in a range you'll probably hurt someone

1196
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:11,540
like i don't think you're allowed to turn around with your gun what if you just if you're by yourself

1197
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:15,940
i'm sure i'm sure people have done it at a range i'm talking about in a real

1198
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:21,780
live in a live combat situation you'd have to be a fucking psycho you'd have to be a fucking

1199
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:26,100
bad ass dude i mean you'd have to be like the coolest soldier out there to do that that is how

1200
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:32,340
they kill the summer bin Laden so you know what you're right what was i think of course they just

1201
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:36,900
got their kill ratio up so that like it's that cola duty achievement where you like unlock the dogs

1202
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:42,180
to attach i think that's how they got what's his face recently remember that one hero dog that like

1203
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:47,700
trump gave a medal yeah maybe the dog like the medal of pauner i believe it was called yeah like

1204
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:55,940
maybe the dog 360 no scoped whoever like he 360 no scoped bit someone in the yeah like that like

1205
01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:01,220
he spun around perfectly still stationary like it's not as impressive for dogs though they have

1206
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:07,620
like a great sense of smell and that's right on in the barbarian scent alone uh oh okay the the

1207
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:13,700
hero dog who was injured during a raid which led to death of isis leader abu bhak bhakir al bagdadi

1208
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:23,860
okay so i don't know if you bad doggy more like the only the only answer to a bad doggy is a good

1209
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:30,340
doggy the only thing that stops a bad doggy with a gun is a good doggy with

1210
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:39,380
man it's fucked up how how much we fucked up dogs like as a species like pug's eyes just fall out

1211
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:44,500
and shit sure sure i mean there's no uh there's no way to fix this they love it though they love it

1212
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:49,540
could we could we call this the first ever ethical we did we fucked them up so their eyeballs pop out

1213
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:55,060
but we also bred them to fucking love it they yeah i mean that's true they cannot get enough of their

1214
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:03,460
own eyeballs falling out they cannot get enough of barely being able to breathe at all times yeah

1215
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:09,380
that's the modest the modest amount of air that they're able to get in is like just enough to keep

1216
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:18,260
them fucking jazzed about life if you could create a life they're fucking high on like oxygen deprivation

1217
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:26,100
24 7 you know what yeah constant auto erotic expixiation just that's that's just their

1218
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:33,060
modus operandi brilliant brilliant maneuver all right i'm i'm tapped yeah i'm i'm dry of things to

1219
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:38,340
say i want to say one thing uh that happened to me immediately almost immediately after we stopped

1220
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:45,060
recording last week on sunday so uh before before the podcast i cooked myself some chicken and i ate

1221
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:51,140
it and i thought to myself that tasted a little bit odd not like bad it just a little bit odd

1222
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:57,220
and then after the podcast like i want to like i didn't immediately go to bed better that day

1223
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:04,980
ish i went to bed and uh and i started getting chills and i started getting feeling really bad

1224
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:13,300
and the chills got really violent and painful and and my fever rose to um 39 Celsius which i think is

1225
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:21,780
102 Fahrenheit word uh and yeah and i thought i thought i because i kept getting chills i

1226
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:28,500
thought is gonna get higher and my boyfriend was asleep so i just left him a message on discord

1227
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,220
if i don't wake up call the ambulance

1228
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:37,700
all right wait wait wait wait wait wait with the lifestyle oh god did you wake up on discord

1229
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:44,540
I don't know did I but yeah I was I was scared because I didn't know at that

1230
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:48,460
point that it was food poisoning I just I just started messaging people just

1231
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:54,060
like hey I might not do the commission I'm sorry give me a few days if I might

1232
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,380
never wake up in time to do the commission I didn't I didn't want to

1233
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:01,060
alert people I just said like hey I'm a little bit not feeling too good not sure

1234
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:05,740
what I'm gonna feel better but yeah I just I was panicking because I don't

1235
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:11,860
remember the last time I hear it was so high and but yeah so like it did go down

1236
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:18,620
eventually within the 24 hours and then like three days after I was in pretty

1237
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:24,780
bad shape on the on the upside though I got to taste Jacobs crackers Jacobs is

1238
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:29,340
a brand and crackers are really and and and they were really nice yeah they're

1239
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:36,300
crackers are like like a like a cure-all for for feeling sick I have like a

1240
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:40,260
whole packet when I'm just not not like I don't want to eat real food in case I

1241
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:46,020
get like throw up right yeah if your stomach is upset you can eat crackers

1242
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:50,020
and Jacobs crackers are really nice and toasty I like how lightly toasted they

1243
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,580
are they're just so just so good very good crackers you know Michelle wasn't

1244
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,340
feeling great the other day so I went out and got chicken soup crackers and

1245
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:01,820
ginger ale I have enjoyed those myself with all leftovers and it has been

1246
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:06,940
delicious I love them yeah so for three days afterward I had to be within close

1247
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:11,340
proximity of a bathroom at all times and not good days not good days do you know

1248
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:15,460
what it is that gave you the poison was it was it the chicken uncooked or

1249
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:20,060
something I think I it wasn't cooked enough okay so like they're like

1250
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:24,940
instructions on that chicken specific it's like after you open the packet 24

1251
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:30,020
hours to eat them it had not been 24 hours but was getting close and I might

1252
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:34,860
have taken them taken them out a bit too early and it just baffles me

1253
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:38,380
because like they were supposed to cook for five more minutes afterwards so

1254
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:43,420
those five minutes could have been like the difference between yeah food poison

1255
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:50,140
and not food poison so cook your food people less than well learned and when

1256
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:54,100
I've been when I've been making the curry recently like the way you cook it is you

1257
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,740
you fry the vegetables and the and the meat at the beginning but you you're

1258
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:01,940
only supposed to fry them for like five minutes so the meat is not fully cooked

1259
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:05,420
at that point but then like you put into boiling water you're like cooking that

1260
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:09,660
for longer and like I've been scared every time that like I'm not cooking it

1261
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:12,820
as long as it needs to it hasn't been an issue so far and it's been perfect well

1262
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:17,300
so long as you boil it properly like yeah yeah but I've been on I've been

1263
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:21,340
scared that I'm going to under cook because it goes in just just boil it for

1264
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:25,900
a little bit extra I have been I have been but now now that I've heard your

1265
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:30,300
tale even even more so I spoke to everyone but yeah I survived

1266
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:35,380
thankfully but God God that was such a big scare that is unfortunate being

1267
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:39,460
not sure if she's going to die her first concern is I can't wake up my

1268
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:45,020
boyfriend and my commissioners might be upset with me you know there's there's a

1269
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:49,860
feeling I think in all of us that's like if I bother someone like at any moment

1270
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:53,260
we might be dying if something I've got a little prick in my back maybe I just

1271
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:56,980
got bit by a black widow I'm about to die and if I don't contact someone within

1272
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:02,340
10 seconds like I'm going to you know die of that poison but maybe it's nothing

1273
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:05,780
and I don't want to bother people in case it turns out to be nothing there's

1274
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:09,540
like a certain amount of of of estimation you have to make there about how much

1275
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:14,780
I don't like if I feel like I might die I'm not gonna worry about that's like

1276
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:20,140
um it's the doubt it's the doubt that's that gets you out is it I mean this is

1277
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:24,740
how I think about it I mean if I I don't really get too worried if I'm not

1278
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:31,220
like actually feeling bad as well like if I'm feeling bad physically and it like

1279
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:34,940
I might be sick and this might be a really bad sickness I don't think people

1280
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:41,420
like I don't think of like my my like a worry in the moment as like that big of

1281
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:45,740
a deal in the in hindsight like people aren't gonna worry about it but if it

1282
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:49,700
was like if it was like I didn't feel anything but I just had some strange

1283
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:54,340
idea that I was gonna die that would be weird I wouldn't I wouldn't bother people

1284
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:59,620
that's for me for me it was kind of like my boyfriend already knew that I was

1285
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:03,620
sort of ill because I went to bed and said like I'm feeling really cold and

1286
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:08,500
I'm not feeling too good so he knew I was not good and the fever just hit me in

1287
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,020
the middle of the night and I woke up because of the fever so I didn't want

1288
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,220
to you know pester him because what is he gonna do I'm just gonna wake him up

1289
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:21,180
and worry him just like there's it's not gonna it's not gonna matter like I just

1290
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,420
asked him to like check up on me when he wakes up enough I'm like not

1291
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:30,100
responsive then calling ambulance but I was too awake I didn't fall asleep that

1292
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:34,220
night but yeah before that I didn't even know that it was sweet poisoning because

1293
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:39,140
beforehand for like a whole month I was feeling ill like sore throat and then

1294
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:42,500
like very small he was here and there because I always get sick around this

1295
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:47,700
time of year so that threw me off and I didn't realize it was food poisoning up

1296
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:51,420
until like much later but he was the one who suggested oh it could have been

1297
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:56,180
food poisoning I was like nah it must be it must be just like the flu but no he

1298
01:18:56,180 --> 01:19:02,940
was right flu poisoning well glad you made it out the other side I suspect a

1299
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:07,260
cold see now now that I'm thinking about sickness now I'm feeling like I'm oh am I

1300
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,700
like hotter than I'm normally feel why am I so hot right now is this like a

1301
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:16,020
fever coming on I get all I get all I you when fever comes on come on you

1302
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:20,380
usually feel a chill rather than feeling hot what's what makes you feel hot like

1303
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:25,780
cold or okay so for the chill comes on one that your fever is rising because

1304
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:31,140
your muscles spasm and they're trying to combat the whatever is alien so to

1305
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:35,620
speak so by the time you're feeling hot you feel the fever but the fever isn't

1306
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:40,300
rising anymore so you're stable I think it's the flu the flu makes you feel hot

1307
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,820
I think I thought just a cold makes you feel hot oh no I don't know it's like

1308
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:49,740
uh I don't know oh no the screen all day doing work but I feel like a weird

1309
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:54,620
thing in my head oh god it's my it's my disease is creeping back up it's Japanese

1310
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:59,940
cold you know the the most deadly disease known from the Simpsons that's the

1311
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:04,460
I remember that episode and I think I've got that Japanese they sneezed into a

1312
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:08,740
box and they send it I guess it was a Chinese cold actually okay and then

1313
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:12,300
what the fuck you're talking about but I'm talking about anime colds that lay

1314
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:17,060
people low you know the anime cold that whenever someone says your name you

1315
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:23,980
sneeze no matter where oh okay no yeah I get it like when when in an anime when

1316
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:27,300
someone gets a cold they just like they they have to be hospitalized hit the

1317
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:34,140
fucking floor yes that's right that's right instantly okay well anyway I'm

1318
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:39,980
tapped a couple of voicemail I'm not tapped okay okay I got some things to say

1319
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:49,340
for one say them imagine imagine me dear reader but on a good podcast that

1320
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:54,500
happens no can you believe it it can't you guys know what you guys know the

1321
01:20:54,500 --> 01:21:04,380
sketchy people podcast okay I was on it I was on it this Friday I don't know

1322
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:09,100
when the episode is coming out but link in the description I guess I was on it

1323
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:17,740
with who was on it lemon tart sake it's ake a tattoo art of graph aka green

1324
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:26,020
fleshy flowers Asha am I'm forgetting anyone I think that's it anyway it was

1325
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:31,180
good it's a good show that's nice graph grafted um if you remember from the the

1326
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:35,540
editor contest graph was the one who's entry was the two was the TVs all the

1327
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:39,740
all the TVs and Lee he basically created that but different for there and it

1328
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:45,100
looks really cool I'm glad it lives on because I really like that concept yeah

1329
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:50,220
anyway we talk about art and fucking comics and shit and they asked me a

1330
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:57,380
bunch of questions and I dab oh never paint is all so oh yeah never paint was

1331
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:02,100
there you never paint was there and I think you know what yes but noodle bomb

1332
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:08,860
was not on the episode I was on he isn't there sketchy people podcast good

1333
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:13,540
yeah all okay so I did a thing I announced the thing for my patreon and

1334
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:19,380
like it's probably just like not gonna do anything but I'm gonna say it here

1335
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:24,060
anyway just in case so I said that like since I'm doing slime and punishment

1336
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:28,900
and I'm putting in slime boys in as like background characters I said on

1337
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:33,700
Twitter that like if you are my patron and you are a slime boy I will like

1338
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:37,340
preff forgive you preferential tree I will I will put you will be on the short

1339
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:42,940
list to be a background character but it's only for slime boys like if you if

1340
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:46,180
you're not an endless war player like there's no point and I'm not gonna just

1341
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:49,700
like put your OC and if your OC has if you don't play endless war and you're

1342
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:54,740
not in there and you don't know what it is right sure so I announced this on

1343
01:22:54,740 --> 01:23:00,020
Twitter and like one guy it became a patron and it was someone who had

1344
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:06,340
previously been a patron anyway so I think that probably maybe this just maybe

1345
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:09,380
this doesn't make any difference maybe I just have already included all of the

1346
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:13,300
hardcore slime boys anyway or enough of them that like maybe anyone who would

1347
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:17,780
have maybe pledged for this for this quote-unquote for this honor this dubious

1348
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:22,940
distinction I like has already gotten it and doesn't need it anymore but what I

1349
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:26,500
think I think a lot of rewards like this like a lot of people kind of just

1350
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,900
don't hear about them and aren't even aware it's something they could do I

1351
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:33,940
feel that with some things I do so well I'm saying it here just so everyone

1352
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:38,340
knows but it's not even like I mean I guess it is a reward for pledging but

1353
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:44,180
like mm-hmm like as much as that it's just like I have to put some people in it

1354
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:47,940
kind of to a certain extent it sort of doesn't matter who I put in as background

1355
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:52,020
characters and I feel like if I'm gonna give someone that I might as well give

1356
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:56,860
it to someone who's like supporting me on patreon so I said like if you're if

1357
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:01,500
you're pledging me ten bucks you will be in just message me on patreon and I

1358
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,980
will even even if I wouldn't have had another I will like add an extra page

1359
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:10,180
just just to get you in there if you're pledging less than that then you know it'll

1360
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,940
just be like basically the more you're pledging the higher up on the list you'll

1361
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:18,580
be and I'll just go down and like priority list basically and message me on

1362
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:23,220
patreon pledge me on patreon I've sort of been neglecting my patreon and I kind

1363
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:28,340
of need to like not do that I too have been kind of trying to to do a couple

1364
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:32,580
of things I've been doing this like my monthly podcast or ever I do just like

1365
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:36,420
how things are going overall for this like I like a year of experimentation and

1366
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:39,780
then I started doing like anybody who's pledging ten dollars I'll give like a

1367
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:43,180
long answer to any questions but only like a couple of people have actually

1368
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:46,420
taken me up on that so I I wonder how many are actually hearing about that

1369
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:50,900
that feature so hey ten dollars I keep I keep thinking I should I should steal

1370
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:55,780
hippo's idea steal your idea and just do a money spenders podcast sometimes I

1371
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:59,980
think that I should just pull a Jesse and just like disappear and make patreon

1372
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:04,540
the only way to contact me it seems to have worked pretty well for him I mean

1373
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:08,660
I'm doing I'm doing a patron podcast since working out pretty well for me as

1374
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:11,420
well yeah I mean that that's exactly what mine is to I think all of us are

1375
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:17,820
kind of 30 something episodes so far five dollars get in on it if you're not

1376
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:24,740
already shameless plug is shameless guess I might start thinking about that it's

1377
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:31,820
fun to do I mean I just have I have I have two podcasts right now I have like

1378
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:35,340
one where it's just like whatever strikes my fancy I'll just make them

1379
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:40,140
whatever and $1 patrons get that and for $5 I have a suggestions channel on the

1380
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:43,140
discord and then people can leave topic suggestions and I'll just at the end of

1381
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,180
the week others everyone who dropped one in I'm like all right this is what you

1382
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,340
want to talk about this week and then I'll just go off and half an hour of a

1383
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:55,420
podcast it's great since I'm since like currently the reward on my $5 tier is

1384
01:25:55,420 --> 01:26:00,780
like access to speed draws I do have what I did I downloaded all the VODs of my

1385
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:05,300
like twitch draw streams and I could and I started doing this but I didn't finish

1386
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:08,780
it and I might do it at some point is like just fucking speed them up and

1387
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:12,580
condense those down into speed draws and make those like some patrons only

1388
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:17,740
content so that's the thing I should probably do I guess if everyone's doing

1389
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:23,920
a fucking solo money spenders podcast I should probably do one too it doesn't

1390
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,260
hurt it's simple enough to do for me to be justifying I think so yeah and I kind

1391
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:31,820
of like it it forces me to sit down and like think about stuff which I kind of

1392
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:36,460
like I hate to do it you hate to do it you hate to sit down and acknowledge the

1393
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:40,900
realities of this you of this world indeed indeed I like doing the money

1394
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:47,180
spenders podcast because it allows me to my favorite name to talk about the sort

1395
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:52,100
of stuff that's going on in my life that only patrons would care about so it like

1396
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,780
yeah that's one makes sense you know these people give a little bit of a shit

1397
01:26:55,780 --> 01:27:00,180
at least yeah nice to know yeah it might you know what I think would might would

1398
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:06,100
maybe be the good thing about it is that then like it like since since I don't

1399
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:12,420
like post a lot of content specifically to patreon I mostly interact with people

1400
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:16,780
through Twitter but it would probably be good to have a thing that only patrons

1401
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:21,340
are listening to and so only patrons are responding to and so I'm getting like

1402
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:25,660
patron feedback like from my like the people from like specifically the

1403
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:30,460
people supporting it hurt to have that dedicated avenue that you know is just

1404
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:34,420
those people you know yeah just for comparison sake if nothing else yeah

1405
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:38,580
maybe they could probably give some like yeah I felt some some insight coming

1406
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:43,020
from that group commenting on on mine that's been I mean just knowing it's

1407
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,460
people who are invested again like this that particular group has kind of its

1408
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:51,700
own biases they might like like you too much or they might be like too invested

1409
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:55,540
in stuff and not able to make the kind of cold-hearted decisions you need to as a

1410
01:27:55,540 --> 01:28:00,500
businessman or whatever but you know just having that data set has has been

1411
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:07,380
useful I think right yeah okay well now I'm okay oh yeah actually you know what

1412
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:11,420
all that reminded me that I did have one little announcement it's not a big

1413
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:16,020

01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:47,300
thing heart gold very except best Pokemon game ever made it's gonna be

1421
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:51,740
actually it's weird going from the the quality of life changes in sword and

1422
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:56,460
shield like should have been there generations ago but going back to like

1423
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:01,100
not happen anymore they took out follow Pokemon so game sucks zero my god I

1424
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:05,860
forgot heart gold like has that that'll be totally all the reason to play

1425
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:11,300
heart gold and soul silver it's up there pretty much playing through black

1426
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:15,420
or I have white version actually but I'm playing to white cuz comments on the

1427
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,900
I am games reader did on the first impressions for the new one it's like

1428
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:22,340
that's the best one I have a lighter fucking sick and I'm playing it and it

1429
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:25,340
is like you can just tell going through the towns and stuff all the little

1430
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:29,300
details they add that they cared a lot more and there's just more like life to

1431
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,300
everything not wrong like in one of the one of the first towns something that

1432
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,620
was super fucking cool is like you you're just in the town and it's playing a

1433
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:40,060
background music and then you go into this like room and there's like a piano

1434
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,860
and something like as two people and they're playing instruments and you

1435
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:46,100
talk to them and it just adds more to the music and then you go back outside

1436
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:49,500
and now the music's like remixed I'm like yeah there's nothing like this in

1437
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:53,500
those other games like the towns feel so empty compared to this but listen the

1438
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:58,260
quality of life stuff of the new games is like yeah god what do you mean what

1439
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:05,780
do you mean are you fucking kidding me single use TMS well my problem is that

1440
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:09,660
like not getting XP for catching Pokemon makes me not want to ever catch

1441
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:14,820
Pokemon ever oh yeah that like I have like a like almost 200 catches and that

1442
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:18,660
is a new game that I just from my playthrough and I usually never break

1443
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:22,540
50 on my first run of a poker game because I'm like why would I ever waste my

1444
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:27,140
time catching Pokemon which serves me no purpose and I'll just save it for end

1445
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:30,860
game who fucking cares your subject of like having things reminded me of a

1446
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:34,100
brilliant thing I read I think this is on like a 4chan thread about about

1447
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:39,260
something but I thought this was a very insightful commentary on like old game

1448
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:45,020
good new game bad mindsets which is it's that so like when you compare like Sword

1449
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:48,900
and Shield for example or really like any kind of like triple-a fancy game like

1450
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:52,700
like your Final Fantasy 15 or something like that to like you could say Final

1451
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:55,940
Fantasy 7 or like a sprite like Final Fantasy 6 something like that any of

1452
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:59,660
that old stuff let's just do like a like a fancy 3d game versus like an old like

1453
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:04,500
16-bit like Final Fantasy 6 for example it's that you know in the new game this

1454
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:08,180
was this was something somebody was pointing out that like when you play

1455
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:12,740
the new game it can feel kind of like empty and lifeless despite there being

1456
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:16,580
so much more stuff and it's like why is that and this this person's point was

1457
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:21,860
when if you got a game like Final Fantasy 6 it's it's sprite based right and you

1458
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:25,500
walk around a town and like it's they don't have to think about the kind there's

1459
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:30,900
not so much information that you need to fill this huge 3d space with stuff and

1460
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:35,420
and we're hitting this this like intellectual wall or this like cognition

1461
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:40,780
limit that we can't expect a company like does every fucking blade of grass in

1462
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:46,620
in like Breath of the Wild like have meaning and purpose no no it does not

1463
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:50,180
or like Final Fantasy 15 is an even better example absolutely not like the

1464
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:54,700
vast majority of it is really just filling empty space because something

1465
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:58,220
has to be in that space but in your average like town or even just like an

1466
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:03,780
open wilderness in like a Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 6 like proportionately

1467
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:08,540
speaking way more love and way more like kind of intelligence or purpose is

1468
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:13,340
given to every like individual tile or something so it's like when you when you

1469
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:18,100
look at a game like a Chrono Trigger you can kind of feel that like more thought

1470
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:23,060
was put into every individual panel there versus something like Final Fantasy 15

1471
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:28,860
where we just know it's mostly like filler content with a couple of waypoints in

1472
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:32,620
this giant world that have like actual meaning by the developers and that

1473
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:37,460
gulf is the soul versus soulless feeling I think everything in Chrono Trigger you

1474
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:42,180
know was was put there by hand because the entire thing had to be handcrafted

1475
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:47,100
but in Final Fantasy 15 all of the like the vast majority of the environment

1476
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:50,580
stuff like the blades of grass that's all just like a shader or like just like

1477
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:55,260
you know a a program that just like right populates with grass like none of

1478
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:59,460
that was like hand placed and stuff and you know if anybody's gonna say

1479
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:02,940
something like this is fair like Final Fantasy 6 or Chrono Trigger like they

1480
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:07,700
use tile sets I mean okay that's true but like think of the proportions like so

1481
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:12,500
many less tiles are used compared to like the vast gigantic open spaces of

1482
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:17,300
like a Final Fantasy 15 or 13 or I don't know Assassin's Creed or something

1483
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:20,980
like that not that I've played many of those so I think that this gulf is why

1484
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:25,260
at least people like me get instantly more attracted to like sprite based games

1485
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:30,260
because if it feels more like something thing especially considering a game

1486
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:35,620
again RPG like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy is that like the level of

1487
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:39,940
abstraction allows you to like you you kind of just subconsciously fill in the

1488
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:44,460
gaps you know because yes you know like you're in a town and like there's like

1489
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:48,940
five buildings in the town but because it's so abstract it's the idea of a town

1490
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:53,560
and then your subconscious like fills in what isn't there but once you get like

1491
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:57,060
in a 3d space that's more photorealistic it's just you know it's the

1492
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:00,620
uncanny valley it's like well there's only like you know 20 people now that work

1493
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:05,140
that was done by the player's imagination has to be done by the

1494
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:09,140
developers and there's no way they can live up to that expectation that we've

1495
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:12,980
had like from our youth and you know this is why realism is such a bane on

1496
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:17,580
fucking video games like it's it's yeah all this empty work that serves no real

1497
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:21,620
purpose it doesn't serve the game it's just like kind of dick wagging for no

1498
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:27,940
no benefit for anybody it's just empty pointless soulless work to re-create

1499
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:32,620
the trudgery of reality that I hate that's absolutely true that's exactly

1500
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:37,820
that's exactly what I was gonna and like the only thing is I I do feel sympathy

1501
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:42,860
for companies who feel and to an extent it's true that they like have to live up

1502
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:46,700
to this standard that they feel is being set I mean companies like Square Enix

1503
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,980
take it to the extreme and they do it like they think too much they have to live

1504
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:56,220
up to this I thought I was still muted lol

1505
01:34:56,220 --> 01:35:06,460
I mean this was slightly unrelated I just made a post on Twitter this morning

1506
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:09,580
I was just thinking about the Final Fantasy 7 remake wasn't exactly about this but

1507
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:13,460
just like I do have sympathy for companies that I think these days like

1508
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:17,500
standards just changed expectation of the audience change or at least companies

1509
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:22,100
understanding of what they think the audience needs has changed and it's

1510
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:25,540
just put such a burden on them and I have true sympathy for the for the trap

1511
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:29,020
they've basically fallen into with this but I'm just gonna I mean I'm playing

1512
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:33,660
crosscode right now it's like a 16-bit game and I'm loving it so much more than

1513
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:38,500
like any RPG I've played in the last I don't know like RPG specifically in the

1514
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:43,220
last probably like I don't know five to ten years you know I unmuted myself I

1515
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:49,220
was eating lol but I'm muted myself because Nino Cooney has deals with this

1516
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:57,300
problem of like things being like too too real for you to to on this like to get

1517
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:03,060
that it's like everything you see mm-hmm you know probably have meaning or is it

1518
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:07,140
like filler content like with a big no everything is is handcrafted but the

1519
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:12,580
thing they the way they get around it it stylized and when you're in in world

1520
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:19,380
map or in your kingdom mm-hmm you are like a tiny little chibi-ized version of

1521
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:22,820
yourself and everything small and cute and it kind of looks like when you're

1522
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:27,580
running around your kingdom upgrading things they have like timers so like

1523
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:30,900
once you've spent a load of money there's like oh this will take like 12

1524
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:34,500
minutes to research so then you go out into the field and you do stuff and you

1525
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:40,260
come back you've got more income to spend and research is completed but it

1526
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:43,980
looks like a mobile game which is is like it doesn't play like a mobile game

1527
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:46,860
but it looks like a little more ball game if you imagine like I don't know

1528
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:53,540
clash of guys my favorite where everything sort of like cutesy and

1529
01:36:53,540 --> 01:37:00,820
stylized and cartoony and they can make games in 3D that look good mm-hmm

1530
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:05,700
is good I think you know Korea is a great example of like not letting

1531
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:10,060
technology like rule you you know because the game stylized so it's not

1532
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:13,380
it's probably not pushing technological boundaries the same way something

1533
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:17,420
like Death Stranding is for example not but it still looks good because it's

1534
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:23,220
it's it's art direction instead of raw polycast yeah that one Zelda game the

1535
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:28,380
people hated when it came out but then started praising about how I think

1536
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:33,180
yeah Wind Waker that's the one that there is a lot there is a very specific

1537
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:39,540
Wind Waker feeling like the the the the the the sea town level which is like

1538
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:47,940
kind of like a half submerged what's it's not called Athens what Atlantis so it's

1539
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:54,540
like a sort of Greekish architecture with this a few of these like stone

1540
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:59,220
walkways that are very like covered in water but like by one or two inches of

1541
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:03,300
water and you splash through it and it's it's a really sunny town and it just is

1542
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:08,780
the it just I love it so much I love the music I love being in that place and

1543
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:13,980
it's it's you know it's a stylized location it's so wonderful that it

1544
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:17,420
couldn't exist in real life because like the realistic lighting engine would make

1545
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:22,500
the shadows so dark that they're black and walking into them would be like oh

1546
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:27,900
you know like you know how in in like realistic games where they do that thing

1547
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:32,340
where if you go from extreme shadow to extreme brightness the camera adjusts

1548
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:37,900
its aperture or whatever to like adjust to the light and now like you can't see

1549
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:41,460
anything that's in the shadow and when you're in the shadow the the light areas

1550
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:46,340
are completely like so bright that you can't see anything I don't like that

1551
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:50,100
about reality I would prefer being able to see the shadows and the light the

1552
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:55,900
same time and you know I would I would prefer the worlds to be art directed

1553
01:38:55,900 --> 01:39:00,260
but the real world is annoying things such as you can't see like the human eye

1554
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:05,580
is fallible I prefer video games where they they got around those problems and

1555
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:09,220
then they are officially putting them back in so that people can imagine they're

1556
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:15,300
outside of some stupid bullshit you know I like games past little colors bright

1557
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:20,460
games like like story of seasons games are cute and nice looking and I love them

1558
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:25,740
I mean I'm totally with you on the stylization thing being nice but I

1559
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:29,300
mean you guys are you're talking more about graphics which which again is fine

1560
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,980
and I agree with but like I meant it a little bit more like specifically like

1561
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:37,180
gameplay wise I think maybe one good example is like for example you got a

1562
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:42,100
game like Final Fantasy 12 where it's a big open 3d world you can walk around

1563
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:46,900
but there are like set areas that you walk into but the problem I mean it's not

1564
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:50,980
really a problem but like the kind of issue is that you can like look down a

1565
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:56,620
path and you see that there's so much more city that you just can't access due

1566
01:39:56,620 --> 01:40:02,340
to like you know invisible walls and not even necessarily that but like the city

1567
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:05,260
is structured in such a way that you can't get to like the vast majority of

1568
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:08,540
it whereas if you compare that to something like Final Fantasy 9 for

1569
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:12,820
example or even Final Fantasy 7 which is the same they both have like pre-rendered

1570
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:16,620
backgrounds and stuff and like pathways that you're let along like a city like

1571
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:21,740
Lindblum or something or Trino it's clearly bigger than the set few areas

1572
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:25,940
you're like able to walk in relatively like how big the city looks but it feels

1573
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:31,460
satisfying from a gameplay sense because like every area you walk through it's

1574
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:34,380
not they're not like a breath of the wild where like it's a whole map full of shit

1575
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:38,100
and then there's just a couple things in there to do or like a Final Fantasy 15

1576
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:42,860
or something it's that like every alley in there is used for like some event

1577
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:47,260
throughout the game so they all like feel meaningful like this is where I had

1578
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:51,740
like that boss battle here's where like Freya joined my party and it feels like

1579
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:55,020
every area for the most part not every single one but like more of it

1580
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:58,820
proportionately feels like it had value and purpose behind it in terms of

1581
01:40:58,820 --> 01:41:04,020
gameplay and like I would say like Nino Kuni they have some really good level

1582
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:08,060
designers because the towns in that game are one of the only places like

1583
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:13,500
there are the towns castles like main areas hubs where you talk to people and

1584
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:19,980
that's where your normal character model is they have designed these towns in

1585
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:25,660
such a way that they they are actually very very small but they've made it like

1586
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:29,940
they're just I don't know how they did it I would have to like see if there's an

1587
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:37,580
analysis video analyzing the topography the geology of like Goldpaw which is

1588
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:45,220
like a Chinese dog city where everyone's a dog and they go to the casino

1589
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:48,620
and it's China and it's a really nice place but there's like all these alleyways

1590
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:53,140
but it's not like all these alleyways it's like the entire city is there's no

1591
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:57,380
like invisible wall and the rest of the city is over there it's like the whole

1592
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:01,540
city is very small there's only a few buildings but it feels like it's a big

1593
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:05,500
place because of the way they've structured you know the stairs and the

1594
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:10,420
alleyways and the and and you know what you can see from each location I feel

1595
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:15,940
like a lot of thought has been put into making a 3d environment like that like

1596
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:20,940
feel bigger than it is and it's yeah I think I had the I had the similar sense

1597
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:25,460
with Ding Dong Dell like the first city you go into the first Nino Kuni yeah

1598
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:32,540
really good yeah not that I mentioned I didn't even think about it I like it well

1599
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:37,740
perhaps hopefully we've been successful at articulating this nebulous game feel

1600
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:42,660
issue but that's just a theory a game theory so let us know what you think I

1601
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:46,820
guess you want to go to the voicemails now last I'm ready I'm ready for those

1602
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:51,220
fucking voicemails okay we've only got three so we'll we'll get through them

1603
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:54,700
pretty quick here oh there was an update I didn't feel the need to play it but

1604
01:42:54,700 --> 01:43:00,020
I think we had guessed last time that the voicemail God was was keyblade

1605
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:05,420
spirit confirmed not keyblade spirit and the key but do you guys remember no

1606
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:11,900
what was it the remember the unironic gang weed guy who had called in as the

1607
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:16,460
Joker before that's another voice of the voice okay well I remember who could

1608
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:21,700
ever forget that beloved character you know I actually just watched the was a

1609
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:24,860
dark night the dark night like this morning as I was doing other work

1610
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:30,260
excellent film it's kind of amazing how many legendary lines are like all from

1611
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:34,180
that one movie unironically incredible filmmaking okay anyway doesn't matter

1612
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:39,660
fuck you voicemail God no one will ever figure out who you are you made it too

1613
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:44,500
hard dude you fucked up I did make it too hard like I don't want to be mean or

1614
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:48,740
anything but it's a little bit unreasonable just like guess who I am guess

1615
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:54,700
who I am and we have to wait a week only to hear nope guess again yeah I mean how

1616
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:59,500
long are we gonna play this game out I mean like it's already annoying when

1617
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:04,100
you're in real life next to the person and they say hey guess what I have or

1618
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:07,340
something guess guess guess guess this thing and you guess once and you're

1619
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:11,300
already done with it like you don't want to hear more so just just just come out

1620
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:16,780
with it we're not gonna we're not gonna do this for months true true well okay so

1621
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:21,780
that that all being out of the way we've got a voicemail called not surprised

1622
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:28,740
just disappointed okay and let's play it one two three here we go a KPCP here's

1623
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:32,980
a list of potential characters I'd rather get fucked in the ass by Ben

1624
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:38,420
Saint Betty's real gentle Digi bro I'm not getting fucked by a little girl

1625
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:44,740
endless Jess to Harry best guy ever yes sure why not so in conclusion your

1626
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:48,700
all terrible homosexual lovers don't you ever be looking around here for work

1627
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:57,060
again well okay you know I thought that was funnier the first time I heard it's

1628
01:44:57,060 --> 01:45:06,140
alright it's fine and you all appeared apparently I don't even understand the

1629
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:10,500
premise it was that people I'd rather be fucked in the ass by but he objected to

1630
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:15,180
most of them and then said he would I guess he's ranking he's ranking us he's

1631
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:21,980
glitching out something like that well checked okay that embarrassment behind

1632
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:28,700
us let's move on to the next one this is from Hiki Komori Rambo okay all right

1633
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:35,500
here we go and play yeah so this one goes out to Ben Saint yeah I just started

1634
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:42,140
a pretty normie office gig and I noticed in the break room on my first day

1635
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:50,420
there was perched atop the refrigerator a box that stated slimfast keto peanut

1636
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:57,460
butter cups and not only was this box perfectly at eye level with me but also

1637
01:45:57,460 --> 01:46:03,260
etched on the side and Sharpie it said please eat these and you know you really

1638
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:09,260
can't ask for more of an open invitation so I decided to take the box down on

1639
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:15,980
sheath one of the individual peanut butter cups and eat it and you know Ben you

1640
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:21,420
get a lot of shit on the podcast whenever you talk about keto I don't really

1641
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:27,740
know as much as I would expect I've had a pretty open mind so being able to

1642
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:32,700
actually experience something keto certified like literally says on the box

1643
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:39,900
this is keto mm-hmm I have to say completely you know bias free it was one

1644
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:44,380
of the worst fucking things I've ever eaten in my entire life dude anyways my

1645
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:52,060
question is why are you so good you fucking douchebag okay you want to

1646
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:57,180
have something that's keto and great eat bacon there you go yeah eggs second of

1647
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:01,900
all what he doesn't say what what was wrong with them did they taste bad cuz

1648
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:06,940
I think that was his point I had sugar-free chocolate shit before and it

1649
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:11,980
has given me ridiculous diarrhea because some because some like artificial

1650
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:16,460
sweeteners can give you fucking crazy diarrhea yeah that happened is that the

1651
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:20,140
problem did they just taste like shit what how do they taste like shit I've

1652
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:24,700
never some could have given us more some people I don't know some people are

1653
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:29,140
like really sensitive to the taste of like artificial sweeteners and can be

1654
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:33,460
like oh like stevia has a weird aftertaste sucralose has a weird aftertaste

1655
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:38,660
gross I pity those people I really do because to me there's like they're not

1656
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:42,980
new types like Ben over here literally cannot tell the difference between

1657
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:46,020
like something that's sweetened with sucralose and if you're doing if you're

1658
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:49,220
doing keto correctly you shouldn't even be having artificial sweeteners

1659
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:52,500
because they still trigger insulin and you don't you don't want to have an

1660
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,740
insulin reaction just just eat fats and and proteins

1661
01:47:56,820 --> 01:48:00,900
fuck everything else well it sounded like it sounded like a rookie's first

1662
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:04,740
attempt at pouring into the world of keto and it went catastrophically wrong

1663
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:08,900
making making a rookie mistake is fine casting judgment on an entire

1664
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:12,900
fucking uh mindset due to what you can do it as a vehicle

1665
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:17,220
to dab on Ben I mean who's gonna turn that one I don't think honestly I think

1666
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:20,740
this guy's arguing in bad faith he didn't he didn't lay out a

1667
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:23,940
cocaine case for what was wrong what was wrong with the fucking peanut butter

1668
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:28,660
we'll name one thing that was wrong with those fucking peanut butter cups

1669
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:32,740
there wasn't enough p there wasn't enough nut I think too much nut not enough p in

1670
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:37,060
my opinion that's gross fucking all right let's move on right along here we've

1671
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:40,340
only got one left we only got one voicemail left oh my god yeah that's

1672
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:44,420
right that's right and this is from uh Harlock Asnable who's written it I

1673
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:49,220
think he oh I think I know what he's gonna say I think okay he's gonna remember

1674
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:52,980
well I'll tell you I think this is probably about the fact that Harlock Asnable

1675
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:58,980
who famously got a girlfriend at uh got an anime club oh that's right he told me

1676
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:02,820
I think it was on twitch twitch.tv slash st comics with an x dab

1677
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:09,300
that his brother also got a girlfriend for an anime club not the same anime club

1678
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:14,900
a different anime club okay well let's let's let's see if I'm right and that's what this is about

1679
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:22,260
all right Harlock uh three two one go yo update on anime club gfs um my little

1680
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:26,980
brother went to an anime club at his high school and he also got a girlfriend so nice

1681
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:32,340
this is really starting to be a threat to society you know what I mean yeah but uh

1682
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:38,500
I'd also like to make it clear that I am making a bet with ben saint yeah if I'm not with

1683
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:45,540
this anime club gf that I'm with right now till February uh I'll give him fat stacks on his

1684
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:51,780
patreon but if I am and he was wrong he did make it to February I'm giving Nate bestman

1685
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:57,780
now we're talking baby oh yeah that's the rules of the bet here we go February that's right

1686
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:04,020
specifically Valentine's Day fucking be there be square why why does it make me why does it make

1687
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:10,740
me so much more angry to imagine Nate getting money from me losing than it does to imagine just

1688
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:18,740
just me not getting the money from all I can say to this is hashtag gamify your gf boys across the

1689
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:25,060
world gamify your gf this is the right way to structure a relationship I have no doubt about

1690
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:30,100
it make it so that it's a bet if you stay with this girl not based on like if you like her or

1691
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:38,980
hey hey harlock hey harlock great great way great way to make make me win is tell her about these

1692
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:46,500
voicemails okay consider that possibility if you wonder she knows I wonder if they know about

1693
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:51,220
this I would be fascinated okay no because I think when the first called in I said we said like

1694
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:56,100
Valentine's Day and I said oh they won't be together by valentine's day oh this motherfucker I think

1695
01:50:56,180 --> 01:51:02,740
statistically probably true well I don't know who knows yeah who can who the fuck knows I like

1696
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:08,180
to think that our boy harlock is is gazing lovingly into his anime gf's eyes and he's like honey I'm

1697
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:12,980
so happy to be with you I feel like we're gonna be together be together forever rolls over picks

1698
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:17,380
up phone calls and what's up PCP I want to make a quick bet over here I think I'm gonna be with this

1699
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:23,940
bitch forever just letting you know you know money flipping it around I mean no matter what this man

1700
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:29,060
is losing money it's either going to Ben or to me based on the stakes of the game here that's why

1701
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:33,460
I mean that's it's just fine with me relationship involved in this until now you know you gotta

1702
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:37,860
have those fat stacks if you want to keep a woman in those fat stacks of pancakes you've got to be

1703
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:42,740
given fat stacks to either ben saint or best guy ever on patreon if they're gonna be the only

1704
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:48,420
glance your way it's the dichotomy of man uh really either one of these two it's the only way

1705
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:56,660
well uh well best of luck it's spicy it is spicy well done I'll be eagerly awaiting now so uh what

1706
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:59,860
is that wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait get your brother get your brother to call in I want

1707
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:04,740
to make the same bet with him oh yeah that'd be great I want to double the same stakes let's take

1708
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:10,740
his money as well as one of us or the other oh maybe me and Ben can make a secret bet uh to no

1709
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:16,580
matter who wins we'll split the money 50 50 and uh I mean I guess then we there's just no there's

1710
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:24,100
no edging our bets eh I like those odds okay well we make corruption aside

1711
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:30,260
guaranteed corruption aside collusion that's yeah collusion yeah that's the end of the voicemails

1712
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:35,460
everybody but leave us more at the speak pipe link down below somebody called in and was saying

1713
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:41,460
like it's hard to leave a voicemail um to like get the audio quality in but we had a wasn't there

1714
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:46,500
a solution that like oblivion had in order to get like a high quality audio upload yeah but who

1715
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:52,340
remembers that I don't know how I know how to look back at past episodes if anybody remembers

1716
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:56,500
like post in the comments or something and I will like add a little document to the description of

1717
01:52:56,500 --> 01:53:01,060
episodes if people want to do that because it seems useful to have just because some people care about

1718
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:05,300
like the quality and there's some issues with that uh okay but nonetheless leave us your

1719
