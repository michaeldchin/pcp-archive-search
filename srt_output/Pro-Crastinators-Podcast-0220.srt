00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Hello everyone and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,240
Uh, I'm sorry darling, I'm listening to the PCP right now. It's so interesting. It's so

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,680
arousing. It's so exciting. It's so- what's- fuck how does it go? It's so something. Haven't

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:32,080
heard that song in a while. Hey, shout outs to Pro Sasuke for that tune. That was you right?

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:44,720
Oh god, I'm almost certain. Anyway, uh, welcome to the pro solo Bencast. It's here guys. It's

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,960
here. The day has arrived. The day has arrived. I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I own the road.

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,600
I can do whatever I want. And no one can stop me. I'm here to say thanks for listening.

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,160
And if this excites you, if the thought of the solo Bencast is titillating for you, as it should be,

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,400
you can get more on patreon.com slash ben saint where I do one of these every month just about

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,040
me and myself. What's going on? So, hmm, I don't have a plan. I never come into the

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,360
PCP with a plan. So what am I going to talk about? Let me talk about what's been going on with me.

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,320
Just very briefly, um, Vapors 2. It's coming out. It's getting printed. It's in the process right

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,000
now. Very exciting. Fulfillment shall begin. RFCK, Endless War, just got a big update. I wasn't

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,480
really involved in making it. I'm not much on the coding side of things anymore, hardly at all really.

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,400
But the pins, the pin kickstarter, those are also in production, entering the final stages. I should

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,640
have the samples of all the pin designs tomorrow. That's what UPS tells me. Very exciting. Uh,

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,400
that's great. That's cool and all. Good shit going on. Um, but enough about that. Let's talk about

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:11,120
the absolute state of the PCP. Um, just yesterday or was it the day before? I don't remember.

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,040
They all blur together. There was some Twitter shit. I went on Twitter. I went on the Procrastinator's

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,560
account and I said, it's, it's maybe time. This was, Tom had said that like, we need to start

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,640
thinking about what if the videos don't come back? And yeah, I agree. It's starting to seem like maybe

22
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,760
they won't. Um, YouTube keeps emailing us back. Whenever Nate sends an email, we get an email

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,520
back saying, thanks for reaching out. Thanks for your patience. There's still no update. We're working

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:51,760
on it. Um, meanwhile, like, you know, my, my close personal friend, Maryweather, who this is not

25
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,320
anything against him, I'm just using it as an example because I happen to notice that he had a,

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:03,680
a, a video get, uh, you know, falsely copyright flagged and it got taken down. He said so to

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,440
Team YouTube on Twitter and he got a response within like a day and his video went back up.

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,040
Hmm. Could it be that he has 10 times as many followers on Twitter? Could it be that he has

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,680
10 times as many YouTube subscribers? Hmm. Probably not. I don't see any correlation there.

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,000
And I certainly don't think that correlation implies causation. Heavens, heaven forbids

31
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,840
to Betsy. Um, so, you know, they, they're just God, they, I'm gonna, I'm gonna look at the fucking

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
Twitter because I'm so mad. I'll just tell you what happens. If you don't, if you don't look at

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,520
Twitter, that's fine. Um, I'll, I'll give you the blow by blow. Um, because this is infuriating.

34
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,080
Uh, you know, I said, um, you know, email us if you have the streams, right? At this point,

35
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,360
it's like, okay, we got to think about, are we, do we have to reupload? Um, if anyone has, I know

36
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,720
at least some of the streams were saved by, by one or two people. These were the people who,

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,320
they contacted us during Radcom when we thought we lost the streams and they had saved them.

38
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,840
So somebody has them saved, at least some of them. Some of them could be lost forever. I don't know.

39
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,360
Um, but at least some of them have been saved somewhere. So I sit in the tweet like, uh,

40
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,360
our content's gone. YouTube's really being sluggish. Email us at the procrastinators mail

41
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,520
at gmail.com. If you would be so kind, if you have a copy and can provide it with us for a

42
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,720
potential reupload in the future and fuck in team YouTube. Thanks for the follow-up. We're

43
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,800
still working on your case. We understand that this can be very frustrating, but rest assured that

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,600
we're doing our best to recover the deleted content. Appreciate your patience in the meantime.

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,960
Okay. Thanks for that, I guess. And then follow-up. We also recommend deleting your previous tweet

46
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,680
as it contains your personal info, email address. This is so that you can restore your privacy.

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,440
So you can send secure your privacy and security at all times. Hope this helps. Oh yeah, team

48
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,560
YouTube. That helps a lot. That's big. That's, that's a, that's doing a lot for me right now.

49
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,960
And I really appreciate it. I totally didn't think that gosh, if I said the email, someone might find

50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,240
our email. And then who knows what could happen. Thank you. I'm sure you don't just want us to

51
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,920
delete the tweet because it's embarrassing that you made a fucking clerical error or, or a deliberate

52
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,120
decision, maybe, at this point, who knows, to just fucking destroy our content for no reason

53
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,080
and not even explain why. You know, it couldn't be that you just don't want us saying that on

54
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:49,520
Twitter. No. I'm very mad. I'm very mad about this PCP situation. That's it. I, what, you know, it

55
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,080
must be the moon. It must be those damn witches that cursed the moon. I don't know if you've seen

56
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,800
today. This is a trending thing on Twitter. Apparently someone says that some, some witches

57
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,280
did a blood hex on the moon and now it's bad. I don't know. I hadn't actually read the original

58
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,720
article, but I believe it. You know, I don't know the evidence, but I buy the premise that the moon

59
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,600
is cursed and we're all feeling the consequences. It just seems, it just seems, it just seems plausible.

60
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,280
You know, it just seems like something that it feels true is what I'm saying.

61
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,440
Oh, man. What else thing to update about the fucking procrastinator podcast?

62
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,360
You know, this, this shit is all happening. This content deletion has occurred. We're uploading

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,880
on the website. If you're listening to that on the website, hey, good job. You found me.

64
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,040
And, but we're still, we are still making some progress on the, on the rad con stuff that we

65
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,480
didn't deliver on yet, like the, the OVA and stuff. We are, we are chugging along that we've made a

66
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,240
little more headway on that. It'll, you know, when we'll be done. I don't know, but it's gonna get,

67
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:13,040
it's, it's getting there. It's, it's progressing. Oh man. I don't know. It's the solo Ben cast. And

68
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:21,360
you know, you've all given me a very easy out. This time, let me just, uh, the pro you've all

69
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:31,600
given me an easy out because I have been less censurious, censorious, um, with, with voicemails.

70
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,840
I think people are liking it. I think people are liking it. I'll play anything. I'll do anything.

71
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,480
I'm crazy. Uh, I mean, I'm Antifa. Um,

72
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,760
so I've been getting a lot more voicemails, so maybe I'll just jump into voicemails and see

73
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:53,680
how long that, that takes me. By the way, that guy, um, that guy who made the don't support PCP

74
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,680
or Digi Bro because Ben is Antifa and Digi is a quote unquote degenerate. Uh, that guy

75
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:08,720
privated the video. However, I did have the foresight to save a copy. I have a copy of that

76
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,000
video saved. And I think I might, I'm, I'll, I'll, I'll ask around and see if anyone else,

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,160
if there's a problem, if I do this, I think this should be fine, but I might re upload the video

78
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,640
just to Patreon, just as like, if you're a patron and you miss that video and you want to hear

79
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,360
all the reasons why, you know, the PCP hates America. I might put make that

80
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:39,040
just a little patron bonus exclusive thing since, since, since our, our friend has decided to redact

81
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,920
it publicly. Um, but you know, you put it, he put it, he put it out there and you know, he said it,

82
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:52,720
you know, people saw it. Um, anyway, so I might do that. Patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

83
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,040
Uh, but let's jump into voicemails and just see where the night, where the, where that leads.

84
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:06,720
Um, the first one is a hip hop is bad. You guys were talking about Kanye being the,

85
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,480
like running for president and shit. And, uh, you were mentioned the statement from a guy who said

86
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,440
that like, uh, hip hop sucks because they all just brag about stuff. And, um, yeah, bragging

87
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:29,040
in raps is like bad, but like the reverse is good because like I saw this other quote. I, uh,

88
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,120
it was like rap stopped being good when they stopped rapping about being poor and started

89
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,240
rapping about being rich. And, uh, I feel like that is actually true. And the rap that is about

90
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,760
like being vulnerable emotionally or financially or just in any way is better. And then like rap

91
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,320
where they're talking about how great they are and how they have money and bitches and all that

92
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,960
shit like that. Um, and that kind of just applies to any music. Like if you're, you know, talking

93
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,480
yourself up, it's kind of cringe, but if you're like, you know, letting you open in the doors to

94
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,040
your heart and shit, that's, that's epic and based every single time, even like all the music, you

95
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:21,360
know, right, right on. Um, I think, yeah, I don't, I'm like, I can understand the appeal and yeah,

96
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,760
not just rap anything, anything that any piece of media or whatever that is like bragging about

97
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,400
your success, bragging about how rich you are. It's like, okay, seems like the base appeal of that

98
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,600
would be like other rich people would like that. Cause like, yeah, I can relate to it. Like who's

99
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,920
going to, like no one's going to relate to that except other rich people or people who, or maybe

100
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,960
just people who overestimate their own success, right? Those are two things, but like there's

101
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,840
more poor people than rich people. Um, so I don't know. It's just based on the numbers game. I don't

102
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:00,240
get it, but apparently I'm wrong because people do seem to like rag raps. That's people don't

103
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,440
generally have a problem with it. As a fucking communist, uh, you know, I'm just inclined to be

104
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,800
like, hmm, wealth doesn't seem like a thing to be bragging about. If anything, I feel like you

105
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,560
should be embarrassed of it because you're hoarding resources and that's bad. Um, but I mean, obviously

106
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,520
not everyone feels that way. So yeah, uh, the, the, the, the quote, I remember quoting, I think

107
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,880
was Benjamin Dixon, he wasn't saying like bragging, rapping is bad. He was just saying that like the

108
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,640
rap culture celebrates capitalism and monetary accumulation, which seems from an outsider's

109
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,720
respect, as someone who doesn't, isn't into music at all, from an outsider's perspective,

110
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:50,960
that feels true. Um, but yeah, uh, good point. Next one is from stop recording.

111
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,320
Please stop recording unless you have at least four people on, because it's just, the podcast is

112
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,280
only wasting my time now with just two hour episodes that are shit. Um, like make two hour

113
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:13,520
episodes that waste my time and are funny again. Stop making shit. Okay. You dumb, you dumb motherfucker.

114
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:21,680
Okay. Listen, if you don't like, if you don't like episodes that have fewer people on them,

115
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,360
I guess that's fine. That's valid and you're entitled to your opinion. But why, like what,

116
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,760
what would you gain? What would you gain if we decided no, no, no, anything that doesn't have,

117
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,240
let's say four people on it shouldn't exist. We won't make it. What's the benefit? I, why? Like,

118
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,320
I could under, I could, if you, I don't see what's inherently worse about something that has, like,

119
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,200
here I am on the Ben Solo cast, like obviously I have a vested interest in this concept, right?

120
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,040
I don't see what is inherently worse about it, about having fewer people. I could understand

121
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,200
that you're having a preference, maybe it tends to be lower energy, or maybe it's just less likely

122
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,760
that, you know, your favorite guy or whatever is going to be on it. Fair enough. Why would we stop?

123
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,360
Why would we stop? I don't get it. You haven't explained it to me. You haven't convinced me.

124
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,840
Owned. Next one is from Thank You, Nate.

125
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,440
This message is from Nate. I saw your high school, the dead video recently, and it inspired me to

126
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,840
make a big change in my life. For years, I've been trying to win the affection of this girl by

127
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,000
trying to communicate that I need her, trying to appeal to the fact that she's my friend and she

128
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,360
cares about me to get her to be with me. That doesn't work, lads. You have to do the opposite.

129
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,320
It comes down to your dignity or your crush. Pick your dignity every time. That doesn't mean

130
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,720
never admit you're wrong. Just only do it when you actually think you are wrong. Even if that

131
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,560
trade-off works, you do not want to be one of those guys that's married to a woman that doesn't

132
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,360
respect him. You have to be okay without a woman for her to respect you. The thing I always got

133
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,240
caught up in was that I'd never met anyone who I wanted to spend my life with, like this girl,

134
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,000
and I don't think I ever will. But that doesn't matter because you don't actually need to be

135
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,560
with them. You need to work for something that you care about so much. Then even if it's all

136
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,520
you have, all alone, you'll be okay. Maybe this girl will come back to me someday or maybe I will

137
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:26,320
be alone. But if that happens, I will be okay. Thank you, Nate. You were close. You swerved a

138
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,600
little at the very end there. Surely, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume

139
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,400
that surely, in hindsight, you can see that maybe this girl will come back to me or maybe I'll be

140
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:49,120
alone is kind of the wrong lesson. If you don't, like you said, you don't need anyone. You can be

141
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,960
self-sufficient. You can be happy alone. That's called valuing yourself, having, I don't know,

142
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:05,280
dignity or whatever. It's a component of that, right? If you can do that, then surely, surely

143
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:14,160
you must see that it's not the logical extension of that is not, okay, okay, so I can be alone.

144
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,840
And the only alternative is this girl. You've gotten there, kind of, but you're not quite at

145
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,160
the finish line. I haven't seen High School of the Dead. I haven't seen Nate's High School of the

146
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:33,440
Dead video. But yes, oneitis is bad. You will not, you will, that's, if you know, that's when

147
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,760
you are obsessed with one girl and you're like, oh, this is the only girl for me. That's bad.

148
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,240
That's not healthy. And the idea of like appealing to them is like, oh, you're my friend and I care

149
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,560
about you, right? It's like, you can't, you can't like, if someone doesn't like you, you can't,

150
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,640
you can't appeal to them on the basis of how much you like them, right? Like, no matter,

151
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:04,240
no matter how much you like someone, that's not gonna make them like you. Like, so there's no

152
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:11,760
point in appealing, like either they like you or they don't. And maybe there's no, there's no use,

153
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,120
like, there's no end, like the more you try to work on it, like you can't like be like, okay, okay,

154
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
well, let me, let me try and fix that. Let me do something to make them like me. It's like, well,

155
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,040
if you're, if you're, if you're deliberately working on that as a project, like it's a bad look,

156
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,800
right? It's like, you shouldn't be, you shouldn't be working on that. You should be doing your thing.

157
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,000
And if someone likes it, they like it, right? So the thing is, so there's no,

158
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,840
there's no fixing that if they don't like you, you just got to, you just got to do your thing.

159
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,480
And if they, maybe, if they change their minds, maybe they, they probably won't,

160
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,520
because you shouldn't be doing anything radically different. You should be doing your thing.

161
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,360
All times, you should be doing your thing. And if you keep doing your thing,

162
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,240
then the people who are into it will be down for it. And they're in, and they're out, and they're

163
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,720
out, but down, and all around, like the Heffalumps and Wuzels. Okay, woo, cool, good, good, good

164
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:16,560
story, guy. Next one is from Nate, quote, full-time YouTuber and quote, best man. Let's hear what he

165
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:25,200
asked to say. The other day, it just dawned on me. I'm a full-time YouTuber now. I've kind of been for,

166
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:34,400
you know, nine, 10, 11 months now, 12 almost. Yeah, how many, and how many videos came out in

167
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,360
that time? Nate, full, I'm reading into the intention of these air quotes here. It's like,

168
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:47,200
okay, full-time, yeah. Glad, I'm glad you don't have to work a wagey job. But I'm not alone in asking,

169
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,080
where's best anime ever, Ghost in the Shell? Where's Gits, Nate, full-time YouTuber best man?

170
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,560
Give me the content. I want the content.

171
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,640
Oh God, I hope these aren't all about Nate. The next one is called, for real, is Nate sexist?

172
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,960
Let's fucking do it, lads. You know, guys, I don't know how to feel about Nate these days,

173
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,480
you know? It seems like he really hates women and like makes fun of them all the time.

174
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm genuinely wondering if he's sexist. Mr. Bestman, do you care to comment?

175
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm not sexist. Thank you.

176
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,320
Well, there it is. You mean you heard it. That's it. There's no, there's no more. There's nothing

177
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,800
else to say on the matter. We have the word of God, and that's it, end of discussion. Cool, simple.

178
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,480
Next one is from Margar, who famously has been the last person to call in

179
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,960
a few times in a row now, but not this time. We've got more. We've got plenty more after this.

180
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:11,280
Let's hear from Margar, shall we? Margar here. I'd like to question my status in voice jail.

181
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,640
Has it been abolished? Am I set free? What happens to a person when there are no police,

182
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,920
but they get arrested? Do I still exist? I still want to send voicemails every week.

183
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,960
It's, I look forward to it now. I have made a pattern of it. Don't put me in jail. I've done

184
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:40,160
nothing wrong. I like it. Don't do it, please. Well, that's for a judge to decide. I can tell,

185
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,240
okay, the status is there was disagreement about whether voice jail was the proper course of

186
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,840
action. And so your trial was held up. You are currently caught up in red tape. You are being

187
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,840
processed by the system. The system is working. The process is working. It's in the process.

188
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,560
You are being put through the machine. However, while you are not technically in voice jail,

189
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,400
which was not technically about, we did not fully abolish voice jail with the charity stream,

190
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,760
but effectively you are detained and unable and lack your freedom while you are in the

191
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,960
processing phase. And frankly, I intend to use it, do everything in my power to make sure

192
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:30,000
that the process takes, never comes to completion. You are never brought to trial,

193
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,400
and you are never free. But that's just me. So I hope that answers your question and you're welcome.

194
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,360
Next one is called BLM. Okay. All right. Hey, what's up again? I'm here again talking about

195
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,000
everybody. The last two weeks, I've been trying to get a hold of Nate Bestman because he's a

196
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,960
fucking coward and won't show up on his own show. This is the whole point of him using the N word.

197
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,200
Don't really appreciate it as a viewer and a listener. So he does fucking stuff for that.

198
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,560
Again, and also stop talking over the voicemails. It's really hard to listen

199
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,560
when you're talking over. Okay. You have a limit of 90 seconds. Okay. I got 96 to talk

200
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,200
when I apologize. I deeply, deeply apologize for talking over the voicemail. That's my

201
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,160
bad friend. Nothing else up with me. You know, just chilling right here. Okay. Nate to respond to

202
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,960
this message. Okay. I'm sorry. I can't, I can't, I can't raise all right or

203
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,240
issues of the N word and his reason. Okay, bro. It's not cool. Okay. You wouldn't even say in

204
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,360
front of an African American. Go fuck off. All right.

205
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:53,520
I, oh God. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm with you. And I think I would mostly agree.

206
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,040
I mean, I know Nate's said it before. I mean, I've said it before. I can't, I have. I just,

207
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:08,640
it's happened. Ingest always, but I have. So there it is. I don't think it was a good idea.

208
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,840
I'm not like saying like, no, it's fine. I don't know if it is fine, but, but it's happened. So

209
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:24,320
I'm not above it. But Digi's explanation of why her, what she said. Okay. I hope I'm not

210
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,720
misremembering, but like her explanation is that like she grew up in a school that was like

211
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,560
very much black population and a lot of people there said it all the time and she said it and

212
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,240
it was like a part of growing up in her culture. That doesn't sound completely ridiculous to me.

213
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,080
You know, if you grew up and everyone around you said it, sure. I, I would,

214
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,720
I mean, you wouldn't say it. I don't think did you, or I don't think anyone would say it in

215
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,520
front of like, I know she would probably say it in front of like certain people that she knows,

216
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,240
you know, black people, maybe certain people who she knows is fine with it. Probably she wouldn't

217
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:14,640
say it in front of just any random person, black person, that would be like real fucked up. So,

218
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,800
I don't know. I personally don't think that I should say it. I don't, you know,

219
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,000
even, even as a joke, I don't necessarily, I don't stand by the times that I've said it in the past

220
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,200
before. It's bad. It's, you shouldn't say it generally. But I'm not here to police anyone's

221
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,480
language. I'm not here to say like, you can't say that. I do think, you know, I might not agree with

222
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,200
it. I might think that generally probably white people probably don't say it, but I'm not gonna,

223
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,360
I don't have the power to enforce that. And I don't think that I can say you can't,

224
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,600
that's just me. It's everyone's, the words you use, ultimately, it's up to you, myself,

225
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,680
I don't think I should say it, but I can't speak for anyone else. But I did not disagreeing with you

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:12,400
in thinking that probably don't say it. So that's my opinion. I don't like it, but I'm not a cop.

227
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:22,800
Yeah, I think that's what I think about that. Okay, next one. A question people might hate.

228
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,920
Let's see about that. Did Nate stop showing up because there's drama or just because he's cringe?

229
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,360
I mean, Nate has given no explanation why he stopped showing up. He did just move.

230
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,920
I don't know why. I mean, I don't think moving would explain not being on the show for, you know,

231
00:24:49,920 --> 00:25:00,160
like six weeks or whatever. It doesn't take that long to move. I don't think any drama did it,

232
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,640
like I don't recall any particular drama occurring before Nate stopped showing up.

233
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,360
Other than maybe like the,

234
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Nate had had Nate stopped showing up before the channel, the content got deleted. Did he like,

235
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,440
did he like recuse himself out of like shame or something or a general upset about like,

236
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,760
you know, what's happened to the channel? I don't know. I don't know what the relation,

237
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,640
if there's any relationship to that happening here. I have no idea. Short answer, no clue.

238
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,480
No clue why Nate doesn't show up anymore. It doesn't make any sense. Seems really weird to me.

239
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,480
But you know, here I am, the only one still here. So, so clearly I'm the weird one.

240
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,840
All right, cool. Next one is from Doon Koon. My man.

241
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,800
PCP. This is Doon Koon from Procrastinate is Anonymous.

242
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,080
And I demand the immediate release of All Dye Corporation from The Voice Jail.

243
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:08,160
I am invoking my voice grail status to free my nigga All Dye. Do it or we'll kill you with guns

244
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:20,960
in Minecraft. Oh God, okay. Hold on. I gotta check something. I gotta check something

245
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:31,040
real quick here. I'll die. I mean, was not released, was not one of the ones released

246
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:38,480
from Voice Jail during the BLM stream, right? Let me just make absolutely sure of that. I have the

247
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:49,760
jail image saved here. Yep, it was. It was Mozilla Fennekin, a well-researched thesis,

248
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:57,600
and Japanese man Yuta who were freed. Still in there are lol pussies out here eating with spoons,

249
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,480
Lost Tape Archive, All Dye Corporation, Oopsie Bobo, and Fuck Dye Buster.

250
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,280
Those are the ones still in there. I'm pretty sure eating with spoons is TNCP.

251
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,360
Hope I'm remembering that right. But, but,

252
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,880
Doon Koon, I don't remember you being in Voice Grail, but if indeed you are in the Voice Grail,

253
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:30,560
then we have stipulated before that like Matter and Antimatter, Voice Jail and Voice Grail

254
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:40,800
cancel one another out and mutually annihilate one another in a burst of pure light that extends

255
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:50,880
in a time-space cone throughout the fabric of reality. So, if indeed if you're not pulling

256
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,000
one over on me, if you're in the Voice Grail, then there we go. All Dye Corporation, you're free.

257
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,680
You're free, fucker. Congratulations. Pussies out here eating with spoons, Oopsie Bobo,

258
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:11,200
and Fuck Dye Buster are the only ones left in Voice Jail since Margar is still being processed.

259
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,120
He's not technically made it into his cordoned off cell yet, which why I have specially prepared

260
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,240
for him. He hasn't made it there yet though, so there's only three in there. So we're closer

261
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,800
than ever to abolishing Voice Jail, which obviously I'm conflicted about. Obviously,

262
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:35,360
I'm of two minds about that. On the one hand, cops bad. On the other, prison labor, highly profitable.

263
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,840
So, I don't know. Let me just, just for reference, let me,

264
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:50,640
let me make sure, let me remove him from the image so that I won't forget. There we go.

265
00:28:50,640 --> 00:29:02,080
This, it's Canon now. It's, it's Canon. Done. Okay, next up, semi-normie guy. Hmm, I don't like,

266
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,480
I don't like the cut of this guy's jib. Let's see what he's got to say for himself.

267
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,520
About a year ago, I sent in a voicemail to you guys about me considering joining the military.

268
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,640
At the time, I thought it was the most effective and accessible way to help and serve people,

269
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,120
and I thought that it would develop me as a person in ways that only that career path could.

270
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,600
But I was still torn about it, so I asked you guys's advice. Now, one year in change later,

271
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,960
I look back at those thoughts and my frame of mind has just shifted so much on so many issues,

272
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,400
including but obviously not limited to the military. And so I'm almost embarrassed that I even sent

273
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,120
in that voicemail. I just think it's crazy how much people's perspective can change in such a

274
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,720
short amount of time. Anyways, question I'm leading to is, can any of you remember a time in your

275
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,520
life when you looked back and had this similar experience that I'm having now where you're

276
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,200
cringing at your past self for being just fucking idiot? And what was it that you were being an

277
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:10,880
idiot about? Thanks. Um, well, I think my answer is going to be kind of boring. But like around

278
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,440
like last year, when I fell down the communism hole, I look back at my I look back at my dumb,

279
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,520
confused, milk toasts, no real convictions about anything, you know, sort of vaguely

280
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,560
liberal, centrist self. And I'm like, absolutely disgusted, like how embarrassing,

281
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:36,560
how embarrassing to be like that. I don't know. So that's that's me. That's this the most obvious

282
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:46,320
example. Um, um, what else? What else? I don't fucking know. Um, the military, I don't begrudge

283
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:53,360
anyone serving in the military. I do think that it's probably not. Yeah, I don't think it's

284
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,480
necessarily like a super helpful or heroic thing to do. I don't think like the United States

285
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,600
military is like a force for good in the world really. Um, but you know, you got to do what

286
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,640
you got to do. And they claim to give like some pretty good like veterans benefits, but then at

287
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,120
the same time it seems like they kind of bend over backwards to find loopholes to deny their

288
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,200
veterans benefits. I hear that all the time that it's actually real hard to get the benefits

289
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,160
you're supposed to have and stuff like that. So, you know, I don't know, but um, you know,

290
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:32,560
an individual who does it because it's like that they're their their quickest path to like

291
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,400
economic security or whatever. It's like, I get it. Um, but also I'm kind of glad you didn't do it

292
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:45,040
because I don't think it's super, super great, but whatever. Um, it's not necessarily super

293
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,680
really. It's fine. It could be fine maybe, but probably not. That's bad. Don't join the military.

294
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:59,600
It's stupid. Uh, ACAB, uh, lol. Uh, next one is from who Ben St. really is. Hmm. Terrible.

295
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:11,520
Guys, I've finally done it. I finally understand who Ben St. really is. Think about this. Ben

296
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:20,560
is just Chaz Princeton from Yu-Gi-Oh! Who? Chaz Princeton.

297
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:31,040
Chaz Princeton. Uh, okay. Well, I like his fashion sense. I like his, I like his look. I like his

298
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:38,000
vibe. Um, he's got, he's got better hair than I do, but I mean it's, this is Yu-Gi-Oh! So that's fine.

299
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:46,800
Um, uh, let's, let's read, let's read about Chaz Princeton from the Yu-Gi-Oh! wiki. Chaz Princeton,

300
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,880
known as Jun Manjome in the Japanese version, is an arrogant duelist who serves as one of

301
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,080
Jaden Yu-Ki's rivals throughout the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX series. Chaz is considered Jaden's primary

302
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,440
rival in the same, in the same effect that Setokaiba is the primary rival of Yu-Gi mode.

303
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:10,080
Okay, so I'm the edgy rival of the GX series. Okay, that's good. They do have dueled one another

304
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,400
total of seven times throughout the seasons of the anime. Through his evolution, he goes from

305
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:23,040
being a duelist who only respected powerful cards. Is that a thing? Is that a thing in Yu-Gi-Oh!

306
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,560
That's like, oh, even weak cards are good. You gotta love your fucking Pokemon. Just battle with

307
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,400
your favorite. That sucks. That sucks so bad. He only respected powerful cards to a duelist who

308
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:40,640
believes that there can be effectiveness in any card, specifically shown in his use of Ojama cards.

309
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,160
He becomes a marked threat after becoming the North Academy representative, but after that

310
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:53,680
becomes more and more a comic relief. Yes, it's me. It is me. It's perfect. Uh, in the manga,

311
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:01,360
Chas serves much the same purpose as in the anime. Very good. Um, I want to know what are these

312
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,760
Ojamas. They're like nasty little goblins. Um, like, what's, are they like little weak

313
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,960
creatures, but with like funny goofy like side effects or something? I don't know. Uh, it's

314
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,720
yeah, you're right. He, he got it. He did it. Um, next voicemail is from

315
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:25,040
Nat. These are all caps. Naz, question mark, greater than Chas. Well, we just found out that Chas

316
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,000
Princeton is base. So I hope you're not gonna, I hope you're not gonna shit on my boy, but I think

317
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,160
this is talking about the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, I think. Um, I don't know what Naz is, but

318
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:45,920
let's, let's find out. We're entering a new era, a golden era for the PCP. No more Chas. We are in

319
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:52,960
the Naz, the Nate Autonomous Zone. What do you guys think? Let's air some grievances, shall we?

320
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,120
Why is Nate so bad at communicating? Why can't he like, you know, let us know he's moving and stuff?

321
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,840
Um, he wanted to move at the end of the last month, but he didn't. Okay, he's moving now,

322
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,200
and that's fine. But what the fuck is up? Where are you at, dog? He's canceled a bunch of streams,

323
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,600
and he hasn't been on any of the episodes. Okay, maybe. Let's say, hypothetically, he's editing

324
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:24,720
some videos. That's fine and all, but is an hour or two to come hang with you guys really that big

325
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:34,080
of a time sink? I don't know. I don't know. I don't, I don't know. You know, I don't, I don't have the

326
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:40,560
answers. I don't have answers to these questions. It really makes you wonder. Uh, the Nate Autonomous

327
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,920
Zone, that doesn't, no, it would be like, because Nate, it's a Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,

328
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,880
then the Nate Autonomous Zone would be an Autonomous Zone located in or around Nate,

329
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,040
so that doesn't work. I don't know what you would call it, but I understand the point.

330
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,480
Uh, yeah, we're free, we're free of his tyranny, the tyranny of his, of his, of his ledgers,

331
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:10,400
um, and his, and his fucking, his, uh, his, uh, his devil, his devil's advocate centrism. We're

332
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,520
free, everyone. Uh, we've made it to the other side. Uh, no one can fucking stop me. Um, uh,

333
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,920
and here I am. Here I am, you know, speaking truth to power. And, you know, I'm proud of myself.

334
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:34,560
I'm proud of myself to stand up to bullies. Yeah, yeah. No, no, uh, I don't know. I don't know

335
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,920
what the fuck his deal is, you know, whatever. Uh, he doesn't want to explain himself and that is

336
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,400
his prerogative. Um, next up is from Slyther Slacker. I think I know who this is, but let's

337
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:55,120
hear him, shall we? Quick clarification. Slyther Sean is also me, a.k.a. the voicemail god.

338
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,440
Also, the reason for that was I rebranded my channel to fit more with my theme. I'm going to

339
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:09,280
be doing a big ol' UgeoGX lecture in the future. And also, question for y'all. How many notes

340
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,920
or how long were your notes for your lectures? I'm currently sitting on a Google doc at 21 pages.

341
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:32,720
Um, um, my notes, uh, okay. Well, I'll speak for myself. My, I didn't take that many notes.

342
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,560
My first Sonichi lecture, I didn't have any notes. The only, like, my main notes that I used

343
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,120
were on the board. Like, the board was my notes. I had my phone open to, like, quickly look stuff

344
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:51,120
up and I did that a couple times in the lecture. Um, in the Unicorn Jelly lecture, I think it was

345
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,560
the same. I didn't really have any, I don't think I had any notes other than what was on the board.

346
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,240
I think, I don't, I don't, I don't remember, but I'm pretty sure. In the Sonichi 2 lecture, which,

347
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,640
I'm sorry it's not out yet, but I'm waiting until, um, after I do the Slime and Punishment

348
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,240
Finale, which is almost done. I have, like, one more shot to make. It is, like, almost

349
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:17,440
fucking done. Uh, yeah, baby, yeah. Um, uh, in the Sonichi 2 lecture, I did have notes,

350
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,840
not that many. I just kind of, like, I had, like, just like the first one, I had, like,

351
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,720
chapter names on the board and a couple of highlights, but then I, I sort of had a little

352
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,640
bit more elaboration in my little, in a little, little notebook, just a small, little ledger

353
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,240
notebook. So I, my notes were pretty, probably, like, four, like, mini pages, four or five,

354
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,720
like, very mini pages. It was the equivalent of maybe, like, one and a half, like, full-size pages

355
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:56,720
of notes written at normal size. So, minor. Um, I, I found it, I found it mostly adequate to just read,

356
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,480
reread through the material, since I was already familiar with it, reread through it,

357
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,400
write down notes, sort of highlighting what I considered to be important moments, and then

358
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,880
kind of pair them down to what I actually wanted to talk about, and then just sort of distill those

359
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,320
into bullet points and put them on the thing. And mainly I was able to, like, okay, oh, bullet

360
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,400
point, oh, I remember, and then kind of go on about the details of what the bullet point, um,

361
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:29,120
was referring to. So yeah, I'm not a big note guy. Uh, and I'm pretty sure that the other guys were

362
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,480
the same. I don't think any of us had, like, a ton of notes. Um, so yeah, for, for me, and I think

363
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,800
for the rest of us, not that much. Uh, next one is from Ben, you ruined my life. Well, I'm ready

364
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:51,440
to answer for my crimes. Let's go. All right, Ben, it's your roommate, Joe Swanson. I could not

365
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:58,240
find my legs, so I broke into the kitchen and I took your room, and I took your worm oil,

366
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:05,040
and I drank it all because I was running low on nutrients, like Paul Blart, Ben. You understand?

367
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,400
I understand, like Paul Blart, yes. I hope it wasn't too important to you, but I would not

368
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,520
recommend you make any more, unless you would like to become a worm as well. You see, on top of not

369
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,480
having legs, I now no longer have arms because I lost them drinking your worm oil. I am now a worm.

370
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,520
It's syrup. It is your roommate, the worm. Don't even know what you're drinking. Good night.

371
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,920
Hey, okay, worm. Uh, is this a reference to In the House of the Worm by George R.R. Martin,

372
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,640
which is a, I haven't read it, but I like know about it. It's like a story that he wrote a long

373
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:50,480
time ago about like a space colony that has this cult, and they worship this like, sort of dune,

374
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:57,440
sort of like, worm creature, I think, but like the priests of this worm god, they cut their arms

375
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,200
and legs off to basically make them into, like, resemble a worm. Is that, is it a reference,

376
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:11,520
or is it just a happy accident? Um, listen, Joe, worm, buddy. Uh, yeah, it was important to me. I

377
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:22,240
spent like over $100 buying 11 pounds of isomolta oligosaccharides, aka insoluble tapioca fiber.

378
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:30,160
It took me all day to convert it to, to, to cook it into syrup and bottle it.

379
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,640
It took hours and hours to cool down. It was, it was, it was molten hot and it does not give off

380
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,880
heat. It was like the labrea tar pits. It was, um, just, just a nightmare. I had to put a little,

381
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,280
I had to put it on the, on the living room table and put a note on it with a skull that said,

382
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,760
heat death, don't touch. Um, but, but you, you didn't listen. Um, and the thing about it is that

383
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,760
it's delicious. You can, I'm, I would love to just drink it myself. It's, if it weren't earmarked

384
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,760
from, it's drinkable. You just take a big spoon of it and eat it. It's like honey. It's like a

385
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,640
agave nectar. It's wicked good. So good. I hate you. I hate you, Joe. How could you? You've ruined

386
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:16,080
my life and I will not be bullied. Um, I will, I will persevere. Um, I will make more worm syrup.

387
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,400
Um, and I will fucking cook you in it. I will, the thing about it is, Joe, if you take that,

388
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,440
if you, I'm trying to experiment, but like how, how much should I cook it down? I bought a candy

389
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,760
thermometer and I'm seeing, and I'm taking little, little small batches of it and cooking it to,

390
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,160
because like the lower the water content, the higher the boiling point, because you know,

391
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,840
adding fiber to it in a solution increases the boiling point. So as you cook it and water cooks

392
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:51,040
off, the temperature increases higher and higher. This is how it works. So I'm experimenting with

393
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,560
seeing like how hot should I cook it to get it down to the point where it has, I think I want

394
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,080
like the minimum water content possible while still making it like able to be like poured and

395
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:09,040
work with and added to a solution. But if you cook it way down, like to about 140 degrees Celsius,

396
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,440
it becomes like amber. It becomes like this syrup that once cooled becomes like rock hard and you

397
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,280
can like crack it with a hammer. So what I'm saying is that I'm going to encase you in it, um, and

398
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:29,360
keep you like Han Solo in, in fucking carbonite hanging on my wall as a trophy. That is your

399
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:37,200
fate. You brought this upon yourself. Live by the serp, die by the serp. That's, that's, and also,

400
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,680
Eleazar put up a picture of my fucking the syrup that I made on Twitter. It's, it's funny. It's

401
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:56,560
cool. I'm very excited. Delicious. Next one in this, in this charade. We've got a message from 522.

402
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,160
Oh god, I wanted to burp, but it didn't work. And now my throat feels gross.

403
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,760
522. What's up, buddy?

404
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:23,120
Ah shit, what game is this? Is it, is it, is it Chrono Trigger? No, it's Earthbound. It's Earthbound.

405
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,720
Where, where, where, where is this going? Where, where is this going?

406
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:45,840
I mean, it's, it's nice. What a, what a relaxing time. You know, this is just like the solo

407
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:53,520
Bencast vibe. It's just, you know, just floating through, floating through a, a, a void. But it's,

408
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,000
a vaguely sinister void. That's, that's what this feels like. That's, that's, that's what,

409
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,680
that's what listening to my voice sounds like. And that's what this song sounds like. So it's

410
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,960
very fitting. Appreciate the contribution. You fuck!

411
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:22,000
Well, um, voice jail. Voice, I'm gonna submit another applicant. You, you're going into processing

412
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:30,480
along with Margar, 522. You are, the paperwork has been begun. You will be incarcerated at our earliest

413
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:41,280
possible convenience after we, after we refund the police. Next up, Snowman. What's up, my dude?

414
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,040
Hey guys, I'm a longtime fan of the show. I just wanted to say thanks for making it. It makes

415
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:58,160
me happy. Bye. Thank you. And you, you see, who was it that said that dumb shit? Who was it that

416
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:05,440
said, uh, stop, stop? You see, stop recording. People appreciate what I, me, personally do. This

417
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:13,120
is now a solo effort. I have successfully privatized the PCP. It is mine now. I own it. Uh, this is a,

418
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:21,040
this is a one man show. Um, and frankly, this was the plan all along. Just make the PCP environment

419
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:28,720
so toxic, so uninhabitable that all other members would just be forced into, into retirement.

420
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,400
And I would be left, you know, with the spoils. That was the, the treasure, the pot of gold at the

421
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:44,720
end of the rainbow. I, I made it. I made it through the wilderness. Somehow I made it through. Uh,

422
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,080
it's good. It's good to be the best, but it's lonely at the top.

423
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,640
What's up, the Joker?

424
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:07,920
I had a vision, a world, world without insane PCP ground out a little profit and YouTube

425
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,400
trying to, trying to shut them down one video at a time. And it was so

426
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,840
great. I've had a change of heart. Speak up.

427
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,600
Should I, should I have all the fun?

428
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:34,400
Let's give someone, give someone else a chance. If Ben St. isn't cancel pencil in 60 minutes,

429
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,040
and I blow up PCP HQ.

430
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:53,760
I'm genuinely not sure if that like glitchiness was intentional. I'm leaning towards yes,

431
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,080
but I'm not a hundred. I'm not a hundo on it. Um, blow up the PCP headquarters. We have no need

432
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,800
for it. I was planning to burn it down anyway. Now that, now that it's my show, we don't need

433
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,960
this big office building. It's just taken up space. It's just rent seeking, you know, burn it down.

434
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,160
You know, give it, give it back to nature. You know, humans are truly are the virus.

435
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,560
Um, I think, I think you and I can make beautiful music together. The Joker.

436
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,960
Uh, let's hear from

437
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,840
Drumpf off a bean. Yes, please.

438
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,040
What, what, what? One more time? One, one more time? Hmm?

439
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,320
Defund PCP, execute Ben St. Drink Mountain Dew Game Fuel.

440
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:53,440
Something, okay, execute Ben St. Drink Mountain Dew Game Refuel. I, I agree with one of those two

441
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,280
things. So I guess I would say that I'm kind of a centrist on this voicemail. I'm, I'm, I'm

442
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,920
semi-pro, semi-against. I, I think, you know, I don't agree with everything you say,

443
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,000
but I will defend to the death. You're right to say it. Mr. Mr. Drumpf, sir. You are a disgrace

444
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,320
to the office, sir. Have you no sense of decency, sir? Uh, military budget approved.

445
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:28,240
Okay, here we go. Suggestion from a black fan. Oh, no, it's, oh, no, help. Uh, okay, let's hear it.

446
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,640
Crossover episode idea, the PCP with the N-double-A-C-P.

447
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,920
N-double-A-C-P. Nick is angry about Caucasian people. We ain't never going to make it.

448
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,840
You guys like Charlie Brown's Christmas, Charlie Brown's Kwanzaa most offensive video?

449
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:08,640
It's real good. It's real funny. It's very funny. Racist? I don't think, I don't know. It's just so

450
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,360
fucking whack. It's so wild. It's so out there. I find that it takes a refuge in audacity and

451
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:21,280
it's, you can't take it seriously to the point that I don't really see, I don't really see it being

452
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,920
that offensive. Maybe that's just me. I don't know. But that's my thoughts on it. Also,

453
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,560
no hard R. I'm safe. Don't cancel me. Um,

454
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:38,400
because then, because that would just be feeding into the Joker. No, the Joker said we had 60 minutes.

455
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:45,360
I'm not canceled. I'm not. The Joker did not win. He, he still has to blow up the PCPHQ. He has to

456
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,800
do it. That was he agreed on it and I'm not canceled. So he has to do it. That's part of the

457
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:58,080
agreement. We live in a society. You gotta keep your promises. Thank you. Mwah. Um, next up.

458
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,440
Poopsack. 25 seconds. Baby.

459
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:13,200
Howdy. It's me. One of your fans who is not an involuntary celibate. Just wanted to speak up and

460
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:19,280
remind you guys that you do have fans that are adults with children and careers out there

461
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,280
that do enjoy the constant ramblings of the procrastinators. Keep up the good work, gentlemen

462
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,680
and mage. And remember, there are more like me out there. Cheers.

463
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:40,800
I mean, I, I, I appreciate it. I, I was just reflecting today on how much I hate kids and

464
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:50,240
teenagers. They're stupid. They don't know shit. Anytime they do anything good, it's by accident.

465
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,160
They're just, they're just animals, you know, going on instinct. They can't,

466
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:01,600
they don't, they don't have agency. You know, it's not their fault that they like us. It's just,

467
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:09,280
you know, an accident. So it doesn't make me feel good. On the other hand, an adult with like a

468
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,720
family, like that seems kind of normie. And that's pretty embarrassing. And frankly, I, I don't know

469
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:23,200
if, if, if I'm comfortable having you listening to the show. Being that way as you are, I think

470
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,760
that maybe, I think that's a little weird. And I think that maybe you've probably some kind of like,

471
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:36,400
some kind of like, some kind of like MAP, pedophile, a global elite, adrena comb drinking,

472
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:45,680
fucking Democrat or something. And frankly, I won't have it. I won't have it on my show. I object. I

473
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:55,600
don't like it. Well, fuck, man, we're done with the, we're done with the, the voicemails.

474
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,080
We're done with the voicemails and we're not even an hour in. This is unprecedented.

475
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,040
But then this, this, this length is unprecedented. It would be unprecedented for me to end the show

476
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:10,000
now. But on the other hand, everything about the Ben Solo cast is unprecedented. We're entering

477
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:18,960
a new age, a golden age. This is the Ben Saints show now. Everyone, there was a secret,

478
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:25,360
I snuck a secret clause into the contract, into the PCP contract that we all signed in blood

479
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:33,760
all those years ago that said, if ever an episode happens and it's just Ben, Ben owns the podcast.

480
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:39,040
It's all, it all, it's all his. It was a, it was like a taunting, you know, that episode of the

481
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:46,400
Simpsons where it's like, you know, the last one to die gets the art and it's, it's down to, to

482
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:53,520
Burns versus Grandpa. It was exactly like that. And now here I am. I, I, I did it. I killed all

483
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,400
the other ones. I destroyed them. I drove them away with my toxic personality.

484
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:08,400
And, and now here I am at the end. Here we are in the future. And it's bright. I own everything.

485
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:19,600
The, the, the ultimate reward of the PCP. I did it. Remember that? Remember my little pony?

486
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:26,320
Remember, let's take this moment, this moment of transition, a moment of change, right? Nothing

487
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:31,760
will ever be the same after this. Let's take this moment to think back to where it all started,

488
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:39,280
with my little pony, the little, with a little blue horse named Phantom Horn. He never thought

489
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,520
he would see the day when he'd become a big, fancy CEO, corporate executive, head of the

490
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:53,600
procrastinator's podcast, highfalutin, emailing with the YouTube staff, getting, getting deals,

491
00:54:53,600 --> 00:55:03,040
cutting deals, making, making flip, canceling people, getting canceled on and on. We go round

492
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:14,880
and round. But here we are. You know what? I'm tempted to try and stretch to an hour, but like,

493
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:22,960
fuck it, who gives a shit? Thanks for listening, everybody. You're welcome. You're welcome for

494
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:30,240
being the guy who shows up to deliver this quality content directly to your ears and

495
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,920
for being, for having the good taste and the good sense to make it just as long as it needs to be,

496
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:45,280
just, just, just perfect, the optimal length, the ideal format. Here it is. And it's me. I'm the guy

497
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:53,360
who did it. If you want to hear more bonus episodes of the PCP with other guys, I don't know why you

498
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,200
would want to hear other people, but if you, if that seems like something you would consider,

499
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,200
patreon.com slash the procrastinators, you get access to all our fucking bonus episodes.

500
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,600
There's like 40 hundred of them right now. That's a fucking deal if ever there was one.

501
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:14,000
patreon.com slash Ben St. If you want to hear more solo Ben casts and hear me answering questions,

502
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,240
that's what this is. On the solo Ben cast, Patreon Q&A, people put type questions in the comments

503
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,320
and I answer them. And usually I go on longer for each one because they're more,

504
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,440
generally people ask me things more specifically about me that I have more to say about.

505
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,640
It's better. What am I, am I saying that the Ben St. Patreon Q&A podcast is better in every way

506
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:41,520
than the procrastinators podcast? And yeah, as a matter of fact, I am. Sue me. Send a voicemail

507
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:48,000
to speakpipe at, is it at the procrastinators mail at gmail.com.

508
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:56,640
Wait, no, that's not the, the link is teespring, put gumroad, redbubble, speak, speakpipe.com slash

509
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,800
pcp voicemail. Always fuck it up. Send the voicemail. And I'll read it. I'll listen to it,

510
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:10,240
because as you see, I don't curate anything. I'm an anarchist. And, and I don't believe in censorship.

511
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:16,000
And I, I'll just give it over to the fucking, I'll throw, I'll throw the shit to the fucking wolves

512
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,760
and let them devour it. Anything goes. It's chaos. Fuck the police.

513
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,000
Um, and I guess that's the perfect note to end on. Thanks for listening, everybody.

514
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,400
Thanks for being a pet. Hey, fuck YouTube. Hey, YouTube, die. Hey, thanks for nothing.

515
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,320
Hey, thanks for fucking our show for no reason. And then just pretending you're going to fix it

516
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,960
when you're not going to. Thanks for everything. You're really fucking nailed it. You're really

517
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,320
cool guys. It's really like fair and good and nice. And you're a good company and you,

518
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:52,640
and it's cool. It's great. You did it. Thanks and have a great day, everyone. See you on the next episode.
