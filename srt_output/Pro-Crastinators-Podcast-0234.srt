00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Hello. Okay, the show's starting. Yeah, okay. I didn't say the show's gonna start. The show's

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,760
starting. This is the beginning of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We got me. Ben Saint. We got Gibbontake.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:27,800
Hey. We got Tom Oliver. You all know. Back in the saddle. Okay, our guest this week. I'm stoked

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,080
to have her on. Mallory Malapert. Is that your real name? Is that your Twitter name?

5
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:40,280
No, that's just a Twitter name. Malapert is, my name is, my last name is Udicious. No one knows

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,360
how to. Udicious? Mallory Udicious. Malapert is just a Twitter name. Malapert means someone who's

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,000
saucy that likes to talk shit to, you know, people that are, you know, above them.

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:59,800
Yeah. News, news to me. Okay. Okay, so I will, I will try and introduce you. And if I, you disagree

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,680
with anything, you can, you can correct me. You might know her as the, the artist on Twitter who

10
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,200
made two, two particular pieces that were, that were controversially received by the broader

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,240
community. The first one was the new guy comic, right? Show that on, Eleazar, put it on screen,

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,800
show the new guy comic on screen, pause the video, read it, and think about it and consider,

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,120
consider, form your own opinion. Second one was, I don't know what to call it, the shoplifting one?

14
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,400
Well, you know, I should probably say like, you know, I do a webcomic called sweet beans.

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,240
People call me sweet beans. That's not my, but I call myself. I was calling you sweet beans until

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:51,080
like a week ago. Yeah. That's just the name of the webcomic. Okay. Now, now we've, we've cleared

17
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,960
that up. Right. Right. So the comic, your, your comic in general is called sweet beans, but that was,

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,360
was that like an episode of sweet beans? Would you call it? Yeah, you know, I don't know. It's

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,080
like sweet beans. We'll first off, you know, like I, yeah, I'm sorry, you might have to edit out

20
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,080
all my mumbling, but you know, it's just like a webcomic about like these, you know, characters

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,920
and, you know, they, they have feelings and I don't know. It's just like, yeah, I don't, I always

22
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,720
wanted to make a comic about characters and they bump up against each other and I wanted to develop

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,240
these characters. You know, I grew up watching the Simpsons and stuff like that. And, you know,

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,840
before sweet beans, I was doing like, you know, comics are, you know, like, the transphobia is

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,920
bad, you know, like that I started like in 2000. And I know, hey, you know, and like, hey, whoa,

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,800
self deprecating kind of stuff. And, you know, and, you know, I gotta just got sick of that. And,

27
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,560
you know, I just always wanted to make a comic with, you know, just a bunch of fun characters

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,120
with different personalities than, you know, struggling within securities and,

29
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,440
you know, just silly jokes and, and depressing stuff, you know, just like whatever comes to

30
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:12,760
my mind, you know, and have these characters. How long? I was going to ask how long sweet beans

31
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:21,240
has been going for? I started it like in 2019, like at the beginning. So it's not very old,

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,200
actually. You know, I feel like it's still new. I'm still figuring out all the characters. And

33
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,880
that like this past week, like one of the new comics was about characters, like I have that

34
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,840
have only been in the background so far, you know, so I feel like it's still new. I'm still

35
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,520
like figuring it all out. The one about the one about the two are like all hugging and stuff.

36
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:52,440
And the other two are like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, like the Oh, thank you. Yeah. I literally

37
00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:04,440
gave it a like on Twitter. That was how strongly I felt about it. Yeah. Okay. Anything else? Anything

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,360
else I forgot to mention? I mean, I was curious if we're just going to continue the conversation.

39
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,880
I was curious, like the name sweet beans, because like multiple times in the comics that I've been

40
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,520
reading, the characters say sweet beans as a reaction to certain things. Is there like,

41
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,280
is there a connection to real life? Like, is that something you just say all the time and you

42
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,240
decided to integrate that into the comic? Or is this something kind of came naturally? Like,

43
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,240
was it like a did the name come first? And that's just something you say? It was just kind of like

44
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,480
a coincidence? Because I wasn't sure if that was like a through line, because your your comic has

45
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,960
multiple characters. There's there's not like a central protagonist. There's like a couple,

46
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,040
there's characters that reoccur. But it's not always the same like continuous story. There's

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,040
like a little, it seems like from what I was reading, it's like slices of different characters

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,440
lives. But like multiple characters say sweet beans. And I was wondering if that was

49
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,360
relevant more than just like a phrase. And I'm just kind of connecting dots that aren't actually

50
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,720
there or if there's any story behind. Yeah, sweet beans is it came from, you know, like back in the

51
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,880
day, I just, you know, I've worked at slew of retail jobs. And, you know, like this, I worked at

52
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,720
Starbucks. And it was just like this, this phrase that, you know, like, all the co workers came

53
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,720
up with, you know, like, because we had this customer that came in all the time. And he'd be

54
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,280
like, Hey, guys, cool beans. And I'm like, cool beans, this is the stupid stop saying cool beans.

55
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,720
And then, you know, and then we decided sweet beans sounded cooler. And so like, basically,

56
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,800
anytime anyone's instead of saying cool, or yes, or any, it's like, we replaced it all with sweet

57
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,840
beans, sweet beans. And it just stuck around. And like, so like, you know, I don't know, for like

58
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,080
15 years, I've been trying to get people to say sweet beans. And then like one day, you know,

59
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,880
one day, I'm like, Oh, maybe I could just call the my my comic sweet things. How you do it.

60
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,200
Comic that, you know, sneak it in. And, you know, because I feel like it has like kind of like a

61
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,240
peanuts vibe, you know, like, oh, peanuts, those are cute little peanuts in there. And it's like,

62
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,880
it says sweet sweet. I assumed, I assumed that it referred to like pause like toe beans.

63
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,800
You know, you know what I'm saying? Little cats have little beans on there on their little

64
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,200
That's what I thought it meant. I don't know. That's cute. I like that. That's that's yeah,

65
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:28,280
that's what it's from now. Okay. We've successfully rewritten history.

66
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,320
Awesome. So, so yeah, I became I became aware of you. It was I remember it like it was only

67
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,040
yesterday, even though it feels like a lifetime ago, it was at the beginning of this year.

68
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,920
There was a kerfuffle the kerfuffle about the new guy comic didn't didn't

69
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,160
It was I remember it wasn't it. Okay, I might be misremembering, but I'm pretty sure that like

70
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,200
Oni plays like retweeted it and said that like this is like the first meme of the new year

71
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,800
or something like that. Fuck that guy. Yeah, well, because if the shit started on January 1st,

72
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,600
I woke up to it. Yeah. And that's how I knew 2020 was going to be a bad year. It's like I'm like,

73
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,280
no shit. And like it has been, you know, awful for me ever since like besides like, aside from

74
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,640
like the pandemic stuff and everything else that is like anxiety, like on a personal level, like,

75
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:29,640
it has been shit. And but yeah, like it's it's that comic is so stupid. I like I drew it

76
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,480
like in a couple hours, I just like wanted to test out these brushes I had. And like my friends and

77
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,040
I were like, you know, we're kind of complaining about like, how like, you know, it's just so much

78
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,200
bad stuff is going on in the world that people don't have empathy for, right? You know, and like

79
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,960
everyone's like, you know, I just see on the internet, like all these people like pouring it out

80
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,920
like love for this like millionaire douchebag gamer guy, you know, it was because PewDiePie had

81
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,400
gotten robbed, right? That's that's what it was about. Yeah, in reference to like, yeah, I was never

82
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,640
a hundred percent sure. Okay, I thought so. Yeah. So, you know, and like, I was just like, oh, whatever,

83
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,080
you know, I'm just gonna like I drew, you know, I was in a good mood and I drew this like stupid

84
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,080
comic out, you know, and like, you know, and it's it's funny to like, you know, at the time I

85
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,640
belonged to this, like, you know, the, you know, chat group full of cartoonists and they're all like,

86
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,760
yeah, this is great. This is hilarious, you know, and, you know, and so like, you know, and same

87
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,640
thing with, you know, comic artists are well, you know, the same thing with the the the shoplifting

88
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,200
comic like got approval from like all of my friends, you know, this is great. Sure. You know,

89
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,680
and then like, you know, never trust your friends. Right. The public has a totally different

90
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,000
reaction. It's it's always like a blind side because you think like, you know, when you're

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,840
making something, you always kind of want to run a pie people just make sure like there's not like

92
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,840
spelling errors or it doesn't look like crap or whatever. And you get the okay from your friend

93
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,680
group and then you go out into the wider world and it's a totally different reaction like I tried.

94
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,680
I tried to avoid this. I did my best. I ab tested it and it didn't work. The the the meat. So,

95
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,400
so the meme was right this this the like oh first first meme of the new year whatever new decade

96
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,960
whatever was that like the the new guy, the guy who the guy who was like offended on behalf of

97
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,280
PewDiePie is the the night sky he's he's right basically was the joke and like people were like

98
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,000
people were like drawing like redoing it with like like, you know, making him look good and him

99
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,680
you know showing like oh what a sweet guy like oh he's so sweet he's so kind. I

100
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,400
and I was like puzzled because I saw all these redraws and like aren't about that guy before I

101
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,280
found what it was from and I was like who is this person like what is this even in reference to

102
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,920
and then I found it and I read it and I was like what is this about and I was like oh okay PewDiePie

103
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,280
got raw and I was like no no fuck it fuck PewDiePie who gives a shit if some gamer bro gets robbed

104
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,600
like why am I supposed to feel bad why should I feel bad for anything that happens to fucking a

105
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:15,160
multi-billionaire fucking Felix fucking like a you know douchebag idiot youtuber guy kind of

106
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:23,080
a little bit of a Nazi sometimes man like no thanks so I was like when when I had finally puzzled

107
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:30,040
out what was really going on with the whole like the whole meme or joke or or whatever I was like

108
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,040
indignant I was like no fuck this I hate this I hate that this has been the reaction to to

109
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,560
something that is so like yeah and I'm still and I'm still mad about it to this day when I think

110
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,880
about it um you know like honestly like the new guy thing it didn't bother me I I thought it was

111
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,520
funny like all the jokes that people were making some of them were funny yeah you know like you

112
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,600
know and you know and it's like so funny these days like everyone that has a hard time with me

113
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,400
like you know this is just like how it is on twitter it's like they want to they twist you

114
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:09,000
into this like thing that they want to see you as you know like you know and like it was just a

115
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,040
stupid comic that I didn't even care about I was just like you know I was just testing out brushes

116
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,440
I wasn't even thinking you know there's like this one asshole cartoonist I was like breaking down

117
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,400
how I like messed up the design because like you know this was a good guy you know and I was just

118
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:30,680
like oh I saw that yeah oh my god yeah I was I wasn't thinking any of that stuff out because I

119
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,440
literally like it was like you know and not like my sweet beans comics were like I give a shit about

120
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,880
it I it was literally like a doodle comic you know what I mean right yeah it's like that sort of

121
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:49,880
stuff pisses me off so much like the the the like nobody in their right mind would get so bent out

122
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,720
of shape out of like the design of this little slice of like like comedy comic webcomic that

123
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,720
they saw on the internet unless they had some other thing that they were trying to say although

124
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,880
there's some other problem that they had they had secretly that they didn't want to talk about they

125
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,160
said I'll just I'll talk about the art style instead and in order to bash from this person there's

126
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,080
all different ways people do this yeah you know it's it's such a huge problem on the end and like

127
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,360
it sucks how like everyone has just accepted it you know and like it's it's ridiculous and

128
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,200
these like social media platforms they just completely encourage all this behavior you

129
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:36,120
know it's like yeah I mean because I remember when I first read the comic my my initial reaction

130
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,640
like is like in the middle of the drama is like I can't understand where people are coming from I

131
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,000
guess I guess you'd like you know if you're if you're someone who's overly empathetic not even

132
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,600
overly but like you're an empathetic person you probably like you know anybody has something

133
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,000
bad for them you kind of feel bad for it sure like I could understand the perspective of the

134
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,920
comic too of just being like this guy has so much shit we don't need to like go to bat for him you

135
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,560
know and and when I when I saw the comic I was like okay and then I kind of like moved on and then

136
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,120
when like a week later people were still talking about it yeah why why is this such a big why why

137
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,720
is it such a big deal I wonder why I think it's just like it's because it's because Oni retweeted it

138
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,680
right because like you you get someone who has like a big profile to make a statement and then

139
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:25,240
their audience kind of piles on to it I you know what I I would like I would grant Oni that probably

140
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,040
I don't think he meant for it to happen either you think you know like because like it's so easy

141
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,320
for any of us to just make a comment yeah and just think nothing of it and then your audience takes

142
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,680
it and runs with it yeah you know yeah I mean I like Oni I think he's a funny guy but Twitter

143
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,560
makes you the worst version of yourself only Oni seems like kind of a douchebag honestly

144
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,000
that's my impression yeah like uh he like the week before he was messing with me he was messing

145
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,280
with this like other uh transgender cartoonist you know it's uh um it's it's a weird you know it's

146
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:08,360
like you know it's funny how people have a you know I feel like we're just like easy to pick on

147
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,360
you know what I mean yeah did so so so Oni was giving you shit before New Guy there's a there's

148
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,520
a history here then because I didn't know that oh well he wasn't giving me shit specifically

149
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:26,280
there was this other transgender um cartoonist I think what it is it's it's like it's um it's

150
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,520
the the boogeyman that is social justice and and everything that is you know under that umbrella

151
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:39,640
or perceived to be under that umbrella is all in in circles where people don't like

152
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,360
think of the nuance of these topics they just hit you know they watch a video about a person

153
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:51,080
dunking on a stupid comic or you know the the worst possible interpretation of of something

154
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:57,640
that's a little bit strange to them and then they just ascribe that thing to you know way too much

155
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:06,120
stuff so if anything is in any way social just to see or tumblery or trans or you know of that

156
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,720
nature they'll just think of it as a bad thing before even looking at it no absolutely and

157
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,720
then like these like they all think I'm like this like vokes gold you know like super tender queer

158
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,760
you know and that's like that's not not what I am at all you know like I'm very rough around the

159
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,200
edges I I'm trailer trash I you know like I you know like I try to be kind and respectful

160
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,560
to everyone you know and do this you know the nice social justice thing but like you know like

161
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,920
I mean like I yeah I'm definitely not like you know one of these people on Twitter that are like

162
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,920
you know constantly like screaming about you know that you're not you know you're not a school

163
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:56,200
yeah you're not a cop you know I I'm I'm you know I'm you know I'm something of an SJW

164
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:03,080
cut myself but also but also I also am not a cop that's the line with like when you're when you're

165
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,520
telling people when you're telling people what they should and shouldn't be doing that's that's

166
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,360
cop behavior and I don't think that's the line that's usually the stuff that people like the like

167
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:19,720
anti anti SJW youtubers bash on on the people who are saying this is you know like policing

168
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,520
language and and things like oh my free speech is being violated and then they just take that

169
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,840
animosity and they just put it on everything that even slightly resembles you know social

170
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,960
justice in any way or or even things that aren't related but they just think of it like that because

171
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:44,120
like I saw a lot of the new guy stuff you know you see comments underneath these things about like

172
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,320
you know this is what's wrong with America these this generation is fucked up and you know what

173
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,800
they're talking about and it's like yeah nothing to do with any of that it's it's the intellectual

174
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,720
shorthand of taking what you like the smallest possible context of somebody and applying all

175
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,000
the baggage of what you perceive their positions to be you know it's a you're literally straw

176
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,840
manning people you know they look at like that comic and they're like you must be this type of person

177
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:18,600
and so all the faults of that collective is ascribed to you personally and you're held to account

178
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,080
for it all which is ridiculous no I think I think you fucked up and I think you brought it all on

179
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:28,760
yourself because you gave yourself a little angry eyebrows and it made you unsympathetic and that's

180
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:36,200
why that's right that's right new guy was a round soft character that made him seem empathetic

181
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,240
and and the pointy glasses too many points the points implied negative connotations

182
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,720
he looked like heavy weapons guy from TF2 my favorite video game

183
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,640
you know it's it's it's funny so like a year and a half before so maybe two years I got

184
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,960
quote canceled again you know the the you know or base this is like the first time like yeah I got you

185
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,600
know uh fucked up you know I saw like people arguing on Twitter about like uh you know what

186
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,840
labels that LGBT people can and can't use and I just like came out like dude shut the fuck up who

187
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,160
cares what other you know yeah and then like people twisted that into like oh uh you know

188
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,520
you hate lesbians and bisexuals and I'm like oh my god you know but but the thing is it's like

189
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,640
these they ran with it you know like the the uh you know SGW or whatever you know you know

190
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,120
section of Twitter you know like the you know they ran with it and like you know there's like

191
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,800
people to this day I get like messages from that like oh you know you hate lesbians and I'm like oh

192
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,520
my gosh I've been married to lesbian for 10 fucking years what the fuck are you talking about it's

193
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,120
really it's really easy I don't know it's really easy to find something to like I don't know pretend

194
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:03,160
you have a problem with someone about if you uh if you I don't know if you if you've got some if

195
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,720
you I mean why would they do it in the first place I don't know the whole you know the whole like

196
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:15,400
I mean the whole micro label like um or whatever discussion is very fraught emotionally uh it's

197
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,720
it's it's it's people get people get really uh yeah hung up about it this is the thing that's the

198
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,240
problem right now I feel like it's like people are getting so passionate and like passionately

199
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,720
angry about these issues that deserve tons of nuance you know like you know it's a shoplifting

200
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,240
comic for instance you know it's like like there's obviously different sides to this

201
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,320
you know and uh you know and it's like why not like we can't why can't we have a discussion you know

202
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,720
it's it you know it's like this weird black and white thinking that uh that happens I don't know

203
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,800
if it's social media I don't know if it's just like human nature or what there's a lot to dissect

204
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,360
about the about the response to the shoplifting comic which I didn't mention but that was the

205
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,000
second like big time that I saw your stuff getting circulated around and was like oh it's

206
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,400
is that same is that same person oh what's going on now that's and again I saw I saw the reactions

207
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,120
to it and I saw edits of it and I had to like sort of work backwards and like what is this

208
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,440
referring to where did this come from and then again I found it and I was like no fuck that

209
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:30,200
fuck these people fuck uh a stealing is good actually but that's not even what I know that's

210
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,800
no I know that's not necessarily what you're saying in the comic it's just what I personally

211
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,360
think is that stealing is good that's that's all that's me though my views do not reflect those of

212
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,160
anyone else I associate with I'm gonna steal your computer next time oh why don't I doesn't

213
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:51,320
Bernie distribute all 90% of his taxes or whatever yeah okay sorry anyway what were you talking about

214
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,680
oh I guess uh never onto the shoplifting comic right that uh yeah so like

215
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,920
you know like I was I just wanted to like you know this is like something that I did in my youth

216
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,320
a lot right I shoplifted for you know because I grew up in poverty like I said I was trailer trash

217
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:18,200
you know like I just like for me and my friends like shoplifting snickers bars and stuff was

218
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,280
just normal you know because we didn't have money at all you know and like it you know and we lived

219
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:31,400
in trash and so uh you know and and this is another of my friends were like yeah this comic is great

220
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,080
you know I just it was to show this character you know I just like wanted to show this character

221
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,640
like doing this thing and then like later on in the series like slowly show like who this person is

222
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,400
you know and this is like just part of who this character is the comic presents the action like

223
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,440
pretty neutrally it doesn't even really comment or like it's just the thing that she does it yeah

224
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,040
like that's the thing they wanted to turn it into this discourse you know when like the actual text

225
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,880
of the comic was like you know and I could I guess I could you know like it's like I said I'm

226
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,600
I'm not like a professional like you know like like I didn't get to go to school or anything you

227
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,440
know this is just something I love doing you know like you know I didn't go to school to learn how

228
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,880
to like what how I should develop characters and story arts and stuff like that I'm just trying

229
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,840
to have fun and do my thing sure it's it's it's really strange because like that was one of the

230
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,160
things I was wondering when I read that shoplifting comic because I read it and it didn't come off

231
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,520
as that like much of an issue to me again it was one of the things that kind of shrug my shoulders

232
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm like why are people getting so bent out of shape because like I guess the the question

233
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,240
that I was wondering and since reading more of your stuff it's been answered was like is this

234
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,800
like an autobiocomic trying to be prescriptive or is this just a character living their life

235
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,240
and doing things because if it's if it's the latter like there's no problem clearly it's not

236
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,400
it's not the latter like the comic makes no commentary about like yes you viewer should

237
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,760
go and steal I me I've been saying I'm saying that but the comic isn't

238
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,800
uh and and even even if the comic was saying that like who cares like you you can choose to

239
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,920
be like I don't agree with this and just sure move on even even if you thought even if you thought

240
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,160
that's what it was about for whatever reason it's just so strange how people like get so preachy

241
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,720
it's so preachy I guess it's all I don't even think it is I don't think it's cloud chasing like

242
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,600
like dog I don't know see responses to it like on twitter it's like it's like you know

243
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,160
posts or twitter accounts with like five followers are there just be okay I want to I want to unpack

244
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,680
it a little bit like the thing that people seem you know people say like oh those employees

245
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,080
they're gonna lose their jobs now they're gonna they're they're gonna they're gonna they're it's

246
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,880
gonna get taken out of their paycheck but first of all no it's not how jobs work second of all no

247
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,600
you don't nobody gets fired over this shit it's it's simply doesn't happen you're simply being

248
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,360
you're just it's it's so scoldy it's so fucking scoldy and it's such cop behavior why is everybody

249
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,800
so fucking hungry to act like a fucking cop on the internet it's because it's because they're so

250
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:24,360
fucking scared of of the video games being taken away by the scary women yeah I agree like and we'll

251
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,520
wait a second this is the part where I disagree right because like you know the chuds the right

252
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,800
wingers yeah you know like they're gonna do that thing you know that's a she violated the non-aggression

253
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:42,360
principle ah my my uh the no no no and and cap joke whatever I think I go on sorry you know

254
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:49,400
like you know no it is completely fine you know um like the you know the part that hurt me right

255
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:56,840
was like literally my own community right okay it's like group of lgbt cartoonists and allies

256
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:04,920
right yeah like a couple really popular respected folks in the community were like this is irresponsible

257
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,640
you know blah blah blah and that's that's that's when fucking shit hit the fan for me that sucks

258
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,280
so bad I don't care I don't care about right when you're you know like they could hate me all they

259
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:22,280
want like the whatever the chuckles never gonna please them laughs yeah you know I don't I really

260
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:29,720
don't care you know what like broke my heart was like how like it caught fire within my own community

261
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:37,720
and like basically I got canceled you know canceled uh that thing that doesn't exist you know um in uh

262
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,720
like you know and like you know all of a sudden all these people who I thought were like honestly

263
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,760
like friends who I talked to on the regular or at least acquaintances and well-wishers

264
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,200
are all of a sudden talking crap about me like you know just like unfollowing me blocking me

265
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,600
soft blocking me you know and uh you know like almost no like almost no one came out to defend me

266
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,760
it was so heartbreaking was it you know was it because there were I had a different yeah I

267
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:14,760
I was just gonna say I I only saw the chud stuff I didn't really see much of of of like I don't know

268
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,760
uh be heading like like like from it within like why like I don't understand because like

269
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,680
because now there's like oh I don't know like people are people are mad about this and I like

270
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,440
they just want to be like oh no no I don't endorse this no no no don't be mad at me too right that's

271
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:42,040
part of it too you know um I think uh you know uh there's like a lot of you know the stuff is

272
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,000
complicated I guess you know because there's like so many you know people doing different things you

273
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,800
know but I think you know basically uh a couple cool respected people in my community were like

274
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,160
fuck Mallory and like tons of people just like follow it along you know do you want to name do

275
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,040
you want to name names I am definitely not going to name names I'm not gonna bring myself down to

276
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:12,920
their level you know like you know I'm I'm just sort of curious like why would that even happen

277
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:21,560
like what what is so offensive to well I well okay so I've been trying to process this for months

278
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,240
you know because like I said like like you know I don't know if any of you have ever been part of

279
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,040
community and then getting exiled from it and then having like you know like people who I like

280
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,240
talk to on the radio just Tom was uh Tom here was uh lambasted by the Brony community once upon a

281
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,680
time that's true yeah quite a quite a few guys Brony's huh I when I was we were talking on Twitter I

282
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:54,600
told Mallory a little bit about our Brony history and uh you know I wouldn't say I wouldn't say we

283
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,200
were ever like ostracized though we pretty much left of our own accord except maybe Tom I mean on

284
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,680
that level the the the Brony stuff was mostly just shitty commenters who were mad that the baby

285
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,560
wasn't getting their bottle anymore and we weren't going to talk about pony videos uh pony episodes

286
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,680
anymore they were just like yeah you know I want you to do that forever I don't think any like friends

287
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,720
that we had made yeah I mean the thing that happened to me was I was just getting a lot of

288
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,440
shit from people for not being uh positive enough I was just like my whole my I was being paid

289
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,160
the pony show and that's evil that's something that discord would do I was is criticize the

290
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,840
ponies I was being paid $1,500 a month on patreon to talk about this show and so I talked about

291
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,640
this show and they were like you're not sucking it's dick enough and I was like all right well then

292
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,480
maybe I'm just shouldn't be doing this anymore and you guys are kind of dumb and then I lost

293
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:55,480
90 percent of my income in like one week yeah at the height dude 1500 a month completely insane

294
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm drinking I'm drinking a I'm drinking a those are the good days so I mean like that's like

295
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,280
that is like the constant you know people like losing their income because like you know like

296
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:12,360
you have like a opinion about a cartoon show Jesus Christ yeah you know like it's it's it's

297
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,480
it's ridiculous you know well I'll defend the bronies I'll defend the bronies on that one I mean

298
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,040
they signed up to hear you gush about their favorite show to hear you you spread love and

299
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,480
positivity you know much much in the way that pinky pie would uh and then and then you didn't

300
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,280
deliver on your implied promise and so you you failed them I would say yeah I mean that's fair

301
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,840
but I mean like I mean I don't know it's like you like the pony show like why not like

302
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,520
take in other points of view that like might be critical like I it's it's it's ridiculous that's

303
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,200
you know like I I I love it when people tear apart the stuff I love it's funny like but

304
00:29:53,160 --> 00:30:00,360
uh it's it's funny to think it's a funny question uh it's you know the the brony uh the brony

305
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:07,240
criticism the brony analysis youtube scene had a very particular uh culture surrounding it

306
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,600
and uh you know they were really in the market for a particular particular kind of analysis

307
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,800
I think I think the way I had always interpreted it uh just from the very beginning is that I

308
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,120
think so many people were into like the stuff that we were doing talking about the show in a

309
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,240
positive way is because they were looking for affirmations a bunch of dudes who felt who felt

310
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,680
like oh god I like this girly thing this feels so weird and then here's these people saying

311
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:38,600
that it actually has like legit merit so now I feel justified in my deviance and then anytime

312
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,560
you you said something that wasn't super positive it put their own identity the more the more

313
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,360
question the more people there were and like the more of like a professional veneer that they

314
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,000
could give themselves like say echoing the same like the show is good the show is a masterpiece

315
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,920
the show is important the show is valuable you know it's like it's like yeah reinforcing this

316
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,640
this uh yeah the whole the whole thing which people were really invested in uh you know

317
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,800
so yeah people were tying their identity to consumer products and felt insecure about

318
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:19,560
themselves and uh curious like consumer product isn't perfect yeah yeah it's kind of weird

319
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:27,400
it's kind of weird I don't think does perfect even exist um if you ask brownies it's my little

320
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:33,960
pony oh I wanted to make a joke I want to be like ha ha you've never seen uh have you I don't

321
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:43,240
have you seen the sonic the hedgehog 2006 oh that was a good joke thank you thank you very

322
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:53,160
okay I'm sorry um uh but yeah you know so yeah you're we're talking about like basically you

323
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:59,480
still like you know and like I'm not joking like this this shit affected personal relationships

324
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,040
you know like you know and like by the way folks out there listening don't try to be friends with

325
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:11,320
people who care way too much about their like social media like persona or like you know reputation

326
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:17,000
or whatever because they'll just like act like you don't exist anymore you know because like you

327
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,760
know oh no I you know because like associating with this person is iffy now so like like you know

328
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,240
I mean imagine like I don't know nobody nobody got mad nobody gets mad when like uh

329
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,800
ah god I don't know I'm trying to think of like another like comic or something that includes

330
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:43,480
I don't know a bit of mischief this is just some mischief that a character does and that's

331
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,840
I don't yeah and it's like imagine imagine being like this is irresponsible it's irresponsible to

332
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:58,440
depict mischief in Paris an upcoming comic is going to have a lot of mischief in it actually like

333
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:05,720
more more stealing destruction of property round three let's do it based did you see there was a

334
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,160
headline a couple months ago that like some people were had like done a little done some like they'd

335
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:16,760
like messed up a building or something and they were going to be like they there was a possibility

336
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:22,520
of them being sentenced to life in prison for mischief yeah it's yeah yeah it was because

337
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,840
this fucking like company that owned the building was like wanted to like make an example of them

338
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:33,560
or something uh I mean I I hope that it didn't god occur uh but that was property owners am I

339
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:42,440
property owners can't live with them gotta kill them uh okay uh yes you know but um but yeah you

340
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,720
know like it's like with this whole situation I feel like it's so easy to dunk on the right wingers

341
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,400
the chuds you know it's like sure you you know and that's like I'm just so sick of it you know it's

342
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,800
like you know you turn on the youtube and it's like another video of like some leftist like oh wow

343
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:04,920
you debunked Jordan Pearson again no shits wow you know like you know it's like it's not 2013

344
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:11,400
anymore man like things are different now I feel like you know like the left and progress it we need

345
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:18,120
to look at ourselves and see like our failings and try to do better in the future and like part of

346
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,960
the thing that we're doing is tearing each other apart over the smallest fucking little things I

347
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,520
the the left has a problem with like an endless purity test you know yeah you know there's these

348
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,400
people and they roam twitter and other social media and they're like you know like another

349
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,600
thing that happens to me the thing that happened to me last week right you know like uh someone

350
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,800
trotted out a comic that I did seven years ago to like I was just about to bring that up

351
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,680
so basically okay so it's been six months since the shoplifting comic right and I'm like I have no

352
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,840
regrets about making that comic you know I'm proud of myself you know like Cart making comics is

353
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,400
this thing I always wanted to do and I'm growing and I'm getting better and I'm starting to get good

354
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,600
at it you know and I'm proud of myself and like you know um and you know I'm not gonna be you know

355
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm not just gonna carve away and like apologize and do that like fake apology thing that everyone

356
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,960
does you know when like the you know when I'm glad if I if I saw you apologize for it I'd be like

357
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:29,080
that sucks well yeah it's nothing to apologize for yeah well it's like the thing you know well

358
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,720
it's not apologizing you know it's just like I think to like when I was a kid you know like

359
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,760
you know like my my dad had a bad drug problem my parents are screaming at each other you know

360
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,280
we had no money we were barely making it by you know like I was always out of the you know I had to

361
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,280
get out of the house I was raised by wolves you know and like I was a feral kid and like you know

362
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,160
I'm not going to apologize for you know like in just you know because my audience is like you know

363
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:04,120
the age is like 15 to 45 is like you know and I just imagined some 15 year old kid that was in

364
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,120
a similar situation to me you know like you know it's like hey it's okay you know like

365
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:18,760
like you're not a bad person for stealing a Snickers bar or some you know uh some markers

366
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,960
you know and that's like another thing that got me um you know it's like well you know oh you have to

367
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,040
you should only steal things that you need to you know and it's like don't 15 year old poor

368
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:37,080
kids need you know uh art supplies too you know it's like you know and it just brings out how

369
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:43,480
much people in like these the so-called leftists or whatever progressives they you know they don't

370
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,120
like it and that's what I was going to get like these uh get to is that like the folks that gave me

371
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:55,400
a hard time you know it was mostly people from like these uh the queer animation folks right

372
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:03,240
and all of these people you know they grew up middle-class you know like LGBTQ folks in the

373
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:09,560
animation industry you know okay and like and and and like a lot of them you know they grew up middle

374
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,320
class upper class they got to go to college you know they you know they're not they've never really

375
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:22,760
struggled the way that you know I just I just couldn't I just couldn't get into Aladdin because

376
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,480
you know he steals that bread at the beginning and like he doesn't even eat it he gives it he

377
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,920
doesn't even need like it was terrible like like that that fucking that fucking merchant you know

378
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,720
that merchant's probably gonna like go out of business and die uh because of that bread you

379
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,000
know he really should have got his hand chopped off uh I mean he like the guard said like he knows

380
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,080
the penalty for stealing so he should have just accepted it in my humble opinion and that's the

381
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,280
thing too they they twisted it into this like you know I'm anti-worker now you know and it's all

382
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,160
like have you ever you know and it's like funny because like as when I was younger I helped organize

383
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:05,880
a labor union you know and it's like I you know I'm pretty based actually yeah I I'm carcaring I

384
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,000
ww member you know it's like don't tell me I fucking hate workers you fucking rich piece of

385
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:22,840
shit yeah damn yeah fuck that fuck yeah I'm so mad the the the you know this is the thing instead

386
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,200
like like you know like and like I said people who I thought were friends this stuff has cut me up at

387
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,240
night you know uh like the mental toll that it's it's taken on me I've lost sleep you know like

388
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,480
you know like some of my closest friends just gone

389
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,920
just because and it's and it's it's because they just didn't want to be associated with like

390
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,360
well you know that's a thing you know like what I don't want to like this I don't want to assign

391
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,400
too much now this to it you know what I mean but like it's it's just like you know like that's seen

392
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,760
in like the sci-fi or horror movie right where like the dystopian thing is happening and like

393
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,400
the person's getting shunned or like taken away and everyone just puts their head down and lets

394
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,520
it happen even though they all know what's wrong you know it's it's it's you know like

395
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:19,320
you know and you know because like people you know like they're trying to make money too and

396
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,680
they're trying to like you know do their thing you know and oh yeah you know what I mean like so

397
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,960
like even even if they don't think it's fair like I guess they think I think it's like they think

398
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,720
if they defended it they would like be perceived as like they would think it would look bad too

399
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,680
I understand yeah like oh you're now you're supporting this irresponsible mischief you

400
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,200
troublemaker you you you rascal they would say to this hypothetical person

401
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:57,080
I I get it I guess uh hmm yeah you know it like but you know like it burned you know it

402
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,720
chewed me up on inside and the insides and like I even like at one point like you know during one

403
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,600
of my lowest points you know like a couple of the people you know in the community who like I feel

407
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:28,840
feel bad like that shit sucks you know like you know like yeah Jesus Jesus Christ not likes the

408
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,920
comic the and then just like shut there's so much stuff I don't like and I just shut up about it

00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,520
people are being mean to me on the internet and so like and now like you know ours you know the

415
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,520
leftist response is like well that doesn't exist canceling doesn't exist you know okay yeah you

416
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:24,040
know and it's yeah and like I feel like that's like kind of um the thing that like we need to

417
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,680
start doing you know it's like some of the things that right wingers complain about there's like

418
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:35,480
nuggets of validity too that we should sure like honestly answer to you know like you know like uh

419
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,200
the virtue of signaling thing you know it's like how like companies you know like like uh

420
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,880
you know companies try to sell stuff to like lgbt people you know by putting a rainbow on it but

421
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,960
they don't give a fuck about us you know like oh yeah i've always hated that the whole you know

422
00:41:51,960 --> 00:42:00,440
look disney and like capitalizing on of people's um acceptance of of these sorts of things they

423
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,920
don't actually care as soon as it stops being profitable they'll stop making it what did right

424
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,400
letter media call it passive progressive which i thought was a good coin of phrase for it you

425
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,040
know it's such a i don't know i don't know if it comes from like genuine ignorance or if it's

426
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:20,840
like a deliberate bad faith when people say like oh the the left is hypocritical because like

427
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:26,520
companies sell i don't know people like conflate it like they think that that's what the the left

428
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,600
is like that's what progressivism is is like oh it's just companies selling stuff with rainbows

429
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:36,200
on them oh it's just hypocritical and like no they're doing that in spite of what's good

430
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,480
you know yeah you know i'm capitalizing on on on on idea that's not that's not the

431
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:48,280
that's not the thing in itself yeah really you know when we get like overly happy about like

432
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,320
this like corporate intellectual property is like slightly more oh yeah they put the

433
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,560
you know they put the lesbian cop in that in that one in that elf movie or whatever

434
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,760
but even like the stuff that we consume you know like that like a lot of us like you know like

435
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,280
everyone loves shira right you know and everyone's like you know but like

436
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:17,640
you know like i it's it's uh sorry you know um but then like you know but the people who make

437
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:23,640
these things they're like they're they're rich and they're like yeah at the end of the day it's all

438
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,800
owned yeah it's it's you know they're making money off of you you know and like and i think

439
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,880
representation is good i want more representation in the media but like it's this like kind of

440
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,840
let's examine maybe you know like maybe just not blindly celebrate stuff and like you know

441
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,760
like hey are you just trying to like get money out of us get brownie points you know because like

442
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:55,480
there's a lot of you know cynical shit going on and uh it's it's it's uh it's sad i don't like it

443
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,960
representation only only happens in the framework of like when it's when it's uh you

444
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:08,520
know when it's gonna make money yeah that's what that's what you know people that are so concerned

445
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:16,280
about like uh you know uh uh i don't know white erasure or something or whatever i don't know they're

446
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,120
like uh they're like they think that like an agenda is being forced here that like oh this is

447
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,160
this is a conspiracy the illuminati or something is like oh they're all putting oh they're all putting

448
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:33,960
colored people in my in my media and for for various uh i won't speculate on what they think

449
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,560
the goal is there but uh you know it's like it's not true it's never it's never true it literally

450
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:46,680
is only done to to sell shit yeah it's it's the demographics changed and now they can make money

451
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:53,000
off of it and and then they know too that like oh we get this like you know like oh we have a

452
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,520
lesbian making this tv show now and so that we'll get you know and that you know it's it's also

453
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:04,760
girl boss it's fucking bullshit man and don't get me wrong i love that you know lesbians

454
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,280
should make all the tv shows you know what i mean like agreed that's great yeah it's it's like it's

455
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,560
it's a fanciful notion that it could all happen naturally but we know it doesn't and it's annoying

456
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:23,320
yeah it's capitalism man like that's you know it makes you question everything you know because

457
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,120
when when the motive can be so poisoned you can't really trust anybody at their word that they're

458
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,800
doing this for a legitimately positive reason there's always a financial motivation and it's like

459
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:39,720
well then what was the point you know and like i'm that's i'm being a little cynical about it too

460
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:45,560
you know and like that's why i keep stressing i like shira i like all of this stuff too you know

461
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,960
but like i don't know i think it's something about the internet just like creates this like

462
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,880
black and white thinking you're either on this side or that side you know like these like uh you

463
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,000
know there's like these fractions on the left it's split up you know there's like these people who

464
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,120
just like you know they're like fuck identity politics 100 percent and you know and like you

465
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,080
know and then these other you know on the other end that's you know like people getting mad at

466
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:16,280
like you know my comic for you know supposedly hitting trans men when a trans man actually helped

467
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:26,200
me write that comic you know and it's you know um yeah i just uh i wish there was more nuance and

468
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:32,680
people yeah i think but you know most entirely the problem is the platforms that we use to

469
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,960
communicate such as twitter it's mostly twitter i feel like youtube is also a bit bad because

470
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,080
you know comment sections on youtube videos are terrible and nobody ever likes reading them

471
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:49,640
and video responses are usually lengthy and hard to to watch all of and twitter is like

472
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:57,480
the opposite problem there's so much like small bite size takes you can't have a big discussion

473
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,800
in a twitter thread without it being very difficult to read it's like yeah it goes wherever

474
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:11,000
yeah and you know i think it's in a in a forum like discord it's a little better because two

475
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,080
people can have like a lengthy one-on-one and get to the bottom of the disagreement i've seen it happen

476
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,720
i've had a few disagreements and arguments in discord and they've been a lot more fruitful than

477
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:27,080
ones ever had on twitter another good thing about discord is that it's not as public you know when

478
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,000
you're having an argument on twitter there's a pressure that like you're in public and you need

479
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,720
to fucking slam dunk this thing because everyone's watching when you're in discord you have like the

480
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,120
freedom to make mistakes you know because if you're talking one on one with somebody it's just you

481
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,360
and that other person and if you say something that's wrong no one's going to be there to fucking try

482
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,400
and dunk on you or like analyze your conversation it's just the two of you and that's how conversation

483
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,120
generally has worked for like all of human history and it's only now with social media that we have

484
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,440
you have 250 characters to take down this other person because everyone's watching you.

485
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:04,200
Arguing on twitter, arguing on twitter really is a farce it really is just uh you know something

486
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,720
you do for the sake of anyone who's watching yeah it's true it's that's all it is and it's because

487
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:15,400
like you can never you never you never don't feel that like oh this is public like everyone like you

488
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:21,000
know anyone can see this right it changes everything so i i never think about that stuff you know i

489
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,160
can't help but to be really genuine and like messy well i mean come on you know like i think

490
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:34,840
maybe it wasn't you that was saying oh i like how messy you are you know and uh maybe uh yeah then

491
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:40,120
maybe it was someone i don't know someone recently said oh i love like how you know messy you are

492
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,960
you know like i don't like your art or like in your your house no like yeah messy like as in you

493
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,960
know like i'm raw and genuine you know that's so maybe that was not you know i don't think that was

494
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:59,640
me but but you know what i was trying to get at is that you know you know everyone's so worried

495
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:05,240
but i i don't know i think it'd be nice if people would just like just you know would be able to

496
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,480
loosen up a little bit and you know and then give space to others to process feeling lost or like

497
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,920
you know it's it's just moved so fast you know it's like you're either right or wrong you know

498
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:24,120
and good or bad you know and it's it's it's it's garbage it's it's it's not working it's obviously

499
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,800
not working you know there's like nazis on the street now fucking killing people you know i mean

500
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:35,560
it's because it's like social media is all about it's like the business of attention arbitrage

501
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:40,680
everybody who's on there who wants to like make something of themselves you have to gain attention

502
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,440
i know it's a nice word right it feels it feels good to say yeah nice um and so like the the things

503
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,440
that sell are the extremes and so it pushes everybody more and more to the extreme because

504
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,760
that's what gets you more attention and then if you're trying to have any nuance you're shot down

505
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,600
as a centrist or just like you know milk toast or your your lack of like hard line stances on

506
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,280
something means you're empowering the other side because everyone else is ingrained in their own

507
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,520
opinions and it's like left no room for nuance and it's left no room for growth you know people

508
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:19,240
people have just used people have used like people have like uh i think the well is a little poisoned

509
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,760
on nuance because people have like i don't know people will sort of pretend to be trying to have

510
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,960
a nuance take when they're what they're really doing is trying to push an agenda but they're like

511
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,840
they pretend not to be doing that they pretend like oh but you know there's more there's there's

512
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,040
a lot of that is obvious though you know it's like because then you go and see how they're

513
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,080
following it's like Ben Shapiro and stuff you're like okay go go help you know what do you mean

514
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:49,240
yeah you know like i you know i think like you know when you know it's someone like in your own

515
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:58,360
community like like you know enter a conversation with them in good faith you know but that that

516
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:04,440
did not happen whatsoever you know like well i mean like don't get around there's been tons of people

517
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,360
who've been supportive and love me and i just am forever grateful to the folks who stuck around

518
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:16,680
in the face of you know like being judged you know by hanging out with a priah or whatever

519
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:26,360
you know but uh ah gosh i i'm sorry i lost my train of thought so that i got i got i was gonna

520
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:33,080
i was gonna say uh what's uh what's uh i don't know what's everyone up to how's everyone feeling

521
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:41,320
how's your week how's your week been are we all uh i i i can talk about nothing because i've been

522
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:47,480
doing nothing i've been playing war the warcraft a lot based and i've been i've been going through

523
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:53,480
a weird phase where i'm like i'm i'm gaming hardcore or casual or rather you know i'm

524
00:51:53,480 --> 00:52:02,040
gaming hardcore on online on surf in the web um and i'm like usually i would feel terrible and want

525
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,840
to die because i'm supposed to be working i'm supposed to be a hardworking artist making comics

526
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:13,640
making things supposed to be working right now and uh and usually that would lead to by the way

527
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:21,480
yes that would that would usually lead to a depression spiral um but it hasn't i'm just

528
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:28,760
i'm just playing games and i'm really into it and uh that's my week hell yeah it's a it's a really

529
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:35,080
good happy story but there's not much to say i could talk about the world of warcraft lore but

530
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:41,880
i don't know if anyone else has played uh that that game i haven't played enough to understand it

531
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:48,520
unfortunately oh i know i just really like it board rules uh alliance rules i've been yeah oh hell

um oh fuck i was gonna say oh yeah i've been watching i've been watching this youtuber well

568
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,680

571
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:00,600
like even nuzlocke's fan games he just does them over and over and over again uh he you know does

572
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:05,080
imposes all kinds of like extra extra uh challenges on himself when he does it

573
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:11,560
and i'm watching his shit and i'm just like yes um oh i love it it's so i don't know something

574
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:16,360
something about it is very uh it just just makes me want it makes me want it makes me want to do

575
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:22,840
another one but i can't do it but i can't do it because i'm too anxious about all the things that

576
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:31,640
i have not done other than yeah yeah the struggle yeah it's it's a it's a pretzel of like um the

577
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:39,320
anxiety the anxiousness of having all this hanging over your head is more of the obstacle that stops

578
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:45,960
you from doing it and you you've got to try and somehow untangle that in you know do things in

579
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,720
the right order and it's like i can't figure out how to do this in the right order in order to

580
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:56,920
untangle it and you just sit there for months right the analysis paralysis of like what do i do

581
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,880
makes you do nothing and then you just feel worse i've just been doing resin printing

582
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:07,400
i finally got my resin printer all set up and going i posted one on twitter uh that looks so good

583
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,520

608
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:57,560
like by hand or how's how's how's that production begin uh yeah so yeah so this is the thing this uh

609
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:04,440
marketing dude from this toy company called make ship got ahold of me and was like hey we want to

610
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:10,840
make your character into a doll this is what we do and uh basically it works like Kickstarter

611
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,000
they like i guess they go out and find people who they think could uh sell enough of these i

612
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,080
need to sell 400 for it to work what and uh yeah i think i could do it i don't know maybe

613
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,680
we'll see now that's so cool that they came to you i tried to make um i tried to kick start a

614
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:33,080
plush of my character once it didn't work but i just went through Kickstarter i was i found this

615
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:41,000
this this what was it called uh i can't remember i got this thing and i was like

616
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:49,560
yeah and they do mass produce orders uh i'm so angry about it still

617
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:58,760
i i put my money down i was there you should you should um i think we maybe talked about this

618
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:04,920
before but when you do uh the uh you should make you should make it a stretch goal for uh the next

619
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,840
thing that you're going to bell jay book yeah yeah the bell jay book

620
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:16,360
because i think that's because i think yes yeah because i think the um the issue was like you

621
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:21,320
know it's kind of an expensive item uh you know kind of a high barrier to entry whereas i think

622
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,160
if the if the book was like you know maybe 20 bucks or something i think there would be a

623
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:33,080
lot of people who would go for that uh uh and uh you know i think more people would be interested

624
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,920
in making you know you know there's a there's a certain crowd you know people got a budget

625
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:42,520
for this kind of stuff uh yeah so i don't know piggyback it piggyback it off of another thing

626
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:50,200
perhaps uh i would like i would like a pump a pump plush uh be pretty pretty pretty epic

627
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:56,680
haha uh oh yeah oh yeah and you put the you put the you put my pins on it on it's on it or on

628
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:02,200
on shawl right or no on your brisker yeah my brisker plush that i they got from the same company

629
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,960
yes right it's it's cool anyway the ivy plush how's that how's that going uh i guess well right

630
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,400
now they're just designing it and then i have to approve it and then i guess the camp the pan can't

631
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,120
then the campaign is going to start in the next couple weeks oh shit soon that's so cool have you

632
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,440

633
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:33,880

634
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:40,680
ironic hmm oh i know yes it's the that is that it's completely on the same level it's dealing

635
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:48,440
from a multimillion dollar corporation yeah yeah get owned okay well that's pretty uh yeah i'm pretty

636
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:54,200
excited about it um right now i have a comic promoting it on my patreon like once it gets closer

637
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:02,200
to the actual campaign i'll share on the other social medias um based based yeah i hope it works

638
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:09,640
out because i definitely couldn't handle another public humiliation at this point i think who among

639
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:14,680
us could uh do you have can you show us well they haven't designed it yet so you don't know

640
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:21,000
what it looks like yet right yeah but um i don't know if you go to my uh patreon there's a comic about

641
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:29,080
it uh uh you know there's a public for all god no no okay okay you gotta pay the dollar baby

642
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:37,640
shut down uh wait what's your what's your patreon uh is it plug sweet things patreon.com slash uh let's

644
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:00,760
see that's because i don't make promises i can't make you know basically my patreon deal is is like

645
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:05,560
you know people who sign up could see the comics before i put them on social media and that's it

646
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:13,080
you know and then that's the deal you know that yeah because uh because like i you know i got the

647
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:20,280
ad hd i got the depression uh you know sometimes i could go a little bit without doing anything and

648
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:27,720
i don't want to make promises i can't make or can't keep yeah i would be um yeah my my patreon

649
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:34,040
is also it's like tom does like rewards and stuff and i'm like that sounds hard it's yeah a lot of work

650
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:40,760
you know and like that's it you know with my comic i'm just like i make all these comics for me

651
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:46,600
i'm not like i don't think about audience and stuff like that which obviously keeps backfiring on me

652
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,960
you know um sure but i don't care because it's like you know it's like i'm just doing this for me

653
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:58,520
and i'm just very blessed and lucky that a lot of people enjoy it so you know it's like i pay my rent

654
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:05,240
doing you know uh anthropomorphic comics you know that's pretty cool that is the dream

655
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:14,040
have you read tales gets trolled uh no but i i know the drawings okay okay good it's a good

656
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:21,080
it's a good comic i reckon i recommend it highly um how does that stuff work with all the copyright

657
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:26,920
stuff you know i just you know like uh one of my favorite artists right now they they do all this

658
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:32,040
Burton Ernie uh fan art and they're doing a comic of Burton Ernie and they're gay together and stuff

659
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:37,480
like that like oh i've seen some of those that's really cute yeah isn't that great i love that

660
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:45,880
i think i think that's probably uh yeah i think if they're like making money through patreon i think

661
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:52,120
it would probably not be a problem i know that the the the mario that that like mario animator guy

662
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:58,440
got his patreon shut down by nintendo let's see mario bro depends on on who owns the coffee right

663
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:04,440
and whether they're willing to go out and you know hunt down people using the the likenesses of

664
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:10,520
characters just to put like a lot of the time you can just get away i love but mario no no no no

665
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:19,400
i love nintendo games like they're my favorite but god they're such fucking ass they are yeah yeah

666
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:26,600
yeah they're very litigious you know it's like they can they they can lose money every single year

667
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:31,880
for like 300 years and still like be a decent business like what are they doing with this

668
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:36,840
shit like why what is the point of it you know they're the i think they're the richest company in

669
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:43,080
japan as of like this year i believe so yeah the switches don't really well they're shareholders to

670
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:51,800
please some some people with i gotta wear suits are they need money i think and that's why

671
01:07:54,600 --> 01:08:01,000
they say please more money and they nintendo says yes they get it yes so you know what no but but

672
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,240
what the i don't you know see this is the thing we're just like rich people in general i think

673
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:11,720
in companies and stuff it's they don't want more they specifically want other people to have less

674
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,760
you know like because they have enough all these rich people have enough nintendo has enough

675
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:23,960
they specifically want you know these people making their fun little games their their tribute games

676
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:31,800
and you know comics or whatever they want them to have less it's really disgusting i think i

677
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:37,720
think rich people treat money like normal people treat social media followers it's about it's

678
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:41,880
just about score it's about keeping score i need a higher score because once you have that much money

679
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,840
it's no longer a resource like your bases are covered you're never going to have to worry about

680
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:51,080
money and like spending it to acquire things to live so that point you're just keeping score who

681
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,000
could be the richest person i want to be i want to have the most subscribers i want to have the most

682
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,080
money and so it's it's about squeezing as much out of the people so you can be higher on that

683
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:06,600
like tier list of of rich people it's just like that's why jeff basos has a bajillion dollars

684
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,120
he's just like ego tripping hardcore do you know it's really funny about that too it's like just

685
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:17,320
like rich people like you know folks with like lots of followers say like want to pretend like that

686
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:24,040
isn't any kind of currency whatsoever you know like it doesn't exist like uh you know like people

687
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:29,400
like they like turn their nose up at the term of social capital when like you know the only reason

688
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:35,960
why my stuff gets seen is because i got 22 000 followers and like you know like a couple's even

689
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:41,320
more famous people follow me you know that's like it gives you legitimacy and then it just helps you

690
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:48,680
even further you know uh it's social capital is translated like directly into actual capital

691
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:54,120
all the time it's like how it works yeah but you know you'd like go into some of these like

692
01:09:54,120 --> 01:10:00,680
progressive or leftist spaces and they'll crucify you for saying that you know is it like i mean do

693
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:08,120
people i don't know i i think it's if you've got if you've got clout if you've got the followers

694
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:14,600
it's probably pretty tempting or pretty uh you know to say like to want to pretend that like

695
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:22,920
that's not a thing if you've got it uh uh but like you know i mean who who among us you know

696
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,920
when you interact when you have like a twitter interaction with like someone with way more

697
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:32,440
followers than you or something and then suddenly like you're you're flooded with uh you know

698
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:39,240
with notifications like way more than usual you know like it's obvious it's obvious that

699
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:44,840
like a phenomenon is occurring here that you have we have we have we have butted up against a

700
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:53,240
a sort of a power differential here that is causing uh some effects you know it's very it's yeah

701
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:58,520
and do you know it's funny i think we just got to the crux of a lot of the issues that we've

702
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:06,120
been talking about today you know it's a bunch of weird power dynamics you know that happen

703
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:15,480
yeah oh yeah like like uh i don't want to like assume too much but like i i know people would

704
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:22,680
like just turn on each other when like uh you know their friend is like oh now they're famous now

705
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,360
they go to all this cloud well now i hate them and i want them to die and i want them i want to

706
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:32,280
cancel them to see how they like having nothing just like me people get really emotional about

707
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:39,320
things like that oh absolutely they do you know it's like i even even have friends right you know

708
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:43,960
like uh recently like i'm like hey you know i told one of my you know comic friends and like

709
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,880
i got this plushy thing going on and like the first thing they said was like well why didn't

710
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,480
they come to me for the plushy i'm like what the heck why can't you just be happy for me man

711
01:11:52,280 --> 01:12:00,200
yeah it's i mean i understand the temptation to succumb to the sour grapes it's it's okay to have

712
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:05,800
sour grapes you just don't lead with it you you say you know sour grapes are a natural phenomenon

713
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,960
but you can't let that you acknowledge your sour grapes you can't lead the the charge with a sour

714
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:16,120
grape it's a bad look yeah it's not very nice acknowledge them and move past them

715
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:22,760
um no one likes talking about sour grapes or envy or jealousy it's like this such a taboo

716
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:29,640
subject that like everyone's like oh no i don't feel those feelings ever you know um and i feel

717
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:35,320
like uh especially on social media especially with like people who are trying to like do something

718
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:41,000
and have an audience you know i feel like that stuff is a lot more common than it's it's obvious

719
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:47,240
the numbers yeah everybody you obviously are there you want the numbers to be higher because

720
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:53,480
that like makes it more effective at whatever it is you do it yeah like who who does what people

721
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,720
are embarrassed to have emotions people are embarrassed to admit that they get angry at

722
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:04,360
things and it's it's not good they got it it's all part of humanity and living and being a person

723
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:12,040
if you if you hide behind like oh oh no no i'm i'm like like a robot that makes me cooler than

724
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:20,040
you actually it's just it's just lies be true be real it's it's weird you know and and that

725
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:27,720
that's why i don't trust anyone with like over 50 000 you know followers on twitter it's like

726
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:32,280
you know it's like wow you're you're pleasing that many people at once you know you're just

727
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:39,160
good at keeping the mask on right you know like giving everyone what they want yeah i mean as your

728
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:45,400
audience gets bigger it gets more difficult you know it's more difficult to kind of juggle all those

729
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:50,920
competing interests from people who follow you and like i on the one hand it's like we'll just be

730
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:55,880
yourself like resist that temptation but like when your livelihoods tied up in that it becomes a much

731
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:04,520
more complicated equation yeah it's true it's true you just gotta be i i i try to be very genuine

732
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:08,920
yeah that's a cool thing i mean as your as you when your audience is big enough when your when

733
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,240
your platform is big enough i assumed i assume there comes a point where it all just becomes

734
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:19,400
noise and you just like can't listen to any of it and you just kind of probably have to just

735
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:24,600
just zone it out and like not even worry about like what anyone's like saying uh because if you

736
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:28,840
list because there'd be so much i don't know imagine you have like a hundred thousand followers

737
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:34,040
and every time you tweet you get like hundreds of replies i mean you might you might read some

738
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,200
and get like a sort of like feeling about like the general kind of thing people are saying and

739
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:45,400
like what people think about what you're doing but uh you know you would sort of just that's all you

740
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,680
would could really get is like a feeling like there's too much yeah you you would need too much to

741
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:54,120
really need managers you would need like um people vetting like reading and being like hey have you

742
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:58,760
heard that people are saying this like because you personally couldn't keep track of everything you'd

743
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:06,840
need you would need other people to to sift through it if there was a reason to do so yeah and i think

744
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:12,600
that's really tough because like from a user perspective like like the reason like people

745
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:18,440
who aren't creators who don't have a huge audience like social media so much is because it gives you

746
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:22,520
a communication line to people you care about right like we all have people who are interested

747
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:27,480
in our work and they can talk to us on a level that normally you wouldn't have access to with like

748
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:33,560
a celebrity and like traditional uh media um yeah and so there's like that personal feeling

749
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:38,920
and then once you get big enough that feeling dissolves on your side because it's just there's

750
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:44,280
just so much you like literally just as a human being can't process all that information but all

751
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:49,560
those a hundred thousand people still feel like they have a connection with you and it's incredibly

752
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,400
difficult and then it gets back to the thing that you're saying earlier like you know as soon

753
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:58,120
as something gets popular people look will fuck that stuff exactly it comes cool to hate because

754
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:02,760
then like there are a bunch of people but hurt that you made it well you know and and that's

755
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,640
completely understandable too you know because like you know it's like i i love comics and

756
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,920
cartoons right and like every single day i just see such incredible work from people that have like

757
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,720
a thousand followers two thousand followers you know it's like what do i do that's so special

758
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:23,000
you know i got 22 000 people on twitter following me 20 000 people on facebook

759
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,960
you know like i i don't you know like i just feel like there's so many more

760
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:33,960
cartoonists that are doing you know better work i've seen i've seen really great art from people

761
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:40,360
with a lot less of a following than me and i'm like huh makes makes you think makes you think

762
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:47,080
that maybe the meritocracy is a lie it is a complete lie you know it's uh i'm just i'm just

763
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:52,280
i just can't shut up i'm an attention whore you know i'm just lonely and so i go to twitter because

764
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:57,480
i'm alone and it's this like false sense of community and i'm like and i just say my random

765
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,120
thoughts and people are like hey yeah that's right you know i hate to admit that i also do that

766
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,920
but it's it's so obvious that's what it's for it is i guess that is what it's for i mean

767
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:13,640
studies show that uh folks that uh feel more lonely are more likely to post more

768
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,600
on social media so like when you see you know one of your favorite you know someone posting

769
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,840
over and over again you know like yeah give them a comment or even rich i'll be like hey how you

770
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:34,120
doing today you know um i feel i feel called out i feel seen in a bad way any of folks that

771
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:43,080
listen to the the guy the musician jeff rosenstock i don't no i don't know anything

772
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:53,000
about uh he's like this uh you know kind of punky musician he uh he got to start doing like scott music

773
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:02,360
in the early 2000s and then um uh went solo but uh you know uh he's getting he actually oh he does

774
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:11,240
all the music for craig of the creek uh yeah yeah he's uh um if you like punky type of music i highly

775
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:18,600
suggest it um but like basically all of his watches cartoons i do watch cartoons i like them a lot

776
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:27,640
yeah curtains are fun i love all ages cartoons um but yeah like anyway one of the lyrics that stands

777
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:33,080
out to me is you know he says rushes to his phone because he doesn't want to feel alone you know um

778
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:37,400
you know that's like exactly what i do too you know it's like i'm sitting all alone and i'm like oh

779
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:43,560
maybe twitter i won't feel so lonely you know but i mean it's even you know but that's a lie too

780
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:49,240
because twitter is bullshit you know yeah it's i've like purposely put my phone away for a while

781
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:54,360
and i've gone like a couple days without any social media and there is like a kind of zen that returns

782
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:59,640
that i haven't felt since i was like 12 before phones existed i'm like ah there were times you

783
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:04,680
could just literally be alone because like it's a totally different feeling having your phone on you

784
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:09,000
than not because like you feel like especially when you're someone like me who's like a fucking

785
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,480
shut and neat and like all your friends are through online so it feels like everybody is

786
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:19,160
with you and nobody's with you at the same time all the time so to actually be alone and to cut

787
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:25,080
that part off and have no computer and no phone around you just like oh i'm like alive again

788
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:29,720
almost yeah it's like a different way of thinking that was i think it's been months since i've gone

789
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:37,560
a day without checking twitter um you should do what i do i i have uh app block on my phone and i

790
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:43,640
have said it that i am allowed to use twitter for 60 seconds every day and then it gets blocked for

791
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:48,760
the entire day so i always like every time i wake up i'm like 60 yeah i go to twitter i'm like okay

792
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:54,760
what's on twitter and then oh oh that's right i'm blocking it and then i forget about it and it's

793
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:59,720
great i get to do that little uh i'm waking up and i need to check twitter like i do every day

794
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:07,800
but then it immediately goes away it's it's it's actually quite cool that is awesome because i i

795
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,680
struggle with addiction in general you know like i was saying earlier you know the addiction runs in

796
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:20,680
my family it's you know it was really bad growing up but yeah like uh you know so i read books on

797
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:26,360
how to deal with addiction and uh one of the things they say is that like you know the difference

798
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:32,920
between a habit and an addiction is this feeling of um of despair like of hopelessness right and

799
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,960
you know you feel that hopelessness and then you could get control you know by turning to your

800
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:43,480
addiction you know and you know i couldn't you know i completely feel you know it's like i feel

801
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:49,240
utterly alone in the universe i'll go on twitter where people are you know and i was like i i you

802
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:54,280
know i haven't gone a day without twitter and i can't remember the last time you know yeah it's uh

803
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:02,200
it's ridiculous yeah i mean every time i go on twitter like i kind of i took a break from twitter

804
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:08,040
i think last month or the month before for a week and then i came back and i've just noticed

805
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:13,320
almost every time i go on twitter i feel worse than i did before because there's always something

806
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:19,800
that's on my timeline that like is annoying or insulting or unfortunate or like i'm just i

807
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,640
just find myself doom scrolling because it's 2020 and that's all the timeline is i'm just like

808
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,440
like i need this because this is my primary platform where i interact with like my audience

809
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:35,640
but at the same time it's a net negative on my mental state always it's like why do i do this

810
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:42,760
see you know and for me it's like uh it's it's kind of a mix right you know kind of like i like uh

811
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:48,120
i use the cannabis too right you know and like a little bit of weed right will help me and make

812
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:52,760
me feel good and like you know just a little bit and then i'll get more productive i'll come up with

813
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:57,880
ideas and stuff but then like i get sucked in and then i start doing i smoke too much weed well i

814
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:03,000
don't smoke it i eat it usually but um and then it stops working well for me you know and then

815
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,680
it's just like it doesn't feel good anymore you know i feel like twitter's the same way for me

816
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:15,240
like a little bit you know like i get that interaction you know i have some funny conversations

817
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:21,080
i actually connect to people i have kind of the same thing i kind of do the same thing with booze

818
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:26,680
i'll take if i have like a shot or something or half a shot sometimes it makes me a little more like

819
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:33,080
a little more willing to like sit down and like you know like draw something whereas like otherwise

820
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:36,280
i might like overthink it and be like no i don't want to i don't want to do that i don't want to

821
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:40,840
draw that no i'm i'm nervous it'll be bad or like oh what if i what if i fuck it up and it's a waste

822
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:46,280
of time uh and then i get drunk and then i just pass out and then i hung over the next day it is

823
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:53,400
an unfortunate pet and it's a disaster yeah yeah like like was that you who said you were hung over

824
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:59,800
today yes yeah i feel better now that's good yes thank you

825
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:09,480
uh where were we what's going on where am i i don't know i'm sorry i brought up addiction

826
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,240
i don't know i brought up addiction oh sure and feeling alone and all this i don't know i

827
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:17,720
like talking about stuff that's like hard for people to talk about so i make the room silent

828
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:22,120
a lot of times no it's it's real shit i mean we don't we don't rule talked about it before

829
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:28,680
yeah we're no we're no strangers to interesting depth conversations like that it's not

830
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:34,440
doesn't have to be all fluff so i mean i deal with it all the time it's like that depression

831
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:39,800
and just the feeling of just like inadequacy and like comparing yourself and like it's that's like

832
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:46,760
really the thing with social media right is it's it's uh social media and patreon have like put a

833
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:54,120
number to your success in a very clear manner and so it's very easy to compare yourself to others

834
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:59,720
right like i can look at anybody that i like and you can just break it down to numbers like they are

835
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:05,640
ex followers better than me they are ex patrons better than me uh you know their ex engagement

836
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:11,480
better than me and they shove all that in our face too it's like when you write on that's the first

837
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:17,080
thing you see you know and then people pretend and then people pretend no that stuff doesn't matter

838
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:21,880
it doesn't just some people i'm sure it doesn't i mean some people if you have like a lot of

839
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,400
shit going on in the real world and you have like a career and blah blah blah i'm sure like

840
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,080
twitter doesn't faze you because like you're busy like going into the office and getting

841
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:34,040
shit done and being like a real cog in the machine i don't know what that's like i'm sure it's grand

842
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:38,360
quote unquote but like if you're in it if you're trying to like be successful and you're trying

843
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,520
to be an artist like the way to be an artist or creative person now is to go on social media

844
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:47,400
and whore yourself out for views and clicks and it's just like that's a metric that's like your

845
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:52,360
guidepost for how well you're doing and it's like the people say don't compare yourself to others

846
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:56,040
but i'm always feeling at the same time i don't know how i'm doing the only way to measure if i'm

847
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:01,080
like doing well and to course correct is to look at that information and compartmentalize it and

848
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:05,400
like analyze it and try and like course correct when things are bad and things like that and it's

849
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:13,960
just like it makes something that started out as just pure passion very monotonous and mechanical

850
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:18,840
and it almost doesn't feel worth it at that point and then you want to reject that and just like

851
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:23,080
fuck it i'm gonna just do what i want to do but then it's like oh now i have no money and now i'm

852
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:35,160
dying so it's just like uh gross yikes yikes yikes you gotta give the people what they want and

853
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:43,000
high doses yeah seriously it's like quality and quantity on point 24 7 every day it's never be

854
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,160
wrong don't you have to be correct yeah constantly if you disappear for a week the algorithm forgets

855
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:56,440
about you and then you got to start all over again i i like being nobody i like being somebody who's

856
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:01,400
just sort of like pretty cool like niche like but not even like a large niche just sort of like

857
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:08,280
like you know one of these days i'll start my career but not yet and i i guess i have i literally

858
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:12,760
just want a cult following and like a literal cult i just want to have like 10 people who give me

859
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:20,280
$10,000 that's fine that's fine with that i guess i i guess that i i like some aspects of being

860
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:25,720
niche but uh mostly i just hate being a small fish in a big pond and i just want to get big and crush

861
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:32,440
my enemies you mean physically i just want to be more i want to well sure yeah obviously um i just

862
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:39,240
want to be i just want to like wield power and destroy those who oppose me that's that's just

863
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:44,760
that's why that's why i get into this whole internet creator game nice good good for you hope

864
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:54,040
of you you've reached your dreams i just it's you know i feel i don't know man i feel i see

865
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:58,440
i follow all these people on twitter who like you know i like the stuff they say i like the

866
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:02,840
stuff they post and i'm like oh these guys are cool i like these guys oh some of them are like

867
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:06,040
friends with each other they they taught they tweeted each other like oh that's cool that's

868
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:11,320
funny to see and then i'm like oh i am like nothing to these people i am like an i'm an ant

869
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:19,560
i'm like a one i'm like a two percent of like their power level on the internet uh and it's it's

870
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:26,440
something very demoralizing huh what you mean something to me yeah well how many followers

871
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:36,760
you got um nothing i've i've got good followers they they count you know you know you know when

872
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,960
when i get in that comparing mindset it's very it hurts it makes me feel bad and just makes me want

873
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:48,840
like i must i must accrue power i must accrue social capital you know well just just compare

874
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:56,920
yourself to your past self instead of other people think think of t-bap been yeah but my past

875
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:03,000
self made 90 like 10 times oh no don't think of that t-bap and the fucking base oh yeah that's it

876
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:11,960
so uh you know i speak comparing myself to i was i was i uh you know for some reason because i

877
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:17,640
was in a nuzlocking mood yesterday i went and i watched a little bit i watched the finale of uh

878
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:22,600
nuzlock uh genocide again and i i think i mentioned this on a stream recently but like

879
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:28,520
i can't believe how how different i sounded my voice is like markedly different in like that

880
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:35,880
era i'm like bad at like maintaining the breath control i'm like there's parts where i'm like

881
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:42,040
almost like gasping and like my voice sounds so like it sounds deeper but also like more

882
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,840
it's it's weird it's it's strange to hear like such a clear difference it's only like

883
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:53,080
i don't know exactly when it stopped but there's like a pre that and a post that that like era

884
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:59,160
in in like my stuff and i don't know exactly when the transition happened uh it's it's really

885
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:03,640
working on a podcast you probably end up you know just learning the way that you're supposed to

886
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:08,280
talk like you know halfway through these podcasts i got super i'm like insecure i'm like oh my god i

887
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:14,920
sound like an idiot i'm yelling i'm like seeing you know i i come off as trashy probably i don't

888
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:19,160
know that's like what i was you know thinking halfway through this thing i'm like it probably

889
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:27,400
do it i i blew it i fucking blew it um did she blow it guys no no did you blow it okay all right

890
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:33,960
commenters let us know if she blew it you know i got all passionate about like people being mean

891
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,960
to me and i'm like

892
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:46,040
we have plenty of mean people in the comments uh so you know actually our our commenters well

893
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:49,800
i mean they're not you know they're not great but they're i think they're okay you know i think

894
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:56,440
they're maybe a little above yeah they're below par they need to step up their game okay okay commenters

895
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:02,600
flex how cool you are in the comments you have to flex your brain you have to do more controversial

896
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:08,760
stuff you have to get controversial guests on and they have to say like extreme things and you

897
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:14,440
have to have we have to get alex jones sort of get out it goes straight to alex jones the most

898
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:22,360
extreme possible we could do it are any of you folks are any of you folks old enough to remember

899
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:28,520
when that guy was just like about aliens and like very mild conspiracies like before he was like

900
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:32,600
i might be old enough but i used to watch all of his documentaries on youtube and i

901
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:37,960
thought they were hilarious like the one where he's like i've infiltrated bohemian grove and

902
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:43,960
like all this crazy shit oh man i was i was into alex jones before he was cool i i love that crap

903
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:50,680
as a kid you know because i was like man fuck these rich people you know like you know it's like

904
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:57,960
you know they do weird ceremonies and stuff like they're controlling the world eating babies

905
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:04,280
demon spawn yeah i never really uh looked at build a bird group and the trilateral commission

906
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:09,400
are controlling everything i've only ever seen clips of him just problem but that's enough and

907
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:16,600
he's very funny from what i've seen crazy man he's a treat he's a joy we we should have and then he

908
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:23,960
turned into like yeah get him on buy my pills oh but then yeah but then he got into the right wing

909
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:31,320
grift so he know yeah that's where the money is i guess because i know is there any left wing

910
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:39,160
grifters is that i'm sure there's some bends are left for ingrifter bends uh doing something with

911
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:43,880
his mic i guess ben's mic is muted so i could say that and i know you wouldn't say anything back

912
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:50,360
i'm back uh i am a big big time grifter uh i just want and i want to be bigger i just want to be

913
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:57,960
the biggest grifter i can be um uh you know man there's a are there left wing grifters either

914
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:03,000
there probably are kind of depends kind of depends on how you define grifter i feel like people throw

915
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:08,280
that word around a lot i feel like there's some people on who are like formerly in like the

916
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:13,160
skeptic community who are now left leaning and some people say that's a grift and not like a legitimate

917
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:18,440
change of opinion yeah i don't know like i don't know if you wanted to do it for money i mean there's

918
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:27,000
way more money in in the right wing like i mean is maybe not for everyone yeah yeah like um tim

919
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:34,120
tim pool has become the fucking goblin that he is now because like of info wars money oh as uh as

920
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:41,000
he's associated with info wars now tim pool not he i was asking i asked someone about this in my

921
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:49,080
discord and i guess uh uh info wars like funded him to do something i don't know i was asking like

922
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:53,960
why did he i was asking like was he always like this and i guess the answer is no and there was

923
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:59,800
like he he did he did some shit for info wars for a while holy shit yeah i didn't i didn't know that

924
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:05,560
i i don't know much about it even now because i can't give you any details like as in peace

925
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:12,920
he's so big and he's so bad he's so i think he might be my most hated person in the entire world

926
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:18,280
i know that probably in the grants i i'm not i'm not joking i know that in the grand scheme of

927
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,520
things there's probably worse people and people who are worse for the world but in terms of just

928
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:27,880
like how much i viscerally hate them i think he might be it he's he's really he's really

929
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:34,920
climbing the ranks every single time apparently apparently vosh is going to his studio to debate

930
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:40,600
in real life and i'm excited it's going to be a fun time did you see that whole the whole thing

931
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:46,360
about how he kept he kept like he refused to like uh leftist won't debate me and then like all these

932
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:53,080
people would but he's like no i won't do it on a call i haven't i haven't you only you can only do

933
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:57,480
content in like three years well people were retweeting it because he kept like saying like

934
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:01,960
no no debate me no no debate me but he's like he won't do it over he won't do it remotely he you

935
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:07,720
have to like travel across the country to come and do it in studio and it's like why yeah why would

936
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:13,960
you do this if you heard about they catch covid and die on the way so we can win by default i don't

937
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:18,200
know i did hear that vosh was going to do that it's funny she just wanted to make it as unlikely

938
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:22,760
as possible that a leftist would actually try to debate him and so that he continued to say

939
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:27,320
that leftists won't debate me all these commies don't have any money that's why they're commies so

940
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:33,800
they came in afford to come here he's not he's not a smart individual and i don't think he can defend

941
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:40,600
himself against i mean i i think i used to watch tim pool like back in like 2017 or something and

942
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:46,600
he was still a pretty small channel and he definitely was not the same kind of duty as now like like

943
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:52,280
him and sargon have shifted so far right in the last couple years where like they were they were like

944
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:57,320
misguided but palatable to a degree when you're like a fucking

945
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:02,280
a centrist right kind of person like i am but like i listen to their content now they're not

946
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:08,600
even the same person wait oh my god tom you're you're a centrist right person i mean centrist left

947
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:14,840
my bed that's the that's the opposite yeah yeah i said the wrong thing i'm i'm definitely more

948
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,760
the left guy i'm like a sock kind of dude everyone should everyone should just become

949
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:22,200
communists malibu is like literally ready to kill me it's like oh we're gonna go to

950
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:28,040
i was gonna be like oh my gosh i can't believe you know because like i don't i feel like you're

951
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:33,640
really cool i grew up conservative christian so i guess at one point i was centrist right

952
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:39,640
i have a friend i have a friend who who calls him he's if you ask him he'll like call himself

953
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:45,880
kind of like right leaning but like the thing about him is that i don't know i think is that he

954
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:51,160
he strikes me as like genuinely apolitical and i think what he means when he says that is just

955
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:55,640
that he's like trad he just you know wants like you know white picket fence wife two and a half

956
01:35:55,640 --> 01:36:01,000
kids and a dog or whatever like whenever like politics comes up he doesn't like he doesn't

957
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,880
say the things that you that i would associate with someone who calls himself that he's like

958
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:12,360
i don't know he talks about like uh you know how like oh like uh uh uh yeah vietnam had like a really

959
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:16,520
effective like a public housing uh you know infrastructure or something like i don't he's

960
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:24,040
interested in that kind of stuff so i don't know it's it's uh i think i don't know or i don't know

961
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:29,160
who's vietnam he he's an architecture student and he was talking about how like you know like some

962
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:34,280
some like southeast asian countries like compared in terms of like how they had like you know solved

963
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:40,520
the housing crisis with like public options and whatever uh i don't know the point is like he i don't

964
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:45,240
know i think it's interesting but like yeah he he will say that he's right leading but i don't think

965
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:52,040
i don't even think he is and that's why he's still my friend lemau see this is the thing i i'm beginning

966
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:58,360
to notice that like people like they love leftist policies like when they're in action you know

967
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:03,400
but they hate they hate our guts they you know and it's because it's obvious for fucking you

968
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:07,480
know like the left is just filled with like smug we're better than you assholes you know

969
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:15,640
and uh you know i think that turns off a lot of people you know like yeah um i mean people people

970
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:20,120
people think libs people think libs are the left and it's very frustrating it's a very you see all

971
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:24,680
over the place and again i said this before i'm not sure if they don't understand or if they're

972
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:29,160
like deliberate if deliberately misrepresentation i think it's definitely a little i would imagine

973
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:36,360
they don't understand because i didn't understand until a few years ago or maybe maybe even just one

974
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:41,240
or two years ago language like i didn't understand the left because the only things i had seen

975
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:48,600
were videos by um people dunking on feminists and i thought yeah this feminism stuff is silly

976
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:54,280
that it's it's it's worse in in uh countries in the other places in the world not in the western

977
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:59,320
world and like you know i've just bought into that because i didn't see the alternative side

978
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:05,000
once i had i was like oh well there's there's there's there's more to it than i thought

979
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,040
we'll see the uh do you see the debate the last debate i have never seen such a thing ever

980
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:15,160
never will i i i actually i actually did watch this one i thought it would be funny it wasn't

981
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:21,400
that funny uh but there was the part where it's depressing yeah i kind of like the part where

982
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:27,400
trump said that the kamala harris was like more he said more liberal than bernie sanders it's like

983
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:34,600
okay uh he's like uh i mean i get that is that is true technically more yeah you're not the way he

984
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:40,920
meant it though yeah yeah i know well that's uh sure uh i don't know and uh i wouldn't wouldn't

985
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:47,400
wouldn't recommend uh it was very um boring but it wasn't that long yeah i was just gonna say you

986
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:54,760
know um i i find all of the drama in in the left really interesting you know um i like because like

987
01:38:54,760 --> 01:39:00,600
i don't know the people in my circles on social media they hate all of the youtube leftist people

988
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:11,000
they just despise them all you know you know yeah i get that i don't know i i i think uh i like

989
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:17,320
them i like you lefty i like bread tube what there i said it you know even though i don't i don't

990
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:21,960
watch as much so i don't watch as much of it as i as i was for a while because i feel like i've

991
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:26,840
reached the point where i kind of get it but for a while there i was down the rabbit hole and i was

992
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:34,920
like yeah this is cool i'm glad people are saying this shit you know i i definitely don't hate any of

993
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:41,560
them i uh i i uh you know i have their videos on in the background a lot of times when i draw

994
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:45,800
and stuff like that you know because i mean you know what else am i going to listen to you know

995
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:54,520
yeah but yeah it's like it's funny how like you know it's like i don't know like every like

996
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:58,520
there's groups of people who hate fosh and then like you know there's everyone hates

997
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:03,480
contra points and then everyone you know like god you know are we all we're all riding with

998
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:09,720
biden right we're all riding with biden hell yeah choo choo choo the biden train is leaving

999
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:15,240
the station i'm lucky that i don't need to yeah you know i've never voted uh for a democrat for

1000
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:21,880
president in my life it's always been third party yeah well i mean i i've lived in states

1001
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:28,040
i live in i've only lived in blue states like i grew up in chicago and like yeah and 2008 right

1002
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:35,240
i was like a nadir person you know like uh yeah yeah you know someone spit on me once uh in chicago

1003
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:41,400
uh when they saw my nadir pin yeah it was during 2008 when things were you know yeah i got spit on

1004
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:49,080
for wearing a nadir pin it was pretty intense uh i love uh walking around uh in my yang shirt uh my

1005
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:56,280
yang 2020 shirt is going to be a uh a treasured possession of mine uh for the rest of my life

1006
01:40:56,280 --> 01:41:02,440
i hope really a yang man oh Jesus no okay for like i had like a two week period where i heard

1007
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:07,560
about yang and thought he was pretty cool and then i was quickly disillusioned and realized he's

1008
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:15,080
kind of just a libertarian tech bro and uh and that his ubi was a little like i kind of like the idea

1009
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:22,280
but like his version of it is like the worst version of it uh so no but kind of but only briefly

1010
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:28,360
no i'm sorry i apologize i apologize for my if anyone sees me wearing my yang shirt i'm sorry

1011
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:35,800
you know it's it's funny how like everyone just argues about like these individuals you're like

1012
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:41,160
oh yang or oh bernie or like how oh the the dnc screwed over bernie i'm like they didn't screw

1013
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:46,360
over bernie bernie's fine they screwed over us that's who they screwed over sure you know

1014
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:53,320
you know like like you know all these politicians they might be different but at the end of the day

1015
01:41:53,320 --> 01:42:00,680
they're on the same side you know what i mean like even bernie is like a wealthy dude who benefits

1016
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:07,000
from all this stuff you know and like yeah he's become biden's little bitch and uh you know and

1017
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:11,960
so it like it makes me angry you know and that's the thing i wanted i wanted bernie

1018
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:17,240
you know but like the thing is it's it's it's not bernie it's not him it's us you know that's the

1019
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:23,240
thing it's not you know it's not me us not me us yeah you know and i i really think that

1020
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,720
people should take that kind of stuff to heart you know like they didn't you know the bernie

1021
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:33,640
bros are just so they they screwed bernie and poor bernie and then it's like no poor us that dude

1022
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:38,360
has health care you know like and he's never gonna not have health care we're the ones who need

1023
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:42,760
the health care you know i think 150 thousand years old had a heart attack and made it through

1024
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:47,800
so like his health care must be doing great i think that's fair i think that's that's that's

1025
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:54,920
perfectly fair and true yeah keep it keep it in perspective i guess yeah yeah i think i'd probably

1026
01:42:54,920 --> 01:43:01,160
fall for that trap sometimes i mean we make it we make it all about the individuals so much you

1027
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:07,400
know like you know we get mad at like one one person for you know their stupid shoplifting

1028
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:14,360
comic you know but not at like you know the system that maybe might have drove this character to

1029
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:19,720
shoplift you know what i mean it's easier to target individuals for our simple monkey brains

1030
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:28,440
to wrap around the concept so reality tv people want to see the different face as the president

1031
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:34,760
yeah the what they're gonna do is like not as easy to most people now edit it in again

1032
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:45,640
oh the burp you guys don't keep burps then uh not anymore as of right now they're no longer

1033
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:53,400
included yeah new policy uh what are we talking about we're talking about president oh we're

1034
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,960

funny and i wish you would notice me uh and uh and play uh uh play slime games with me

1053
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:14,200
thoughts thought slime put uh my shoplifting comic in one of his videos um actually it was

1054
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:19,240
like just a split second i think i may have seen that a split second and i got so excited it was

1055
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:25,080
this video where he was actually apologizing for another video i guess i didn't get to see the

1056
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:31,400
video he apologized for because he took it down but uh basically this video he i guess it was really

1057
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:37,080
mean spirit or something and so he apologized for it but in the video he's all like everyone's jumping

1058
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:43,800
up this person's ass to apologize for this comic which is ridiculous this comic is awesome

1059
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:48,360
and then you know and then went on to apologize for his thing so it's not even one of his

1060
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:53,640
very good videos it's kind of boring just watching him apologize but you know i was like ah he

1061
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:59,960
noticed me for a second yeah ben have you ever reached out to thought slime that's sick as fuck

zone uh thing yeah left his project the eyeball zone i sent him an email thinking that maybe uh

1067
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:40,920
endless war kind of qualifies uh i don't know it does and i perceived no response so either

1068
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:47,800
he didn't or he picks i mean it's it's not really much of a of an overtly leftist anything it's just

1069
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:54,440
a funny slime game video game yeah i thought he would at least think it was cool i am in his um

1070
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:59,080
or i was in his discord but like i didn't really do much in there i just kind of was in there and

1071
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:06,040
was like okay i'm in uh i'm still in there i don't even remember you try to get peter coffin on here

1073
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:23,320
a second uh no i just i uh peter i just because both of them i don't know they both kind of look

1074
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:29,480
alike i guess and they both go by they and sometimes i forget which one's which uh but not

1075
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:36,920
usually because they're different lol um okay that's so that's that what what else guys

1088
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:04,760
they're not convinced to vote biden and the the headline is like these women aren't convinced

1089
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:12,200
about biden despite all the things trump has done and it's like well those aren't the same thing uh

1090
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:17,560
you know the the it's like well shouldn't shouldn't biden have to do shouldn't what

1091
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:23,560
biden does enter into it in some way you know what one would think yeah it's like that thing

1092
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:28,600
we're like you know i don't know what's like it's like someone will hear me trashing liberals and

1095
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:48,280
yeah well you know that's why we we gotta reach across the aisle we gotta reach across the aisle

1096
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:52,520
and bring the far right over based on our shared hatred of liberals that's the thing we can all

1097
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:59,000
agree on um i don't know i don't know if that's i don't think i don't know if i actually believe

1098
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:04,920
that uh huh i don't think people agree with that at all i don't know i don't know if i actually

1099
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:08,200
even agree with that it's probably not it's probably not actually gonna work that well

1100
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:13,320
i mean i'm sure some of them you know like i don't know i wouldn't be surprised if there's

1101
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:18,760
folks out there that like you know they just see like you know like these liberals on the tv and

1102
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:23,800
radio and they're like shut up college boy you know like what's the alternative you know is oh

1103
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:30,520
conservatives you know like yeah like you know what i mean like i know exactly because you know we

1104
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:38,680
don't have like you know like far right discourse is acceptable in the mainstream media but not far

1105
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:44,280
left you know it's like it goes as far bernie is as far as it goes and i might you know in my eyes

1106
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:51,880
he's kind of like you know a centrist leaning to the left you know it's like not really change much

1107
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:58,680
if you're if you're far far right discourse doesn't threaten capitalism whereas far left stuff does

1108
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:04,920
and every establishment media source is pro capitalism so they're not gonna platform that

1109
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:12,920
shit if you're some moron uh watching you're watching television and you're like uh well no

1110
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:16,920
not you don't even i'm not even to say you have to be a moron but if you're just a person watching

1111
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:24,120
television watching the news and you're like boy liberals sure are smug and hypocritical

1112
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:28,360
and suck you know you rightly come to that conclusion and then you're like yeah and then

1113
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:34,280
you're thinking what's the alternative like the visible alternative you know is conservatism uh uh

1114
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:40,120
who who who you know yeah they don't people don't acknowledge that the left is even real and to

1115
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:44,840
a large extent it's not we don't have an organized left in america uh to the extent that they do in

1116
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:53,720
other countries japan has a communist party i want i want that i want that i think it's easy

1117
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:58,680
like in our bubbles to think that we're a bigger deal than you know we really are you know what i

1118
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:06,520
mean like yeah you know but it's sad it's it's and it's there's not very many of us like you know

1119
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:10,840
it's in the grand scheme of things yeah that's true yeah i think i think destiny was talking

1120
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:15,800
about at one point breaking down like oh yeah like there's a ton of like you know super left

1121
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:20,600
people on twitter but twitter is like one percent of the population and like only like a couple percent

1122
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:25,880
of twitter would be like really far left so like you're talking about a fraction of percent of the

1123
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:31,960
american population actually believes these things so you're but you're so insular on twitter it feels

1124
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:39,080
like there's this big movement you know and it's not really there yeah and like but but and the

1125
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:43,880
mainstream media you know it's like we have no history about like labor it's like this you know

1126
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:49,080
label rights you know people don't even know what mayday is about or you know yeah you know or any

1127
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:56,040
of that kind of stuff and uh yeah you know so you know it's i think it's easy to write off these

1128
01:53:56,040 --> 01:54:01,640
right wingers is like you know people call them stupid all the time or they call them all bigots

1129
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:08,280
you know and uh you know i'm and a lot of them are that you know a lot of them are just they they

1130
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:13,240
hate trans people that they're a lot of them are obsessively hate trans people for some reason

1131
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:17,640
it's it's kind of weird isn't it have you noticed that like yes they're always talking about us

1132
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:22,680
it's so yes they're very there's there's a certain yeah there's a segment of the population that's

1133
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:28,360
really fixated it's kind of weird you know and they're like they we shouldn't have rights because

1134
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:32,120
they're barely a fraction of the population i'm like well if we're barely a fraction of the

1135
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:38,360
population then why are you so fucking concerned like you know whether we get like the healthcare

1136
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:45,160
or like you know we use the fucking toilet you know jesus i um you ever you ever venture on the

1137
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:53,080
kiwi farms you're jealous you ever venture on the kiwi farms i have a page there uh you know

1138
01:54:53,080 --> 01:55:00,040
just for my own mental health i do not look at it because yeah it's like i mean back in the day

1139
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:05,960
like i used to look at it you know um and it just like always made me feel bad or you know

1140
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:13,960
you know and yeah the level of disc you know i the level of discourse there that i have seen

1141
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:20,680
is very it's very weird the tone that like every thread takes the tone is always very like

1142
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:27,480
the it's it's it's it's always like um i don't know it's it's so scoldy it's so

1143
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:33,000
scoldy and coppish and like like i don't know the conclusion that they always seem to come to

1144
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:38,600
about these people that they you know really hate and really want to like say bad things about just

1145
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:43,640
you know for whatever reason the conclusion that seems like they always come to is like oh

1146
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:48,120
this person should have just like stuck to the straight and narrow this person should have like

1147
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:55,160
you know uh uh you know just like maintained his traditional western values uh or whatever

1148
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:58,440
i don't know there's like a really strong like sort of traditionalist like

1149
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:05,240
enforcement's mentality there that like anything that someone anything bad about someone is because

1150
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:11,560
they deviated from like the the the the norm i don't know that's uh that's something i noticed

1151
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:17,800
going on there and i think it's very weird oh yeah hey by the way like you know during that whole

1152
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:21,800
like harassment thing you know like uh when my own community was turning at me when i needed

1153
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:29,880
the most i was getting doxed they those fuckers doxed me based yeah yeah yeah terrible uh

1154
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:39,960
yeah they're they're weirdos it's it's weird the tone there is very strange uh like uh you know

1155
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:45,160
the one thing the kiwi farm is like they can't they keep comparing me you know i don't know if

1156
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:48,360
they do this anymore because i haven't like looked at that page in a while but they keep

1157
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:55,160
comparing me to this other transgender comic artist named sophie labelle who does this um

1158
01:56:56,040 --> 01:57:01,720
sophie labelle yeah she does this comic called assigned mail it's it's like this kind of like

1159
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:08,360
cuddle party like oh i know i know assigned mail i know yeah it's just like it's all like uh transphobia

1160
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:13,960
is bad yay you know that kind of stuff you know which is fine you know like you know sign people

1161
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:20,520
yeah but uh you know for some reason that they always compare me to her for some reason like

1162
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:27,720
you know like uh well it's because they're they're really fixated on on that on that aspect of

1163
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:34,440
people and like that's all reducing people down to a label it's stupid it's pretty it's pretty bad

1164
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:41,880
i don't know you know uh i mean i i was familiar with kiwi farms because uh famously i'm a big uh

1165
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:46,840
i'm a big christorian i'm a i'm a big i'm a big time youtube uh sonichu man

1166
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:54,920
the the thread on chris is like particularly bad like the the the thread on on on christine is like

1167
01:57:55,880 --> 01:58:03,400
almost like weird and like they can't type or spell and it's like i don't know what's going on there

1168
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:10,200
it's like they're seething it's like literal children are the only ones like in that discussion

1169
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:17,000
anymore or like people who just like can't fucking use a computer correctly i don't understand i do not

1170
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:23,640
understand uh that um yeah and then everywhere else it's just very like hmm you see this person uh

1171
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:30,440
um this this youtuber uh he has you know uh lost subscribers because they uh they didn't uh i don't

1172
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:37,480
know they didn't uh uh get out of there because they're gay or something they didn't they didn't

1173
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:42,040
i don't know whatever they're degenerates they're yeah that's that that's what i was trying to

1174
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:48,440
say this person is degenerate here's here's why that word that word is so weird it's it's they

1175
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:53,560
constantly use it and and like yeah that's what it means is that you deviated from this like

1176
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,280
this normal this like normative idea that they're like kind of obsessed with

1177
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
and like anyone anyone boring yeah i don't know i feel like do you think like kiwi farms comes

1178
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,640
i mean i always associate kiwi farms with like 4chan right like like kind of like a similar

1179
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:14,120
sort of crowd of just like people who kind of like take the piss out of like other people online and

1180
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:20,600
like you know like making fun of like deviance i suppose and it feels like yeah 4chan's very much

1181
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:25,560
like an anonymous sort of thing right and so like being anonymous means like blending in and like not

1182
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:31,080
not sticking out or anything and so if you're like really big into anonymity like you would you would

1183
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:36,200
want to pull back people who stand out from the crowd and i feel like maybe that's kind of part

1184
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:42,360
of what it is is like if you're kind of coming from that background that like anybody who like is

1185
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:48,120
deviant goes against what you kind of have self-identified as i definitely wouldn't say taking

1186
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:53,720
the piss out of like these kiwi farms people just pick on small-time trans artists a lot you know like

1187
01:59:54,280 --> 02:00:00,760
you know it or like oh my gosh that antoons guy you know like how they went after that you know

1188
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:07,960
like you know and like i saw i saw this thing like antoons was saying that like like this puppy

1189
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:13,880
chan they have all this power and like dude they have like less than 60 000 followers on twitter

1190
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:20,840
you know like your antoons is like antoons has like a million fucking subscribers on youtube

1191
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:27,560
have you have you seen his youtube channel i only vaguely understood this antoons debacle

1192
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:35,080
but like here like he's making a video about me right now wait really yeah someone leaked stuff

1193
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:41,000
from his discord he is gonna he's making a video either with just me in it or about being or something

1194
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:50,200
like that so um antoons videos are so strange like his biggest videos are like the it's like

1195
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:55,320
deathbed scenes of like popular cartoon characters there's like i think his biggest one is like

1196
02:00:55,320 --> 02:01:01,320
homer simpson's deathbed and like friend flinstone is there and it's like it's like everyone's just

1197
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:08,200
crying and like i don't understand it at all it's it's really weird i guess it's i guess it's meant

1198
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:17,240
to be funny like you think so i guess it's common in a meta way i guess 129 million views sonic funeral

1199
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:24,040
yeah that's what that's what he does but that's what he did before he decided to be like a

1200
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:30,200
fucking bigot on twitter professionally lol yeah what is with that like all of you know these like

1201
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:34,360
people have like a decent career all of a sudden like get irked by trans people and then that's

1202
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:39,800
like what they become about you know is like yeah they're fucking pussies they're scared of the big

1203
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:46,760
boogie man who's gonna you know femboy eyes them with the femboy ray and like no i don't want to

1204
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:53,400
do any of that i don't want to oh they're taking over everything oh it's just it's hysteria

1205
02:01:54,120 --> 02:02:00,120
yeah they don't know anything about anything and then i assume that antoons i assumed that

1206
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:05,320
antoons was just one of the cadre of people who just wants to be another stone toss and we'll just

1207
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:09,880
like you have a little cottage industry that sprung up about like just get trying to like

1208
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:14,840
make a comic that gets retweeted by stone toss and then and then you know a couple thousand at

1209
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:18,120
least a couple thousand people will be like yeah i'll follow this guy because i like what he's saying

1210
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:24,520
um and uh but no he's he's already huge on youtube and he's still up to this weird shit

no empathy they're they're quick to like be angry at at weird shit for no reason you know i i honestly

1231
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:44,920
feel bad for a lot of these boomers you know they they don't know what's happening and it's not you

1232
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:50,680
know i like yeah i would feel bad for them if they weren't like actively ruining everything for the

1233
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:56,440
rest yeah that's i know i'm just talking about well you know you know moms and stuff like that i'm

1234
02:04:56,440 --> 02:05:03,080
not talking about like you know people's power you know i think that's yeah you know like lady on

1235
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:10,360
the street you know that is like you know not the action they're voting it's the lead it's the lead

1236
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:17,480
the lead is voting for us now the lead wants uh you know the lead wants the wall and it will

1237
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:21,720
have it by any means necessary uh made of lead

1238
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:29,880
you know like my mom is just like it's so hard to get things through her skull you know i have to

1239
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:36,280
tell her over and over again and like she it's like it just does not understand it like anything

1240
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:43,080
you know maybe my mom's just an idiot but um yeah and it's like and i'm just like you know

1241
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:50,600
but really i think it's like she ate lead chips as a kid you know what like yeah i'll do it uh what

1242
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:56,520
was that uh it was just like actually like eight lead chips no oh you know like i don't know because

1243
02:05:56,520 --> 02:06:02,040
like back in the day you know paint on the walls was made out of lead and it would chip off and

1244
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:08,840
children would eat it you know and like all the gas was leaded you know like when my mom was a baby

1245
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:14,280
you know i think i don't know and see yeah it's not my fault it's not my fault for that i have

1246
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:18,120
those daddy issues you mentioned it's the lead it's the lead that did it you know that's the

1247
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:24,280
lead that made uh my dad get me uh put me on fucking uh uh adhd and i punched the hole in the

1248
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:31,640
wall it was the lead all along you know it's not it's not me anti-lead we were taking an anti-lead

1249
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:38,440
stance on this podcast now we're pro-circumcision and anti-lead um

1250
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,760
wait no we were arguing about that before the last time i i think i came off as being a little

1251
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:53,480
i mean i was doing it on purpose i all i all i wanted to say about the circumcision thing was

1252
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:58,840
that i'm open to being convinced that maybe it's good uh uh not not that i not that i actively

1253
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:04,600
think yes it's good we should do it just that i am available to be persuaded by evidence that

1254
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:10,120
suggests that it is you know how dare you it's not it's not it's not my default my default

1255
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:18,200
position is not we should definitely be circumcising always abc always be circumcising and uh and

1256
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:23,160
you know you got you'll need to you'll need to make a compelling argument uh otherwise to change

1257
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:28,200
my mind it's not like you guys you guys had a podcast about circumcising we got we talked about

1258
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:33,640
last it was yeah based on a voicemail i think right at the end of the discussion about it

1259
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:41,880
yeah um speaking of voicemails i mean we've been going we've been going for two and a half hours

1260
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:49,160
now uh i don't know do you guys i'm sorry was i interested enough that i do okay here i well

1261
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:56,760
i almost feel bad saying it because like i feel like we could keep going uh uh and and yet and yet

1262
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:59,560
the podcast must conclude

1263
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:07,400
eventually i mean we've had long episodes before it's fine and you can also like cut out stuff

1264
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:13,320
you know because there is points oh no no no no no no no no no that's good content that's good

1265
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:17,800
content right there that's not we don't we don't pay we don't pay our editor that much i mean go on

1266
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:24,440
this is a shoestring operation hmm you hear that alia czar get fucked

1267
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:31,560
like honestly this is fun i like like i'm just excited that i get to talk with other people

1268
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:38,200
um this quarantine is naming nuts yeah because you know i'm a high-risk person i had a kidney

1269
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:43,720
transplant you know oh shit oh i had so many bad things happen to me in my life it's uh you

1270
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:49,880
know i can probably write a book about that um you know and so yeah it does suck you know but

1271
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:55,720
whatever i'm it's made me home yeah but yeah so i'm on these uh anti-rejection medications

1272
02:08:55,720 --> 02:09:01,160
which lowers my immune system so basically if i get covid you know i also like struggle with

1273
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:09,320
hypertension so if i get the covid there's like a 40 chance that i'm toast oh jesus christ okay yikes

1274
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:14,920
yeah so i don't even hard car lockdown yeah i don't even go to the grocery store i have you

1275
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:23,640
know people bring me the groceries yeah and you know it sucks i'm going crazy i hear i think

1276
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:33,080
if it's driving me bonkers like that's why like you know i mean i i was pretty much i was pretty i

1277
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:40,360
was a little bit of a hermit even before lockdown and lockdown has made me think like i need to like

1278
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:46,680
once when when normal comes back i should probably like take better advantage of it

1279
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:53,320
and like actually go out and do more things than i used to even you know because like now now i have

1280
02:09:53,320 --> 02:10:01,160
to do it and it's like uh you know maybe this isn't uh maybe this isn't the way to live uh yeah it's

1281
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:08,200
not that great um i i i also love just having this podcast and then the streams we do just

1282
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:15,880
it's just nice to talk to people about stuff every every week i'm a people person i need people

1283
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:20,920
i like going out and doing you know i need my alone time too you know like but i just i like

1284
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:29,800
people a whole heckin lot and um yeah and uh so this has been really difficult for me my partner

1285
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:34,680
on the other hand she's like thriving you know she's like has you know you know she's more of an

1286
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:42,680
introvert um you know but it's like you know i'm all itchy and like bouncing around and you know

1287
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:49,560
and she's just like chill i'm i think i'm pretty good i'm pretty good with isolation but you know

1288
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:56,680
enough enough so i'm probably doing better than a lot of people but i i i'm also i'm also pretty

1289
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:03,480
over it uh yeah you know this covered thing and not a big fan honestly uh i could take it to leave

1290
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:09,400
it i guess i thought hey you know it sucks too it's like you know this might not be the first

1291
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:14,200
this might just be the first of uh a few pandemics that we get in the next two decades

1292
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:22,360
yeah it sucks good to think about i know blows but hopefully hopefully not you know

1293
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:29,640
you know and hopefully this thing mutates and hopefully it mutates and it's not as deadly

1294
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:37,880
or you know the vaccine is good or something right right yeah i i feel like optimistically

1295
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:43,560
by the middle of next year there'd be a vaccine out and we'd finally start actually dealing with it

1296
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:51,800
the um i i don't know between the fastest it's gonna be the fastest time it ever took to create

1297
02:11:51,800 --> 02:12:00,600
a new vaccine was four years fastest hey yes i think it was malaria no not really i don't remember

1298
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:07,240
there's a lot of new vaccine technology you know where they like just type shit into a computer

1299
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:13,400
it spits out the vaccine why haven't they done that that's um suspicious

1300
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:18,840
i you know i'm simplifying it because i'm an idiot you know i don't really know how

1301
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:24,760
it's probably much more complicated than that mumps it was mumps was the fastest vaccine ever

1302
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:30,520
developed and it took four years in 1967 well yes a while ago i think i can definitely do it first

1303
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:39,000
to now well i mean who knows right well that i guess i guess we'll find out based on all of the

1304
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:45,960
things i've heard from all of the experts saying they're projected um thoughts um it's it's something

1305
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:52,600
that could happen within one or two years so i'm pretty confident that that will be the timescale

1306
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:59,560
if such a thing happens at all like how do they know maybe they are bullshitting but this is the

1307
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:05,480
novel coronavirus it's a new virus like like i don't know maybe they know something i don't

1308
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:09,640
but like how would you how would you be able to be like oh yeah i think this new disease that has

1309
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:14,680
never been researched before i think the timescale for making a vaccine for that should be about uh

1310
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:21,080
like this how would you begin to answer that i think they definitely know more than you do about it

1311
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:29,080
but no you know i don't think so actually it sounds okay all right point taken point taken

1312
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:34,280
experts are really boring yeah is that hard to talk to because they they study all the time they

1313
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:41,720
don't know how to speak in front of cameras on the news i thought you liked boring videos uh i do

1314
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:48,040
but like it's it's it's hard for people to agree and like like really get into something an expert

1315
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:56,600
says because an expert is an expert at their thing and not at speaking yeah i agree that i see people

1316
02:13:56,600 --> 02:14:01,960
on my timeline kind of afraid of the vaccine even though they're not like those anti-vaxxer types

1317
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:07,640
you know like afraid of rushing out the vaccine and i would be nervous i would be nervous to take

1318
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:13,480
a vaccine that's like yeah you know like that was new and that hadn't been like tested that much

1319
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:19,320
they would have to have like loads of volunteers be like okay we have something we can try anyone

1320
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:26,520
want to try it and people will be like oh please me and then yes and then they would try it a bunch

1321
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:31,560
and after a few weeks or months we'd we'd have more of an understanding whether it works or not

1322
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:38,280
i feel like what kamala harris said during the the vice president debate was also not a great

1323
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:42,840
thing either she was saying like oh it comes out during a trump presidency i won't take it it's just

1324
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:49,480
oh my god why would you say things like that yeah that was like what does that have to do with it

1325
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:54,280
because she was saying that like if if dr fouching everybody clears it but if it comes out during

1326
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:59,160
a trump administration and trump's the one pushing it i don't want to take it and it's just like weird

1327
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:03,800
like weird trump doesn't have the authority to like clear a fucking you know like he's not going

1328
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:10,040
to be like i did the trump vaccine and i developed it myself but it's just the trump vaccine you know

1329
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:14,600
uh uh he just he just like puts his like fucking name on regeneron or something and

1330
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:19,960
starts hawking it or whatever but like a legitimate vaccine like it's not trump's not the one doing

1331
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:25,640
it so like putting that in people's minds it definitely makes a part it makes a vaccine a

1332
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:30,280
partisan issue which is like not a good idea yeah i was about to say that stupid culture were

1333
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:37,480
bullshit you know that needs to die it's like the uh like the stimulus package like i don't know

1334
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:43,000
like i guess i guess they think that like getting the stimulus package out now like people would

1335
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,920
think trump did it but like does anyone think that there wouldn't be a stimulus package under

1336
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:51,560
like biden like does that does anyone really think that like trump is the one doing that and

1337
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:57,720
that if it wouldn't happen without him you know what i mean it just seems like no it's congress

1338
02:15:57,720 --> 02:16:03,400
is doing that am i right yeah i'm right yeah yeah of course you're right you know yeah okay hell yeah

1339
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:09,960
you know it's it's the culture war thing you know it's like yeah you know it's either bad or good

1340
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:15,480
i don't remember kamala saying that that's what seems like a really bizarre statement

1341
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:21,880
i must have missed it i was like what the isn't she like a cop or something too

1342
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:31,000
yeah she's the the the da like the oh god i don't know she was a da somewhere and yeah she uh you

1343
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:38,600
know she did some uh uh she kept some uh some people in jail uh for no reason uh yeah she

1344
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:43,080
prosecuted a bunch of uh you know people probably shouldn't have gone to jail but they did because

1345
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:50,440
the prison industrial complex you know needs more slaves haha yeah fuck yeah uh so yeah she's a little

1346
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:57,080
bit of a cop a little bit of a cop that shit sucks big big cop big time cop no she's awful she's

1347
02:16:57,080 --> 02:17:07,240
terrible uh but i mean you know i guess mike pence makes her look good i guess so you know yay yay

1348
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:17,400
biden biden biden biden uh well i know about pence is that he's some kind of like fucking like

1349
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:23,400
idiot like local like news jockey or like like radio host or something and like that was his thing

1350
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:30,200
for a while really that's yeah yeah he was it's funny because like he seems to have like no

1351
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:36,520
personality whatsoever well he just seems like to be in the back yeah behind the scenes doing

1352
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:42,360
whatever he's like the anti-trump you know i can't i can't even picture what his voice sounds like i

1353
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:47,480
don't even know what he sounds like i don't know i don't i don't think i've ever seen him talk i

1354
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:52,520
miss the i miss the kamala debate so i'll maybe i'll maybe i'll go the rest of my life never

1355
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:57,320
knowing what he sounds like that would be nice that'd be pretty good actually oh it's me mike

1356
02:17:57,320 --> 02:18:04,920
pence hello this is what i sound like that's it that's what it was uh yeah he ran like a he ran

1378
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:35,800
what is that face he's making doesn't look very excited yeah he looked very sad

1379
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:43,320
he he posted a video not too long ago where he he he he wanted to try the cloudberry um but he

1380
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:50,600
didn't just like get one he like went on like a trip to um i scanned an avia and like went like

1381
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:57,240
foraging in the woods to like find one find one like ripe off the the bush or whatever uh it was

1382
02:20:57,240 --> 02:21:06,040
great yeah uh and you know what he said it tasted pretty good so that was a good video who am i to

1383
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:11,960
disagree are all of his videos like he just puts in his mouth he says that's pretty good most of his

1384
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:18,840
videos are just him kind of he'll just kind of hold the fruit and like shake it talk about like

1385
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:24,040
where where it comes from talk about like you know how it's generally eaten by whoever eats it or if

1386
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:29,720
it's eaten anywhere yeah and then he'll like yeah he'll just cut into it and eat it and like be like

1387
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:38,920
taste uh bad um taste like a mud uh taste like a shit uh subscribe there is a way to do that but

1388
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:45,160
that's that's the gist i've been watching this guy named brutal moose i think his name is brutal

1389
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:52,440
moose he i am familiar with that name yeah he he uh does the thing called brutal foods and he just

1390
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:58,280
like eats uh tv dinners and talks about how disgusting they are and funny sound effects

1391
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:08,120
amazing i are they that bad i don't know i'm looking at some of these thumbnails and like

1392
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:13,400
that doesn't look hungry man dinner doesn't look too bad you know i mean that's so i think i could

1393
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:19,560
stomach it i guess yeah there's lots of salt in those things you should not eat them yeah

1394
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:25,560
especially if you're especially if you're born in the 80s you know because you're old

1395
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:34,200
it's true no you know i'm really wrong i'm really thinking about like what youtube stuff i get

1396
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:39,160
excited for nowadays and i don't think there's anything left really that's what i'm saying like

1397
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:46,280
i don't have anything every time i used to be so excited for like jon tron for example um or you

1398
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:52,360
know i had a list of like i love these creatives and now i'm just like uh jon tron didn't he do

1399
02:22:52,360 --> 02:23:00,440
the right rain grip too didn't he like trans people i think he got led down led down the wrong path

1400
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:07,560
i feel like he said he said some pretty fucked up shit on a stream with destiny and he has never

1401
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:14,520
apologized or taken it back uh so it's a little like he quote unquote he clarified it but like

1402
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:22,280
he didn't understand did not do like anything for me it didn't really like it's clear that he

1403
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:27,720
still hasn't looked into the things that people are calling him out about and you just say guys

1404
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:32,280
i'm not a white nationalist i'm i'm not that's basically what it was that that's pretty much

1405
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:37,240
all he said but he didn't explain like he didn't explain like how he changed his mind or anything

1406
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:42,040
or like how he actually in hindsight i don't agree with the things that i said no it was terrible

1407
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:47,800
it was a terrible apology yeah so like public apologies are always so terrible you know when

1408
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:55,720
people apologize to public it's just so it's cringy every single time i i hate them yeah yeah i mean

1409
02:23:55,720 --> 02:24:01,320
it wasn't the like the stereotype that you might imagine of him like being like with the sad piano

1410
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:06,920
music and him like pretending to cry he like walks in from off camera sits down guys it's time to

1411
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:12,040
be past that side yeah you know who'd had a you know who had a good had a good public apology though

1412
02:24:13,480 --> 02:24:22,520
who yeah you know i guess uh my man my man my man pro jared pro jared uh had a great public

1413
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:30,840
apology uh and pro jared did nothing wrong and i i stand oh the yeah yeah that was a pretty crazy

1414
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:37,160
video wait what what did everyone hate his guts for oh man i have a hard time okay with all the

1415
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:43,160
internet drama well this was i mean that was a while ago but there was a lot there was um okay well he

1416
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:53,400
got he he got divorced from his wife and at the same time some people accused him of uh of uh

1417
02:24:53,480 --> 02:25:01,720
basically pedophilia and uh he and he he he made it you know he basically like disappeared

1418
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:06,600
and like people were really it made me really mad because people like treated these two things

1419
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:11,000
is like the same like people were angry about him and like they would talk about like oh how he was

1420
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,760
like his his ex-wife would like say all these terrible things about him and like oh he was

1421
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:18,760
such a bad husband and stuff and they would say that in the same breath as they're like oh yeah and

1422
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:24,680
he was also a child groomer and it's like those are not those are not even comparable um but then

1423
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:28,920
you know he disappeared from the internet for a while and then he came back with with a big video

1424
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:34,840
when he's like with a big receipt he didn't yeah he didn't he didn't talk about um the divorce at all

1425
02:25:34,840 --> 02:25:42,040
in that video but he just said like um yeah so like here's why you know here's why these allegations

1426
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:47,880
are false and like he made a pretty good you know a pretty solid case for it and it was like yeah okay

1427
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:57,640
good I just uh I just really hate his ex-wife uh uh so you know I was glad I was glad that

1428
02:25:57,640 --> 02:26:04,200
he made a comeback just uh because you know I think it would be funny if she had a bad time

1429
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:12,840
that's what I think amazing cool these these public personalities on the internet and

1430
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:22,760
all the callouts and accusations it's it's so weird like it's uh yeah you know like I have

1431
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:29,160
a hard time wrapping my head around all this you know like I mean this because cloud is currency so

1432
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:35,000
you know you gotta you gotta jockey you gotta try and maneuver you know you gotta like take down

1433
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:42,200
someone so you can get their cloud you know or whatever if you're if you're the guy who like

1434
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:50,520
owned someone hard enough then uh you know like like uh you can oh yeah you can be you can be the guy

1435
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:58,360
who canceled some other some other big dude you know and that's and that's that's cloud in itself

1436
02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:04,520
you know I have zero interest in like calling out or trying to cancel like even people who've

1437
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:08,600
wanted me you know like I you know like earlier we're talking about like how people in my own

1438
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:14,920
community treat me like garbage you know like I I forgive them all you know like I you know I

1439
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:18,760
I'm a very forgiving person you know like I get it you know there's been times

1440
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:23,720
where like someone whispered in my ear like hey that person actually really sucks because of reasons

1441
02:27:23,720 --> 02:27:32,120
and I'm like yeah yeah they suck you know and uh you know like it makes me wonder like how often

1442
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:37,560
like do people just get totally reamed that like just don't deserve it you know

1443
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:44,600
yeah I think it's it's quite often but it's it's hard to tell and and getting all of the information

1444
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:50,680
necessary to know is sometimes such an ordeal that I don't even want to get into like I'll just

1445
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:56,200
assume everything everything is wrong and nothing is real because I don't want to have to form an

1446
02:27:56,200 --> 02:28:03,480
opinion on whether the ex youtuber did or didn't do the things that they said or have been told

1447
02:28:03,480 --> 02:28:10,040
they're doing by this other youtuber it's like everyone's stupid I don't want to I don't like it

1448
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:17,560
yeah like recently there is that uh that transgender woman who like I guess she like hooked up a

1449
02:28:17,560 --> 02:28:23,240
controller to or like you know a vibrator or something like that right you know and um

1450
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:29,880
um you know she had the the the vibrator you know like well here the story was is that like

1451
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:36,840
you know that she was masturbating with children on uh let's play you know that was like the info

1452
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:42,360
that I got yeah right you know I'm like what the fuck is this and I looked into it and like

1453
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:48,520
apparently she just like she uh hooked up this controller to a vibrator right and then had the

1454
02:28:48,600 --> 02:28:55,880
vibrator like laying on her chest and like basically uh I forget which game it was but uh you know

1455
02:28:55,880 --> 02:29:01,720
every time she like bumped into a character the vibrator would vibrate on her chest you know

1456
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:06,200
and then like then she realized um like oh this might be weird and then she like disconnected it

1457
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:11,880
right and then it turned into this huge thing where like you know I got people in my DM saying

1458
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:18,280
it's all like you follow her you gotta unfollow her she's masturbating you know on this video

1459
02:29:18,280 --> 02:29:23,880
came and I'm like holy shit and you know and like all it took was 30 seconds of research to like

1460
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:30,600
you know realize that what they were saying was yeah yeah blown out of proportion it just

1461
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:38,440
wasn't true you know she wasn't masturbating you know um it's like it's like the thing with with

1462
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:44,760
progerid was like even though the bigger allegations were false there's still a bit of

1463
02:29:44,760 --> 02:29:53,800
iffyness with him like having a weird um like alter ego sexy tumblr so it's not completely clean

1464
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:59,480
but at the same time it's not too bad either it's it's just you know I mean it's not yeah it's it's

1465
02:29:59,480 --> 02:30:07,080
expanded into it's not what people were saying ever yeah uh and it's very very very very very

1466
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:14,600
frustrating all your folks here seem very like forgetting and open you know like in my like

1467
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:22,440
online circles it's like fuck all of these people 100% you know it's um god no it's exhausting

1468
02:30:22,440 --> 02:30:29,320
living like that yeah I mean and honestly is uh you know like I I have a hard time I mean there

1469
02:30:29,320 --> 02:30:37,000
are there are people who I think like fuck them forever about uh but you know but but not people

1470
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:42,680
you've heard secondary information about right no right there's people who are like scoring you

1471
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:46,680
in real life and you're just like you know what I'm done dealing with that person but when it's

1472
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:50,600
like secondhand information from someone online who you're never going to have an actual interaction

1473
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:55,720
with it's like why waste all the time and energy like hating on that person you know you could just

1474
02:30:55,720 --> 02:31:00,600
kind of like acknowledge it but like okay that happened and just move on it doesn't have to become

1475
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:06,120
this huge fucking ordeal and it just seems like unhealthy to have that kind of standard anyway

1476
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:11,480
because like I don't know eventually like if we keep like making this purity test

1477
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:15,080
more and more stringent eventually you're not going to pass it anymore and then you've

1478
02:31:15,080 --> 02:31:19,160
helped create an environment where everyone's going to turn on you and it's just like I'd

1479
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:23,880
rather like let people have room to learn and grow and get better and like make mistakes

1480
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:31,000
yeah you know and it's another thing that you know the recently someone's in my DM saying you

1481
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:35,800
got on follow this artist they they draw you know child porn I'm like holy shit you know I'm like

1482
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:41,320
you know and this that's that's a big deal you know and then I'm like well you know

1483
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:46,840
I asked the person where it's the evidence for this and like the evidence was literally

1484
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:53,160
a drawing of Birdo or Yoshi from Mario but their butthole was showing you know

1485
02:31:54,120 --> 02:32:00,680
oh what that's funny you know and that's child porn

1486
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:09,000
okay it was a youthful Yoshi why because like is Yoshi canonically like young or something I don't

1487
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:15,000
know yeah maybe that's what it was but I'm just like you know and like and that's like a big deal

1488
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:20,920
like because she's only 17 according to the according to the guidebook with uh with a super

1489
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:27,080
from a super nintendo this is fucked up you know and like you had Yoshi in the game he's only 10

1490
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:38,680
minutes old yeah yeah oh shit that's true that's true you know baby and it's it's it's like but

1491
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:46,280
this stuff pops up like constantly you know and like it's like it's gotten to the point where it's

1492
02:32:46,280 --> 02:32:53,400
just like I don't know what to believe about people anymore you know it's yeah no I when I see um

1493
02:32:54,600 --> 02:33:00,680
yeah I don't think much of it when I see like if I hear that like you know someone you know did

1494
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:05,960
something like I really need to see like evidence I need you know if someone is doing something wrong

1495
02:33:05,960 --> 02:33:13,080
I'm not it's not enough to just hear it I I have to see it like that's the only that's the only way

1496
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:20,120
I kind of think that's probably how it should be yeah yeah yeah yeah um I mean I think probably

1497
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:25,720
things would be better uh if everybody uh did that I know I don't know you know they on social

1498
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:30,520
media there's like a lot of kids there's like a lot of there's cloud chasers there's like young

1499
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:37,240
kids who are stupid and there's you know yeah that's like another the kids like they're uh they're

1500
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:41,720
super concerned about zoophilia have you noticed that like you see a bunch of teenagers and they're

1501
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:46,280
all super concerned and like is this a problem or like people fucking animals is that a thing

1502
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:50,760
that's a problem right now in our society they've discovered not safe for work are for the first

1503
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:55,640
time and they're shaking they're literally shaking that's all it is is it just that they if they want

1504
02:33:55,880 --> 02:34:01,320
is it just that they want to shame furries and like call them like uh you know perverts or whatever

1505
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:08,200
and like is that what's going on there I have no idea but I feel like it's the thing that

1506
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:12,200
that just keeps cropping up because you know young people come onto the internet all the time

1507
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:18,440
and they discover the internet um for the first time and they learn all these things and then

1508
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:23,080
they get mad about certain things and it's just sort of it's a it's a wave it just comes and goes

1509
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:29,240
I don't know I don't I don't pay too much attention to a lot of the outrage because I know a lot of

1510
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:35,080
it is is very young people coming to terms with some strange things about the internet that

1511
02:34:35,640 --> 02:34:41,240
aren't really that big of a problem do you guys see that tweet the other day it was like it blew

1512
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:48,280
up it was like uh liking petite women is rooted in pedophilia though that was a great that was a

1513
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:53,480
another great take from the twitter uh take machine yeah um

1514
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:01,320
I saw a lot of really I saw a lot of really funny responses to it I wish I could remember

1515
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:07,560
them off off the top of my head but whatever it was big big shit show that that is disgusting

1516
02:35:07,560 --> 02:35:13,800
and bad you know and like but some of these like accusations are huge like big crimes you know like

1517
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:20,040
like pedophilia is disgusting you know like you don't do that to children you know and like to

1518
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:26,360
just like they're throwing it around like it's confetti you know and uh they gotta be the most

1519
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:32,280
outlandish they gotta have the biggest headline to get the most twitter likes in on twitter it's

1520
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:38,680
all about being extreme like we were saying oh yeah I mean it's a it's a serious accusation and it's a

1521
02:35:38,680 --> 02:35:44,120
really easy it's just a really easy way I don't know it's a it's really easy way to just like

1522
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:49,000
spread something bad about something if you just want to destroy them that's like the the simplest

1523
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:56,280
way to do it um you know I don't think we got to talk about it but uh you know like um so I

1524
02:35:56,280 --> 02:36:02,360
reshared that shoplifting comic right you know and like yeah I guess some people couldn't handle that

1525
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:07,960
I had the confidence to do that and uh you know they dug up that seven-year-old comic of mine

1526
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:12,840
you know and uh and you know now that I think about it I think the only place they could find

1527
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:20,120
that comic is on kiwi farms so I'm pretty sure kiwi farms person what were you saying what was the

1528
02:36:20,120 --> 02:36:26,280
old one what was the old the old comic so like this I it was a comic I made you know oh my god so

1529
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:33,240
like it was like back in 2013 I was like super sjw back then you know um you know because like

1530
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:39,720
you know like I because like you know I transitioned in them you know you know started

1531
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:44,840
transitioning the mid-2000s and you know family and friends treated me like shit I got like

1532
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:50,600
super sick of it then I kind of discovered you know the social justice thing and I you know

1533
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:57,800
you know ran with it hard you know and um you know well because it was super empowering to me like

1534
02:36:57,880 --> 02:37:05,160
as a you know trans person that like has been sucked over you know uh and so like you know

1535
02:37:05,160 --> 02:37:10,840
my old comics were all about that kind of stuff you know like how how shitty transphobia is and

1536
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:18,280
stuff and uh so this comic that you know that I that one of my friends helped me make right

1537
02:37:18,280 --> 02:37:22,120
you know because like especially you know because like all the canceling stuff that was a thing back

1538
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:29,640
then too you know I was super paranoid to like talk about anything that wasn't inside my own exact

1539
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:35,000
experience so like I got my you know this person I'm still friends with to this day I actually

1540
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:42,760
did a social distance hangout with yesterday honestly um you know we uh you know just made

1541
02:37:42,760 --> 02:37:50,920
this comic about uh trans guys you know struggling with uh you know machismo culture and like the

1542
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:56,120
pressure you know to be like you know super masculine and kind of shitty you know kind of

1543
02:37:56,120 --> 02:38:02,520
like you know and like you know as a trans you know femme like I kind of related to that but like

1544
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:06,760
on the opposite end you know like people tell me I have to like wear you know high heels all the

1545
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:13,080
time and put on makeup every day you know it's like you know but I you know um so like I basically

1546
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:17,320
you know me and my friend we made this comic about like just a trans guy struggling with um

1547
02:38:17,560 --> 02:38:25,640
you know and like basically the narrative that uh these kids came up with was that like I hate

1548
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:32,360
trans men because I think that like they're oh embracing toxic masculinity you know and uh but

1549
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:38,920
like that's the thing that's such an easy like I don't know it's just like a lazy like you know

1550
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:43,480
like hey if I look at this thing and I don't engage with it and I don't like think about it

1551
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:49,400
I don't know it's just I can spin this they say I can spin this yeah yeah such a lazy spin

1552
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:54,280
but but you know and that's the thing like I you know but but that's the thing it caught fire

1553
02:38:54,280 --> 02:38:59,720
and like thousands and thousands of people saw it right and then like the person got pressure to

1554
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:04,840
apologize and one of the people who shared it also you know apologize and like a dozen people

1555
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:10,120
saw the apology but now like you know I'm still getting dm this like from people being like you

1556
02:39:10,120 --> 02:39:17,240
hate you know trans men and like you know or like you know like you know like something uh some of

1557
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:21,320
the replies under a comic of mine recently it's like why do you hate trans men you know and it's

1558
02:39:21,320 --> 02:39:26,200
and it's like this thing and it takes on a life of its own and like even no matter how ridiculous

1559
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:32,920
it is it's like you know you get stained with that and it sticks it sticks to you it's and it sucks

1560
02:39:33,160 --> 02:39:40,520
I I have to wait hold on one second I gotta I gotta end the craig recording and start a new one

1561
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:46,520
let me do that right now it's okay okay we're good we're good okay um

1562
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:51,800
it I mean it reminds me of like the buck angel thing on contra points right and how everyone

1563
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:59,080
said that like oh it's like she is you know has this like this guy on this kind of who said like

1564
02:39:59,080 --> 02:40:05,480
transphobic things and then there was the the the the whole um I don't know there's such a fucking

1565
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:11,720
kerfuffle like every time contra points does anything yeah yeah it's it's it's that that thing

1566
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:19,400
of of the popularity getting people more ready and willing to try and take them down

1567
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:24,200
contra points is huge so it's like oh wouldn't it be great if she fell

1568
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:31,080
from such a great height all of my online social circles hate her guts 100% you know I

1569
02:40:31,640 --> 02:40:38,680
I can't understand what I mean can I ask why well I mean the narrative is that she is

1570
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:46,680
quote truce gum and she hates non-binary people uh that's what people say yeah okay and um

1571
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:53,000
you know like I'm gonna say I'm like I do not stand contra points I don't I don't like I'm not I'm

1572
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:58,920
I'm not a huge fan I I mean like I I've seen all of her videos you know like what one of them drying

1573
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:05,400
and stuff they just autoplaying stuff like that you know I like a lot of the stuff that she says that

1574
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:11,320
is good like it is just old news to me and then you know I you know for you know and it's like

1575
02:41:11,320 --> 02:41:17,800
for me let's um you know I don't hate her guts you know I think like the worst accusations against

1576
02:41:17,800 --> 02:41:23,000
her uh like are aren't true like I don't think she hates non-binary people I'm a non-binary person

1577
02:41:24,520 --> 02:41:30,040
I I you know I if all there are non-binary people think she sucks like that's their thing and

1578
02:41:30,040 --> 02:41:37,160
they're completely you know they could uh I mean I uh I mean I understand how some of the things she's

1579
02:41:37,160 --> 02:41:42,760
I understand why she's rubbed people the wrong way but like I mean I I don't know it's a and I've

1580
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:49,800
seen people say oh yeah she hates non-binary she's a true scum I mean she has said in response to that

1581
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:55,160
like no I'm not like that's not what I think and like has explained what she does believe so like if

1582
02:41:55,160 --> 02:41:59,240
you claim that you're basically just saying that like she's just lying and like I don't believe

1583
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:04,120
that she's I don't believe that she's like making these videos and just like pretending to believe

1584
02:42:04,120 --> 02:42:12,200
things that she doesn't I really don't yeah that's she's just willing to to entertain her own um like

1585
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:20,360
thoughts of because I watched her beauty video not too long ago and she goes into like um you know

1586
02:42:20,360 --> 02:42:25,560
asking the question of like why would I go to such lengths to you know get surgery to change the

1587
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:31,720
shape of my skull and all this stuff and it involved like talking points and and discussions like

1588
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:38,280
like a like a genuine introspective discussion about like things that could be labeled as

1589
02:42:38,280 --> 02:42:45,080
true scummy thoughts but like it's it's what she does is to like invite the discussion which is

1590
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:51,720
why she's so popular because she through asking these questions and then discussing them openly

1591
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:58,280
has reached so many more people than she would have otherwise so like her personal beliefs

1592
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:04,840
like just because you're you're you're willing to entertain ideas and talk about them in a video

1593
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:10,920
doesn't mean that you necessarily believe them and she's you know she's explained what our actual

1594
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:19,240
beliefs are so it's like they just they just they're just mad you know it's for me it's like

1595
02:43:19,240 --> 02:43:26,360
obviously there's things to critique about her you know but you know and but there's this thing

1596
02:43:26,360 --> 02:43:33,240
that the part that people ignore right is that I think that trans women especially there's something

1597
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:41,320
about us that people they just we they they you know and this I'm talking about other trans people

1598
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:49,720
you know like they just jump up our asses big time you know and it's like you know like if

1599
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:55,720
it was anyone else saying the same things you know like sure get the criticism that you deserve but

1600
02:43:56,440 --> 02:44:03,160
you know like you know but the way like people talk about like these you know not just contrabot

1601
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:08,840
tons of people like it's like all this bad faith that like you know they're like like I remember

1602
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:14,280
when Chelsea Manning right do you remember when Chelsea Manning went to that like alt right ball

1603
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:23,320
or whatever uh you know maybe she like crashed this like party of full of like right wingers right

1604
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:29,800
and like everyone on my feed was like like fuck her and I'm like oh my god you know she's like

1605
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:36,440
she's a fucking hero what are you talking about you know like yeah you know and

1606
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:43,560
it's like it's cop it's cop behavior it's very much like oh you shouldn't you shouldn't do that

1607
02:44:43,560 --> 02:44:50,760
you shouldn't say that you shouldn't uh it's very very uh uh uh just very much like please

1608
02:44:50,760 --> 02:44:59,240
please follow my script I guess yeah kind of uh but yeah my about behavior I think you know trans

1609
02:44:59,240 --> 02:45:06,680
women are getting held much higher standard than everyone else you know yeah yeah I think uh

1610
02:45:06,680 --> 02:45:11,560
let's probably agree with that I see I see that kind of you know and like that's you know and like

1611
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:15,480
I wouldn't be surprised if like someone listened to this and then like you know took it out of

1612
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:20,600
context and they're like you know like oh now Mallory's uh you know I see the term contra points

1613
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:30,680
apologist unironically used you know you know and it's yeah it's just like this is just a person

1614
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:38,920
you know like yeah you know and it's like does she deserve to be as popular as she is I don't know

1615
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:44,680
probably not no you know like yeah like yeah you know she's not seeing anything very new

1616
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:50,520
you know um sure you know like I think I think the reason why she got so popular is because like

1617
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:54,280
her videos look cool and they got the cool music and stuff like that you know what I mean

1618
02:45:56,280 --> 02:46:01,800
yeah maybe no for sure for sure it definitely had a part to play although at the very beginning I was

1619
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:08,360
turned off by how extremely feminine it was I was like that's silly but I really got into it afterwards

1620
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:16,200
um but you know it's like but then people get obsessed with like you know with like other

1621
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:20,440
people get to be wrong and then they forget about it right you know but when a trans woman is seen

1622
02:46:20,440 --> 02:46:28,120
as wrong it's like you know like people obsess and obsess and obsess you know um I like I used to

1623
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:33,240
belong to this like group filled with trans women on facebook right you know and there is this one

1624
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:39,720
person in there who got you know popular and but this person was an asshole right you know they

1625
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:46,680
treated they treated people unfairly they were smug they were exclusionary you know they pissed off

1626
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:51,320
a lot of people in the group right you know kind of like you know contra points you know by saying

1627
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:56,120
like being a jackass like contra points you know contra points is jackass sometimes you know I think

1628
02:46:56,120 --> 02:47:01,400
like you know what I mean and uh yeah I think so and you know it's like

1629
02:47:03,400 --> 02:47:09,320
you know other people get to be jackasses and like it's kind of forgiven or forgotten about

1630
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:14,120
you know but like you know this this person in this group you know and like this is like not a huge

1631
02:47:14,120 --> 02:47:18,680
clout thing you know they don't make videos or anything you know people to this day are still

1632
02:47:18,680 --> 02:47:24,360
obsessed with this person being an ass this trans woman being an asshole like people made

1633
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:30,680
separate facebook groups based around talking shit about this trans woman you know who is like

1634
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:36,760
you know and it's like weird like people just get you know and you see it like the kiwi farms

1635
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:43,400
like all the so many people in there are trans women you know that you know get shit on yeah you

1636
02:47:43,400 --> 02:47:49,560
know and uh and we do you know it's like not even um you know it's not just the chuds it's our own

1637
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:57,800
community oftentimes other trans women you know and uh it's you know like the world doesn't like us

1638
02:47:57,800 --> 02:48:05,560
very much you know and I think in turn you know like it makes us not like ourselves and each other

1639
02:48:05,560 --> 02:48:16,520
and it's a big problem you know um damn yeah it's I I haven't felt that quite as much um

1640
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:26,040
I I don't put on a voice but I am trans myself haha um uh I haven't tried I haven't tried changing

1641
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:32,040
my voice to I haven't really tried presenting yet quite new but um oh you're new well congratulations

1642
02:48:32,040 --> 02:48:41,080
on all of that and coming out and stuff hey good for you thank you yeah let's yeah yeah no it wasn't

1643
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:48,040
for the applause I know I mean it's not you think oh you want to like give once a middle you know no

1644
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:53,320
when I first transitioned you know this is like you know I started in the mid-late

1645
02:48:53,320 --> 02:49:02,360
2000s when I you know and like it was before the the tipping point right and like oh like I remember

1646
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:11,720
the time magazine trans tipping point from 2013 or 14 no so I mean okay well basically uh the time

1647
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:16,520
magazine came out with an article about like you know the trans tipping point about how like

1648
02:49:16,520 --> 02:49:21,720
we're like you know we're visible now basically you know we like in popular culture that was

1649
02:49:21,720 --> 02:49:31,320
basically the whole thing you know and so like back then I had no idea how just disliked we were

1650
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:35,800
in general you know and there's like tons of reasons why people dislike us you know like

1651
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:42,600
you know name you know there's it's a whole whole thing you know but I was like naive to all that

1652
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:49,000
right you know um I was just super excited that like I'm like oh my god I get to be myself now

1653
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:54,200
you know and like this is a good thing for me personally and like it's making me a better person

1654
02:49:54,200 --> 02:50:00,360
you know and so like it kind of came as a shock to me that like you know all of a sudden

1655
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:06,920
you know like I wasn't given the benefit of the doubt that I used to get you know

1656
02:50:07,880 --> 02:50:13,800
like in the workplace my work got critiqued you know I I went from employee of the month

1657
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:19,800
to you know like uh getting breathed down my neck all the time that's really nice though yeah you

1658
02:50:19,800 --> 02:50:25,320
know and it's like it's it's so subtle it's hard to talk about you know especially in public

1659
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:30,040
because like a lot of this stuff is subtle right you can't like you can't like point to like one

1660
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:34,760
thing and be like that's it yeah you know it's like people get annoyed with us a lot easier

1661
02:50:35,400 --> 02:50:40,600
you know that's like part of it it's like you know it's just subtle and like even like you know

1662
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:45,640
someone was you know someone who uh I saw on twitter just like uh like a month ago like someone was

1663
02:50:45,640 --> 02:50:50,840
making a joke right about how trans women are annoying you know and like they were trying to

1664
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:55,560
be ironic making fun of how people hate trans women and then like the whole like thread was like

1665
02:50:55,560 --> 02:50:59,800
other trans women be like yeah we're fucking annoying I get why people hate us and it's just

1666
02:50:59,800 --> 02:51:11,160
like oh my god unfortunate you know and I mean there's a lot of like there's a lot of insecurity

1667
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:19,400
about it and you I don't know and well I'm I think it's so when it comes to you know like

1668
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:27,160
you know like uh people who are in the public sphere you know um I that that is more easily

1669
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:33,080
annoyed thing gets you know amplified a lot you know and you know so when someone like

1670
02:51:33,080 --> 02:51:40,920
country points comes around and says some jackass things it like you know people latch onto it and

1671
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:47,800
they don't let go you know and um yeah you know or like you know it's like you know uh

1672
02:51:47,800 --> 02:51:55,560
Mallory hates trans men now and they won't let go you know um and it's it's yeah I don't know I

1673
02:51:55,560 --> 02:52:01,480
I haven't yeah I was gonna say that I hadn't experienced a lot of that towards me although

1674
02:52:01,480 --> 02:52:07,560
I'm thinking about it I have gotten ever so slightly more like shitty twitter replies

1675
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:16,520
um since coming out but mostly positive and it's I guess I'm I'm thankful that I'm such a small

1676
02:52:16,520 --> 02:52:23,560
like internet figure that it doesn't affect me quite as much like if I were to get big I could

1677
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:29,560
I could see it like oh being a bad thing absolutely yeah especially you know like you know just the

1678
02:52:29,560 --> 02:52:34,280
stuff that we were talking here today you know it's like you gave projair the benefit of doubt or

1679
02:52:34,280 --> 02:52:39,320
I forgot who was doing that earlier but like you know just like giving you know these youtubers the

1680
02:52:39,320 --> 02:52:47,080
benefit of the doubt is enough to get like your ass reamed on uh you know twitter you know and um

1681
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:52,040
you know and like what you're you know like when I get some in the benefit of the doubt it's it's

1682
02:52:52,040 --> 02:52:57,160
not like I'm not trying to put them on a pedestal or anything I'm just like trying to be a good person

1683
02:52:57,160 --> 02:53:01,720
you know and like you're trying to be a human being yeah you know it's because like if you think

1684
02:53:01,800 --> 02:53:08,040
about all of this all of the the drama and the things at the end of the day it is people

1685
02:53:08,680 --> 02:53:14,120
who have opinions about other people and other people getting extremely frustrated about that

1686
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:20,440
it's strange and unnatural social behavior that doesn't happen in real life like you don't

1687
02:53:21,080 --> 02:53:25,000
it's impossible to get mad at someone that you don't really know personally

1688
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:31,080
about what they think about someone else except on the internet where it happens all the time

1689
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:40,360
yeah such a strange like it you can easily not do that ever but yeah you don't fall into things

1690
02:53:40,360 --> 02:53:46,520
like that and my thing personally is this like I rather give a piece of garbage you know the

1691
02:53:46,520 --> 02:53:52,360
benefit of the doubt and another chance and another chance and another chance than like you know

1692
02:53:52,360 --> 02:53:59,240
accidentally like condemning and maybe even like you know exiling and just screwing over a person

1693
02:53:59,240 --> 02:54:05,720
who has like is a decent person who has you know good in their heart you know it's like

1694
02:54:07,640 --> 02:54:14,280
you know because that's what happens you know like you know I lost a community because I made a

1695
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:20,600
character shoplift you know in my comic and now like still so ridiculous it's like and that that's

1696
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:27,640
the tipping point for some people that's enough you know and like and it's made me afraid to

1697
02:54:27,640 --> 02:54:32,760
like engage with like other artists you know like uh you know because it's like oh do you think I'm

1698
02:54:32,760 --> 02:54:41,320
a piece of shit or not I have no idea you know um and it sucks because I think you're cool well thank

1699
02:54:41,320 --> 02:54:47,800
you but uh you know what I mean but like I'm a person with needs and and desires and flaws and

1700
02:54:47,800 --> 02:54:55,320
you know and um you know like I need community you know and uh like it's uh you know especially

1701
02:54:55,320 --> 02:55:02,520
during quarantine like so much of our social has been uh constrained to the internet you know and

1702
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:07,400
but like the way we treat each other on the internet is fucking awful you know and I don't

1703
02:55:07,400 --> 02:55:13,880
think enough people are talking about it and uh you know like you know like I think it's gonna

1704
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:20,280
take a lot of work to stop it you know because uh you know like we have to change the way that we

1705
02:55:20,280 --> 02:55:29,160
think about things you know it's a complicated uh puzzle and and and it's also like something that is

1706
02:55:30,680 --> 02:55:37,800
it it would require so much mental and physical energy uh that a single person cannot figure it

1707
02:55:37,800 --> 02:55:44,520
out on their own they've got their own life to live and so like the way it gets sorted is

1708
02:55:45,240 --> 02:55:51,880
it's kind of like even if you think of how to do it how do you make it happen is another thing

1709
02:55:53,240 --> 02:55:57,080
you know you need to dedicate your life to it and it's like I don't want to dedicate my life

1710
02:55:57,080 --> 02:56:02,520
to cleaning up the internet I didn't break anything I didn't make this mess yeah you know I just exist

1711
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:10,200
yeah exactly you know and I think you know like I think we touched a lot of on a lot of the things

1712
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:14,520
that are causing you know like that cloud stuff you know the numbers are in our face and everyone

1713
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:23,160
wants more numbers you know or you know they're mad that like oh this other person is popular not me

1714
02:56:23,160 --> 02:56:29,080
you know or like they're mad that like you know there's this like disagreement and you know like

1715
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:34,360
you know I have no doubt in my mind if certain people listen to this podcast later like we'll

1716
02:56:34,360 --> 02:56:40,840
just like want to cut me off because like I'm I gave Natalie the benefit of the doubt you know

1717
02:56:40,840 --> 02:56:44,280
even though I said I'm not even like a fan or anything you know but I gave her the benefit

1718
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:51,960
of the doubt so I'm done you know yeah and I mean I can imagine that even if like they they listen to

1719
02:56:51,960 --> 02:57:00,520
that the fact that you're on a podcast where we uh like I personally like Natalie and so like

1720
02:57:00,600 --> 02:57:04,520
association like oh how could you be in a podcast with give and take who likes Natalie

1721
02:57:05,640 --> 02:57:11,240
they'd always find a way to make it the bad thing that you did yeah doesn't matter how

1722
02:57:11,240 --> 02:57:17,480
many times you say you know qualified like I'm just saying I'm just saying no they just want to hate

1723
02:57:17,480 --> 02:57:21,480
and the thing is and then but then you go and they turn around it's like no this thing that

1724
02:57:21,480 --> 02:57:29,080
we're complaining about does not even exist you know like it's it's so fucking bizarre and uh

1725
02:57:29,880 --> 02:57:37,400
you know I I uh and so that's why I'm the Joker now I don't care you know I've I've

1726
02:57:39,960 --> 02:57:49,240
I've transitioned to the Joker uh my pronouns are now honk and uh and giggles you know that those

1727
02:57:49,240 --> 02:57:56,600
are you know like you know it's you know so I see why like people get cynical about this

1728
02:57:56,600 --> 02:58:02,280
and then like they turn around and they're like well fuck all y'all you know like um

1729
02:58:03,640 --> 02:58:11,560
you know it's uh yeah it it stinks and I and I and I I want I want something to be done about it

1730
02:58:11,560 --> 02:58:17,800
you know like because uh you know we're looking down the barrel of a really shitty future and

1731
02:58:17,800 --> 02:58:23,800
we need each other you know especially trans people trans people we you know like you know

1732
02:58:23,800 --> 02:58:30,840
because like the larger left they're you know like they're sick of us you know um you know

1733
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:39,240
we need each other you know uh and uh like like saying that you know like like this one person

1734
02:58:39,240 --> 02:58:44,520
aids bisexual people uh you know and it's you know and that's another thing too you know I have like

1735
02:58:44,520 --> 02:58:50,200
all my content creator friends like they all of them unanimously you know like anyone listening

1736
02:58:50,200 --> 02:58:57,880
to this like you know everyone is afraid of you know like this thing happening to them also you

1737
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:03,320
know like having their own community come after them and rip them apart and take away you know what

1738
02:59:03,320 --> 02:59:11,720
little like you know like uh you know um you know because like people make you know uh you know

1739
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:17,320
some of their income is based on you know the content they create you know and that could go bye

1740
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:23,880
bye like that you know um if you know you say if you say some jackass stuff and the apology

1741
02:59:23,880 --> 02:59:31,480
isn't good enough you know yeah I don't know I feel like to to to worry so much about the

1742
02:59:31,480 --> 02:59:40,120
possibility of it happening is it's it's almost part of the problem because if if you know like

1743
02:59:40,120 --> 02:59:45,480
you're saying like people stopped associating with you now that you're cancelled if they

1744
02:59:45,480 --> 02:59:49,800
didn't stop associating with you and if that wasn't a thing then cancel culture wouldn't feel

1745
02:59:49,800 --> 02:59:56,280
like it has any weight anyway and then you would still you know people would stand by things rather

1746
02:59:56,280 --> 03:00:03,400
than hype like angry hype which is what it feels like yeah you know sort of snowballs out of control

1747
03:00:03,400 --> 03:00:09,560
and people don't really they don't really take the time to like think about what it what it all

1748
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:14,760
spawned from they're just like oh I don't want to get hurt I'm just gonna go with whatever everyone

1749
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:19,880
else is saying yeah yeah exactly you know and that's the thing you know like I don't think I'm

1750
03:00:19,880 --> 03:00:24,200
entitled to an audience or anything you know I never wanted to be popular I just wanted to be part

1751
03:00:24,200 --> 03:00:33,720
of the fucking group you know what I mean and um like uh you know but this like weird demonization

1752
03:00:33,720 --> 03:00:41,000
of individuals in our in our groups that that you know barely did anything wrong or was just

1753
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:48,280
being kind of a jackass you know um it's it sucks and I don't like it especially you know

1754
03:00:48,280 --> 03:00:57,240
because it keeps happening to me over and over again you know right uh well I mean we live in

1755
03:00:57,240 --> 03:01:05,000
hell so you know I you know and part of I invite some of it too because like I said you know I'm

1756
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:12,760
way too genuine and vulnerable on the internet which I probably shouldn't do but I can't help it

1757
03:01:12,760 --> 03:01:18,760
because like I you know I had a lot of bad things happen to me in my life and I just you know I'm like

1758
03:01:20,600 --> 03:01:26,920
you know I just don't care anymore and I just like I'm sick of like feeling ashamed of like

1759
03:01:26,920 --> 03:01:33,000
you know my background and stuff so I have to talk about it yeah but you know probably

1760
03:01:33,640 --> 03:01:38,760
pales in comparison to when we all got called ugly on Twitter today uh so

1761
03:01:39,400 --> 03:01:45,080
oh ugly did you guys did you guys see the the the tweet that I made or it was a YouTube comment

1762
03:01:45,800 --> 03:01:50,840
what on on the on the Jennifer Diane writes lecture someone left a comment that said

1763
03:01:50,840 --> 03:01:55,400
nearly everyone in that room is grotesque and not lucky with the opposite sex

1764
03:01:55,400 --> 03:01:58,920
yet people take them seriously internet is very strange

1765
03:01:58,920 --> 03:02:03,320
wow okay

1766
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:10,760
grotesque all right no I'm none of you are grotesque

1767
03:02:12,120 --> 03:02:19,720
and not lucky with the opposite sex so there you go two things you really shouldn't be

1768
03:02:19,720 --> 03:02:27,880
if you uh if you know if you can help it I I think okay I'm sorry I don't want to cut off but I do

1769
03:02:27,880 --> 03:02:33,160
I think we gotta kind of wrap it up yeah it's been a while because I have to I have to go and

1770
03:02:33,160 --> 03:02:40,120
compete in a pokemon tournament oh yeah pokemon pixel moon minecraft in an hour and 40 minutes um

lot about internet that's fine that's good that's good it's good good all all good content for the

1864
03:13:48,520 --> 03:13:56,600
and i said i got fuck it i'm i'm out and then the rest was history the secret the secret tragic

1865
03:13:56,600 --> 03:14:05,560
backstory down everyone is just fucking everyone's dropping dead margaret samurai we need some

1866
03:14:05,560 --> 03:14:14,440
beautiful colorful characters who will be next who who will rise to take the throne next next

1867
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:22,280
voicemail cross y'all we're talking about circumcision three two one go okay the definition of mutilation

1868
03:14:22,280 --> 03:14:26,200
is cutting off or causing injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is

1869
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:31,080
permanently damaged detached or disfigured so circumcision does fit the definition of mutilation

1870
03:14:31,080 --> 03:14:35,480
but so does getting your ears pierced also just going to add that considering the extremely negative

1871
03:14:35,480 --> 03:14:39,320
connotation that the word mutilate has it probably wouldn't fill you with confidence to hear people

1872
03:14:39,320 --> 03:14:43,240
use that word when talking about your genitals it is permanent disfigurement but it doesn't really

1873
03:14:43,240 --> 03:14:47,880
have any noteworthy downsides and the few cons that it does have are barely worth mentioning true

1874
03:14:47,880 --> 03:14:51,960
foreskin does function as a natural lubricant but it doesn't really make a huge difference and while

1875
03:14:51,960 --> 03:14:56,520
lube is a product that you have to pay for it does exist and even if you have foreskin you'd be an

1876
03:14:56,520 --> 03:15:00,760
idiot not to use it the foreskin also has a lot of nerve endings which assumedly makes sex more

1877
03:15:00,760 --> 03:15:04,680
pleasurable but again it doesn't seem to make a huge difference and we can't ignore the sizable

1878
03:15:04,680 --> 03:15:08,840
chunk of biological males who suffer from premature ejaculation which if the whole nerve

1879
03:15:08,840 --> 03:15:12,920
ending thing is true circumcision would slightly reduce the effects of also ben talked about

1880
03:15:12,920 --> 03:15:17,640
circumcision slightly reducing the rates of stds and it being cleaner overall which is technically

1881
03:15:17,640 --> 03:15:21,880
true but the reason that's the case is because if you don't wash an uncut versus a cut penis

1882
03:15:21,880 --> 03:15:26,200
the uncut penis will get dirtier just by virtue of having surface area that the shower water

1883
03:15:26,200 --> 03:15:30,840
isn't touching a properly washed uncut penis is just as clean as a properly washed cut penis

1884
03:15:30,840 --> 03:15:34,280
it's just that some people are retarded and don't wash their dick and the effects of that are more

1885
03:15:34,280 --> 03:15:39,880
prevalent in uncircumcised penises conclusion all of the pros and cons of circumcision are negligible

1886
03:15:39,880 --> 03:15:44,200
it literally is less impactful on a baby's life than getting their ears pierced if a couple wants

1887
03:15:44,200 --> 03:15:49,320
to circumcise their kid that's fine if not that's just as fine it doesn't matter who gives a fuck

1888
03:15:49,560 --> 03:16:03,080
um i feel like that's true i feel like that's fair i just i just there's the there's um

1889
03:16:04,760 --> 03:16:12,120
like that's all like medical and and like pros and cons like to have or to have not

1890
03:16:12,200 --> 03:16:18,760
an uncut or cut penis um but i would still have the extra argument of

1891
03:16:19,560 --> 03:16:27,480
fuck you mom and dad you don't get to do anything to me yeah i mean i you know i agree and honestly

1892
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:31,640
like if i had a kid i probably wouldn't circumcise him because like yeah why is it up to me

1893
03:16:31,640 --> 03:16:41,800
yeah so true truth true next up we were right three two one go

1894
03:17:01,880 --> 03:17:05,880
everyone's gonna acknowledge that we're right in a few years once they bring gilgamesh back to life

and insurrect him as god of the new world order all right uh screencap this post

1896
03:17:16,120 --> 03:17:19,800
i don't know what that is in reference to is that is that supposed to be that they

voicemails smiley face three two one go hey there pcb this is my review of the voicemails from the

1910
03:18:53,880 --> 03:18:58,600
center perspective it's a cool and vault way to interact with some of my favorite per social

1911
03:18:58,600 --> 03:19:04,280
personalities it gets me playing good recording my own voice and editing and audacity which is great

1912
03:19:04,280 --> 03:19:09,080
a bad part is i can't fucking read so i need post production and voice meter and audio channels are

1913
03:19:09,080 --> 03:19:13,400
a nightmare having voice meter installed made me feel like i might as well send a voicemail every

1914
03:19:13,400 --> 03:19:19,640
week because of some cost lse of keeping it installed so i'm sent some really shitty voicemails in

1915
03:19:19,640 --> 03:19:25,160
uncreative states of mind it feels great to hear my own voice in the show and to make you guys laugh

1916
03:19:25,160 --> 03:19:30,520
and it stings when my emails are so bad they're literally getting skipped through or cut two things

1917
03:19:30,520 --> 03:19:36,520
for are for certain it is not a place for meaningful or nuanced discussion because of the one-sided

1918
03:19:36,520 --> 03:19:42,520
nature of it two parasocialism is a hell of a drug but it is not a viable replacement for meaningful

1919
03:19:42,520 --> 03:19:47,080
social interaction with actual friends or loved ones overall score 709 pretty good

1920
03:19:48,760 --> 03:19:50,600
bazinga that sounds about right

1921
03:19:53,880 --> 03:20:00,920

1929
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:55,800
three two one go what do you guys think of amvs i made one in high school it was uh i made a fully

1930
03:20:55,800 --> 03:21:07,320
coolly amv how i set it to uh um set modus but modus mouse song float on float on by modus mouse

1931

like physical tape like on vhs ships yeah yeah because we had that we had a um an av like production

1933
03:21:21,880 --> 03:21:26,760
class and like it was like make a video like cut tapes together and we had equipment for that

1934
03:21:26,760 --> 03:21:33,960
and so like i made it as a class assignment and uh yeah yeah that's how i did it that's very based

1935
03:21:33,960 --> 03:21:40,840
i would like to see i i wish i wish i still had it i wonder if it's in like some attic somewhere

03:21:55,560 --> 03:22:00,200
three two one go ben are you found because i found someone else so perfectly balanced between

1939
03:22:00,200 --> 03:22:04,280
base and cranes every time you do say something base you have to follow up with some dumb shit too

1940
03:22:04,280 --> 03:22:07,480
usual times in the last episode but the left half are language swap but you've been saying

1941
03:22:07,480 --> 03:22:10,920
say things in the most authority way possible like previously gone biologically six you just

1942
03:22:10,920 --> 03:22:15,160
say it doesn't exist you can't say i'll call reframing my idea of biologically six it's no

1943
03:22:15,160 --> 03:22:19,080
a six could possibly a more broader spectrum or something but instead you phrase it in the

1944
03:22:19,080 --> 03:22:22,840
worst way possible and don't follow up you constantly do this and when i think you finally

1945
03:22:22,840 --> 03:22:27,400
get your political shit together you go down a new avatar system dumb shit about the circumcision

1946
03:22:27,400 --> 03:22:34,120

1948
03:22:41,480 --> 03:22:47,000
you say something based and then you say you follow with something cringe and how dare you

1949
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:55,320

1950
03:22:55,320 --> 03:23:01,960
