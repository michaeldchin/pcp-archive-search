261
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:57,160
That is me and no, I did not know that with that I see I feel that this is the big difference maker

262
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,400
And this is the big meta thing that it is a huge

263
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,880
This is which because like and then the the the vessel there with that's where your choices don't matter

264
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,560
But that's because you're not that's that's exactly him

265
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,080
Because the vessel took you the player out of the equation by ripping out the soul aka hearts putting in the cage

266
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
So

267
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:29,800
The fact that that is there and the things that that imply I feel that's going to be what Delta rune is about like agency of players

268
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,120
Surely we'll know one day. I hope one day. I hope to know what I can't wait to play this one

269
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:42,040
I'm 40 and really finally get the answer to this question. Well, we'll get on PCP episode. What let me just let me just ask you guys this

270
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,880
Everybody does that make a big difference to you. Does that it make you well?

271
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,280
It gives me hope about makes it encourages me that there is more going on here

272
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,080
Yeah, I want to tell you and because Tom brought up the the YA thing

273
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:02,840
Cuz like a big part of the discussion we were having when we were playing this game is that I kept calling it like youth fiction that like

274
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,640
I was comparing it to like Harry Potter and like that level of very childish

275
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:16,280
Characterization and theming and I didn't mean this as an insult to Toby Fox's

276
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,760
Inspiration because I feel like this is a game that he probably wrote that dude's youngest fuck, right?

277
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,520
Like how old is 25 maybe now or something? I don't know. Yes. So so at yeah

278
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,840
2012 that he wrote this he's a he's a baby, you know and like this game feels like

279
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,000
someone who's

280
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,120
Trying to express his very personal experiences the fact that the the the big

281
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,520
Wham line the arc words of this game are quiet people piss me off

282
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,200
Is that what it is? Your choices don't matter is like the I mean

283
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,920
That line is repeated twice. It's repeated. Yeah, several times

284
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,720
It has said quiet people piss me off first by Susie and then by I think yeah and both at very important moments, you know big dramatic

285
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,720
pulls and

286
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,440
this is

287
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
This is clearly a game about

288
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,640
Otherness about being like an outcast Susie is this character is very angry about the fact not that she

289
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,080
That that people don't accept her for being who she is, you know that she she thinks everyone's already drawn their conclusions about her before

290
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:34,760
They meet her that like I think Toby was very inspired to make this game based on his experiences as a human

291
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
You know clearly this is a game

292
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,960
You fucking take one look at Toby Fox. Obviously. He's a quiet fucking nerdy motherfucker who's been bullied his whole life

293
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,240
So like this game means something to him. I'm sure never

294
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,120
but like but also I

295
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,040
Feel like when I looked at this game

296
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,720
I saw Toby trying to work through something like trying to work through his past and get this off of his chest finally

297
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,600
But he's doing it in a very

298
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:09,280
Basic and generic way and I don't even mean that as an insult like sure. Let's find it's it's well

299
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,840
Constructed. He's telling the story as well as any other youth novelist would it's as good as Harry Potter

300
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,960
I'm 27. I don't need to read fucking Harry Potter. All right. Let's get into that. This is what I care about most of all

301
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,200
Okay, what made Undertale one of my favorite games of all time. I played Ben turned me on to the demo. He just said it's great

302
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:34,400
Nate go play it. I said, okay, I play it. I'm fighting Toriel. I get the and I killer and I get a bad ending

303
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,160
I'm like, okay, I'm gonna try this again and not killer. See what happens. I spare Toriel this time

304
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,120
And Flowey tells me like lol, you think you can just like not killer. I remember what you did

305
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:49,680
I'm like, what what what are you talking about? I and you know and then like whatever I do a pacifist run

306
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,960
I see that everything changes. I do a genocide run and I see that

307
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,040
Oh my god this and it really it was the genocide run when the demo came out

308
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,560
That was the thing that made me think wow, this game is not afraid to go there. This is bold

309
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,200
This is creative. I've never seen this done in this way before

310
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,760
This could be and at that point I was truly excited and had no I did not think for a second

311
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,840
It was going to be as good as my expectations were and then it was better than them

312
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,400
Because it it did as much as you could do with that concept and I personally love the moment-to-moment

313
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,200
Like world exploration of undertale. I love all the flavor

314
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,600
I love the fact that there's an ultra mega secret boss. You can fight if you do a bunch of you know

315
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,280
Genocidal shit. It's so fun for me. I love that game

316
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:42,840
But the thing that made undertale so great was the degree of choice you have and like your own

317
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,440
Responsibility for your choices now

318
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,800
I current once I discovered that you can move the heart thing at the end after you know

319
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,400
Kara rips it out or what at Chris Bessel whatever that implies to me

320
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,760
Okay, Toby is smarter than me and he has things planned this man made undertale

321
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,560
I'm not going to under a smarter than you but at least yeah smart enough to appeal to you

322
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,720
I think okay playing this demo. Yeah, I feel like there is potential for this game to be better than undertale

323
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:18,520
There's just so much more going on that like if he if he did to this game what he did to undertale

324
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,560
It will be better, but it's just a matter of like we don't know that yet because it's a fucking demo

325
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,760
You know, see I completely agree and I think you're right and frankly. I'm more scared now that this game

326
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,320
I mean my my expectations were so high for undertale and it bet them

327
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,960
I don't like is it possible to do that twice in a row? Oh god. I don't know but more importantly than that

328
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,640
The the main conceit of the undertale demo

329
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,440
I understood and couldn't and was like this is the coolest thing I've ever seen

330
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:52,120
The conceit of this demo is that your choices don't matter and I know he'll subvert it in some way

331
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,040
But like what so I played through the game a second time doing it effectively a genocide run and I was disgusted

332
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,760
I had heard this and I tested to see I think I know what you're gonna say

333
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,880
Literally you have the ability to do a genocide run in

334
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,400
In undertale in the demo and the fact you could was amazing and incredible

335
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,400
I loved it you don't even have any of those kind of option like when what I when I played through the first time

336
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,920
I was like, oh man, I have to this is a creative thing Susie who's a member of my team

337
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,520
I have to prevent her from killing enemies to get the pacifist run by far the coolest thing by far

338
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Absolutely the best thing about the game and then I played a quote-unquote genocide run and found I couldn't even kill people when I tried to and

339
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,680
Was like well that just completely invalidated all the effort I put in in my fucking pacifist run and I was

340
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Like that was a terrible betrayal to me of

341
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,160
What I hoped the consequences of my actions to be Rob me of agency which is why it's extra weird

342
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,280
Yeah, that afterwards Toby puts out this statement

343
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:02,840
That's like I hope people don't play this game with the expectation that it'll be like undertale that might ruin your experience with it

344
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,840
Why didn't you fucking say so? I

345
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,680
It doesn't matter if it's a sequel to undertale or not the fact that the game itself sets this up

346
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:17,200
But it turns out it's just not an issue or it's like putting in QTE elements in a game that you can lose and you still win

347
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,200
That's what it is

348
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:27,600
Defense it worked and it did get me to play the game worried about like, you know stopping Susie from hurting people

349
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:36,920
Even though even though it turned out upon review that it was a trick and I did not actually have to worry about it at all

350
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,240
Can you quickly explain for the viewers?

351
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,720
Okay, me what happens when you try to do genocide run because I want to do that

352
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,800
I'll be happy to but I just did bug fixes for my game instead because I'm gay

353
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,960
I hear your brother. There was literally one difference doing a genocide run versus a pure 100% pacifist run and it is this

354
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,120
It is that at the end when all the characters when you're fighting the king at the end when you're like, oh, we can't kill this guy

355
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,800
What are we gonna do and then the enemies come and they like pick up the king and they take him away?

356
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,040
Like it you know friendship saves the day instead of that what you get is a scene at the end where

357
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,260
It's actually interesting

358
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,680
The what happens is instead of the king being carried away by enemies

359
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:25,600
What happens is Susie has over the course of the game has learned that pacify spell that Rawl say knows and

360
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,180
Casts that spell upon the king and he's really tired. So he gets pacified

361
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,160
That is the only difference. He learns it and doesn't just ask

362
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,060
I am 100% sure because I played it and that is what is stated by the characters. Yes

363
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:47,260
It's so for some reason the difference between these two is that I feel like she just remembered that Ralsei can cast it

364
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:52,180
So she asked him to cast it. Well, I have played the game and that is not what happened

365
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:58,180
So, I mean let me know how can you be 100% sure that you wait mage did you do this run?

366
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
I watched I watched

367
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,460
Dab dab dab dab. Yeah, that's what I thought. It's still it's still words Nate that I could read so, you know

368
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,060
Yeah, so you you're just saying that I'm wrong. I'll go check. I'll go fucking check right now

369
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:16,380
I'm just saying that we might be interpreting the same line in different ways, and I'm not sure which one is correct

370
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,740
I'm gonna prove it right now

371
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,620
Nate did this seem ambiguous to you at all. No, not at all

372
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,980
Changes there's actually two changes, but one is significantly smaller the second one. There's a secret boss

373
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,100
and

374
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:37,580
Yeah, and during the the pacifist route it turns into an armor, but it during the genocide run so to speak it turns into a

375
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,640
What then so the secret boss by the way is great and one of the best characters and

376
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:50,420
I just I want to say that you you you let you literally can't kill it like anything like you cannot kill anything

377
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:55,420
If you watch if you watch they do not die if you hurt them if you get them under zero HP

378
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:01,140
They like zip off screen like they're running away, right? But but can you what happens if you don't stop?

379
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,500
Susie from doing things just the same thing they just run away

380
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:12,260
They they get down to zero HP and and then they run away because that's what happens like mechanically that sucks

381
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,180
Okay, quickly. I just people are theorizing and I

382
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,700
Know what they're basing it off and it could be like completely wrong and I don't blame it

383
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,900
It's just an interesting theory

384
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,980
I just thought about is that darkers actually bleed and it could be because and the reason they run away is because

385
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:33,780
Toby Fox or whatever they're trying to hide the fact that they actually do bleed which is not common for monsters of

386
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,300
At least the lightings

387
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,020
What is that implying is that implying anything about?

388
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,260
Anything I

389
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,740
Don't know about it. It's just because at some point

390
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:51,580
Lancer Lancer. Yeah, Lancer brings up a bucket. It's like oh to mop up the blood that you're gonna

391
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:56,620
God, I can't wait for like a week now for Matt Pat to come in and explain all this for me

392
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:01,820
So I can understand it. Yeah, I did my due diligence. God damn it. I know everything there is to know

393
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,860
I just it's just I mean, I'm not saying it's true, but it's interesting theory

394
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,140
I mean, there might be a reason why you can I think it's pretty weak

395
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:14,040
I don't that seems pretty weak. It was a strange choice to have Kara literally break into the

396
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,520
Da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba Fortnite dance at the end of the game. That was an odd

397
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:27,600
Animation so I want to jump into something a little bit here that like my biggest hope for a final version of this game is that I

398
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:36,800
Recently have been on this kick where I'm talking about how media can basically broke it be broken into two categories

399
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,520
stuff that is about

400
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,440
Exploring the self and stuff. That's about exploring society

401
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,560
like

402
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:52,520
Every story is either about a man trying to come to grips with understanding himself well man or woman, obviously, but you know

403
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,080
I say man broadly or trying to come to grips a society around them and like

404
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:04,000
Informulate different opinions and different perspectives into one thing and when you look back at Undertale even though it has

405
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,640
It's about a

406
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,840
It's about one individual and how they slot into society

407
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,640
It's like are you someone who's a protector or a sociopath like where do you fit in but with this game?

408
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:24,360
Because you have a party of three and who knows how many more in the final game could be our teammates could be more

409
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,560
More to explore with this party system

410
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,600
It feels like this is almost

411
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,920
Spiritually a sequel which is why it's kind of weird even that this was like thought of before Undertale supposedly

412
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,600
You know, I don't I can't say I know the chronology of thoughts and Toby Fox's mind

413
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,280
But nonetheless at this game feels spiritually like a sequel to Undertale

414
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,240
Just in that there's three people in your party and that

415
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:01,160
Literally core to the mechanics is how those three people interact that like you can warn enemies about when this girl's gonna attack and the entire

416
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:06,640
Demo as soon as I knew that I was just like when is that other guy

417
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,920
rat res

418
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:16,680
I'll say I'll say when is Ralsei going to get mad at Susie. Yes for attacking and Toby's way too good a game designer to

419
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,960
Not do something interesting with Ralsei as a party member at some point

420
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,840
Yeah, like I knew that scene was coming because I was like well your character is not gonna do it

421
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:30,440
But like the fact that she's doing this is a problem. It has to be wrong brought up at some point

422
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,360
Ralsei's gonna get upset at her

423
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,320
He's gonna accost her for this the way she's been acting and like that's a very basic childish kind of

424
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,480
You know

425
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,120
black and white way of looking at it like either you spare him or you or you don't but

426
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:52,920
Surely there's more depth to it and the game then steps into the gray area of like what if there's an enemy you have to kill

427
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,680
You you don't actually you can just spare the fucking

428
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,240
final boss

429
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:05,400
All the way, but like obviously that's the next step forward, but then it's like well if this is all explored in chapter one

430
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:12,120
Surely there's even more you can do with this. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Will this game ever get made?

431
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:19,400
Okay, okay, so what since choices don't matter and you're forced into a pacifist route in the chapter one so far

432
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,800
Yeah, so far. Yeah. Yeah. What if you're forced into a genocide route in chapter two

433
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,600
Potentially that'll be fucking crazy. I mean, yeah, that'd be interesting. That'd be interesting

434
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,760
It seems like you know, it's setting it up because you know of the whole ending thing

435
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,920
I honestly have a lot of faith in toby as a character designer

436
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,280
So, you know, frankly, I'm I'm happy to sit back and say

437
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,600
You know, maybe I can't imagine all the ways to do interesting things with these mechanics

438
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,400
But I feel like there is enough material here to work with

439
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,240
That he can definitely come up with something and that thing again with like the moving heart at the end

440
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:56,360
Which is the physical manifestation of the theme that like your control can be wrestled from your choices don't matter

441
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,440
It's a video game. Ah, the only way to win is not to play. Ah, you could definitely

442
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,840
You know pull up pull a spec ops the line sort of thing with that or something the way and uh

443
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,480
My position basically I've been wanting to say this but I kept forgetting

444
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,960
Just I don't think toby fox can

445
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,600
Disappoint me. I'm at this point

446
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,640
It's just like because the reason I like undertone and I like delta rune is because it has the toby fox flare

447
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,560
It has his sort of like a quirky humor and just the little

448
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:30,760
Sort of things without in like for instance when I got jailed in in delta room and I ate the moss and I put the shackles on

449
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,320
And I'll say commented on it. I found it so funny. It was like you're like you could eat the moss

450
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,960
Yeah, you can eat the moss and then so I didn't know yeah, and the susie says like oh, you didn't even leave any for me

451
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,200
There's so much love and I love his artistic voice

452
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,160
So that's that is a lot agreed a hundred percent

453
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,800
So because it was it's a toby fox game

454
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,440
I don't think he can disappoint me to the extent where I would be

455
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,400
Upset about it. Even if it's the game is not as great as undertale. It was or you know mage

456
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,840
That's that makes a lot of sense

457
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,600
I I guess it's just fair to state that like some people have different hopes and expectations for what you know

458
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,400
This game may or may not be in terms of like mechanical complexity. I mean, I sure have some high hopes about that

459
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:15,720
I think a lot of people will enjoy delta rune for same reasons why they might have enjoyed undertale

460
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,760
And that is I wouldn't say surface level because that's an inherently derogatory sort of like

461
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Oh, you're just enjoying it on the surface level

462
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:29,160
But I just mean the art the visuals and the sort of dialogue that you hear from the players

463
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,240
I think a lot of people will enjoy it

464
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,880
You're solely based on those aesthetics and the voice of toby as you said

465
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,960
Yeah, and I personally had absolutely no issue with it being an alternate universe because I like seeing the characters that I love

466
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,640
Living their happy little lives in but they aren't the characters you love. They're different. That's true. I know

467
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,720
I mean, they're wearing their skin

468
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,600
Well, it's called. Well, it's called. I mean, I called it an alternate universe for a reason

469
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,680
It's you're not the exact same characters, but there's like they look the same

470
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,520
But it's a different universe where they didn't have to go through the whole

471
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,160
Nonstance that they had to go through

472
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:11,560
So I still think it's interesting to see characters who look exactly like other characters that you've read and you know

473
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,360
Got to bond with except now they're different and sly and sometimes well

474
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,480
Luckily, that's a very small portion of the game that you don't need to worry about that much because the rest of the game is different

475
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,560
Don't don't confuse me

476
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,800
I with with other people here. I'm not saying I'm not saying that this is a large complaint from me

477
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,280
I don't even think it's really a huge complaint. I am more so on the camp that I just think it's weird

478
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,360
I don't really get where it's coming from. It's not

479
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,320
Odd curiosity that's that's that's where my beginning and end of that comes from

480
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,800
um, I think oh

481
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,120
sorry, I thought I was fucking mouthful, but

482
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,320
Get that dick out of your mouth digi

483
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,720
Take the words out of my mouth. I love dick

484
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,200
uh

485
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,560
The thing about it for me and the reason I've been so emphatic about

486
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:04,760
Why I wish he would have said something is that I don't mind that it's the same characters because

487
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,800
I feel like I totally get that as somebody who um, like mage said earlier has

488
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,280
Has a stable of character. So I've tried to put in a lot of different stories because

489
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,920
I look at it as that

490
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
generally with artists

491
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,840
Your characters all represent a part of your psyche

492
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:29,400
Like most of the characters that you write are bound to represent something about yourself some way that you think like

493
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,520
I tend to look at a cast of characters

494
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,880
It's like if you are a prism through which a beam of light is being cast then

495
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,120
You know all the characters are the different colors that are refracted through that prism

496
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,200
um

497
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:49,720
So like and generally when you look at an artist's work you can often say like oh this character

498
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,960
It's just an xb for that character, you know to use tv tropes terminology

499
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,320
um

500
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:01,240
So rather than create like major saying rather than create a character who everyone's just going to say

501
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:07,880
Oh, this is just the sands of this game. Just use sands again. He's the best representation of that part of your mind and like

502
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,440
Undertale is already a universe that allows for so much that he could

503
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,440
Like portray these characters as best. Maybe he imagines them

504
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:17,960
um

505
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,160
So like that part of it. I feel like it wouldn't have even been a

506
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,800
A fraction of a question in anyone's mind had he just said from the start

507
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,200
It's an alternate universe guys

508
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,400
Undertale doesn't matter and like I guess nobody would have said a damn thing. I I mean

509
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,480
I'm slightly with Nate here. I mean pretty Nate with I'm pretty with Nate here

510
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:43,560
I didn't really think like I just assumed it was an alternate timeline and that it wouldn't really like I

511
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,240
I could instantly tell this isn't a sequel in the sense that this is

512
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,680
I don't I wasn't expecting it was a sequel

513
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,400
It's just that it's clearly an alternate timeline

514
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,880
But without knowing distinctly because toby fox says in his tweet longer

515
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,600
Like don't worry about your ending to undertale

516
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:07,160
Everybody in undertale is fine and that's that's not affected by actually they're they're exactly as dead or alive as you left them

517
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Right, right exactly exactly

518
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:16,120
So so like uh, they're they're fine either living their lives are dead and buried like you left them, you know, that's that's that's fine

519
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,720
but

520
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,320
Because I understood that they were alternate universes. My question was this okay. How is this connected?

521
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,760
But if I had read that tweet before I'm like, oh, it's not connected

522
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:32,280
They're just the same and that that changes how you think about them. Now again, this is a tiny complaint

523
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,320
I don't know why we're focusing so much not about it, but like that's my position

524
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:42,280
That's because it's it's weirdly fascinating because it's just the fact that look it's not even that like playing this game

525
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,720
I thought it's not that I thought it was a sequel or a prequel

526
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,000
It's not that I thought it would have relevance to the actual story of undertale

527
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,840
It's that when you see these characters it makes you think that the game will be like

528
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,000
Undertale that it will like like like ben said we spent the whole game waiting for the other shoe to drop

529
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,960
And if he came out and said it's not like undertale, you wouldn't have been waiting for that

530
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:11,160
You wouldn't have been thinking. Oh, it has to have it has to be meta. It has to be crazy

531
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,440
I mean that heart moving thing at the end is kind of that shoe dropping

532
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,400
If it is, I mean that could very well be but like he even says

533
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,440
In the tweet longer like I don't think I'll ever be able to make you feel that way again

534
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,040
And I don't know how much of that is him being humble or literal like it's impossible to know before we get full day

535
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:36,520
I was waiting for I was waiting for a moment like when flowery suddenly flowery's face changes and suddenly he's attacking you

536
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,360
And you realize that like you've been tricked. I mean I was waiting for that like

537
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,760
The whole game

538
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:48,360
Or something the notion of whatever like lack of control whatever you your choice don't matter

539
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Sounds to me just like a bad game

540
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,200
But I just believe that's why I think I think he must

541
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,600
Subvert it like that's not a theme like that's not a theme that is like

542
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,480
A game where your choices don't impact the ending like let's explore that like what no, that's dumb

543
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,960
Like that's that's one of those uh jokes on you

544
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,120
I was just pretending to be retarded

545
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,320
The reason why I'm so fascinated with this relation to undertale and the fact he uses themed characters

546
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:23,480
Is because even though I now know after reading the tweet longer the somewhat the quality the chronology

547
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,480
Of you know, it was delta and then came undertale and you know delta was first

548
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:34,680
It feels on the surface of it and I'm really I'm crazy for this as a sort of you know marketing corporate thing

549
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,120
You know I'm making a new game, but undertale is really popular

550
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,800
Let me put in the old characters. So it'll spread the word around like hey

551
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,920
Stay today. Hey Steve. Did you hear that sands is back sands is back

552
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,040
I say dropping all of my groceries to run home pretty good for that though. The fact that literally was planned this way

553
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,400
I understand. Okay. That's what like again. Why why would you start talking if I'm still in the middle of my point?

554
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:03,960
Why why would you do that? I'm sorry? It's just that waking up in the bed that the last game ended in is just like

555
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,640
You didn't have the same bed though. I'm not even talking about that

556
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:12,680
I'm saying that it just is interesting the fact that this came first even though on the surface

557
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,080
I would think that it was a marketing thing and now the fact now that that has taken away from me

558
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,360
I am just confused at the point of him doing it like this now that we that it's revealed like oh, yeah

559
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,400
Like he's really into this. He just really likes having the same characters there

560
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,360
I know what you're all saying like oh, it's fun to see characters in a different life

561
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,200
But I just don't resonate with that whatsoever. I think it's extremely confusing

562
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:37,320
I'm saying the same thing as you like there's no reason it had to be this confusing like

563
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,160
Literally if it had started in any other way

564
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:46,120
Then that undertale ends with you being tucked in by toriel and

565
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:52,920
Delta rune opens with you being woken up by toriel if it opened in any other way

566
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,720
It would have been a thousand times less confusing

567
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,040
Chris which is a new name

568
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,480
Not even the one it is fucking totally irrelevant to the fact that it's like you could do

569
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:10,840
Anything else you could do anything else you could start off in a forest you can start off in a city

570
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:16,440
You can start off anywhere other than a bed being woken up by the character who tucked you in at the end of the last game

571
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:22,680
And it wouldn't have been as confusing. I get it. I think that it's pretty minor like because again

572
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,200
Frisk has a canon name and chris also has a canon name and they're not the same name

573
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,360
The fact that it ends

574
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,720
Okay, maybe this is just a way that that my mind works

575
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,120
But like if you're gonna do

576
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,240
Parallelism if you're going to do a juxtapit like if you're gonna do the same fucking scene

577
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:47,720
That the last game ended on as the start of your game. You're making a statement there. Are these intentional?

578
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,800
Or is this just the way toby fox writes his undertale games?

579
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,920
No, it's intentional. He definitely wanted you to be confused by the start of this game

580
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,480
That's why he put out don't anybody talk about it for the first 24 hours guys

581
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:08,680
Nobody spoil anything even though it's irrelevant to the original game. There is nothing to spoil in this fucking thing

582
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,760
That was another point I wanted to make it's very weird that on the main site of delt ruin

583
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:17,640
It says this is an experience for people who have finished undertale yet undertale has no but rare

584
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:25,000
Relevance to this story whatsoever. Well, I mean there is the asriel reveal. That's that's not even a reveal

585
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,880
It

586
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,240
This game has literally no

587
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:36,120
Well, if you have no connection to undertale then the fact that we recognize the face of that character like wouldn't make sense

588
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:43,240
It wouldn't first okay first of all we don't because we've never seen that sprite before we can kind of infer that it's probably asriel

589
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,600
I think

590
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,120
What having what having okay?

591
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,600
If this is an experience for people who have finished undertale

592
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,080
Then I think that what that must mean is that like if you finished undertale

593
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,920
You will surely recognize that ralse is an anagram of asriel

594
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,840
And you will probably guess that he is asriel before the end of the game

595
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,120
And then when he takes off the mask you'd be like, oh, yep. Mm-hmm

596
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,640
Um, even though that makes no sense based on the other things that the other characters say you will

597
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:14,440
That will probably I mean, that's it. That's like the only real connection to undertale that I can see

598
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:20,040
Okay, I have and even that is confused and I and I feel like I can't even speak any further on it because I clearly

599
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,120
Missing information do you think do you think the point of all this stuff?

600
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,840
Because now now that nade has told me you can move the heart at the end at the end of the game

601
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,480
Is all of this meant for the player?

602
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,640
Right like like I mean, of course it is but what I mean to say is that

603
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,040
Everything that's happening like the reveal of taking off as like, oh, it looks like asriel

604
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,760
That's for you everything that happening in universe like it's not addressed, right?

605
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,040
And then at the end of the game it's like, oh, you're just the heart the character

606
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:52,040
You're playing as isn't you in this world the world's just happening

607
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:58,360
And you're along for the ride and that's why all these weird things that like we understand as a player

608
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,440
Like oh, that's the character from the other game

609
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:05,400
And like this is a situation that explains something from the other game kind of but how it's connected like all of that

610
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,920
Is like on a different level than all the actual events in the game itself

611
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,120
That's a good point. They're there. I mean we we don't have all the information

612
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,600
There's definitely he is stated this game is for people who've played undertale

613
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,600
The fact that we recognize all these characters and that is that is a separate thing from the people in the game that

614
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,720
I mean, I'm just saying that could be intentional and could build to something

615
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:33,640
Um, I'm I'm still waiting. I'm still waiting for that shooter drop. I am I mean when when when you told us about the heart thing

616
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,880
We were kind of mind-blown, but I feel like

617
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,480
That's the kind of detail only an undertale superfan would notice. That's me, right?

618
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,760
Like you got to be somebody who is expecting

619
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:52,120
More out of every single second of the game, which yeah, how much fun is that to find and be the one you discover these things?

620
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:59,560
It is it is fantastic those things exist. But it also makes me think about the fact that in

621
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,520
Normally in art

622
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:09,640
When somebody makes something that is so personal that nobody else can understand it unless they dig as deep as they can

623
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,120
That's called autism

624
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,160
Like when you when when when someone makes a

625
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:22,520
35-minute analysis of why a sonic game story is actually super deep. Yeah, like we call that autism

626
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:29,080
And we laugh at it and we say it's bad storytelling and like if you do it. Well, it's fine. It's not bad

627
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,840
Or it's not it's just it's not I'm not even calling it bad. It's just like a matter of

628
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:40,200
We didn't see this heart move moment and it's so easy to play this game and not notice that and like

629
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,720
That's at the end of three fucking hours

630
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:51,160
You know like for I don't know I tend to look at art in a more like I I tend to measure it more in like time for

631
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,880
dollars kind of way like

632
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,000
if

633
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,800
If every moment of my experience is great

634
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,360
I give it a 10 out of 10 if

635
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,440
One moment was amazing enough to make up for a bunch of

636
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,920
Parts I didn't care that much about. Yeah, it might be a more fair trade

637
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:14,440
I'm just looking at this game and I'm like is is the fact that you can move the heart at the end and that like

638
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:19,960
Oh, there's confirmation. There is more going on. Is that enough to offset the feelings?

639
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,120
I had of three and a half hours of going

640
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,040
Eh

641
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,040
Nothing really going on in this game

642
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:33,240
It doesn't it doesn't greatly improve my like experience of chapter one. It just makes me more hopeful that

643
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,840
Because I have tons of hope for like this is a full game

644
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,360
I think like I have no real reason to doubt that toby could make a great game

645
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:49,240
But when I watched this chapter one, nothing grabbed me nothing grabbed me the way that undertale did

646
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,800
I feel a little grabbed by this heart reveal

647
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:57,320
Um, like by the end of the by the end of chapter one my expectations were pretty low like I

648
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,840
felt like I felt like maybe toby was setting up for like

649
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,360
Okay

650
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:10,520
So all of this is just to say that these undertale characters are not the same and this will not be an undertale ask experience

651
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,760
This will be a new and like this will be a new like totally linear

652
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:23,240
Totally YA level, uh, you know story about like a mew and a mean bully like going into an alice in wonderland world together

653
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,960
And we will have episodic adventures where that happens and you will fucking like it

654
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,960
Um, and I was and I and I was a little crestfallen by this

655
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,520
I didn't feel that cynical about it because just the fact that susie

656
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,200
Could attack enemies and you had to stop her like

657
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,520
Yeah, that's something that felt so that felt like a mechanic that you could do so much with

658
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,080
that like to think that

659
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:55,000
That the game that this chapter didn't do that much with it and like we know what toby can do. So it's like

660
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:59,720
There's no way he wouldn't explore this to a more full extent. Yes

661
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,960
I kind of got the impression from chapter one to made as episode two

662
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:11,480
Hey, oh my god, welcome. Welcome to episode two waifus now that we've done episode one episode two waifus

663
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,640
my new waifu susie from delta room

664
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,240
minus rules card

665
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:24,920
I love him. Oh, you know, I I I it took me a while to figure out that that you whose name you were saying mage

666
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,320
Just because the way I know I had such a hard time spelling it. Who is it? I don't even know what you're talking about

667
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,440
It's the it's the traps or the uh, the puzzle master

668
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,680
Yeah

669
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:41,240
He's cool. He's cool. Also, is he gassed out? Is he literally gaster? No, he's not gaster. It looks kind of like gaster

670
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:46,120
I'm just saying it does look kind of like all right. I got a hot take. I got a hot undertale take laid on me

671
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,680
I love delta rune because other characters are nice and cool and it's really cute and stuff

672
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:58,680
Yeah undertale. Here's my hot take. I think undertale strengths were all way always the characters

673
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:05,640
And and the story and and the meta gimmicks and and and like the the the world bending stuff was like

674
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,360
It's nice, but I don't care if it's not in this new game. I care, you know

675
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,120
hippo, I'm really glad you brought that perspective up because

676
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,120
um

677
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:21,640
That's the biggest disconnect that I think there is between two different camps of undertale fans. We're like

678
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,960
For me, it's like all I care about is the meta stuff and the characters did very little for me

679
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:33,080
Whereas I feel like the vast majority of people who like undertale mostly like it for the characters and

680
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:40,200
Like the meta was kind of secondary to them like most people like the game because they think that dating papyrus was a great

681
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:46,600
Yeah, yeah, I mean that I don't really care about that particularly. I'm not gay guys

682
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:53,800
But um like the the way that toby writes is is funny and quirky and nice and cute

683
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,160
And I like it and the characters that he writes are the characters that the sort of

684
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,040
Sort of characters that I like

685
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:05,640
And and I like stories and stuff and I've been burned by steven universe not existing

686
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,680
And I've blown through adventure time and that's over and I'm sad because though that's a good show

687
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:16,680
But there's no shows there's no shows that exist that are good and deltarune is like, oh, this is not this is like well written

688
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:22,440
Like like, you know cliche story a little bit of a cliche story like like oh

689
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,480
it's a

690
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,520
Something or other somebody changes their tune and it's you know

691
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,680
But like it works and it's effective and I just don't get enough of it nowadays

692
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,280
I just don't get enough of just good stories that are just told. Well, I like it

693
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,720
I'm on I'm on board with this. That's that's kind of where I wanted to go

694
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:44,760
I can't tell the difference between nowadays and before days because I'm constantly watching old shit. So

695
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:51,000
Oh, well, I I completely growthy hippo and a lot of my enjoyment from undertale was also the characters

696
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,040
I would say it's more about a 50-50 split maybe a little bit more of the meta because I'm a homestuck boy

697
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:00,600
But I did quite enjoy the characters and all of the quirky dialogue scenes and stuff such as that

698
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,120
I would say the only difference here is I don't really resonate with the characters from deltarune

699
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:09,800
And I don't really think that's an issue per se. I just find them not as interesting as you know

700
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:15,320
Sands and empires and stuff like that. I don't know if I'm really going to say that's the reason why I don't like it

701
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,960
We got we got uh, we got susie who's literally just nelson months

702
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,520
She's yep. She's good. I like susie. Yeah better than nelson. Well nelson doesn't particularly fleshed out

703
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,840
I mean susie at least has an arc. Nate. Okay. I don't think you remember. I don't think you remember

704
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,680
Nelson has a lot of fleshing out throughout this the the many seasons

705
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,240
Then I think maybe you give nelson credit. You know what that's fair. Is that the fucking the

706
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,840
You know, what's funny is the only name in my mind was Seinfeld

707
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,200
and

708
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,080
uh

709
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,840
I know it's simpsons now that you've said the ha ha noise

710
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:58,360
I'm drunk as shit by the way. Okay, that's cool. All right. Did you just wake up is

711
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:05,160
No, dude. I've been up forever. Oh sleep means nothing sleep is a whole other world to me

712
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:11,560
It's like a whole other different universe. Okay. Um, you know, when I read the comedy scenes in undertale

713
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,000
My impression is like, huh, that was clever

714
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,840
I like them a lot. I really like the writing. Yeah, I love toby's writing toby's writing is great

715
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,760
Toby's characters are great. It's it's all very intelligent

716
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:32,440
It's all smart and funny and I look at it and I think that sure is smart and funny

717
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,040
The the I think the funniest moment in uh

718
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,360
Undertale was the part where you are in like the glowing

719
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,320
Place with like the glowing water

720
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:48,200
Yeah, and you walk up you go like to like a little side path and you find the little bird

721
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:54,520
And the little bird like oh, yeah flies you across the tiny little gap with like the heroic music playing

722
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,240
Yeah, that was great. That was really good. That was really funny

723
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:03,880
The dialogue jokes and stuff are like I I guess it's that like homestuck's comedy is I mean, uh,

724
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,600
Fucking undertale's comedy is homestuck. Same thing. Yeah, that's what I meant to say, but like

725
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:15,000
Distilled like yeah, it's homestuck. Homestuck is explosive and constant all over the place

726
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,800
Like it covers every base imaginable and it's so long and it goes in so many directions and undertale is like

727
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,520
Drawing a through line through that

728
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:28,680
Undertale is is more pop than boogie and homestuck is more boogie than pop or whatever

729
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:34,120
That's a perfect description. I was gonna use the word normie, but you got me in an even better terminologies. Thank you

730
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,080
Well, I just want to say

731
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,480
That I definitely I don't know. I agree with munchie. I care about both

732
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,400
I the thing is I absolutely love all the writing and jokes. I like

733
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,480
A lot of people get turned off by like tumblr enus of undertale doesn't happen to me. I love everything about it

734
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,600
I don't even think it's as tumblr as people think it is. I agree

735
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,240
There is there is a little bit of like like bait for certain types of people

736
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,640
I mean, I still think it's weird that undine and alphys are kind of like I don't get the connection

737
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,360
But like whatever. I don't care. It's fine. It's fine. I mean, okay

738
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,280
I feel like tumblr

739
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:13,320
Poisoned the well in this case because like I've been into lesbians and like gay shit

740
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:19,000
Since way before tumblr because I too have like have had

741
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,560
Gender identity issues long before that was popular to have

742
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:30,520
Before it was like a codified thing where it was like, hey support me on patreon because I'm not sure if I'm a boy or a girl

743
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,720
Like yeah, like I had those issues before that was the thing. So like I feel like

744
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,600
Undertale speaks

745
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:44,680
I don't feel like toby is doing it to cash in on a trend or like he only he only writes lesbians into a story

746
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:50,200
Because he reads tumblr guys like no, I think he he has a better appreciation than that

747
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,920
But it's kind of just in that world. I do wish that it was less like a

748
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,760
fucking

749
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,240
Virgin gay boys idea of it. Like I I want some hard fucking

750
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:07,720
You know, it's not that kind of story. That's that's really all there is to every story should be that kind of story

751
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,960
I'm trying to say

752
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:15,160
Hey, fine final point. This is really my final point on this on this whole thing. It's that

753
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:20,040
unequivocally in my in my humble opinion the demo from

754
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,960
Undertale was way better. I do think that's true

755
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:30,840
Don't think that's debatable in in every way except visually because deltarune has some incredible visuals the sprite work is off the charts

756
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:37,080
I absolutely my favorite sprite work is when the main character points in battle and there's little sparkles when he's commanding

757
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:41,400
It is gorgeous. It is gorgeous and I love the battle aesthetic is really nice

758
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:46,760
Yeah, it's great and I love that it's it's in world battle arenas. You don't final fancy teleport to another one

759
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,000
It's just it's chrono trigger rules

760
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,640
fantastic sublime

761
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:57,160
Is that true? I didn't pick up on that. Yeah. Yeah, you watching someone play the game. No, that might only be in some areas

762
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:01,800
It's only in some areas of very normal enemies. You just transport to a computer

763
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,400
Synthwave, but for bosses you go in

764
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,600
In the world. I hope it does more of that. Hope it does more of that stuff. Um, uh, but uh, uh,

765
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,560
Right, I just I want more meta stuff

766
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:19,560
I believe in toby my faith is restored and I just I need him to deliver some but I believe that he will that's

767
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,600
I think this could I mean I think that this game can be amazing. I don't know whether you probably talked about this

768
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,360
Well, but um

769
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,440
Sorry, there's a lot of lag happening. Um

770
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:37,880
The speaking of like faith restore and toby. I am just happy like regardless of like the quality of this this deltarune

771
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,560
I'm happy that I know what he's doing and then he's doing something me too

772
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:47,000
We were we were talking in the chat the other day and devoo say that we're all a bunch of assholes when this came out

773
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:53,320
But that's fine. Uh, we were just saying how man like what the fuck's toby up to can't wait for him to milk undertale forever

774
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:57,800
And never do anything and then this drops out of the fucking blue

775
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:03,960
Blowing me the fuck out my blowing my asshole wide open like a blooming onion from outback steakhouse

776
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,440
and I just want to say that

777
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,760
I have been deeply inspired by

778
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:17,480
Toby's commitment to his artistic vision with this shit and the fact that he's a one-man team

779
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:22,760
He's got temi on sprite work. He's been he's sucking japanese cock all day. He loves his japshit

780
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:28,280
With the translation and I don't know. He just seems really into it. Also. He's learning japanese. He's a hero

781
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,520
He's a hero this guy. Did you know about the fact that he interviewed zune?

782
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:38,360
What I had no fucking idea. He interviewed somebody linked it to us in uh, I am games

783
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,960
Yeah, he like met zune who was like who found out about undertale because people are like

784
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,400
This is like toho and they sent it to him and like he did an interview with him and like

785
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,080
Apparently he's like a huge fanboy of perfect cherry blossom

786
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:56,120
Yeah, yeah, those two together is such a perfect like those two fucking indie heroes basically

787
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:01,560
Yeah, I just maybe i'm exaggerating a little bit to call toby hero, but i'm reading his twit longer

788
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:05,160
He's definitely indy. Well, the only reason I say that when he was making undertale

789
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:10,200
He was definitely an underdog hero now. He's like he's successful, right? I'm sure he could ride

790
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:14,440
Indy hero. He is soon as fucking successful

791
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,400
I mean that's true

792
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:20,600
I'm just saying like like I was gonna say that like the fact that toby is like guys. I want to make this project

793
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,040
I have a vision. I don't know if it's even possible to make my vision

794
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,720
That is an inspiring thought and he's like i'm going to try

795
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,880
I'm gonna try to make a team to make it happen and i'm just like fuck. Yes

796
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,360
This is what I this man should be doing

797
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:39,400
This is what everybody should be doing. Yeah, if you can afford it, which he can thank god

798
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:45,240
More so than the game itself like that twit longer spoke to me a lot and like it made me

799
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,600
Even though I didn't it didn't make me love the game more, but it made me empathize with him more

800
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,520
as like when he said when he like the ball drops and he's like look

801
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,800
Like when I made the undertale demo was to prove to myself

802
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,360
I could do this game in a short amount of time

803
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,640
This demo took me years to make and like

804
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,840
He's straight up like some of it is because of the fact that it's aesthetically way more

805
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,760
It's got a lot. It's a lot more complex

806
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,600
And he had to set everything for the future in this if he ends up more

807
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:20,600
So he had to plan a lot. Yeah, but he also mentions like loss of enthusiasm in the project

808
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:28,840
Like at some point it's like hey, this is taking too fucking long. I'm he probably has had better ideas

809
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:36,120
He's probably just through sheer force of aging looked at this and said like I'm getting less and less interested as I go and like

810
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,760
He set a definitive amount of time of how long he's willing to work on a project

811
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:47,320
Seven years seven years is the maximum and he's like and consider three of those years are already up

812
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:54,120
You know, imagine seven years making a game and then you decide. Well, no, it's a bust. That's I'm calling it here

813
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,520
Yeah, someone's really done. I don't believe it

814
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,800
I mean Duke Nuke forever took 12 years to make

815
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:07,080
It started and stopped many times though. I mean for different companies and shit, but but like I just think of of tobi like

816
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:12,360
Like if he builds this team and he makes the game that will be great

817
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:18,040
If he doesn't I'll be equally excited that like it failed and he moved on to the next thing

818
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,680
Like it's kind of weird

819
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,320
When he was working like when I first found out that this was like Undertale 2

820
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:29,320
I was disappointed because I was like I would rather tobi be doing something else

821
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:33,640
Like this this man has shown us so much talent in undertale

822
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,400
Why would he chain himself to the same characters in the same world?

823
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,680
but then like

824
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,680
When he explained that it's not

825
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,800
Undertale 2 that he wrote this so long ago. I was like, okay, I get it. This guy isn't

826
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:52,200
He's not boundlessly creative. He's a man with a with a very specific something

827
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:57,720
He has to get off his chest. I feel more like you know, like it wasn't that undertale was

828
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:03,160
Born from him being somebody who's like, I'm gonna play with the meta of games and that's my career

829
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:08,360
It's more like he had something specific to say with these characters and they they represent something to him

830
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,240
to an extent that he would use them again, but

831
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,840
Like and then to hear him say like

832
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:20,760
Yeah, this idea in spite of being maybe less complex than the other idea

833
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:28,360
To like thematically is more complex in terms of design and therefore it will take longer and is harder to do

834
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,720
Yeah, it's it's uh, it's fascinating

835
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:38,120
I I just want to mention uh homestuck took seven years to be finished. So I think that's where he got that number from

836
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:41,560
Ha, maybe that is wait. Did it take only seven years? Yep

837
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,680
It felt like a lifetime

838
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:49,640
Act six was what four of those years wait, it took me it took me seven years just to read it

839
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,120
Wait, homestuck started in 20

840
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,520
2011 right no nine

841
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:01,480
Oh, okay, okay, that makes more sense. I was confused. I was like, what the fuck how could it have ended last year?

842
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:07,560
Hey, by the way, uh, just small point. I went and I read we were arguing about like the genocide ending how it ends

843
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:13,960
Uh, uh, me and mage and uh, I did look it up. I did look it up and what it says is uh, uh that

844
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:20,280
Like so susie does something the king falls asleep and then, uh, uh ralze walks over

845
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,800
They say that i'm surprised you remembered my pacify spell

846
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:31,160
So maybe she like told her to use it or something either way you got used maybe susie didn't literally learn it

847
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:36,280
Yeah, because it was it happened off-screen and we didn't see who used it and that's that's true. That's true. Yeah

848
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:40,840
Okay, so fair enough a small point, but I just yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good to have a resolution

849
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,800
Some sort of resolution. I'm sure they appreciate that

850
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:49,560
I mean, uh, yeah, I mean that pretty much sums it up for me guys. Uh, anybody have any other comments?

851
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:55,720
Hey, how about that how about that ending song with uh with the lady singing?

852
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:03,560
Oh, I hate it. It was it was reminding me that like a huge part of why I have so much respect for undertale and

853
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,600
Also deltardune is that the music is so fucking. Yeah, it was awesome

854
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:16,120
Like no matter what I could say about story mechanics, whatever it doesn't matter toby fox is an amazing fucking musician

855
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,920
That nobody can take that from him ever that battle thing

856
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,440
Nate

857
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:24,840
We were talking about two different things the smash thing. Oh, yeah, you smash the yeah, yeah

858
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,080
I was I was talking about the smash. I was talking about that. I wasn't talking about the the deltardune Indian song

859
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,400
That's what i'm saying like that. I didn't like the deltardune ending song. I don't like it. It's weird

860
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:43,000
Like fantasy. I want chip tunes. I want chip tunes toby. I don't want these fucking human voices in my goddamn undertale

861
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,960
Give me what I want. Give me what I want toby

862
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:51,560
It made sense to parallel to the original game because that was the like it had live guitars in the ending and everything

863
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:56,200
That's true. That's true. Yeah, he was doing a thing there. He just wanted that extra little punch

864
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:02,840
Oh, that's some kingdom hearts shit. I think he got um, I kind of love kingdom hearts

865
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:07,240
Speaking of kingdom hearts, that's the answer. Ralsei is just azrael's nobody

866
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,680
Yeah, Ralsei's azrael's nobody that's that's

867
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,400
Oh my god

868
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,200
Oh my god, light and dark light and dark

869
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:25,480
Just for fun. Uh, did you guys know so I I played everything I did everything, uh, you know pacifist and and aggressor whatever if you fight

870
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,880
Um, uh, the the secret boss the the devil which I love and is hilarious

871
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:34,360
Um, if you fight him and you defeat him with pacifism whatever something it doesn't matter

872
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,920
But when you defeat him with attacking and aggression

873
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:42,520
He tells you that the knight, you know, like the the boss that started the well and is like doing stuff

874
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,160
There's there's a mention of the knight is the one who's like doing shit

875
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:51,480
Actually in in that boss when you genocide fight this guy. He actually mentioned there's a queen who's coming back

876
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:57,960
So just so you know, there's a yas queen that the knight is actually acting on behalf of who seems like they're probably gonna be the real

877
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,840
Villain, so

878
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:06,360
Yep, yas queen. It's gonna be hillary. Can't wait. Can't wait seven years from now

879
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,920
Okay, you can't you can't die tom. You're not yet not until delta room

880
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:18,520
I heard actually I was on a thread and on v and someone's like, uh hate life want to die

881
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:23,720
No good video games, uh delta room comes out says it's going to be seven years till the game's like god damn it

882
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,200
I want it to die toby. Why won't you let me die?

883
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,480
Pretty good

884
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:34,760
All right. Well, I mean that's so wait is is this like a single topic episode or can we talk about smash direct?

885
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:39,320
Well, oh, let's we have only we have only talked about delta room, but we are not

886
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:46,600
Legally bound to it. If you want to talk about the smash direct. I say, let's do it. I'm shocked. It's shocked. Oh, right

887
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:52,600
I'm sitting was it to not have a new adventure mode. I understand that making the subsystem is

888
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:56,680
Substitutes a mysterious locker. I said it was the equivalent to make an entirely separate game

889
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,920
That was half of brawl development. I understand that it was a big idea, you know

890
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,800
And we're taking a lot of work to make all those fmv's

891
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,720
Uh, but

892
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:11,560
In male a's adventure mode was good enough male a's adventure mode was you were walking around in a world

893
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,960
You know first episode or sorry the first level

894
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,640
It's like you're playing a mario game and you can play a chic or you can play a zelder

895
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,480
You can play whoever and it was good enough. You just would go through these nintendo worlds

896
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,800
It was way shorter than brawls and it was could have been easily doable by the what?

897
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,360
900 billion people they have working on this fucking video game

898
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:37,880
So there is something though. I mean there literally is a kind of mode with world of light. Do you know that it's not that?

899
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:46,040
Well, I don't think we really know right now. Okay. Okay. I have seen no footage of a level in the sense of

900
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:51,000
Not a fight, but you know you were progressing from one side of the screen to the other and there are obstacles in the way

901
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,000
I have seen exactly zero of that in any of the trailers

902
01:24:55,240 --> 01:25:00,360
And what it seems to be is that there's a giant world map and you interact with this world map

903
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,440
The world map is you know

904
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:06,600
Painted and it looks nice and there's all these different video game elements in it

905
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:13,000
However, you are merely playing a mini game walk around the map press some buttons on this over world

906
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:19,000
And then the actual gameplay is sometimes you will come across a person who you have to defeat in a

907
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:26,600
Combat scenario, so I have seen no evidence that it is like Maly's is just a sort of weird

908
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,160
Yeah, it's like a weird

909
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:34,440
Maybe almost mario party-esque like the fights of minigames and moving around on a board

910
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,680
I would describe it like that

911
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:41,640
Well, but the only thing is maybe there are still cool like there is at least that intro

912
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:45,560
Story thing where all the characters get blasted by light and I'd like to point out

913
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:51,800
Not every character was in that trailer. Does that imply that there's characters elsewhere who are not dead?

914
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,080
I mean like cloud wasn't in that where's cloud. I don't know

915
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:01,720
Yeah, the thing is there like a story that's gonna happen with him elsewhere. I don't know with the with the smash direct

916
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,360
There's there's like

917
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:08,280
Oh, I like smash. I I'm interested to see what's what's coming up

918
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:15,480
And then like the direct was just like a really terrible presentation like you can get annoyed about the presentation of that direct

919
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,960
And I did and I was yeah, well, what do you mean?

920
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:23,240
What I know about the game. Oh shit, right? What I what I know about the game is that there may be

921
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:30,200
Something resembling some sort of subspace emissary-esque thing with some amount of cutscenes

922
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,240
I don't know enough about it yet to actually like that

923
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:39,320
But that's all I wanted from a new smash game is a is a is cutscenes where the characters interact with each other

924
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,760
And and and they look at each other and it's like, uh, they're running

925
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,080
They're running that they're together

926
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:50,360
Samus and Pikachu you know stuff like that. It was so cool. We got a little of it at the beginning that cut that movie

927
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:54,360
We got we got that big. I mean, they've done so many promotional cutscenes that I

928
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:59,080
I really hope it's not all just for promotional reasons. That's what it was with the last game. So

929
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:00,920
You know

930
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:07,400
Where's gino guys? Where's gino? Why isn't he in the game cracks just sips monster energy drink?

931
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:08,760
Where's gino?

932
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:13,560
I'm about to say something more that will definitely make a few of you in the chat angry

933
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:19,560
And I'm definitely not saying that smash should not exist in the form that it has and there are a

934
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,920
Remiss any of the decisions that had led to this point

935
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,760
However, there is a small part of me that thinks

936
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,520
Some of the worst things about

937
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:35,160
Smash on a gameplay level is the fact that it's a crossover series

938
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:39,000
This is not to say that I don't cherish again the subspace emissary

939
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:43,880
Again to see these characters who you love interact in various different ways with people from other franchises

940
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:47,560
However, I will just say that as a

941
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:52,920
fighting game person as a person who enjoys the gameplay of smash

942
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:59,000
I I start talking and everyone starts booing in the audience who all hate super smash brothers. Yeah. Yeah, okay

943
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,800
I get I know I know it's not fighting games a part of the game

944
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:07,240
But someone who does I would say it's always very weird to me when people are like, yes

945
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:11,320
More players like more characters. Yes. We just need gino

946
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:18,840
But there's no one actually saying like hey, let's have like a new like, you know, let's have a new brawler type character

947
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:23,320
Let's have a new, uh, you know actually talking about their gameplay mechanics

948
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:27,000
I'm just talking about how it's a cool character that you like from other games

949
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,160
I'm so with you because like

950
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,240
Where do you fucking stock?

951
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:36,120
Where do you fucking stop the buck on that shit? Never you never stop it. That's the deal

952
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:42,840
There's like 45 fucking characters in smash. Like there are 74 characters confirmed 75

953
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:47,480
Fucking that's the most in any fighting game ever

954
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:55,000
Like you know, it'd be even better 75 75 would be even better with the plant. So, uh, you know beyond that like

955
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:59,320
Literally and you know what? It's great. Not only five is a new high

956
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:07,160
You could go on forever. Like there is no character. He can introduce that will satisfy me over the character

957
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:11,480
I wanted to be in like yeah, it's impossible for everybody. It's like

958
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,760
Fucking piranha plant really it's like

959
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:22,280
Well, what did you want asshole and then you get 35 different answers goku, you know, we gotta put them all in

960
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,240
Yeah, the Grinch

961
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:29,000
I've never been like interested in in the characters that come out

962
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,960
It's it's really just like it's the same with deltarune

963
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,280
Like I don't really like playing the game smash that much

964
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:41,000
I just remember the subspace adversary being a crossover and I love crossovers and I love characters and I love character interactions

965
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,800
I love those cutscenes for all those reasons because they they made

966
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:48,680
Like they made the idea of playing with these these, you know toys

967
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,240
3d digital toys

968
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,760
Like controlling them and having them like be real

969
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:58,760
Like that was the aspect of of smash that I always liked playing it

970
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,960
It's hard and I'm bad at it and I suck and I don't like it and

971
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,920
and you know, it's

972
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,240
Like all the characters in the world could be in it

973
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,000
I just

974
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,840
I don't care. I love I just quickly wanted to check the reason I'm being quiet is because I never played those games

975
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:17,960
Never gonna play those games completely not interested. That's why I'm fascinating. So

976
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,360
It's such a rare opinion

977
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:24,920
Yeah, I've literally never heard that opinion before I've heard even tom who

978
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,920
abjectly

979
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:31,560
Doesn't like smash, but I've never heard no interest and never played smash

980
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:39,000
Well, there I am here. I go. It is a nintendo thing to me the degree of which I just care about more characters realized

981
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:45,480
In the smash bros universe, you know, whatever. I want my gino guys, you know reuse cool incinero or whatever all these new

982
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,240
When will you accept that gino is a

983
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,160
Super fucking obscure character and I accept that

984
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,040
I also accept the fact that sakurai has specifically said that he'd like to put him in in the past

985
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:01,560
And he's also fairly popular in north american polls. So, you know, these are

986
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,640
What is sakurai's relevance

987
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:11,720
He's makes the game. Yeah, what makes which game super smash bros god did what

988
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,640
What?

989
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:19,720
That's the man. I thought sakurai was the final fantasy guy. No, that is. No, it's tatsuya. Nomura a.k.a.

990
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:25,640
Sakaguchi, I think it was sakaguchi. Sakaguchi, that's something. Okay. Well, that's the relevance. He is the man making the game

991
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:30,760
Go man, that's that's gonna. I'm sorry. Nate. That's gonna be a major. Go man. Now. Say I'm

992
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:41,640
It's spreading like like everyone fucking played like everyone with a super nintendo played mario rpg

993
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:45,240
Everybody fucking love. Look, I'm not true. What are you talking about?

994
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:51,240
Let's not pretend that gino is like someone that we that everyone is clamoring for across the world

995
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:56,920
I I get it. I have played mario rpg and not even made it far enough to see gino

996
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:04,280
I I bet I I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if more people alive today meaning millennials and no one else

997
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,960
Played mario rpg then played. I don't know

998
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,000
Castlevania one or two. What maybe that was playing today, right?

999
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:18,360
Uh, yeah, I don't know. That's a big oof for me there, ben, but uh, you think so you don't think so

1000
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:24,280
I'm gonna look at the sales of each right now. Uh, I would like to point out as a smash boy

1001
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:27,880
That smash bros was not originally smash bros

1002
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,240
It was dragon king the fighting game

1003
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:35,160
And it was a game made specifically just for the mechanics

1004
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:41,240
Because it was iwata and sakura being like, hey man fighting games are all the exact same fighting games are the same

1005
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:47,000
Let's make a new fighting game. That's different. And so they made smash and it's a beautiful game with beautiful mechanics

1006
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,960
Where it's not just fighting, but you know health bar goes down

1007
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:54,040
It's you know, you're racking up damage and hit them off the screen with the beautiful airtight controls

1008
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:58,840
And it was incredible and they're like, hey, uh, no one's gonna like this game. How do we market it?

1009
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,360
Uh, just fucking put mario in there, bro. Haha. Yes

1010
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:06,440
Number one most successful game ever except for poke. I'm saying

1011
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:11,240
I'm not saying that I hate smash or anything. I love smash. It's one of my favorite games

1012
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,280
She's of all time

1013
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:18,360
I love playing as kirby because I am kirby and i'm not upset like just want to make sure

1014
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:26,040
Like guys don't vote me out of the office. I just think it would be cool if the smash genre wasn't relegated just do smash

1015
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:31,400
And yeah, I know about rivals of aether. Yeah, okay. I know about rivals of aether. I know the other ones

1016
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:35,960
But okay tbh who gives a shit fucking roll owned

1017
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,280
Do you like that kirby is canonically confirmed to be the most powerful, uh, uh person in the game?

1018
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:45,560
He's just like the only survivor from the no, he's just he's just the first

1019
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:51,320
Yeah, I mean he was riding a war star. I guess I'm so on it. I'm about to slam myself here, dude

1020
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:57,000
Because fucking apparently according to vg charts with the z dot com

1021
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,600
Uh

1022
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:08,600
Super mario rpg sold 2.14 million games and the highest selling castlevania symphony in the night is 1.27 million

1023
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:16,280
That's fucking crazy castlevania seems so beloved and talked about

1024
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,720
I certainly love it. All right. That well it is. I'm just uh

1025
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:26,280
Mario rpg is talked about and beloved and and uh and not to mention it's part of the mario franchise

1026
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:32,600
Which is just a huge advantage. I have not even seen one analysis video about super mario rpg. It's coming. There are best game ever

1027
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:38,440
Super mario rpg legend of seven stars will be here one day. Wait for it. I did a g rpg on that. Oh, yeah

1028
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:42,680
No, it will. Oh wait, that's right. That's right. Hippo did two g rpg on it

1029
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,800
Well, that's I've seen so many about like mario and luigi and shit and mario is great. It's good

1030
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:55,480
Uh, that yeah, uh, all right. I have a question. I have a I have a thought piece

1031
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,480
Um

1032
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:02,440
Would you prefer if you could only have one or the other would you prefer gino to be in smash?

1033
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,560
Or for gino to come back for another game installment in the super mario rpg franchise

1034
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:13,880
That involves weighing my my faith in nintendo as a development company to make another good j rpg

1035
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:18,600
And I do not have that faith. So I mean look at cloud like. Oh my god guys

1036
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:24,120
We're getting a final fantasy seven reboot. Uh, I would much rather just have them in smash and just like have the cloud

1037
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:30,200
I remember and respect as opposed to the bastardization that we'll be in the remake. So, you know, that's pretty much how I

1038
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:37,000
That's that's true. I'm just saying if that implies that like a direct sequel in the vein of mario rpg would come out

1039
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:43,240
I would acquit like yeah. Yes. No, don't interrupt the perfect ending of mario rpg. It's perfect as it is

1040
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:48,520
Well, nate. I mean like the mario games all take place in the same continuity

1041
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:53,720
and like so like having a sequel to it would not ruin it any more than

1042
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,280
I don't know fucking

1043
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:01,880
Fucking any of the other ones. You know, they're all they're all mario games. There's there's what like 30 years of baggage now

1044
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:08,120
Let's let's you already have a fucking mind's blowing. You heard those in numbers. I said before, right? Yeah, uh

1045
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:12,360
What do you think is the best-selling mario rpg?

1046
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,720
mario and luigi bowser's inside story. That's my guess

1047
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,280
You are correct bowser

1048
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,440
Bowser's inside story with 3.77 million

1049
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,600
Jillian guys

1050
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:28,680
Bowser's not sorry. It's a good fucking game. Literally stop hating for no reason

1051
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:37,080
Saga being 2.1 and super mario. Okay. Well super paper mario for the we is the highest selling of the paper mario with 3.37

1052
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,520
Actually, that might even top bowser. That's not unfortunate. That's a good game before look. It's good

1053
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:46,120
But it's not as good as the other mario. I would say it's equal. It's just different

1054
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:50,920
Okay, it should have said it should have stayed a spin-off. It shouldn't have decided the course of things

1055
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:56,920
I'm gonna need a guide for mario and luigi and super paper mario because like everyone's opinions is vastly

1056
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:04,040
Oh, oh, did you all get with the real shit? That's not fucking fake. Oh the only the only good mario luigi game is the first one

1057
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:09,560
Yeah, all right. Yeah, correct. Yeah, accurate statement. Well, the first three are all great

1058
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,560
The first three are all classic games

1059
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:18,360
You should play the first three and then literally everything after that is a dumpster fire and terrible do not agree on that

1060
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:24,840
The first and and similarly very similarly paper mario the first three are all great

1061
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:29,640
Here's the difference between the paper mario games paper mario 64 is like a cozy experience when you play with the lights off

1062
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,120
And you're in bed. It's a pretty slow experience

1063
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:35,800
But it's kind of quirky in the same way that dealt to ruin. Oh callback is

1064
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,520
paper mario 2

1065
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,400
Paper mario 2 is sort of like a more action-packed version of paper mario 1

1066
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:45,960
It's got which looks way better. It looks beautiful

1067
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,040
There's a ton of interesting gameplay mechanics

1068
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:52,120
And you play if you want to have a good video game experience and the worlds are also super interesting

1069
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:58,840
Super paper mario is a great game as well with a bunch of it's not it's not an rpg in the same way that the other two are

1070
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,920
It's like an action rpg where you move around the world

1071
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:06,760
But it's got a really interesting aesthetic a great story and it just is a generally good spin-off video game that you should play as well

1072
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:12,360
Paper mario super paper jam is a terrible game and it sucks. It makes absolutely no sense

1073
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,520
Paper jam

1074
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:20,840
Yeah, or what's it called sticker sticker star sticker stars the first one. I like paper jam paper jam is a thing

1075
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:28,040
It's like mar it was a mar a paper mario 3 printer error. No, no, that's actually a thing. Uh, it's uh, mario and luigi paper jam

1076
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:30,040
It's not paper jam

1077
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:33,640
Wait, oh, do you guys know what is the best selling game with all time?

1078
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:40,520
It's a bad game isn't it? Yeah mickey mouse steamboat will it's like a new game right? It's like it's like a new game

1079
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:47,080
It's we we sports all right because there was one for we or something

1080
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:49,640
8.2 million

1081
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:53,160
We would like to know 82. I meant to say 82.6

1082
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:58,440
82 okay. Hey going back to munchies point. I just want to say about about the smash thing

1083
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:01,800
Uh, I am somebody who would sacrifice

1084
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:09,080
Any degree of like balance or any of that fighting game bullshit just to get one new character

1085
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:12,840
Because I don't give a shit about I just want characters. That's all I care about

1086
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:17,800
Look, I'll I'll adapt man. Whatever. Whatever. It's fine. I don't care

1087
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:23,240
The meta's gonna be what it's gonna be. Yeah, I'll just adapt. Why would they not add susie to smash?

1088
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,360
Why?

1089
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:29,880
Why this there was this the cryptic 24 hour thing and it was gonna coincide the smash

1090
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:35,720
Oh, oh susie is gonna be in smash because delta rune's new and it's like a promotional thing. Oh, it's it's confirmed

1091
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:42,040
I want it. I want it. What if he really he releases the delta rune chapter one and it's just a like side story

1092
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:47,080
Explaining how sands found a poor magic portal that transported into smash

1093
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:51,240
How is there nobody from golden sun?

1094
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:59,800
That he's been confirmed as an assist trophy isaac tragically. He's uh, Nate. I mean, I know you like golden sun

1095
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:04,840
But you are literally the only person I know who has ever played golden sun. I played golden sun one and two

1096
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:12,200
Golden sun was my first video game at not literally but my first rpg is the first game I cared about

1097
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:17,000
Okay, it's it's actually a fascinating story. Uh, because because here's the thing about golden sun

1098
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:23,080
It is fairly well known and reasonably liked. Here's what I think the reason is why like I was a deeply beloved

1099
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:27,720
I would say it's by by some that's true. Um, and it pulls all right in the polls

1100
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:33,240
But like I think the reason why Isaac is not a care is not a playable character is because

1101
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,720
Camelot the developer

1102
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:40,760
It's it's because the series like they just like if they put Isaac in that alone

1103
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:47,400
I think would catapult the series to get another game made and finish off the like the the sequel to dark dawn that I think they

1104
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:51,880
Wanted I think camelot has given up. That's what I think and because they've given up

1105
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:57,320
They don't want to put in the energy like if if we're gonna put a character in why put it in for like a dead series that

1106
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:02,520
You know, we could do it for fucking piranha plant or you know, whatever it is. Oh, yeah, the new piranha plant game

1107
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:06,760
I can't wait. I can't wait for the new piranha. I don't even that doesn't even sound weird

1108
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:09,880
That doesn't even sound like a weird thing that would surprise me if it were true

1109
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:12,360
Yeah, like these companies have to decide what they're gonna do

1110
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:18,920
It's some kind of some kind of motion controlled thing where you like use the game pad to like tilt around and like stretch your

1111
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,720
Fucking vine. Why would you ever expect?

1112
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:28,760
Gino to make it in before chrono, I'll tell you why uh, oh before chrono you were saying, um

1113
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,400
Well, one is literally mario character. I think that goes a long way

1114
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:39,640
Yeah, but he was in one game. That's not that well technically speaking. He's been in two games

1115
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:45,000
Oh, jesus christ has a little mario and luigi. He shows up. Yeah

1116
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:50,360
But but okay, gino. Okay, gino has already been confirmed to be in

1117
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:54,040
The new smash game as a little like player icon now

1118
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:55,640
I'm not I don't know what that implies

1119
01:41:55,640 --> 01:42:01,000
But they obviously have the ability the legal right to use his likeness in the game to a degree

1120
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:07,240
And I mean some people think that's a deconformation that like he isn't in but we saw like an image in the trailer

1121
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:11,560
I don't think it implies that at all. I think uh, it things remain the same

1122
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:14,440
He's likelihood as being a dlc is certainly possible

1123
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:18,360
But I'm not even trying like I don't want to convince anyone that gino should be in the game

1124
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:23,160
I just happened to think that he would you would you classify smash brothers as a religion?

1125
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:30,760
Imagine a new mario rpg right imagine that in we we meet uh, we meet like gino, but not gino

1126
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:33,880
As we know we meet the we meet the person

1127
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:37,960
We meet like the person who is like an in-world superhero or something

1128
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:41,960
Okay, like an in-world like captain quirk kind of character like, um

1129
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:48,280
Who the who the doll was based off of and he's like a hero to the he's like a hero to the people and the hero to the children

1130
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,800
But he's oh my god

1131
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:55,240
You mean we meet the original gino who is not the same and he's more of like and he's more of like a corporate sellout

1132
01:42:55,240 --> 01:43:00,120
But then for whatever reason the star spirit has to come back to like continue

1133
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,760
You know he has to repair the star road again

1134
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:05,320
And he comes back takes over a doll again

1135
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:12,440
And like the real gino ends up in league with whatever force broke the star road and the doll has like has to overcome

1136
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:18,520
Okay, like original gino can't be a real person. Well, I guess it is mario. I was going to say puppets aren't alive, but

1137
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:23,800
Wait what because gino could like canonically gino is a puppet

1138
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:25,720
Like the mario is an inanimate

1139
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:29,560
He's an inanimate puppet and the the the little toadette playing with him

1140
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:34,360
Seems to think that he's some kind of superhero. Yeah, but that doesn't mean he's based on one

1141
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:38,760
No, well, it doesn't mean that but he could be while we've been talking

1142
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:44,280
I've been trying to like research the most popular characters in nintendo games from like the last

1143
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,520
Uh 20 years

1144
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:54,040
It's actually shocking how well represented like all the most popular characters even if the third party are in smash

1145
01:43:54,680 --> 01:44:02,040
To the extent that gino actually would be like one of the top five candidates probably those characters who would make sense

1146
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:08,280
Um, what do you mean? How so how do you figure like just that most of the characters from like, okay?

1147
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:13,320
I'm going by like game FAQs looking at like the most popular games that are looked at on there and

1148
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:18,760
almost everything on nintendo consoles is represented like down to like bayonetta and

1149
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,720
Shit, that's like not even first party

1150
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:26,680
Um, but I do think it would make just as much sense for like golden sun or

1151
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,640
Gino or something like that to be the next one

1152
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,360
to come out there was something else

1153
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,080
That I saw that would have also made sense

1154
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,760
like, uh

1155
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:42,760
It's it's really just a shame that rareware is like microsoft now because like banjo would obviously make sense

1156
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,640
They should make a deal just make a deal dog like with cloud fucking figure it out pay the money

1157
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:52,760
I don't know yeah like banjo or some resident evil characters like leon from re4 would make sense

1158
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:59,320
Yeah, sure because re4 was a huge game cube game game before it became can we please get fucking

1159
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:03,800
I forgot the name of the silent hill two main character. Can we get that guy, please?

1160
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:07,880
Can we please get jill sandwich as a smash trophy?

1161
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:12,120
We should we should we should get mara from shimakami tense eight

1162
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:17,480
It really sucks that rare when with microsoft now they can't use donkey kong games because of donkey kong 64

1163
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,720
Really sucks that they left donkey kong reds

1164
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:26,520
Yeah, he's right. He's right. So you're implying that why don't they just use banjo and also but even more

1165
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:30,600
I'm honestly shocked that like they have any

1166
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:35,240
Square eighties characters and not so am I dude. I was blown the fuck away

1167
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,240
I made a video about it like three years ago

1168
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:42,600
Not having like if if you ask me like if they were going to do another square character after

1169
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:46,040
After cloud like before gino. They will do chrono

1170
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:50,280
I would have to disagree. But who knows maybe that you could be right. It could be right

1171
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:56,200
I think one of the most popular characters of all time just because chrono trigger is so beloved

1172
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:01,480
This this this is mara from shimakami tensey by the way. He was he was joking

1173
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:05,080
Are there any shimakami tense it came on?

1174
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:09,640
Oh, that's a dick monster. Oh the dick the dick chariot rider. Yeah

1175
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:16,440
You're right. I do want him in there that would be that would be great. Which game is he from shimakami tensey

1176
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:21,720
Just the first one. Yeah, just any game. I'm pretty sure he's in a bunch of them. He's in a bunch of them

1177
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:28,360
Okay, beautiful. All right guys. This conversation is going down the tubes real fast. I feel it. I think we all feel it

1178
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:33,240
Let's uh, look the only thing I have to say about the only thing I have to say about super smash brothers

1179
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:38,680
Is that the latest the latest trailer that has like uh sonic running away and then reaching out to hold

1180
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:42,040
The good grab pq and then they both get like teleported away

1181
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:46,680
Uh, that's getting dangerly close to canonical sonatru and i'm uncomfortable about it

1182
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:51,240
He's right. He's right

1183
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:55,000
If only they had fused they could have had the power to escape, but they didn't do it in time

1184
01:46:55,240 --> 01:47:01,640
That trailer was that that that that that animation was great. I love seeing everybody try their best to survive and

1185
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:08,200
Instantly die and can I just say okay? Here's the thing. I love most about uh smash bros and it also extends to like

1186
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:13,000
Decidio final fantasy like games like that like that that's the zelda in

1187
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:18,680
Smash bros the new smash bros is the character design of the one from a link between worlds

1188
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,840
Which was like a tiny little like chibi sprite and it's been brought to life

1189
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:30,440
So beautifully and to see that character design in these incredibly beautiful animations brings so much joy to my heart

1190
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:36,040
And uh, and I wanted gino to be one of them. God damn it. He deserves respect

1191
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:40,200
But now it's just gonna be a fucking dlc character. You know, I was like malo better

1192
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:44,200
I'm zelda from uh smash bros, you know the new one. Okay. Yeah

1193
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:49,000
All right, I was like malo better than gino. I know all right. We've been over it. We've been hey

1194
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:55,720
I want malo and smash. Hey everybody since we spent this whole podcast talking about video games and therefore

1195
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:01,480
Objectively the opening theme should be I just want to play video games for this episode

1196
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:07,080
That would be true. What games have you guys been playing as of late?

1197
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:14,200
Tokyo Zen and do ex plus nuclear throne in this war one at a fucking i'll go down the list mage

1198
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:20,120
Mage you're first. What have you been playing? Tokyo Zen to do ex plus and also blade and soul

1199
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:23,640
What in the fuck is tokyo zon to do ex plus?

1200
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:26,520
It's uh, it's it's an jrpg

1201
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:32,440
Excellent of what denomination what console what style of graphics?

1202
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:35,000
Well, well, I'm playing it on pc

1203
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:39,320
But I think it's available and originally was on ps4 or at least vita

1204
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:43,560
Or at least the tokyo zon and do original one was I think was on vita

1205
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:47,880
But then there's a PlayStation 4 and ex plus is the advanced version from what I hear

1206
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Is it good?

1207
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:53,240
It's

1208
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:56,040
I've seen this game on steam

1209
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,280
Yeah, it was a sale

1210
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,640
Yeah, it's it's fun. It took me a while to get the controls down with the mouse and keyboard

1211
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:07,640
I actually sucked at it a lot with with with uh with the controllers

1212
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:11,640
So I had to learn this definitely looks like a vita game like a vita port

1213
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:17,560
Yeah, sadly, I didn't know that um, but I I only bought it because it was on sale on on steam

1214
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:20,760
So and there we go and I'm having fun with it. It gives me

1215
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:27,080
It gives me a little bit of bit of persona vibes. It's not as good, but I don't know. It's fun. It's fun enough

1216
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:31,880
All right, we got to move through this fucking thing faster. Let's so let's let's get through these fucking games we're playing

1217
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:37,640
Here's my list. I'm playing ease eight on switch a little bit. I'm playing hyper light drifter on switch a little bit

1218
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:42,600
I've currently taken some time off a hollow night. I'm playing a little bit of devil may cry one

1219
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:47,480
I'm playing a little bit of eventical the porn game from steam and I'm playing a little bit

1220
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,760
How can you be playing a little bit of devil may cry one?

1221
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:55,400
We we did a live stream of that last night where tom beat it in one three hours sitting

1222
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:59,800
Okay, well, I've played I don't know maybe twice for like two hours settings. I'm not that good at it

1223
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:03,080
So, you know, whatever take me a while last game. I'm playing believe it or not

1224
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:07,240
Call of Duty black ops for a little bit every once in a while and it's fun as hell

1225
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:10,920
That's it go tom gay

1226
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:17,640
Uh, if you want to see what I've been playing recently go watch. I am games the most on brand stream on twitch

1227
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:24,440
TV, that's right. The most on brand. That's a great. I like that. I love that. That gives me a

1228
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:27,960
Oh, also, I forgot delta rune now. Good. What do you play?

1229
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:36,520
Uh, I have been playing a lot of team fortress two and I've been getting getting into a big old like depression about it

1230
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:43,080
About how I'm not good at the headshots and I keep missing my head shoots and I keep getting dominated by the entire other team

1231
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:46,280
They're gangbanging me. They're getting me all in the shooting holes

1232
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:52,600
Through my body. There's no body left. I'm dead and I keep coming back and I keep rage quitting every time I die

1233
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:57,240
And I keep immediately opening tf2 after I rage quit and I just do it over and over again

1234
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:01,880
I think to myself. What am I doing? Why am I doing? What am I? What am I trying to accomplish here?

1235
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:05,800
Am I trying to get better or am I trying to what's going on here?

1236
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,920
And then I go to youtube.com

1237
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:12,120
Slash german 985 and I watch all of his old videos

1238
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:14,680
Then I go to star underscore and I watch all of his old videos

1239
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:17,640
And then I watch how it feels to play scout in tf2

1240
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:22,520
And then I fucking I look at a million tf2 videos every day and I don't do anything

1241
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:26,280
And I'm fucking sad and it sucks. It was the best game of all time

1242
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:30,680
I love it when I can get a hail screw skill streak with my sniper rifle

1243
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,720
Oh, I love tf2. Fuck you tf2. You shit

1244
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:34,840
Idiot

1245
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:38,440
Hey, but you know what the worst moment my entire life was was a few days ago

1246
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:40,440
I wanted to

1247
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:44,760
Show kathy some of my culture and so I turned on german is mad and she didn't get it

1248
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:52,200
No, I know I know I was so fucking devastated. I couldn't believe that I that I thought it drops out

1249
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:57,960
Yeah, that that that was investing time and the person who didn't understand the appeal of german is mad

1250
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:05,560
What the fuck I've never seen german is mad german is mad is the only video on the planet worth watching

1251
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,360
If you're watching another video, then you don't understand

1252
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:16,120
German German and star videos are like the game grumps before game grumps, and they're still better than game grumps have ever been ever

1253
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:17,400
sick

1254
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,400
Bad, what are you playing well?

1255
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,800
um plan uh

1256
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:29,560
Me and munchie playing endless war. I'm pretty pretty tired today because and this is my chance to segue into what I actually care about

1257
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:36,840
We had the uh, we had rfck con yesterday. It was great. We met up with some some top some top killers and top rowdies

1258
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:43,400
My my achilles tendons are are raw and frayed to the point of nearly snapping

1259
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:47,160
Because I was walking around in boots that were not the most comfortable

1260
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,160
um

1261
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:52,680
And we met uh, we met endless war in real life and that's what happened to the base of endless war

1262
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,680
It was a great as a grand gay old time

1263
01:52:55,080 --> 01:53:00,920
Well, uh, we prayed we prayed for his mercy and we did not receive it. I gotta ask at the the pillow fight

1264
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,240
Well, what was that room? Where were you? Was that a big old hotel? Oh, ben wasn't there?

1265
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:09,880
That was like that was like an after party thing wait pillow fight. It was like an after party thing

1266
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:15,160
I I because paradox rocks had flew in and he flew in like towards the end of rfck con

1267
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:18,360
I wanted to spend more time with him because he is my literal adoptive son

1268
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,640
We just went back to efrim's hotel room and me efrim a.j.

1269
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:30,920
Shoop cough kazi and paradox rocks. All he just hung the fuck out ordered pizza and uh shot the shit

1270
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:35,160
And uh, I beat the shit out of paradox rocks once. I don't think that that was recorded

1271
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,840
It wasn't on my channel

1272
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:41,160
Then paradox rocks beat the shit out of efrim and then I think efrim beat the shit out of someone else

1273
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:43,480
But I forget hey, oh efrim beat the shit out of a television

1274
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:51,000
Man, this is too fucking meta for me. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Munchy, what games have you been playing?

1275
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:52,280
We're talking about a

1276
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:56,920
Convent I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you don't understand literally everything that we're talking about

1277
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:01,160
Yeah, that's well, that's it. I guess

1278
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:08,280
Munchy, what a game are you fucking playing? I I don't play video games. I only play pokemon going in this war

1279
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,840
Those are both video games

1280
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,640
So you do there you go

1281
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,640
Fucking asshole

1282
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:20,520
Anyway, I got one gengar on gengar. I've been playing which also was rfck coming

1283
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:27,240
I I for the six hours leading up for this podcast. I was playing tails of fantasia on the tails gets trolled

1284
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:31,480
Digi, what happened? I don't know what that is code. You got to get it in the beginning of that

1285
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:33,640
What happened to crosscode?

1286
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:38,920
Getting it on the beginning of crosscode. It's not as valuable as making a video about tails

1287
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:46,520
So that means you just wasted all that time playing crosscode, you know, it wasn't a waste because I had a great time

1288
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:51,800
Why we're gonna we're gonna disappoint the iam games. We've been talking up that crosscode video

1289
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:58,200
Nobody said that I quit crosscode just because I made him fucking decided to play tails of fantasia

1290
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:02,280
Digi, it's gonna take it's gonna take us like 10 million if you're gonna do a bunch of tails videos

1291
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:07,560
It's gonna take us what like longer than uh fucking delta rune will take the finish because there's so fucking many of them

1292
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:15,880
Why are you playing tails of fantasia instead of tails of berseria with that very sexual main character velvet?

1293
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:23,800
Who i'm very attracted to sexual I am planning to do a retrospective on the tails series on the iam games channel

1294
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:29,320
Good luck, but you can find at youtube.com slash iamgames.fun

Yeah, go to iamgames.com for fun better yet. Damn. That's a good ass url that fucking url

1296
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:42,040
How much does that cost you like what's that cost to do? It was it was relatively cheap. I believe

1297
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,520
It was worth every penny

1298
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:48,280
I should buy some I want to I want to pull like a jesse and just buy a bunch of urls

1299
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:53,960
Anything even clothe like best man of all time best boy in the world, you know things, you know

1300
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:57,240
I got a I got a deal. I got a hot deal on stcomics.com

1301
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:03,320
So I technically own st comics with an x as well as st comics with a cs. Well done. I was well done

1302
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:09,560

There will be a new bail jpeg update video. Yeah

1304
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:17,640

1305
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:20,460
Yeah, it was fucked up what you did to your character

1306
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:30,280
Now I remember why it was sounded familiar. Okay. Yeah, yes tails of symphony was my favorite game of all time

1307
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:34,120
And I was 14 and I wrote a lot of pornography about the characters

1308
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,360
What's uh, what's the name of the sexy ninja girl?

1309
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:37,960
Sheena

1310
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:43,560
Sheena yes, she was the biggest titty girl in the world. Well actually tifa was in my pornography

1311
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:46,200
the lolly girl uh

1312
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,760
And uh while sheena was asleep

1313
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:53,560
inserted the hilt of us a short sword into her own pussy

1314
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:58,920
And then put the sheath of said sword and now we're demonetized

1315
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,760
In her sleep. Wow

1316
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:11,480
That was one of one of eight chapters of which I got of which on fanfiction.net before they killed all pornographic fan fiction

1317
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:19,480
I had 8 000 views which until the my little pony channel was the most views I ever caught on anything

1318
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:23,160
I ever did on the internet. Do you ever see I've seen a couple of like 14

1319
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:28,760
I've seen I saw one girl's twitter bio once that was like, uh, it was like 10 000 views on youtube

1320
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:33,880
like, uh, something like 20 000, uh, like snapchat or twitter followers like

1321
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:40,920
100 000 snapchat followers and then like 10 million views on porn hub and it was like an escalating

1322
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:48,040
Legit that fucking tale of symphony of pornography that I wrote when I was 14 took me almost

1323
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:50,600
10 no 10 minutes

1324
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:58,360
Eight years to come in view count it took eight years of non-stop production of further internet content

1325
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:04,760
What can you say it appeals to the largest demographic pornography? That's you know, yeah, and I guess tells everybody a fan's

1326
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:13,080
Porn is for everybody. If you are a viewer and you would like to escape the frankly uncomfortable and confusing lifestyle

1327
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:15,320
of listening to the pcp

1328
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:22,200

Okay, like what did you call me? What did you call me at halloween? You call me like a like a zoomer like a zoomer pied piper

1340
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:17,080
Damn that's so true and much is the lead zoomer. Yeah

1341
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:22,200
He's the first one caught in my in my piccolo song

1342
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,760
Damn, that's good. That's good shit. Yeah

1343
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:30,440
I'm very proud. Um, I guess we're all kind of that. You know, I was just actually I got an interesting message from somebody

1344
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,840
Um in my in my patron discord

1345
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:37,320
I was like rounded up the you know the the people who haven't paid their taxes need to be killed

1346
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:41,160
You know who unpatroned and one guy it was it was really fine. He's just like hey, dude

1347
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,960
Just letting you know, uh, you know, just whatever don't want a patron anymore

1348
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:45,160
um

1349
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:51,960
And one of the things he said was that like like I've I've since outgrown the need for your message of like self betterment

1350
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:55,160
And taken responsibility. So like I don't really need your perfect now

1351
01:59:55,320 --> 02:00:00,760
I get that every day like every time someone unpatriots me. That's what the message is. I mean, that's fine

1352
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:05,640
But I was just like wow, that's actually kind of great. It's a little sad. But like they won't pay me

1353
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:11,160
No, it's it's it's such a weird feeling. I see the temptation, but I think like that's dumb actually

1354
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:14,520
I mean, maybe he's just lying and actually he just you know, doesn't know what

1355
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:20,200
I feel like those people I feel like those people think that they forget about the fact that you

1356
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,560
Remain older than them and that your message will evolve

1357
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:30,200
Well, I mean like yeah, that's true continually need your guidance unless they are actually exceeding you unless you have

1358
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,600
Unless they like they've taken like a huge

1359
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:38,680
Attitudinal shift in their life or something. They no longer see they probably think they're a badass and they're gonna quickly realize

1360
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:42,440
They're not maybe they are I believe this guy or at least that he believes it

1361
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:45,880
It's just that like I mean I think about myself like nobody's that cool

1362
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,960
I was nobody's that

1363
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:51,640
If if somebody like I don't know is loving loves my content

1364
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:56,440
But then like gets a great job like gets a girlfriend and is just like loving their life

1365
02:00:56,520 --> 02:01:03,720
Like I totally get why like you need to take responsibility or whatever. They're like I did that's good. You know got it covered fam

1366
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:09,720
Sure, you know that just sounds like what I want people to do and and I've been thinking about how like

1367
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:15,800
It's inevitable that at the very least people will probably age out or like just some people are gonna not care

1368
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:20,360
About anime video, whatever and just go to other stuff. But then probably like new kids will cycle in

1369
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:23,880
It's almost like you're a teacher in a classroom of a certain grade level

1370
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:27,640
Whatever that may be and people cycle in and they cycle out is their life

1371
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:35,080
Constantly realizing that you're aging because the kids keep getting younger and younger somehow while you only get older

1372
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:37,640
Yeah

1373
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:39,640
I don't know. It's just interesting

1374
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:45,320
This sounds terrifying. Let's talk about something else. Okay, you know what we can go to those we can go to the voicemails anytime people

1375
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:48,120
I want to quickly I want to quickly make a shout out. It's just

1376
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:53,160
Not for myself not for myself. It's not not something that will benefit me in the long run

1377
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:57,720
Is just so there's this anime that absolutely no one is talking about on the internet

1378
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:02,920
It's just like it doesn't exist. I swear like three or four people and like it's called double dicker

1379
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,200
So I just want to raise awareness about this anime because I give us the elevator pitch. Why is it good mage?

1380
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:10,680
What's more like double dicker?

1381
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:17,240
Yeah, why is it good mage sell us please have you guys seen tiger and bunny?

1382
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:22,200
Yes, I have no I'm not certain but it seems like it's by the same people

1383
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:26,280
He has that sort of aesthetic and style to it and like the characters are really fun

1384
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,320
It is by sunrise who did this who did both but yeah

1385
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:35,800
In fact, it is apparently tied into tiger and bunny. It is a

1386
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:39,240
Oh, okay. I like it even more now

1387
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:41,880
Okay, well, hopefully so much. Let us know

1388
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:45,640
Press press m in the chat if you don't listen to mage and did that

1389
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:47,560
Yeah, you don't have to like it

1390
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:51,720
I just want people to be aware that it exists because no one's talking about it

1391
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:55,400
I say I'm if you approve of mage press m and chat

1392
02:02:56,280 --> 02:03:02,280
Mage, I've got an idea. Why don't you make a literal anime analysis video on why it's so great to raise awareness?

1393
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:07,400
Like I did with oh shit. They galco chant. I'm really not good at those things though. It's not hard enough

1394
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:13,560
It's not hard. It's right. I I go search double deck your dug and krill and I see what it looks like

1395
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,040
Is it a good mage? Do you like it?

1396
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:22,760
I mean, it looks like ass, but if she says it's good, it might pass. I mean, it's a cg nightmare, so

1397
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:27,960
I mean, I mean the tiger and bunny had also cg'd and so, you know

1398
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:30,360
The city's state of wifillania

1399
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:33,400
Two suns arise above the city and the people here live

1400
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:39,400
Oh, yeah, it is in a city that is named literally this town is called lis valetta

1401
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:43,720
Oh, which sounds like lithuania. No, I did not realize that

1402
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:45,240
Oh

1403
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:49,160
I see I see the fucking propaganda. Oh my god. There's government like

1404
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:52,760
Mage has been hired by the government to push this propaganda

1405
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:59,480
Is the main character a young a young girl dressed in complete purple with a baseball bat walking around the desolate streets

1406
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:03,000
It is actually a young man described exactly that way

1407
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:06,360
He does not have a bat. He does not have a bat

1408
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:09,560
Is he actually purple?

1409
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:12,680
The pieces are falling into place

1410
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:20,600
His whole entire design is all purple, but like head to toe. Well, we know we know why mage is watching the show now

1411
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:23,800
You're not entirely wrong

1412
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:26,280
I got into it

1413
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:31,480
I mean, I it was recommended to me by by biter and and he sold me because there was a main guy who was purple and he

1414
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:37,880
Was cute. Oh, but bet his personality is so adorable. He's just so excited to be there. It's just how can you not love him?

1415
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:40,360
That's always endearing. I like people who are excited to be anywhere

1416
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:47,400
He's a bit of a dumbass, but I love him double decker. Check it out sponsored by mage and and state of lithuania

1417
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,480
the state

1418
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:55,480
Are we doing questions or what? It's it's time to go to questions. Yeah. Jesus christ. I forgot. I've been here forever

1419
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,840
I feel like I'm dying slowly in my seat. All right. Here we go. It was 10 minutes for me. I'm drunk

1420
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:07,880
I mean, it's been a boisterous last while. I've been enjoying it. Best day drinking of my life

1421
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:14,840
All right, let's get to it people. Uh first first voicemail. Here we go. It's one spar checking in as you guys

1422
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:17,640
All right, let's let's see what he's got for us today go

1423
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:25,000
When I so as the time of this podcast release election season is officially over and with it a whole bunch of annoying videos about the importance of voting

1424
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:31,400
Correct. Um, but right now I'm here looking up some information about the people running for my local offices

1425
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:33,640
and uh, not only have I discovered

1426
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:40,600
That uh, one of the candidates is the serial heckler who attended nba home games to berate the away teams to the point where he actually

1427
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:42,680
Got banned from the local stadium

1428
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:47,480
Um, but another candidate is a youtuber who makes candy and lunchables reviews

1429
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:49,960
Yeah

1430
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:55,160
A youtuber by the way whose catchphrase is just when you thought it was safe to get back into bed

1431
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:57,880
So are there any

1432
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:00,840
You guys

1433
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:09,160
Uh, I just told us before but I can't remember

1434
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:12,680
My chakras just got blitzed from that. Holy fuck

1435
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:17,240
I would register to vote just to vote for lunchables guy

1436
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:22,280
Wait, wait, wait, did you did you hold on on the stream yesterday or like two days?

1437
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:26,840
You were literally making the case. There is no way you would ever vote under any circumstances ever

1438
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:31,480
Okay, well, we found the one well tom guess what I didn't know there was someone

1439
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:34,040
running on the platform of lunchables

1440
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:38,040
I I still eat lunchables every fucking time I go to the

1441
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:46,360
You thought it was safe to get back in bed. What does that mean?

1442
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:50,520
What's gonna what's gonna happen lunchables guy?

1443
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:57,000
Real quick question to decide whether you get to live or die. What is the best type of lunchables?

1444
02:06:57,400 --> 02:07:00,440
I just like the pizza ones with the goop on it. You know, I remember this

1445
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:07,240
Any other answer you would be executed in my society. No, dude. Hammond cracker. You bet you're dead

1446
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:09,720
dead in my society

1447
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:14,680
I never even had a lunchable. Oh, that's sad. That's well. You're european. It's

1448
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:20,200
Radcon four. We have to sit. We have to sit bow down with the pizza and the hams

1449
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:22,360
Gotta make a decision lunchables reviews

1450
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:25,960
We got to have a taste test. You got to pick his favorite. Oh, yeah, fine. Sure. I'll do that

1451
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:32,920
I do recall having like things of in the similar vein of like it's food, right for children, right?

1452
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,080
They're tiny little crackers and bits of cheese the thing is I never liked cheese so I would never eat

1453
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:43,640
Well, okay

1454
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:48,280
The lunchables that are good are the pepperoni pizza ones and it's because for me as a child

1455
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:52,680
They were too expensive for my mom to buy them for me. But as an adult. They are like

1456
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:56,600
Digi's over here in the lap of luxury with

1457
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:01,320
Mountains of tiny pepperoni

1458
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:07,720
They're like 250 they're like not even expensive. That's fine. You know, I relate did she I relate like back in the day

1459
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:13,160
I couldn't get like cereal or like kinder egg surprise is too expensive. So now I'm just

1460
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:16,760
As soon as I became an adult I was drowning in cereal

1461
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:19,480
Best thing about being an adult. Yes

1462
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:24,920
Did you have only I've only ever had the cheese pizza lunchables because when I was a child my mom was like the meat

1463
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
And these are disgusting and you're not allowed to have

1464
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:29,560
Because my mom she's wrong

1465
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:34,040
Okay, well the thing about the lunchables pizzas is that the key to them is that they come with

1466
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:41,720
It's three pizzas and you get nine pepperonis and the satisfaction of laying out your three pepperonis per pizza

1467
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:47,640
And then like take like each pizza you can it's like perfectly proportioned to devour in three bites

1468
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:53,640
So you have one bite per pepperoni. It is the most satisfying fucking meal in the world

1469
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:57,560
You need to put like a video on the main channel if you analyze really do

1470
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:02,040
Dude, I did I I made a uh, there's not on the main channel

1471
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:08,600
But on after dark there's a video of me eating nine lunchables pizzas and I got the worst of a cake of my life

1472
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:15,160
Do not eat more than one box of those. I know it's tempting because you're like, haha, I'm an adult

1473
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:21,240
It's only five bucks. I can do whatever I want if you eat more than four lunchables pizzas. You will feel like shit

1474
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:26,440
I'm just letting you know because all of it is just sugar every single element of it tastes like sugar

1475
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:34,520
The the the end of that message was I think asking us like if there's any other like crazy election people in our areas that like have a

1476
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:38,680
Kooky thing. Oh my god, that was a question. Don't you know about donald trump?

1477
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:43,880
I mean, there's always a crazy guy. I remember like the last time in the in the

1478
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:49,240
uk election for prime minister or whatever that there was a guy running

1479
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:54,360
And he was like what I think he was wearing a giant elmo suit or something

1480
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:57,960
And he was just elmer and nobody took it seriously

1481
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:01,800
But he got votes because people hate politicians and it's funny to vote for that guy

1482
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:07,240
Oh, okay. So there he was kind of like a goofing on the whole system. Yeah, there's there's there's usually a goofer or two

1483
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:11,320
There's a guy with a giant boot on his head. I think I've seen an image. Oh, yeah, I've seen the guy

1484
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:15,320
Are you having a vermin supreme?

1485
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:17,880
Politicians, yeah, maybe got him

1486
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,760
Right. Oh, Ben. What were you saying? I I know I've heard of vermin supreme

1487
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:25,720
I have a I have a a delta rune

1488
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:28,440
observation to make

1489
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:32,360
To jump back. How did that happen? Did anyone know this is a this is a question slash observation

1490
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:36,840
I want to know if anyone else feels the same way about this. I have a feeling I'll be the only one that thinks this

1491
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:43,480
Uh, was anyone else annoyed by the dear girl having a crush on susan. Why do you hate lesbians so much?

1492
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:49,560
Tell me explain it's not that I hate lesbians, Nate. Although I do but that's not the reason why I felt like it had no

1493
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:55,000
It had no relevance to the game that was like it was just oh by the way he he

1494
02:10:55,720 --> 02:11:01,800
Ship them. Yeah, it was it was irrelevant, but I mean there's more chapters to come. So whatever maybe it will be

1495
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:07,960
I know it's not because I want susie susie's mind and no one can have you know

1496
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:13,160
My reaction my reaction to hearing that like to the learning that uh, what's her name?

1497
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:15,560
The dear girl has a crush on susie is wow

1498
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:19,640
This dear girl is a fucking idiot and probably a terrible person

1499
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:25,160
Because susie is a freak and a monster who I don't who like bullies people

1500
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:27,960
Shubs them into lockers and threatens to bite their face off

1501
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:31,480
If you like someone if you like someone like that, you're probably

1502
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:35,400
Okay, first of all, you're probably fucking stupid says ben

1503
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:42,440
Ben first of all, I don't think anyone has actually seen susie bully someone because if you talk to everyone all she did

1504
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:48,440
Throw a ball and then they hated her. It seems like everyone's scared of her

1505
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,760
When she comes in the class they also say they no one actually seen her bully anyone

1506
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:56,600
They're just scared of her because she's big wait. Do they wait. Do they say that do they say

1507
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:00,840
There's an implication throughout the classroom that that that she

1508
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:07,400
Tries to put on a front and then they can sort of see that she's not but they are still scared of her because they're just kids

1509
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:14,040
I I think it's pretty evident that like regardless of whether she's done that or not like yet

1510
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:19,640
She's a 14 year old to 16 year old girl. Of course if she's attracted to other girls

1511
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:22,600
What would she more be more attracted to than the bad boy?

1512
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:27,240
You know the the bad one the the bad apple the one who seems like a bad ass

1513
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:34,440
I mean susie's like that sexy rebel kid from the breakfast club, you know, exactly. Yeah, uh, but she's obviously she likes her

1514
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:37,400
But like she's mean and she's nasty. I think she acts terribly

1515
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:41,320
I think if it weren't for the fact that undertale already did the lesbian thing

1516
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:44,840
You'd be like this doesn't feel as forced as it does here

1517
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:49,400
No, I don't think it feels forced. In fact, I think it feels totally natural

1518
02:12:49,480 --> 02:12:52,600
I think it feels like something that would definitely happen in real life

1519
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:58,360
But it also makes me mad. Well, it makes me mad and I don't think it's fair and I thought I just think it's

1520
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:03,080
I read girls and I was like Ben's such a Ben's a nice guy. Why won't you date him girls? Why?

1521
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,720
It's just no, I no no no

1522
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:07,640
I read that I read her being like oh

1523
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:11,640
I have such a crush on Susie and I just put and I just put the game down and I'm like

1524
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:15,800
I know I know of course you do but she's awful. She's awful

1525
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:19,400
Ben do you think it's implied that it is healthy of her to have that

1526
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:21,880
affection towards Susie

1527
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:27,240
I don't think the I don't think the game really makes much judgment either way. It's implied to be innocent enough

1528
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:31,080
Yeah, I mean, I think it's totally natural that she'd have that

1529
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:37,320
Like I don't think Susie has displayed herself as like an abject sociopath. I think she's

1530
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:42,840
She does she fucking she fucking shoves you into a locker and tells you she's gonna bite your face off

1531
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:45,560
You know that not the kids in class

1532
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:50,040
Also, I mean these people probably grew up in the town together. Don't you think it's possible

1533
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:56,440
There was a time in in you know back in antiquity where Susie and this person were kids and they may be played together

1534
02:13:56,440 --> 02:14:00,280
And they she has some positive memories based on that so even if she's being a jerk now

1535
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:05,560
Maybe there's a connection that's fan fiction. Hey, you just wrote fan fiction. Yeah, I got it consider it

1536
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:09,960
The dear girl. She's like naive and innocent and and soft and kind

1537
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:15,000
So she might admire the strengths that Susie has that she laughs true true

1538
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:20,680
I just yeah, we're all writing some good fan fiction right now. It's just you know, okay

1539
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:24,520
This is not this is not a story problem. This is not a the writing sucks problem

1540
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:29,880
This is a this is a this is a the world is terrible problem where it makes

1541
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:35,560
It makes sense and is totally fine and acceptable that someone that acts like Susie could have like, you know

1542
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:38,200
The affection and admiration of strangers for it

1543
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:46,200
People literally make fan pages for serial killers in real life. I don't that's true. Well, there you go. All right

1544
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:53,160
I mean, I get your right Ben proving proving that but people like are attracted to weird shit and sometimes just strength and

1545
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:57,800
Yeah, I don't you know, I want to I want to say on the basis of this conversation

1546
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:04,600
Before I never talk about Delta Rune again. Yeah, Delta Rune is perfectly fine

1547
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:09,240
I want to go on record as saying that anything negative I have to say about the game

1548
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:13,160
There's nothing wrong with it. I'm just old

1549
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:22,840
I don't I don't I have legitimate semi criticisms like this whole thing about how all my efforts to protect enemies from Susie

1550
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:25,400
We're literally pointless. Let me let me take that back

1551
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:30,600
It's not that there's nothing wrong with it potentially at all. Just that like it's it's overall good

1552
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:35,240
I'm just I don't I don't care. Something being good doesn't impress me

1553
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:41,960
Like I need things to be great for me to give a fuck because I've seen countless good things

1554
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:44,440
Like I've seen hundreds of thousands of good things

1555
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:50,440
So something being good is not impressive to me, but like I do think it's good. I'm not saying it's bad in any way

1556
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,520
It's fine. I get that. I

1557
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:55,640
I get the attitude that like sure it's good, but who cares

1558
02:15:56,280 --> 02:16:00,040
Because undertale for me is not impressive. I don't care about the good things

1559
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:02,920
I don't care if Delta Rune does something totally different from undertale

1560
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:09,320
It's just that undertale changed the game and awakened me a little bit more to like amazing things you can do

1561
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:14,600
And like I just want something like that to happen in delhi. It doesn't matter. What can we move on?

1562
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:18,920
Yeah, we should continue. We should continue. All right. Let's move on. Please. I want this to end

1563
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:22,440
I I hear you. Okay. This one's from pcp fan

1564
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:28,760
Unconditional love guy. That's yeah, okay. That's terrible real name. That's me. That's my

1565
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:34,360
My cock is right here. I'm really happy to hear you guys on a Saturday morning at 3 a.m

1566
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:40,040
I'm sorry. It was late. I just wanted to mention that there's now as many ptp episodes as there are

1567
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:43,880
Is the greatest anime of all time dragon ball super?

1568
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:49,240
I just wanted to know you could be any dragon ball character. Who would you be?

1569
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:53,480
We got several messages about which dragon ball character we would like to be

1570
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:56,040
I would be uh

1571
02:16:56,040 --> 02:17:01,640
Puar the shape-shifting cat. Oh, yeah, I would obviously be Goku because he's the best one

1572
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:07,080
I was gonna say you'd be popo because you look like popo. I don't even know who that is. I've never watched Dragon Ball Z

1573
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:09,080
Um

1574
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:13,480
Munchy the very slightly minorities definitely like completely mr. Popo

1575
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:19,080
It's not a race thing. It's the fact that he's a stocky boy with like big impressive girth and that's what munchy is

1576
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:23,800
Why not boo? Why not Majin boo who's big and pink because he's too fat. He's too fat to be munchy

1577
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:29,240
You're too fat to be munchy. Get the fuck out of here. I'd be sell because I'm into eugenics

1578
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:31,320
So, you know, yeah

1579
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:36,520
I'd be when I was a kid and we and dragon ball z was super popular and every kid was claiming

1580
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:43,240
A person. I was android 18. So I guess for nostalgia's sake. I feel like ben's frieza ben just seems like

1581
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:48,760
Cool, cool, I'll take it. I love it actually

1582
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:56,920
I'm actually sincerely complimented that I was frieza and not I don't know that one pig. Oh, uh, whatever. Yeah

1583
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:58,120
We're long

1584
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:03,320
If I can I know I changed I changed my mind. I'm gonna be oh, I forgot his name

1585
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:05,720
The the general blue

1586
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:10,680
General blue. Oh, that's the blonde, right? The nazi guy. The funny the funny gay nazi is really cool

1587
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:15,720
Magic mage by the way, I can totally see why you'd be android 18. That's the blonde one, right? Yeah

1588
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:21,640
I'm reflecting on it and I get it. Normally. I would pick like some cute girl

1589
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:25,240
I want to be right but like chi chi or something in dbc

1590
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:27,880
There is no who thinks chi chi when they think cute

1591
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:34,440
Like as a okay as a child she's an extremely sexualized little girl. So that sounds like something did you think though like

1592
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,200
There's no

1593
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:39,480
dbz girl who I really relate to

1594
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:43,560
What about vedel vedel's pretty good as for the well, that's what I'm thinking is like

1595
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:50,280
You can either be one of the girls or one of the like the guys who's with the girls and like ultimately if I had to pick

1596
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:54,120
It's like well vedel is the cutest I'd be gohan so I could be with vedel

1597
02:18:54,680 --> 02:18:59,400
That doesn't feel that different from my actual life. No wait, who wants to be gohan?

1598
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:01,560
Yeah, sure. He gets he's with vedel who's fine

1599
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:08,120
That's the square. What okay the hottest girls are like android 18 and vedel probably

1600
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:11,720
Yeah, that sounds about right. Oh, I don't we'll launch I guess from dragon balls

1601
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:19,000
Launch is pretty good. Launch is good too. I mean the thing is that all I don't think the girls in dragon balls year that hot

1602
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,920
Okay, what it comes down to is that the characters and dbz are all very basic

1603
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:29,080
Like every guy is just like a male ideal and every girl is just like your ideal girlfriend

1604
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:34,520
So it doesn't matter who you choose no matter what you get the perfect life like any dbz character you pick

1605
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:38,840
You just live perfect. I don't really like a curatoriyama's girl

1606
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:45,480
Or fucking tm. I like bulma. Bulma's looks nice. She's cute. Yeah, like everybody loves bulma. And if you

1607
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:47,480
Bulma is pretty badly

1608
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:53,000
Okay, who do you want to be do you want to be bulma so you can be a hot girl or vegeta so you could fuck a hot girl

1609
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:58,040
It doesn't matter all the characters are the same. I just like bulma. She she stole my husband

1610
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:00,920
I uh, I want

1611
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:08,040
Oh, I want to I want to be android 17 because uh, uh, he's a not he's the closest thing to a machine man

1612
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:10,280
That oh, yeah

1613
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:14,280
He has unlimited energy and he's in super and he looks the same age

1614
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:19,560
So maybe he's immortal. So I'm on is he the one with the red mohawk. No, that's no that's 16

1615
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:22,040
16

1616
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:29,080
Guys guys did pan ever grow up like because the last time I saw her was like she was in gt. Yeah

1617
02:20:29,560 --> 02:20:32,760
She wasn't gt. Yeah, jesse is telling us in the chat

1618
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:38,520
You guys are looking at this all wrong the correct answer is krillin because he's the only one but the actual normal good life

1619
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:46,200
It's true. I don't I don't like being krillin and getting to fuck android 18 is pretty fucking perfect

1620
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:49,880
Um, like I mean, okay if I'm thinking of it in terms of like

1621
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:56,040
Like when I think of it broadly, I just think that being krillin is no different from being gohan

1622
02:20:56,440 --> 02:21:02,280
Like if you're getting more specific krillin is krillin is like the best human in the entire series

1623
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:04,840
Jesse's pointing out that nobody hates krillin

1624
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:11,000
But I feel some people aren't too fond of gohan after what like he after gohan gave up like all his incredible power

1625
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:13,720
Like I said, like I think we're thinking of this broadly

1626
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:19,560
But if you're gonna get ultra specific like like I said all the girls are kind of the same all the guys are kind of the same

1627
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:21,480
So it's really just like

1628
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:24,040
If on a broad level like if you want to get specific

1629
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:26,040
I just don't really think about tbc

1630
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:32,120
And I don't know it well enough krillin or gohan the way that I respect someone like like goku or vege

1631
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:33,640
Yeah, you know

1632
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:38,760
It was like the least respectable guy at dbc for for in a way like he's he's a dead

1633
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:45,800
He's fucking dead. Vegeta then. Vegeta. Vegeta is the best. Goku is awful. Goku is objectively a character

1634
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:50,200
I don't like as I've grown older and uh, it makes me very upset

1635
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:56,680
If anyone can explain to me what goku did to like not not that he deserves more power

1636
02:21:56,680 --> 02:22:03,000
But literally what technique did he use to acquire more power than vegeta who objectively tried the hardest genetic

1637
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:05,000
genetic genetics

1638
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:10,280
Which doesn't make sense. He just he just is strong and it's really gay and I hated it forever

1639
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:15,800
Well, that's that's kind of what I love about dbc is that like the main character is like the least

1640
02:22:16,360 --> 02:22:21,960
Not okay. I won't say the least interesting character, but like among the central cast. He's like the least relatable

1641
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:27,640
And uh, I think that's almost appropriate like if someone's going to be fucking god

1642
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:31,400
Like the guy who solves every problem. You're not that fucking guy

1643
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:34,040
No audience member is the guy

1644
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:40,360
The moment in the kid boo saga when vegeta finally is he's like sitting there beaten and bloody on the ground like already

1645
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:44,840
Basically dead but somehow came back and goku's like super saying three fighting majin boo

1646
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:49,800
And he just has to come to terms with the fact that like yeah, you're better than me and it just always will be that way

1647
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:51,960
Man that fucking hit me hard as a kid

1648
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:58,840
Like like I think goku is there to remind us like we are not goku

1649
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:06,200
That's why vegeta is the best character in dragon ball like not even a contest like the realist dude the best guy

1650
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:14,200
Yeah, vegeta is the best character in in dragon ball z vegeta is the new main character when he you know comes in

1651
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:18,840
But if you read dragon ball goku is interesting and I like I believe you I believe you

1652
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:23,240
He's fun in dragon ball krillin krillin is the vegeta of dragon ball

1653
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:28,520
Okay, this is my theory on why why goku sucks in dragon ball z because goku is the main character of a comedy series

1654
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:30,520
And dragon ball z is not a comedy series

1655
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:36,280
We'll share and also he never mentally grew up even like a little bit. He never kissed his wife. How did he have children?

1656
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:42,200
Oh my god. I mean you don't have to kiss a woman to impregnate her. I'm just saying I'm just saying who says goku never kissed

1657
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:44,840
Chee-Chee goku did in dragon ball super

1658
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:50,280
There you go. Wait, what? Yeah, I don't wait. What? Yeah, he doesn't even know what a kiss is

1659
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:56,280
But what about all that pornography? I read. All right guys, let's we've been a way too long in this question

1660
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:59,320
Let's move on to the next one shall we? No, I'm fucking I'm fucking

1661
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:12,120
Regardless of why their bed gives a fuck about dragon ball z he grew up with this show and to hear this is obviously

1662
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:14,360
Fucking deeply disturbing

1663
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:19,080
This is like wait, there's something wrong here

1664
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:22,200
Something's rotten. I guess they're

1665
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:24,920
Corrupting his character by you know

1666
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:32,600
It is kind of ridiculous because he was like that in dragon ball like he's like chee-Chee like asked him to marry her

1667
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:35,960
And he said yeah for that real reason and he never kissed his wife

1668
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:41,640
What and it was implied that he he had no idea what he was getting himself into when he said he was married

1669
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:44,440
Why didn't she say something like

1670
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:51,400
How you know goku how you're supposed to talk to that. It's impossible. She couldn't just demand

1671
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:55,800
Why would you marry it kiss her like what the fuck like she has her fucking

1672
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:58,440
She's kind of got like

1673
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:03,160
I don't know. It's a weird relationship where like sometimes she's in control and but most of the time she's totally not

1674
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:06,760
What if she didn't while he was asleep? What if that was the only way it was safe because he's so strong

1675
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:10,040
You know, yeah, maybe he doesn't remember kissing her

1676
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:15,960
Do you guys ever read that it was like an article called like like how to fuck superman or like like something about like

1677
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:21,480
It was a it was like a think piece about how lois lane has sex with superman

1678
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:26,760
And it's about how like his sperm or so would be if his sperm is like proportionally strong as the rest of him

1679
02:25:26,840 --> 02:25:31,960
They would like shoot through her body and like rip her eggs to shreds literally happened in the movie hand cock

1680
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:35,960
Have any of you seen it or heard about it? Yeah, I've watched it. I don't remember how it dealt with this

1681
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:41,080
Yeah, will smith comes through the like roof of the trailer that they're fucking in

1682
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:45,720
Like he has to pull out so that he doesn't fucking murder her with his god damn. I don't remember that

1683
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:50,280
Yeah, there's a scene where they're fucking like and it cuts to the outside of the trailer

1684
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:55,720
Like two holes appear in the roof as he comes through the roof of the she's got a double barreled cock. I guess

1685
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:57,880
That's the only seat I've seen of that

1686
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:01,800
All right, guys, let's move on

1687
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:07,000
Let's keep going. Okay, ryan harper with a with a message. Here it is

1688
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:14,280
Hello, I am the democratically elected representative of the detractors of the new pcp theme song

1689
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:19,240
been sent to tell you guys that the whole issue with the theme song is that

1690
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:22,600
It is more of a joke

1691
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:24,680
than a theme the

1692
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:27,080
Whole bit with the guy

1693
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:29,800
doing a woman's voice

1694
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:32,760
It's funny

1695
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:37,960
But it's really force. Well, okay, it wouldn't be funny if it sounded natural

1696
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:41,640
Okay, but because

1697
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:46,680
Do any of us even disagree theme song like really and after hearing it

1698
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:54,600
We all agree the new theme song is wrong, right? No, why did you vote for it? Oh my god, yeah

1699
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:58,520
No, of course not did you we fucking voted for it and it won

1700
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:03,880
Yeah, I mean I voted for it because it was funny until we realized that when you hear it over and over again

1701
02:27:03,960 --> 02:27:06,920
It's doesn't it's not it doesn't function this way. I mean, I

1702
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:13,240
I like it like isn't it boring that every episode of adventure time opens them saying come along with me

1703
02:27:13,320 --> 02:27:18,040
Like we got it the first time guys. We don't need to hear it every time. Okay. Maybe you liked the second

1704
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:24,040
Maybe you liked the runner-up. I get it. I liked the runner-up too. I also voted for it. I did not listen

1705
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:27,480
It was the one that was just the word pcp in multiple ways

1706
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:36,280
You know what? Yeah, what would be ideal channel trailer? I don't think opening themes are necessary for this show

1707
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:42,280
Well, all right, we don't need to open this can of worms. I don't know. Let's talk about amongst ourselves the next meeting

1708
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:49,560
We'll see what's did you won't be there to speak his opinion. Yeah, that's right. I don't even care. I'm just letting you know

1709
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:51,640
What am I?

1710
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:56,840
I don't care for the rock breakdown, but whatever. Yeah, the rock. Okay

1711
02:27:56,840 --> 02:28:00,600
I didn't remember that that was the thing like when I voted for this theme song

1712
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:06,600
It was based on my vague memory of it from months prior. Oh, that sounds like your problem. Rock and roll

1713
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:11,640
That's true. Uh, I I just will say what I've been saying the entire time

1714
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:16,120
This has ever been even an idea is that we don't even need a new theme song. Why?

1715
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:22,280
We always did money don't know don't know so about that. It's about that community engagement

1716
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:29,000
Tom you're fucking insane. If you think that this is built more commuting engagement than I'm

1717
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:31,560
Supposed to you're insane

1718
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:39,560
The problem was that at first we were playing the wrong part of the song as the op but eventually we corrected that and we're playing a

1719
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:44,120
Better part of it and it was no longer a problem in my eyes. So like I don't know what initially

1720
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:48,840
I was a big complainer of us making the ed the op because of the fact

1721
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:53,400
That it sounded wrong as an op but then like we used a different part of it

1722
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:56,280
It was only five seconds long and it wasn't a problem anymore and like

1723
02:28:57,480 --> 02:29:00,120
It was like fixed before we made another op

1724
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:02,840
I guess

1725
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:05,960
This is what we

1726
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:12,280
Let him finish this all right say it to go all I wanted to say is that we clearly fucked up

1727
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:17,080
We should have referenced our good friend Jeff the master of what's in an op who could have helped us

1728
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:26,200
Yeah, he's right. Okay. Love. Love you Jeff next message. Here we go. This is from uh mackeys back. I think all right go

1729
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:31,960
Hey, Nate, you think you're so fucking cool with your electric skateboard. Well, listen to this

1730
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:38,440
That's me doing a real grind

1731
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:43,080
Yeah, you do that on your stupid heavy electrical piece of shit

1732
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:47,240
What's that Tony hawk

1733
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:55,240
Holy shit, was that bob burn quest was that bob's burgers calling in i'll take ten please

02:29:55,880 --> 02:29:59,400
I want to see i want to see nat you show up to like a challenge

1735
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:03,400
You show up to like meet this challenge and this guy. He's there wearing like, you know

1736
02:30:03,480 --> 02:30:07,000
Like a hemp parka or whatever the fucking zoomers wear or something

1737
02:30:07,240 --> 02:30:10,520
He's probably got a man bun, you know in peach fuzz or whatever

1738
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:16,200
He's looking like a real cool skater guy and you show up on your like motorized electric skateboard

1739
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:21,480
Wearing like, you know wrist pads and like a little a helmet and stuff and like a knapsack

1740
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:24,280
With cheese sticks and pepperoni

1741
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:31,320
The thing is I wish that was me because I fell again today and it hurt a lot again

1742
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:34,280
Dude, um, I'm just saying also. I just want to say

1743
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:40,520
It's it's really put in the fear of god into me and I'm getting more scared every time I ride because now I know

1744
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:45,080
What I have to do and how bad it hurt when I fall made did you did you wear gloves this time?

1745
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:50,840
Absolutely not mage abs. I have not learned my lesson yet. I'm cut listen. It's not so bad

1746
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:53,960
It's I was just walking. I was just walking

1747
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:59,080
After rfck con me and crack were walking to his car. I was just walking along the sidewalk

1748
02:30:59,480 --> 02:31:01,480
You know playing pokemon go

1749
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:05,080
Just my foot missed the sidewalk and I just fell and ate shit

1750

On my on my right palm right now. We're like tore a bunch of the skin off the pavement

1752
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:21,320
So I you don't you don't need an electric skateboard to risk pain and injuries as you're as you're getting around

1753
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:23,880
Is risking pain and injuries

1754
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:28,120
It's really the human condition. He's right. He's right. This is why we need to be robots

1755
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:34,520
I could not have tell how legitimate that call was but like my mental image of a dude just like nonchalantly being like

1756
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:40,440
Hey, Nate, you think you're so fucking cool. Yeah, like busting a sick grind and be like, yeah, fuck you dude

1757
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:47,000
Like is that not the coolest image you could ever imagine? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's one of the best calls of all time

1758
02:31:47,800 --> 02:31:50,920
Mackie's back. Well way to go. I am thoroughly pwned

1759
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:53,400
I'm thoroughly pwned by that

1760
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:57,880
I'm gonna work on my grinding skills. Well, I'm not when I'm not terrified to get back on the board

1761
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:04,920
Uh, okay next call. I fell on a skateboard when I was five and I never got back on so I feel you. It's scary. It hurts a lot

1762
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:10,600
It's real bad. I need fucking elbow pads. I'm tearing my fucking body up. My dad is a big time skateboarder

1763
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:16,200
He's got a bunch of dhs tapes of him fucking busting mad shit on a half pipe and he tried to get me in when I was a kid

1764
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:19,240
Yeah, busting fat loads on that half pipe dude. Just busting him out there

1765
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:25,960
And I like fell once and was like never fucking again. So that's why he fell once you said and then just stopped

1766
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:32,200
Yeah, when I was like five. Oh, you did. Yeah. Okay. Okay. It's fucking hurts. It's serious. Um, yeah

1767
02:32:32,600 --> 02:32:36,360
All right. Yeah, here we go. Here we go. Next one. Uh, this is number six out of 10. Yes

1768
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:40,680
I'm 17 years old calling in with a message. Let's see what he's got for us

1769
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:44,280
Hey guys, so I was reading this book called how to win friends and influence people a book that

1770
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:51,320
And uh, one of their principles is um, do not criticize other people

1771
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:56,280
They say that just to not misconstrue what they mean criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive

1772
02:32:56,280 --> 02:33:01,480
And it usually makes them strive to justify themselves. You guys agree with that or you guys completely disagree. I agree

1773
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:08,760
This is a great question. Okay. Okay. I like criticizing people when I don't care about like

1774
02:33:09,240 --> 02:33:15,320
You know coming to a some sort of agreement with them. I just want them to be annoyed because they made me annoyed

1775
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:20,200
I'm sure that's usually, you know, that's just bad. Well, that means you're not trying to win friends or influence

1776
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:28,840
Yeah, okay, don't you can criticize go you can you can criticize people but you should credit there's like

1777
02:33:29,560 --> 02:33:31,320
I don't know. You just have to do it the right way

1778
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:36,840
You just have to do it in a way that shows that you don't like dislike them or think that they're dumb or that they suck

1779
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:43,640
I like in like a like way like an inception way you want them to like kind of like think that it's their own idea

1780
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:49,960
Right, you gotta ask questions instead of make statements. Yeah, if they're forced to answer badly themselves, it's more impactful

1781
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:54,280
You want to criticize with like well, you don't just want to say oh, well this sucks

1782
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:59,000
You want to be like, okay. Well, I really like the way you did this but this other thing over

1783
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:02,840
I don't know if it really works with this like, you know, you want to like you want to give a little

1784
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:08,120
Nate does this all the time every time we're on the pcp if Nate ever says, uh, I hear what you're saying

1785
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:12,840
That means what you just said was retarded, but I'm not gonna say that that's me saying it in a diplomatic way

1786
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:21,400
Well, okay, like I think that in most situations people are not looking for criticism like

1787
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:24,360
Yeah, um, yeah, just just about 12 hours ago

1788
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:31,080
I put out an album and there was this one guy who left a super long comment like criticizing every fucking song on it and

1789
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:39,000
When I read through it, all I could think was this guy has no idea what my intentions were nor what I think

1790
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:41,480
Of what I've released

1791
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:46,520
Like his criticisms have nothing to do with my feelings on the songs or how I feel about him

1792
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:50,840
But he phrased it in such a way like he was trying to be helpful and it's just like dude

1793
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:55,160
Like you can't help me if you don't know what I'm trying to do

1794
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:59,640
And when people are criticized the reason they go on the defensive is that

1795
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:04,360
They have thought through this more than what they are saying

1796
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Like I think the average person

1797
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:09,960
He turned on to us for criticizing

1798
02:35:12,040 --> 02:35:14,040
Sure

1799
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:21,240
There is a huge difference between criticizing something

1800
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:25,320
To the person's face and doing so elsewhere

1801
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:30,440
And like this guy this guy who I'm talking about on my album literally said you're a critic

1802
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:35,160
So I guess whatever and I was just like what does me being your critic have to do

1803
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:40,120
With the fact that you're commenting on this because when I criticize things I don't leave them

1804
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:46,280
On the guy who made its page like I I've never made a comment that

1805
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:50,200
Reki Kawahara author of sort out online has read

1806
02:35:50,520 --> 02:35:55,080
If you know if someone if someone is looking for criticism, that's one thing in general

1807
02:35:55,480 --> 02:36:00,040
I would say okay. I I I do believe in not

1808
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:04,360
Giving criticism to someone unless they specifically asked for it

1809
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:08,520
Like I don't go out of my way to tell someone if I think they're fucking up

1810
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:16,360
Because and I sometimes I feel selfish for that reason because I know that criticizing someone who is not looking for criticism will only

1811
02:36:17,240 --> 02:36:21,480
Honestly, it might benefit them to hear it if no one else has told them that they're fucking up

1812
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:26,840
Yeah, but it can also make them hate you a lot. Yeah. Yeah. So that's a cost you have to pay

1813
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:33,400
The reason I don't do it is for selfish reasons because I know that it will not it will usually not benefit them because most people will not

1814
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:35,720
Hear it if they're not looking for it

1815
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:38,760
And they will just hate me and I don't want people to hate me

1816
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:42,200
So I just am like, well, I'm just gonna let this person figure it out on their own

1817
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:46,200
I think because that makes sense because that's because that's how it always has to do

1818
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:51,800
A person will not listen to your criticism unless they have already become mentally ready to receive it

1819
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:54,360
I think one step further though, which maybe is too much

1820
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:58,200
But I just think that like, okay, if I've got like my let's say like friends around me

1821
02:36:58,200 --> 02:37:00,760
I see them fucking up and I don't say anything

1822
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:06,120
I personally worry that one day they'll be mad at me for allowing them and not like saying anything

1823
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:09,080
You know what I might be too passive

1824
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:13,080
On on that end like I have benefited greatly from people

1825
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:16,440
Like criticizing me when I didn't want to hear like in the long run

1826
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:18,920
I have looked back and been very grateful

1827
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:21,480
Any specific or credits

1828
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:23,800
No for criticizing me

1829
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:29,960
Um on things and and there are other times when I'm like, I wait, I wish that someone had criticized me

1830
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:32,600
There was one criticism I gave to you Ben recently

1831
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:37,320
I could wait what there was one that I gave to you that I think will benefit you in the long run

1832
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:40,920
You seem to sort of agree with that criticism of was it about uh

1833
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:44,280
Being too like accepting of like

1834
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:48,840
No, no, it was that you you just sing too much and it's not funny

1835
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:52,920
That was the one have you noticed that I have stopped doing it?

1836
02:37:52,920 --> 02:37:57,880
I have noticed that I have noticed that so I think Ben singing is mostly hilarious

1837
02:37:58,200 --> 02:38:03,000
In small doses sure absolutely specifically if he is singing

1838
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:09,400
Neutral milk hotel. I don't get the five six seven oh nine thing that he does all the time

1839
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:13,720
That's that's an endless war thing. So there you go. Okay, whatever

1840
02:38:13,960 --> 02:38:17,000
Uh, it doesn't matter that speaking of stuff like that though

1841
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:24,360
That's that's making me think like the reason why a lot of artists tend to be self deprecating and openly self deprecating

1842
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:28,680
Is that they want to criticize themselves publicly as to like

1843
02:38:29,640 --> 02:38:31,640
Allow people to like agree

1844
02:38:31,880 --> 02:38:33,880
So that they you know, it's like nobody

1845
02:38:34,360 --> 02:38:35,320
It is it well

1846
02:38:35,320 --> 02:38:39,400
It's a shield and it's also an invitation because like if I say something of mine sucks

1847
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:45,480
I want somebody I don't want people to say no no no no no no no no what I want people to do is like to

1848
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:47,880
To take that as like

1849
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:53,560
An opportunity to say yeah, I I you know because like people are generally very

1850
02:38:54,360 --> 02:39:00,120
You know guarded with their criticism. They don't want to make enemies with anyone. They don't want to make someone upset

1851
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:03,160
So like how do you say please criticize me?

1852
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:05,160
um

1853
02:39:05,240 --> 02:39:09,960
Like you I mean you say it like that but like a lot I don't think about it a lot and I think the reason people

1854
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:13,640
like me self deprecate is is like uh like a

1855
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:17,240
A sub uh, what am I thinking of a way to do that?

1856
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:21,240
Subconscious way of doing that. Okay. I so this is

1857
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:27,000
Okay, I think that people probably have the perception that we are all a bunch of like hyper critical

1858
02:39:27,560 --> 02:39:31,800
assholes right if anything and I don't necessarily feel that way I

1859
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:36,440
I mean obviously you can do too much, but I respect I respect people

1860
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:41,960
Well, you can be an asshole and criticize someone who doesn't want criticism and no good comes of it

1861
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:44,760
And you just hurt feelings and nothing good happens and obviously that's bad

1862
02:39:45,080 --> 02:39:50,040
I respect people who are willing to criticize someone if they honestly believe see them fucking up

1863
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:56,440
I don't think that I do. I think that I am too unwilling to open my mouth if I see someone fucking up

1864
02:39:56,440 --> 02:39:57,960
I'm too I'm too willing to be like

1865
02:39:58,040 --> 02:40:02,200
I'm just gonna let them deal with it because they're not gonna want to listen to what I have to say about this

1866
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:08,520
Then I will tell you right here and now I will only criticize someone to their face if they ask for it

1867
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:12,680
I'll criticize people all fucking day behind their back

1868
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:18,040
And that could mean in the form of a long form youtube video viewed by seven million people

1869
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:23,000
But like if it's to someone's face, I'm not gonna do it. They don't ask for it because like

1870
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:30,280
I don't believe you can take it like I've criticized people and they haven't been able to take it

1871
02:40:30,280 --> 02:40:36,360
I've had people come to me asking for criticism and not be able to take it and like I don't have fucking patience for that

1872
02:40:36,440 --> 02:40:42,760
Like I need to have a certain level of trust in you that you actually are going to take this criticism seriously or else

1873
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:46,360
I don't like it's even if I think it can help you

1874
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:52,280
I don't trust you to take it the way I want you to and to like actually learn something from it

1875
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:55,080
Like fuck you. You don't get my criticism. You don't get that help

1876
02:40:55,400 --> 02:41:02,120
Did you you do separate you separate people who don't take it well and people who just kindly disagree?

1877
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:08,040
Yeah, but like I there there are people who I mean if you're gonna

1878
02:41:08,600 --> 02:41:11,640
If if let's say somebody comes to me asking for criticism

1879
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:15,080
And then I tell them my criticism and then they disagree

1880
02:41:15,880 --> 02:41:20,120
And then maybe they they sway me or they don't if I feel like

1881
02:41:20,680 --> 02:41:24,040
I've offered my opinion and you just dismissed my opinion

1882
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:28,440
Then I'm just gonna be like well. Why did you ask for my opinion if you were so sure of my of yourself?

1883
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:31,160
Remember remember Dave did you remember Dave?

1884
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:33,800
Uh, I assume you mean the german guy

1885
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:40,280
The german the german writer he was a big part of why I developed like he was a guy who would constantly ask for criticism

1886
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:42,360
And then argue against all of it

1887
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:47,320
Perfect case study. Yeah, perfect. He's like the he's like the he's like he's like patient zero

1888
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:55,080
For uh, he it's like he's like a cartoonish example of someone who would literally a good reason for why I have trust issues today

1889
02:41:55,480 --> 02:42:01,480
Might be this particular individual later. He moved on to I mean, I think most people have better sense than Dave

1890
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:07,160
Um, but Dave would come to me and he would say hey ben. I wrote this like story

1891
02:42:07,880 --> 02:42:13,000
Or I drew this comic. He was mostly into writing like a novel at the time. I wrote this like chapter of a novel

1892
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,960
What do you think and I would read it and be like, okay?

1893
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:18,040
You know no offense

1894
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:21,160
But your english is not fluid and then he would say well

1895
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:25,080
I can't sell anything if I write it in german and then I would say well

1896
02:42:25,160 --> 02:42:30,200
Your english isn't good enough to sell in english. So no fucking nobody writes in german

1897
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:34,120
Nobody reads books written in german. I mean to be honest

1898
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:39,720
I didn't think that the humor was very good even if I ignored all the weird like like like esl like

1899
02:42:40,280 --> 02:42:42,120
Gaffes and goofs and whatever

1900
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:46,520
But you know even aside might like the the first thing the first thing every time would be like

1901
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:50,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry if you don't you don't want to hear this but your english just isn't good enough

1902
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:56,760
You do not read like a fluent english speaker like you shouldn't you need to you need to either write in german or improve your english

1903
02:42:56,760 --> 02:42:59,320
Like one or the other and he just wouldn't fucking listen

1904
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:03,320
He would and then he would argue against me about why his english was actually right

1905
02:43:03,640 --> 02:43:07,880
Like why it wasn't as bad like why why it wasn't as bad as I was telling him

1906
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:11,640
Yeah, even if it's not as bad it has to be if you want to be published

1907
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:16,120
Yeah, yeah, at least get a proofreader. You know, it's not yeah like get get someone to literally

1908
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:20,280
I would tell him that I would tell him you need an editor or a proofreader or something

1909
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:23,560
And he'd be like no, I can't afford one and I'd be like well, sorry

1910
02:43:23,880 --> 02:43:28,840
We were supposed to be his proofreaders like he was coming to people

1911
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:34,760
But then he would argue and he would argue against our proofreads. Right. It was really fucking ridiculous. Okay. Yeah

1912
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:41,160
Okay, in those situations. Yeah, that's stupid. I was some people are just hopeless and their ego is too big to accept

1913
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:44,040
You know, whatever criticism. I mean not even saying he's got a huge head

1914
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:48,200
But like if he's not gonna take the the points then there's just useless. It's just useless

1915
02:43:48,840 --> 02:43:55,400
I don't I don't know. He was so set. He was like, no, I can't write in german. Why it's your fucking people read people read

1916
02:43:55,640 --> 02:44:00,120
Right people read in germany. This guy this guy sounds like somebody amazon bestseller

1917
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:05,560
Like like like I would I would think that writing in german would be a huge advantage because that's a much more niche market

1918
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:07,720
Right, I guess not everybody knows about marketing

1919
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:09,880
So

1920
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:15,400
What was what was he writing anyway? Was it like something anime related or something? It was like a

1921
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:20,840
Furry weird fantasy. Oh, of course. He's a german furry all germans. Yeah

1922
02:44:21,240 --> 02:44:26,760
He was he was a furry. He was writing. It was like a sort of fantasy. What is it called when you're a furry, but it's all scales

1923
02:44:27,400 --> 02:44:29,080
Scaly scaly

1924
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:31,080
We all know instantly

1925
02:44:31,080 --> 02:44:33,080
I was asking I was asking

1926
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:38,840
Uh, this is all about birds. I I had hoped that there was a special word. We were talking about this on iam games, weren't we?

1927
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:43,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, and apparently. Oh, no, variety fuckers. It's just avian. It's not variety fucker scop killers, wasn't it?

1928
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:49,000

1929
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:51,080

1933
02:45:10,360 --> 02:45:11,560
cringe compulation

1934
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:15,480
You know when you like think about like at random times like the shittiest thing

1935
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:20,760
Or like me not even like like maybe like a minor thing that you did in middle school that you're just like

1936
02:45:21,080 --> 02:45:23,080
Where do I fucking begin?

1937
02:45:23,160 --> 02:45:25,160
I have one. I have one

1938
02:45:27,400 --> 02:45:33,320
Small man boy a non a non man. I have one. So what's that for you guys my blog?

1939
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:41,960
Okay, that's okay. Okay. I I have one that I honestly feel so terrible and awkward and weird about to this day

1940
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:44,520
and I and I feel like

1941
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:46,040
it's it it's

1942
02:45:46,040 --> 02:45:52,280
I've like specifically avoided ever telling the story because it's uncomfortable for me in a way that does not feel fun

1943
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:54,360
Sure. Okay. Um

1944
02:45:54,680 --> 02:45:56,680
Maybe don't tell it. Are you gonna tell us now?

1945
02:45:57,240 --> 02:45:59,960
I mean, I could I don't think I'd be happy to hear it

1946
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:05,800
Objectively speaking. I don't think it's anything that anyone is going to crucify people probably will throw it in your face

1947
02:46:05,880 --> 02:46:10,360
And it doesn't matter if it's bad. It'll if it makes you uncomfortable then, you know, well, I don't know

1948
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:14,680
I think I'm I feel like it's maybe a little overblown. All right. The point is we were we were we were in like

1949
02:46:15,160 --> 02:46:19,640
Fucking middle school. I was like probably in like fifth grade or something or maybe fourth grade whatever

1950
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:21,560
and

1951
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:24,360
I don't know why I did this. I don't know why I thought this was funny

1952
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:28,200
but like we were doing like practice speeches for

1953
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:29,560
uh,

1954
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:33,320
fucking like student government like elections like we were

1955
02:46:34,600 --> 02:46:41,080
Sitting in the auditorium and we were like the the people who were running for student office were were practicing their speeches

1956
02:46:41,560 --> 02:46:42,600
and

1957
02:46:42,600 --> 02:46:47,080
one of the girls running was like a couple years older than me. I didn't know her and

1958
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:50,520
she she gives a speech about treasurer and I like

1959
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:56,360
And like this is this is not in front of like a big crowd or anything like that. It's just like and um

1960
02:46:58,040 --> 02:47:02,440
The she she gives a speech about running for treasurer or something and like I think she asked for questions

1961
02:47:03,080 --> 02:47:09,480
And I think and I decided it would be funny if I like raised my hand and asks like how does a guy get a date with you?

1962
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:14,440
And as like a joke and I was like and like I think it really embarrassed her

1963
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:19,640
And I felt terrible afterwards. I was like, what a weird. Yeah in hindsight like what what a weird

1964
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:22,760
Thing to do like oh that's so mean too because it's like

1965
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:25,320
Oh, she's trying to like do something here and you just hit her with that

1966
02:47:25,640 --> 02:47:31,960
You know, it's funny that you're upset like with yourself for that because I feel like the average douche bag does that every week

1967
02:47:32,040 --> 02:47:35,480
And I mean maybe yeah, that just shows that you're not such a bad guy

1968
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:40,520
But it was very in hindsight. I realized I think I realized as soon as I said it was out of my mouth

1969
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:46,760
When I saw the look on her face that I was like that this was like a very like demeaning thing to do and I had like

1970
02:47:47,320 --> 02:47:48,520
It's real

1971
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:54,840
That's like the worst really where where like the you know the when you you say something and it wasn't even funny

1972
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:59,240
And it wasn't even for a good joke like like the first time in your life where you

1973
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:01,400
Something you say

1974
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:06,600
Doesn't go the way you thought it would in your head and that's that realization of like oh wait

1975
02:48:06,840 --> 02:48:09,720
Like oh, oh no, I heard a real person's feelings. Yeah

1976
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:12,360
God, I don't have a specific story like that

1977
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:15,320
But I have had that feeling before of like just fucking up

1978
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:17,880
Terribly in front of people

1979
02:48:18,440 --> 02:48:19,960
When I thought I wouldn't

1980
02:48:19,960 --> 02:48:23,960
I've got a I've got a small story about this that does haunt me to this day. This was the weirdest

1981
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:30,760
Okay, this was the first time in my life. I attempted to make any kind of sexual advance on anyone

1982
02:48:31,320 --> 02:48:34,920
Uh, nice. It was it was nice. Okay. Well, whatever. I'll let you be the judge

1983
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:39,000
Um, there was there was a girl in my class. I don't know what was going on

1984
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,200
We were like out. I don't know like feel there. Whatever. We were just in school somewhere and uh, um

1985
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:50,600
Like this girl was a well-known slut and I was like, oh, yeah, all right. This will be easy like yeah

1986
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:56,680
Don't worry. I thought she was kind of cute. You know, I'm she likes to park in cars with boys. Exactly exactly

1987
02:48:57,080 --> 02:48:58,280
so

1988
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:03,640
I forget what was going on, but this is how I communicated my sexual interest in her

1989
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:06,200
um, okay, she like

1990
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:10,520
We were I don't know what was going on, but like she like offered her hand. Oh god. This is this is

1991
02:49:11,640 --> 02:49:15,960
She there was something going on. She like held her hand. What was that? Where were you?

1992
02:49:16,040 --> 02:49:19,640
We were we were outside like doing something like the two of us

1993
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:25,240
Um, was this like a school dance or something? It might have literally been a band camp actually

1994
02:49:25,560 --> 02:49:27,080
okay, um

1995
02:49:27,080 --> 02:49:32,920
And the way that I communicated my interest was she like held at her hand

1996
02:49:33,640 --> 02:49:38,280
Like I grabbed her hand. There was like she had like two fingers up

1997
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:44,680
And I I made the like jacking off gesture on her fingers with my hand

1998
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:47,160
This is what I did

1999
02:49:47,400 --> 02:49:49,160
What oh

2000
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:53,640
And she just was like what and I was like that's that's like so forward

2001
02:49:53,800 --> 02:50:00,600
It was I know it was incredibly forward like okay. There was we were kind of friends. There had been jokes about sex

2002
02:50:00,840 --> 02:50:04,520
Uh, but like this was what I chose to do as my

2003
02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:08,840
Method you mean do you mean you guys I was probably sex before or no

2004
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:12,600
Well, no, I mean, I was a virgin for many more years after this. She definitely was not

2005
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:17,640
In fact this same girl, but you and her had joked about sex. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know as a group

2006
02:50:17,800 --> 02:50:21,640
That's less awkward. I guess if like the tone had been set to like make humorous

2007
02:50:21,800 --> 02:50:29,160
No, well the thing is it wasn't it wasn't like on that level. I made it real in a way that was not anticipated by anyone

2008
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:32,200
I want to know how how old were you? I want to know how old were you?

2009
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:37,800
I was pro I was between 16 and 18. I think somewhere in that oh too old too. Yeah way too old

2010
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:42,280
It was it was too real and weird and uh, no no no no no

2011
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:48,040
It's like when like it's like when the nerdy guy who nobody really likes you get paired up with in class to do something

2012
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:53,880
Your girl in this example and he like starts coming on to you in some ways and you're like, oh christ, dude

2013
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:59,080
What the fuck yeah, what is this when he like when he like when he like pulls out his katana

2014
02:51:00,040 --> 02:51:04,600
Like behind the school and like corners you with it and is like we're gonna you're gonna figure enough

2015
02:51:04,840 --> 02:51:12,680
We're gonna do sex stuff now and you're like, oh no not again. All right. That's it. What anybody else got when they want to share

2016
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:15,640
I have a story that is something I regret

2017
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:18,360
Okay. Oh, yeah

2018
02:51:18,360 --> 02:51:23,000
um, it was uh in school. I remember there was this one classmate that I was really

2019
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:26,680
Really did not get along with him

2020
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:30,760
Um, it was because he kept badgering me rather than like I badgered him

2021
02:51:30,920 --> 02:51:33,160
I don't know what his problem was with me, honestly

2022
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:35,240
But he was he was bad to everyone

2023
02:51:35,240 --> 02:51:40,760
But I feel like he was picking on me the most but it was hilarious because he was the shortest guy in the class

2024
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:43,480
And I was the short and I was the tallest person in class

2025
02:51:43,480 --> 02:51:47,080
So it was like a bit a bit of a hilarious duo now that I think about it

2026
02:51:47,560 --> 02:51:50,360
And he's such an odd yeah, and he was so I was walking with my friend

2027
02:51:50,920 --> 02:51:55,320
In the hallway and he was behind us with his friends and he was heckling me

2028
02:51:55,480 --> 02:51:57,880
I don't remember what he was saying, but he kept, you know

2029
02:51:59,240 --> 02:52:05,080
Agitating me. So what I did I just I I I formed the fist and I put all my strength in it

2030
02:52:05,160 --> 02:52:09,800
And and I turned around and I tried to punch him, but I ended up punching someone else

2031
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:12,440
and I

2032
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:16,280
And I felt so bad the guy ended up laughing at the guy that got punched

2033
02:52:16,360 --> 02:52:19,880
And I was like, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it. I was gonna punch him and and

2034
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:24,200
The guy ran away. I probably punched him really hard. I think he cried

2035
02:52:25,080 --> 02:52:33,160
He ran away and cried the violent violent violent violence has no no no don't off switch for for the lethal force

2036
02:52:33,560 --> 02:52:38,120
That was I think like one of the last punches I ever threw and now that I think about it

2037
02:52:38,520 --> 02:52:41,160
Just another story of her going too far

2038
02:52:41,800 --> 02:52:45,320
Just going going too far in this mad maxi and wasteland that is

2039
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:47,640
Lithuania in the

2040
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:54,760
What early 90s? I regret two things. I regret punching that four guy and I regret not punching the other guy after first

2041
02:52:55,880 --> 02:52:58,920
His defenses were down at that point. It was a prime opportunity

2042
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
All right, anybody else anybody else

2043
02:53:03,080 --> 02:53:07,160
I don't know how to answer this question because I am a living cringe compilation

2044
02:53:07,160 --> 02:53:13,880
And I could think of a thousand stories at least as embarrassing. I can sum up jumping in I have one. Oh my god

2045
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:20,920
Hit us up. Hit us up. I'm jumping in at like the last five minutes of the podcast

2046
02:53:21,320 --> 02:53:25,880
Because this conversation brought back a memory so traumatic and so cringy

2047
02:53:26,920 --> 02:53:31,320
That I've never told this story in my life. Okay, I vowed to never tell it

2048
02:53:32,360 --> 02:53:37,560
It's kept me up at night for like 20 years probably longer

2049
02:53:37,800 --> 02:53:39,800
It's

2050
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:45,560
It's the worst thing I've ever done to another human being in my life and it haunts me to this day

2051
02:53:46,040 --> 02:53:50,200
I was like a little kid. I was like seven or eight years old

2052
02:53:50,600 --> 02:53:53,560
Just a little stupid little bastard baby shit

2053
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:57,000
And I was at a carnival with my mom

2054
02:53:58,120 --> 02:53:59,320
And uh

2055
02:53:59,320 --> 02:54:03,800
They had the carnival games and there was a girl who was probably in her 20s or late teens

2056
02:54:03,800 --> 02:54:07,560
You know working at the carnival games with the balloons and you throw the thing at the bottles or whatever

2057
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:10,200
And I went up to there with my mom

2058
02:54:10,440 --> 02:54:11,480
And

2059
02:54:11,480 --> 02:54:14,840
I don't know how it got brought. I think she had like a little kid with her or like a

2060
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:19,400
She mentioned that she had a kid or something. I don't know somehow

2061
02:54:20,040 --> 02:54:22,040
It got revealed that this uh

2062
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:27,640
This this lady working at the carnival game had a kid of her own and I was just like this

2063
02:54:27,800 --> 02:54:31,560
I was a little baby. I would never do this ever as an adult

2064
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:34,440
Ever

2065
02:54:34,520 --> 02:54:40,120
But when I found out that she had a kid the first thing that came to my mind and I said it out loud to her

2066
02:54:41,400 --> 02:54:42,440
was

2067
02:54:42,440 --> 02:54:45,240
Wow a cheating carney and a bad mother

2068
02:54:45,960 --> 02:54:47,960
What?

2069
02:54:54,680 --> 02:54:59,720
I do not condone that I did this. This is the worst thing I've ever said to a human being

2070
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:02,360
You said that when I was seven

2071
02:55:02,360 --> 02:55:05,080
I have two I have two questions. I have two questions one

2072
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:09,800
What made her a cheating carney and two and two what made her a bad mother?

2073
02:55:10,360 --> 02:55:16,360
No, nothing. She didn't need to do anything to me. She did nothing to me. She didn't even cheat. She didn't even cheat or anything

2074
02:55:16,440 --> 02:55:20,040
I had no nothing against her whatsoever. I was just for race for class

2075
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:26,040
I hadn't even like thrown the dart yet to confirm that she was cheating in any way

2076
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:31,000
Oh guys

2077
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:35,080
In my stupid like bastard baby shit right like eight-year-old brain

2078
02:55:35,480 --> 02:55:40,200
I just for some reason associated like carnies with like people don't like carnies because they cheat

2079
02:55:40,280 --> 02:55:43,560
You know like like how oh people don't like lawyers like it was one of those things

2080
02:55:43,640 --> 02:55:47,880
I assumed that it was like a stereotype and I just fucking like it just came to my brain

2081
02:55:48,120 --> 02:55:51,960
And I said that and the look on this woman's face. She was so

2082
02:55:53,320 --> 02:55:59,000
Yeah, did your mom hear you did your mom hear this? Oh, yeah, she heard me and like the woman was so livid

2083
02:55:59,160 --> 02:56:03,640
She said get the get out of here. You can't play this game. Get get away from me, which I don't blame her for at all

2084
02:56:04,040 --> 02:56:06,600
Yeah, I would have done that. I like if a kid had come up to me and done that

2085
02:56:06,680 --> 02:56:09,720
I probably would have left over the counter and kicked it in the face and gone to prison

2086
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:14,680
So I don't blame this woman at all. She was like livid. She said go away you little brat and like

2087
02:56:15,240 --> 02:56:17,240
The like the worst part is

2088
02:56:17,320 --> 02:56:20,280
Like my mother because she loves me and she's my mom

2089
02:56:20,760 --> 02:56:26,600
Like my mother like stood stood there after I like ran away like a little fucking coward

2090
02:56:26,840 --> 02:56:30,840
My mom stood there and like defended me. Oh, yeah

2091
02:56:31,400 --> 02:56:35,640
That's a losing battle. That's a losing battle. Yeah, like oh, he didn't know what he was saying

2092
02:56:35,640 --> 02:56:37,640
He's just like no, I knew what I was saying

2093
02:56:37,720 --> 02:56:42,360
You like like she should she should not have defended me. She should have beat the fuck out of me

2094
02:56:42,600 --> 02:56:44,600
like in the public square

2095
02:56:44,680 --> 02:56:45,880
and um

2096
02:56:45,880 --> 02:56:51,240
I don't know since you guys were all debasing yourselves. Yeah, and revealing your darkest most shameful moments

2097
02:56:51,240 --> 02:56:53,240
I thought I'd reveal mine

2098
02:56:53,560 --> 02:57:00,280
My my story my shameful story is is is it is actually the most like painful memory that I have

2099
02:57:00,600 --> 02:57:06,360
The most it's it's yeah, that's that's the one thing that I remember is being like that one that you're ashamed of doing

2100
02:57:07,080 --> 02:57:10,920
Yeah, oh, yeah, okay. What the fuck that's the most shameful you've got

2101
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:17,640
Yeah, I mean I hurt someone's feet. I hurt someone's feelings. All right. All right. You know what I'll share one

2102
02:57:17,880 --> 02:57:22,120
I'll just share the one that that's probably the strongest in my mind just to fucking

2103
02:57:22,520 --> 02:57:24,520
So when I was in fifth grade

2104
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:27,080
It was valentine's day

2105
02:57:27,080 --> 02:57:33,480
And I was really I was really hoping to get some kind of love letter from several girls in my class

2106
02:57:33,560 --> 02:57:35,240
I had a crush on

2107
02:57:35,240 --> 02:57:37,240
However, I did

2108
02:57:37,320 --> 02:57:39,320
actually get a love letter

2109
02:57:39,480 --> 02:57:43,800
But I had no idea who it was from it just said like I like you or something

2110
02:57:43,800 --> 02:57:48,360
I saw this episode of king of the hill and it was your and it was bobby's grandma that actually said to you

2111
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:50,120
That's fucking bizarre

2112
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:53,480
No, I'm looking around class like which like hoping it's one of the girls

2113
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:55,720
I have a crush on like who the fuck sent me this letter

2114
02:57:56,280 --> 02:57:59,720
Um, so I'm at gym class and at the very end of gym

2115
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:05,960
A girl comes up to me who I've never seen before in my fucking life and it's like I've got a crush on you

2116
02:58:06,520 --> 02:58:10,120
And I having never spoken to a girl before

2117
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:14,280
Just like freak out and don't say anything. I won't look at her in the eyes

2118
02:58:14,440 --> 02:58:18,280
I won't say anything to her and I just like get because like gym class is ending

2119
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:21,480
So everybody's getting in lines to go back into the building

2120
02:58:21,880 --> 02:58:26,360
So I just kind of like rush into line and my my friend

2121
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:32,040
Not particularly close, but you know, the only friend I had in my class was like behind me in line

2122
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:39,160
and um, I guess this girl is like trying to speak to me, but I'm just like hard line ignoring her and pretending

2123
02:58:39,240 --> 02:58:41,240
I don't notice and like

2124
02:58:42,040 --> 02:58:47,480
She starts badgering this kid because I guess she can tell we're friends and I say to my friend like hey

2125
02:58:48,200 --> 02:58:52,760
Can you like I don't know what to do like can you tell this girl to stop bothering me, right?

2126
02:58:53,400 --> 02:58:55,400
And my friend looks at her and says

2127
02:58:55,960 --> 02:58:57,960
He hates you. Oh fuck

2128
02:58:58,680 --> 02:59:01,240
Oh god, I mean we've gone nuclear

2129
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:07,000
He then tells me that he said this and I'm like ha ha and like she's

2130
02:59:07,480 --> 02:59:11,720
She's like crying and he's like laughing and so I laughed too

2131
02:59:14,600 --> 02:59:17,240
You had to pick a side you had to pick a side

2132
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:20,600
And so it's so like it was gonna be a fucking queer into girls. So yeah

2133
02:59:21,480 --> 02:59:28,920
Exactly. I was staunchly anti-girl at this age. Yeah. Um a few a few like weeks or months later

2134
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:33,880
We're doing like a class thing where um, this is a very bizarre project

2135
02:59:34,200 --> 02:59:38,440
Every one of my class had to pick like a famous person from the 1800s

2136
02:59:38,840 --> 02:59:41,960
And like we did this thing where we all we were all in the auditorium

2137
02:59:42,040 --> 02:59:47,640
And we just like had to stand still like a statue and if someone came up and like touched our hand

2138
02:59:47,720 --> 02:59:51,880
We had to give a speech as though we were like a living museum of that person

2139
02:59:52,280 --> 02:59:52,840
Okay

2140
02:59:52,840 --> 03:00:00,680
So I was George Washington carver and that girl came up and she kept like tapping me over and over again

2141
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:08,360
And I like terrified just kept giving my rote speech of being George Washington carver like I literally was a

2142
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:10,920
installation at a museum just like

2143
03:00:11,480 --> 03:00:13,480
Watching this girl like I I very

2144
03:00:14,520 --> 03:00:20,280
Clearly remember like her heart broken face like pressing my hand over and over again hoping I'll say something else

2145
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:25,720
Don't treat me like a human being stop with the camera responses, please and and she didn't say a damn word

2146
03:00:25,880 --> 03:00:27,880
That was the last I ever saw

2147
03:00:27,880 --> 03:00:34,520
Do you like tugging at your sleeve like tearfully like please please please conrat and you're just like did you know that?

2148
03:00:34,520 --> 03:00:36,520
I invented peanut butter

2149
03:00:36,840 --> 03:00:38,840
Exactly what it was

2150
03:00:40,440 --> 03:00:43,960
And that's that's the first thing that comes to buy by that's a good one

2151
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:52,760
That's really funny, but I have easily a dozen stories that embarrassing. I don't know why but I imagine that story

2152
03:00:53,480 --> 03:00:59,400
In the style I don't know why but I imagined while you were telling that story that it was like animated

2153
03:01:03,880 --> 03:01:08,440
Oh, it doesn't matter people have been talking over me this entire podcast. I don't care anymore. Yeah, sorry

2154
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:14,760
Nobody will ever hear what I say they'll listen back. Uh, uh, uh, uh, Tom munchie. You want to tell stories or should we move on?

2155
03:01:15,320 --> 03:01:16,840
How can I top that?

2156
03:01:16,840 --> 03:01:18,120
I got nothing

2157
03:01:18,200 --> 03:01:22,040
Oh, I there was one time where I hit my brother over the head with a metal detector

2158
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:26,040
And I felt bad about it. I hit victor with the face of the microwave door

2159
03:01:26,520 --> 03:01:31,480
That was pretty awesome. I threw a kettle at my sister's head as a child and I don't know what got into me over there

2160
03:01:31,480 --> 03:01:35,000
I wasn't a child. I was 21 when I hit victor with the microwave door

2161
03:01:36,520 --> 03:01:39,960
When we were fighting over who would get my friend's hamburger

2162
03:01:41,640 --> 03:01:45,720
That he offered to victor, but I felt entitled to it. So I

2163
03:01:48,520 --> 03:01:51,560
There are many stories about things I shouldn't have done

2164
03:01:52,120 --> 03:01:55,560
Sort of like digi but not in the sense that there are too many good ones

2165
03:01:55,560 --> 03:01:58,200
But just in the sense. I don't know what people will gravitate towards

2166
03:01:58,680 --> 03:02:00,600
There most of them are just like

2167
03:02:00,600 --> 03:02:04,440
Not embarrassing in the sense of like, ooh, who weren't you like a kooky child?

2168
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:11,400
But like weren't you kooky like three or four years years ago and therefore aren't you just a terrible person?

2169
03:02:12,920 --> 03:02:17,480
Uh, I don't know. I mean I a lot of embarrassment just comes from like

2170
03:02:18,200 --> 03:02:25,400
Me saying things which would have been funny if I were on the internet and not terribly awkward

2171
03:02:25,640 --> 03:02:31,160
But like me trying to do edgy humor outside of like like an offline like

2172
03:02:31,480 --> 03:02:36,440
Just at a school and it coming up really weird and terrible and like

2173
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:42,840
I don't know like I like I like I just would speak in some sort of like grotesque internet meme

2174
03:02:43,240 --> 03:02:46,280
And I would say something gross and then people would be like wow

2175
03:02:46,360 --> 03:02:52,440
What a gross asshole and then not talk to me anymore and I would think you know what maybe I should have seen this coming

2176
03:02:53,480 --> 03:03:00,040
Like why don't they get it when I when I when I say gamers rise up bottom text and strike the awkward penguin pose

2177
03:03:00,120 --> 03:03:03,000
Why don't they like get that? Yeah, what's I don't understand?

2178
03:03:03,080 --> 03:03:05,080
What have they never been on four champs?

2179
03:03:05,080 --> 03:03:10,840
There was well, there was one time where I was just talking to some girl and I was and I was joking about how one time

2180
03:03:10,920 --> 03:03:13,560
I saw like like like like there was this one image

2181
03:03:13,560 --> 03:03:20,440
I saw someone who like cooked their their period blood into bacon and ate it and she looked really upset

2182
03:03:20,520 --> 03:03:22,840
And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess you're not supposed to say that to people

2183
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:32,600
How does one hook their period blood into bacon? Well, I put it on there. Yeah hook in why not why not?

2184
03:03:34,120 --> 03:03:37,880
You eat the placenta you cook the period blood. This is really gross

2185
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:41,400
I'm imagining like a link cable from your pussy to the

2186
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:49,320
Well digi they have those they have those rubber cups now that that that you just stick right up there and it goes into a cup

2187
03:03:49,720 --> 03:03:54,280
So you can pour it into anything you want you cook blood into you cook blood into like black pudding

2188
03:03:54,280 --> 03:03:58,200
Yeah, that's true. So like why not use it. I guess I did a couple months ago

2189
03:03:58,280 --> 03:04:04,200
I had a foe that had uh, it was like a blood foe. Oh god not a period

2190
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:08,600
Like an foe like a blood like a blood. I have many blood foes

2191
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:12,440
I have a new blood foe every day

2192
03:04:13,400 --> 03:04:16,360
Yeah, all right guys next fucking question. Shall we?

2193
03:04:18,120 --> 03:04:20,840
All right, I apologize to the carnival lady. I'm sorry

2194
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:25,160
She hears you out there. So lying car a cheating car

2195
03:04:27,160 --> 03:04:31,720
All right, here we go. Uh, this is from suole as far as I can tell. All right go

2196
03:04:32,600 --> 03:04:38,360
Yo, okay, so munchie college. It's a bad idea. Everything you're saying sounds exactly like what I was

2197
03:04:38,920 --> 03:04:40,920
Maybe I'll make friends or something

2198
03:04:40,920 --> 03:04:44,040
No, like like everyone's saying about the financials and like I get it

2199
03:04:44,040 --> 03:04:45,720
But if you're saying like no, I've got it handled

2200
03:04:45,720 --> 03:04:47,640
I have to argue with you on a more important point

2201
03:04:47,640 --> 03:04:51,720
Which is the fact that the experience is not valuable you think it will be right now

2202
03:04:51,880 --> 03:04:57,400
But the amount of like real world knowledge that you will gain by actually being an adult and not being in some weird like daycare facility

2203
03:04:57,400 --> 03:05:01,160
For adults is so much greater if you actually just move somewhere and start your career

2204
03:05:01,160 --> 03:05:05,720
You're so lucky to be so young and have so many people actually care about what you're making on the internet right now

2205
03:05:05,800 --> 03:05:07,800
You could just bend st. Style

2206
03:05:07,880 --> 03:05:11,640
Start making shit and people would love it and you could be good

2207
03:05:12,200 --> 03:05:16,200
You think oh man, I'm gonna meet people. No, everyone in college is like a fucking super

2208
03:05:16,600 --> 03:05:20,920
Libtar'd like no, it's not gonna work. There are some good people you probably will make a friend

2209
03:05:20,920 --> 03:05:22,920
But here's the thing munchie. It's not a good idea

2210
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:26,280
You can make plenty of friends just by being a normal human being being in a classroom in college

2211
03:05:26,280 --> 03:05:31,080
It's not like being in the classroom. I love this guy. He never stopped and no one talks to each other. It's a huge problem

2212
03:05:31,080 --> 03:05:35,560
No one gets along. It's listen high school is like the most. I mean college is the most

2213
03:05:36,040 --> 03:05:42,440
Fucking like denigrating experience ever will destroy you won't learn anything you can't learn from a book or by actually making things yourself

2214
03:05:42,520 --> 03:05:48,040
That's the most important thing just push yourself to keep practicing and you will become good

2215
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:51,480
I I like honestly

2216
03:05:51,720 --> 03:05:54,440
I love the kind of that man's gym that guy's a fucking

2217
03:05:55,160 --> 03:06:00,120
So what I want to respond let munchie respond to two things first of all the

2218
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:04,840
Two things that come in like every college discussion, which I don't understand

2219
03:06:05,320 --> 03:06:10,840
Are the speaking with absolute certainty about all colleges ever and the and the all bad

2220
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:17,800
All colleges ever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can't you can't like going to college is a mistake all the time

2221
03:06:18,200 --> 03:06:20,200
I don't know about that. No

2222
03:06:21,800 --> 03:06:23,800
I feel confident

2223
03:06:24,760 --> 03:06:28,520
I'm worried about the liberal people in colleges nowadays

2224
03:06:29,560 --> 03:06:31,560
They're not that's not

2225
03:06:33,080 --> 03:06:38,840
You're gonna get off like some some some chick with a green side cut is gonna like is gonna come and like burn your house down

2226
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:44,680
Okay, you guys have to remember that munchie is a libcock. So this is not a problem. Yeah. Yeah

2227
03:06:45,560 --> 03:06:50,520
Also, for me, I think the biggest concern I would question directly at me now

2228
03:06:50,520 --> 03:06:55,320
It's the yeah, I know, right? No, I'm just saying like because I was thinking about this after the conversation

2229
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:57,320
You and I had about college munchie is that like

2230
03:06:58,680 --> 03:07:02,600
You were you were implying that you were like, oh, I'll come over to your house every weekend

2231
03:07:02,600 --> 03:07:05,800
And I'm like, how the fuck are you gonna have time for that if you're in college?

2232
03:07:05,880 --> 03:07:12,280
I like a serious college. I understand that that I should I misspoke and I'm and I said that like well

2233
03:07:12,280 --> 03:07:17,720
Well, not every weekend in the conversation, which you're referring to I misspoke every weekend is not realistic

2234
03:07:18,280 --> 03:07:21,720
Uh to go back to what the guy was saying

2235
03:07:22,520 --> 03:07:28,440
Okay, the second thing uh like aside from speaking as though, you know about every

2236
03:07:29,240 --> 03:07:32,360
Social like like group in every college ever aside from that

2237
03:07:32,840 --> 03:07:38,920
Also the just be a real person in quotes and you'll be just fine

2238
03:07:39,160 --> 03:07:41,160
I don't know like okay

2239
03:07:41,720 --> 03:07:46,920
If I were to just continue what I'm doing now what I would be doing what I'm doing right now

2240
03:07:47,400 --> 03:07:53,400
Aka never leaving the house and only talking to people online and doing my art slowly

2241
03:07:53,880 --> 03:07:56,680
So if that's that's what the equivalent would be

2242
03:07:57,400 --> 03:08:03,800
Going to college is being a real person all of you guys are wrong college is good being a youtuber is morally fucking

2243
03:08:04,440 --> 03:08:07,560
Reprehensible, I would give anything to have not dropped out of college

2244
03:08:07,880 --> 03:08:13,240
Wait, wait, it felt like the only two options here are be a youtuber or go to college

2245
03:08:13,640 --> 03:08:16,920
No, well, they're making it sound like oh drop out of college and be an artist

2246
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:20,680
Here's an idea fuck faces stay in college and be an artist

2247
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:27,480
And maybe don't ruin your entire life by dropping out and devoting everything to this fucking dead end of an artistic career

2248
03:08:27,640 --> 03:08:32,360
When I hear quote be a real person, I think get a cubicle job is what this guy is saying

2249
03:08:32,520 --> 03:08:36,760
Okay, okay, the thing that the thing that stands out to me most about what this guy's saying

2250
03:08:36,840 --> 03:08:41,560
Is the idea that there is nothing that you learn in college that you can't learn from a book

2251
03:08:41,720 --> 03:08:45,720
Or somewhere else like they don't have a monopoly on like secrets

2252
03:08:45,960 --> 03:08:50,120
Ben, of course, they don't have a monopoly on all knowledge

2253
03:08:50,360 --> 03:08:56,600
But like there are of an ensure you can learn some technical skill in books

2254
03:08:56,760 --> 03:08:58,760
But like what I've said a thousand times

2255
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:03,720
I will have an instructor with me who is instructing me on a personal basis

2256
03:09:04,120 --> 03:09:08,840
He is helping me through things as well. I will be surrounded by constant artists. That might be great

2257
03:09:09,480 --> 03:09:12,040
That might be great or it might suck ass

2258
03:09:12,120 --> 03:09:16,840
Okay, obviously there is risk, but it is an educated decision

2259
03:09:16,920 --> 03:09:22,920
I'm making based on literally attending not a metaphorical college, but a college. I'm going to

2260
03:09:23,880 --> 03:09:25,160
Munchy, I'm not

2261
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:29,320
Being a digi here and I'm not saying that college is a bad idea and you will regret it

2262
03:09:29,320 --> 03:09:33,800
You might not but I am saying that you you can't you can't tell me that you have it

2263
03:09:33,880 --> 03:09:36,200
It's an educated decision because you don't know

2264
03:09:36,280 --> 03:09:41,240
We you you look you will not know if it was a if it was regrettable and a mistake

2265
03:09:41,240 --> 03:09:45,720
You can talk to people who've been there and you know until after no, I'm not look you just won't know

2266
03:09:45,800 --> 03:09:52,120
Okay, it's just a fucking crapshoot. That's all I'm saying. It's a crapshoot. It's not a crapshoot. It's just always bad

2267
03:09:53,240 --> 03:09:55,960
Tell me one time. I've ever been wrong about anything

2268
03:09:56,280 --> 03:09:58,280
Oh

2269
03:09:58,360 --> 03:10:00,360
I didn't like the anime you recommended

2270
03:10:00,920 --> 03:10:04,360
Like like what shit wait made you didn't like angel of death

2271
03:10:04,680 --> 03:10:09,880
I I liked it at the beginning, but the further I got the worst. Well, I only saw the first two episodes

2272
03:10:09,960 --> 03:10:12,840
I can't you can't judge. Oh, I would I didn't see the whole show

2273
03:10:12,920 --> 03:10:15,960
I it seemed like your kind of thing based on how much I saw

2274
03:10:16,520 --> 03:10:20,760
I apologize that the show went to shit from your perspective. It's okay

2275
03:10:21,640 --> 03:10:23,640
I wasn't wrong at the time

2276
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:29,240
Oh, I'll give you that much digi you're not there's nothing nothing is guaranteed

2277
03:10:29,320 --> 03:10:34,120
Of course and no matter how educated you think you are you could end up regretting it

2278
03:10:34,360 --> 03:10:39,640
Here's the thing you will you will end up in debt. You might end up okay with that

2279
03:10:39,960 --> 03:10:45,320
Maybe then of course that is true. I'm not saying I'm guaranteed to enjoy college

2280
03:10:45,720 --> 03:10:52,360
But again, I'm playing the odds and there's also no guarantee that I'll be able to make a living on the internet

2281
03:10:52,440 --> 03:10:57,800
With no sort of a hand and like foot in the industry whatsoever. There's no guarantee in that either

2282
03:10:58,760 --> 03:11:05,640
Okay, but but I'm just saying the idea solution to that is to just accept a large amount of debt and then pay that off

2283
03:11:05,800 --> 03:11:07,800
That's not all that I'm doing

2284
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:11,080
You know, that's not all that as a man with debt

2285
03:11:11,160 --> 03:11:17,560
I can definitely say having debt is the worst part of my life and the biggest regret I have and the thing

2286
03:11:17,640 --> 03:11:22,840
I most wish I didn't have sure the idea that somebody on a fucking podcast

2287
03:11:23,240 --> 03:11:28,040
Can wave their hand over all of it and say that college is always a bad idea no matter who you are is insane

2288
03:11:28,200 --> 03:11:30,200
Well, only did you say that you're

2289
03:11:30,360 --> 03:11:34,440
Yeah, I know just like the idea that like say your father is saying if you don't go to college

2290
03:11:34,520 --> 03:11:40,200
You'll fail no matter what is also insane. Of course. Nice. Okay. Here's why here's why college didn't work for me

2291
03:11:40,680 --> 03:11:46,600
Because I I went to a community college. I didn't have the money or the grades or whatever to go to a real university

2292
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:49,240
So I didn't really meet people or it didn't really take it seriously

2293
03:11:49,320 --> 03:11:53,880
And I went into college with an attitude of I don't need this I'm gonna be an artist

2294
03:11:53,880 --> 03:11:59,160
So why am I here? So I fucking I I floundered in it for three years and then dropped out

2295
03:11:59,560 --> 03:12:00,600
but

2296
03:12:00,600 --> 03:12:03,560
If you have the chance if you have the real opportunity

2297
03:12:04,120 --> 03:12:07,000
If you if you have to take if you have to like get yourself into debt to go to college

2298
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:08,680
And you don't think it's for you then it's not for you

2299
03:12:08,760 --> 03:12:13,800
But if you have the opportunity to go to a real university then it is an experience that is valuable

2300
03:12:13,880 --> 03:12:16,760
You will probably make friends. You will probably learn something

2301
03:12:16,760 --> 03:12:19,400
You will probably get a good career out of it eventually

2302
03:12:19,960 --> 03:12:24,200
I just I've never known anybody who I respected who went to college

2303
03:12:25,240 --> 03:12:27,240
I went to college. You asshole

2304
03:12:30,360 --> 03:12:34,600
Tom you wait. Well, you did wait tom. Do you have a degree? Yeah, you do have a degree

2305
03:12:35,160 --> 03:12:38,760
Yeah, but you don't you you hate college. Okay. Let me replace that Ben is a degree

2306
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:43,160
But I've never known anybody who went to college and didn't regret it that I respect

2307
03:12:43,240 --> 03:12:49,160
I don't entirely regret it. Well, I don't regret it. Well, hippo, you don't

2308
03:12:50,440 --> 03:12:52,440
You're from England. It's different

2309
03:12:52,600 --> 03:13:00,520
I I went to a social function a smash tournament at the school that I want to go to and it was a nice time

2310
03:13:00,840 --> 03:13:04,200
I didn't like make a new friend. I hope I hope to god

2311
03:13:04,520 --> 03:13:10,120
Guys, please we already had this argument before and I don't think we're bringing up anything new

2312
03:13:10,360 --> 03:13:12,360
You're not trying to tell me that you

2313
03:13:13,240 --> 03:13:17,560
That a smash tournament is an argument in favor of college. No, I'm not what no

2314
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:21,800
Obviously, okay. Okay. Maybe if everyone would stop fucking speaking over me

2315
03:13:21,880 --> 03:13:25,240
So I can actually say what I'm trying to say and not just say one sentence of it

2316
03:13:25,240 --> 03:13:26,600
And then I have to stop munchy

2317
03:13:26,600 --> 03:13:31,880
I have to keep arguing because I have to keep increasing the time that I'm on this podcast so I can get paid for it

2318
03:13:31,880 --> 03:13:33,880
Now that I've jumped in

2319
03:13:34,280 --> 03:13:39,720
I'm not saying oh, I won't go to college because there's smash tournaments. That'll be cool. That's not at all

2320
03:13:39,800 --> 03:13:43,400
What I'm saying don't even like get that out of your mind immediately. That's I mean, yeah

2321
03:13:43,640 --> 03:13:50,280
I thought that that would be ridiculous. I just don't understand. Oh my god. Did you I can't believe you right now

2322
03:13:50,680 --> 03:13:55,720
After I just said that I want people to stop in or under me you come in saying something

2323
03:13:55,880 --> 03:13:59,560
Obviously, it's just hard because everything you say is obviously fucking retarded

2324
03:14:00,040 --> 03:14:02,040
Anything you have to say

2325
03:14:02,200 --> 03:14:06,680
At all munchy, please continue. I'm saying that I went

2326
03:14:07,320 --> 03:14:11,400
People are saying you you won't make friends the guy in the bush now saying you won't make friends

2327
03:14:11,400 --> 03:14:14,440
You just won't do it. But I went to a social function

2328
03:14:14,520 --> 03:14:19,320
I went to a social function and it was great. Sure. I don't have like oh like hit me up on discord

2329
03:14:19,320 --> 03:14:20,760
They are we're best friends now

2330
03:14:20,760 --> 03:14:25,240
But it was nice to hang out with people and it wasn't an air of like, oh, I don't know what I'm doing

2331
03:14:25,240 --> 03:14:28,360
I can't make friends here. I've been with the same sort of cultural

2332
03:14:28,520 --> 03:14:33,000
Like I've been to this school and I don't dislike the culture at all. It will be fun

2333
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:38,280
I feel like anyone who says you won't make friends is just a weird person who wouldn't make friends anywhere

2334
03:14:38,600 --> 03:14:42,360
Yeah, like obviously that's wrong, but this whole friend argument is weird

2335
03:14:42,440 --> 03:14:48,360
It's like it sort of feels like we're arguing past the point because like yeah, you you you can make friends at college

2336
03:14:48,360 --> 03:14:49,880
But you can make friends

2337
03:14:49,880 --> 03:14:52,440
I feel like munching can easily make friends in any circumstance

2338
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:57,880
He was in like there's no reason to go to dude everyone listening to this because I feel like most of the people who

2339
03:14:57,880 --> 03:15:01,880
Listen to the procrastinators are like in their late teens probably that's the demographic

2340
03:15:01,880 --> 03:15:06,040
They're probably you know weighing their options of whether to go to college if you can go

2341
03:15:06,680 --> 03:15:10,360
Fucking be young be young and be around other young people for the love of god

2342
03:15:10,440 --> 03:15:15,240
Do not be 29 years old and be a fucking youtuber and having a crisis. I want to go back to college

2343
03:15:15,400 --> 03:15:17,400
That's all I want in the world. I want to go back

2344
03:15:17,400 --> 03:15:19,880
Don't be a youtuber, but don't go to fucking college

2345
03:15:19,880 --> 03:15:26,440
Just get a regular fucking job like a normal human like 90 percent of the population who are fucking fine

2346
03:15:27,320 --> 03:15:34,680
You can go to college after the regular job and not have fucking death let people make their own choices about their own lives

2347
03:15:35,400 --> 03:15:37,640
If you've got the opportunity to go to college

2348
03:15:37,640 --> 03:15:41,960
Don't let people make choices about their own lives because don't make the wrong choices. Everyone lives their life fucking wrong

2349
03:15:44,440 --> 03:15:51,400
Hold on we are all people who have lived wrong and have the opportunity to tell people how to how to avoid the mistakes

2350
03:15:51,480 --> 03:15:53,400
We've made

2351
03:15:53,400 --> 03:15:56,920
I didn't make any mistakes. I made all the right decisions at every point

2352
03:15:57,720 --> 03:15:59,720
I came in like an agent of chaos

2353
03:16:01,240 --> 03:16:05,640
If you have the opportunity to go to school and you won't settle yourself with debt

2354
03:16:05,640 --> 03:16:11,320
Yeah, it's probably a great idea, but like it's the trade-off. Okay. It's the trade-off of a huge amount of debt

2355
03:16:11,640 --> 03:16:13,640
Oh

2356
03:16:15,800 --> 03:16:17,800
May or may not benefit you

2357
03:16:18,840 --> 03:16:22,920
Dang it. Oh, we're gonna get copyright claimed. We play that too long

2358
03:16:23,640 --> 03:16:28,120
No, it's from a video game. You can play video game music. Oh, okay. You might be right. You might be right about that

2359
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:31,000
I I just want to say that I think it's really hilarious

2360
03:16:31,640 --> 03:16:33,080
that like

2361
03:16:33,080 --> 03:16:41,240
Munchy is constantly defending college from the standpoint of not having gone to an audience of everyone else who has gone to college

2362
03:16:42,280 --> 03:16:46,760
No, you're you're you're disparaging it from someone who never finished

2363
03:16:49,080 --> 03:16:51,080
I don't give a shit

2364
03:16:51,560 --> 03:16:56,680
Everyone I've ever told it's not just me. It's not like I haven't spoken to countless people who've been to college

2365
03:16:56,680 --> 03:16:58,840
It's not like I've haven't I don't have a huge

2366
03:16:59,560 --> 03:17:04,280
I am someone who's been to college and I don't even think it's bad. I'm not even against it

2367
03:17:04,360 --> 03:17:08,040
I'm skeptical, but I'm not like unilaterally saying the college is bad

2368
03:17:08,280 --> 03:17:09,400
Uh

2369
03:17:09,400 --> 03:17:10,360
Me hey munchy

2370
03:17:10,360 --> 03:17:16,360
Do you want to live the life of ben saint living with nine other dudes and making 400 dollars a month for the rest of your life?

2371
03:17:16,440 --> 03:17:21,640
Yeah, that's the lifestyle you want. Ben seems pretty fulfilled in his life. Well, then you'll be fine. Go to college

2372
03:17:21,800 --> 03:17:27,240
Wait a minute. Wait wait ben's life being like that isn't because he went to college. It's because he became an artist

2373
03:17:27,880 --> 03:17:31,480
When he was both are equally the problem. Yeah, okay, but he does have no I mean

2374
03:17:31,560 --> 03:17:37,160
No, becoming an artist was the right choice for me and I'm fucking happy with my life digi you asshole

2375
03:17:37,880 --> 03:17:41,800
I know you're happy with your life. I'm asking munchy if he would be happy with your digi

2376
03:17:41,960 --> 03:17:45,160
Here's the thing. I'm in front of a panel of people who have been to college

2377
03:17:45,240 --> 03:17:50,120
Who do I like the most out of this group who I like want to I'm sorry. I shouldn't say like that. It's a very mean thing to say

2378
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:52,360
I

2379
03:17:52,360 --> 03:17:54,040
I mean, who do I respect?

2380
03:17:54,040 --> 03:17:58,520
Who do I respect? Like what kind of life do I want to lead? Oh hippo ben?

2381
03:17:58,760 --> 03:18:04,120
They both went to college and say it been in ben's case. Oh not like not a bad thing

2382
03:18:04,120 --> 03:18:09,480
You know there you gotta brood the prawns hippo was just yeah. Yeah, it was cool. It was good. Yeah. Well. I want to do that

2383
03:18:10,840 --> 03:18:17,000
Well, go ahead faggot. Well, I'm just letting you know that it's the worst decision you could ever make

2384
03:18:17,080 --> 03:18:22,520
Hey, man. Look, I used to visit my buddy who went to uh, michigan state, which is an actual college

2385
03:18:22,520 --> 03:18:26,360
Yeah, I used to visit him. I'd come there for st patty's day and it was beautiful

2386
03:18:26,360 --> 03:18:27,000
It was amazing

2387
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:29,960
He would just walk around the college town going into everyone else's apartment

2388
03:18:30,040 --> 03:18:35,720
Having part every every every single house or apartment had a party in it with drinks and girls and fun and friendship

2389
03:18:35,800 --> 03:18:39,240
He was friends with the whole town go to college and you'll be just like that guy

2390
03:18:39,720 --> 03:18:43,240
Every time it's it's always good. I'm just saying that I'm now

2391
03:18:43,880 --> 03:18:45,880
I'm making the generalization

2392
03:18:46,360 --> 03:18:51,960
I'm going to college. It's like saying I'm gonna get an abortion on myself. It's like I hate my life

2393
03:18:52,040 --> 03:18:57,720
And I want to die like listen, but I I'm going to college. It's like saying I want to be castrated

2394
03:18:58,440 --> 03:19:02,440
If you go to college if you go to college, you can become an abortion guy

2395
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:06,680
Professor and you can do that. You can be I just think it should be flexible

2396
03:19:06,760 --> 03:19:11,720
And if you don't you shouldn't feel like like if you like you need to fend like like if college

2397
03:19:12,360 --> 03:19:14,520
Isn't working you should be willing to

2398
03:19:15,560 --> 03:19:17,560
I'm not saying that I will

2399
03:19:18,200 --> 03:19:24,120
Like college is the best decision to me for definitively 100 percent. Of course there is risk and I understand

2400
03:19:24,440 --> 03:19:28,120
I'm sorry if I seem more to senses than usual. I'm just annoyed

2401
03:19:28,760 --> 03:19:34,440
But yeah, that's fine. I'm on team munch. I I believe in you boy. It's fine to be annoyed munchy

2402
03:19:34,440 --> 03:19:39,960
I understand why you're annoyed. I'm just annoyed every time anybody says the phrase. I'm going to college to me

2403
03:19:41,080 --> 03:19:48,280
Well, like every time I hear that phrase. I think oh great. Oh great. You're perpetuating everything I hate in the world

2404
03:19:48,600 --> 03:19:50,600
Great

2405
03:19:51,640 --> 03:19:57,720
Everything the same as it's been who fucking cares you have the opportunity to do anything else

2406
03:19:58,040 --> 03:20:01,480
But you're gonna do the same thing great. I wish the best for you

2407
03:20:02,680 --> 03:20:07,560
No, don't don't wish the best for me. Don't change stop. No more look

2408
03:20:08,360 --> 03:20:13,160
Can I can I make one here's how I win this conversation because conversations are about winning

2409
03:20:13,240 --> 03:20:15,880
So here's how I win it. They're not about understanding each other

2410
03:20:16,840 --> 03:20:21,720
No matter what you do in life, you're going to regret it. Whatever you do to your 20

2411
03:20:21,960 --> 03:20:25,240
You're gonna regret it when you're 30. So just do whatever you want, man

2412
03:20:25,480 --> 03:20:27,640
Everyone just do whatever you want. I win

2413
03:20:28,360 --> 03:20:33,320
Uh, yeah final point on this. I think this is a real actually big brain intelligent point

2414
03:20:33,480 --> 03:20:35,480
It's that I think that college

2415
03:20:36,040 --> 03:20:39,960
Is kind of the pleasures of childhood and then like working

2416
03:20:40,040 --> 03:20:42,440
This is not meant to be demeaning and then like whatever like getting a job

2417
03:20:42,840 --> 03:20:45,080
That allows you to get like the pleasures of adulthood

2418
03:20:45,320 --> 03:20:50,280
I think the pleasures of adulthood are better like having control of your life sooner and you know

2419
03:20:50,360 --> 03:20:52,760
Like what not going into debt being financially solvent

2420
03:20:53,320 --> 03:20:58,840
That's that's the main reason why I think that I mean and I would never say college isn't right for anyone including munchy

2421
03:20:59,160 --> 03:21:03,640
Uh, it's just you know, like well if you want to be a doctor, you got to go to college and a conversation

2422
03:21:03,880 --> 03:21:07,240
Uh, you know, but if you want to be a doctor, you're not a human being

2423
03:21:08,040 --> 03:21:10,520
Well, all right, fair enough fair enough. I want to be a doctor

2424
03:21:10,600 --> 03:21:15,880
I I I have um, I have like secret dreams of being a psychologist or a therapist. I

2425
03:21:16,280 --> 03:21:18,280
That's not a doctor

2426
03:21:18,840 --> 03:21:21,640
What are you talking about actually you need your doctor

2427
03:21:23,880 --> 03:21:28,680
I think about that a lot like I really want to go back to college and like major in psychology or something

2428
03:21:28,760 --> 03:21:31,400
So I can like do you actually have a doctor to be a psychologist

2429
03:21:31,480 --> 03:21:33,960
Well, you can be like a therapist without a literal doctor

2430
03:21:33,960 --> 03:21:37,720
I think or a sociologist you do not require a medical degree

2431
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:41,560
You're you're not a medical doctor, but you do but you do you need you need your ph

2432
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:47,640
You need your phd, which is a doctor. My buddy. My buddy's a psychologist. He uh, he went to a lot of school. It's crazy

2433
03:21:48,040 --> 03:21:52,120
Psychologists are cool. Psychiatrists. There's no one. I trust less in this world

2434
03:21:52,520 --> 03:21:54,520
Psychiatrists are actually like more

2435
03:21:54,680 --> 03:21:58,760
I mean, they're the one with the more exacting like medical degree. That's true

2436
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:02,680
They're the people who I am thoroughly disgusted by

2437
03:22:03,400 --> 03:22:06,840
All right, let's move on to the next we got two questions left people here

2438
03:22:07,400 --> 03:22:12,200
Mr. Waffle guy is the one so here he goes with his question

2439
03:22:14,360 --> 03:22:21,240
All right, so on the halloween and student debt episode. We got a really good discussion about monkey's college plans

2440
03:22:24,280 --> 03:22:26,280
And what hippos got besides youtube

2441
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:31,480
That's all fantastic. I loved it. But my brain mouth requires more

2442
03:22:32,040 --> 03:22:38,120
Feed it. It's greens. Give me the sustenance of the plans of the rest of the pcp methods

2443
03:22:38,840 --> 03:22:42,280
Anyone else on the episode? Where do you want to take yourself in the future?

2444
03:22:42,600 --> 03:22:47,240
Where do you see yourself and not only individually, but with the pcp? Or do you plan on doing?

2445
03:22:48,040 --> 03:22:52,040
Well, I've been tensed. I'm not going to college anymore and the and that that no one should go to college

2446
03:22:52,120 --> 03:22:55,800
So now I've officially abandoned that idea. So now I don't know those futures right open

2447
03:22:56,360 --> 03:23:00,360
I'm it looked like a career in homelessness. It's looking pretty good right now. You know just

2448
03:23:00,760 --> 03:23:05,800
I I I my career is going to be I'm going to become andrew hussey, but good

2449
03:23:06,360 --> 03:23:10,520
It's what I'm going to do. That sounds good. So you'll be toby fox then you'll be toby fox

2450
03:23:11,160 --> 03:23:15,800
Uh, yeah, but I'll have a different name called my name toby bison or you know

2451
03:23:15,880 --> 03:23:22,520
I don't have like a long term like step by step plan. I know that I'm gonna finish max surviving tbap and then

2452
03:23:23,160 --> 03:23:29,080
Uh, take a take a break takes like a social media break and go away for a while until vapors three is done

2453
03:23:29,640 --> 03:23:33,720
I just all I have is a list of projects. I don't have a life plan. All I have is a list of projects

2454
03:23:33,800 --> 03:23:36,920
I mean, that's and they go to tbap vapors three

2455
03:23:37,320 --> 03:23:43,320
Biscopades champion two and that's it. That's not that's almost admirable about more than anything

2456
03:23:43,320 --> 03:23:47,000
I think more than anything like life goal than you could have just having a list of projects. That's really nice

2457
03:23:47,640 --> 03:23:50,600
That's all I have. That's all I am is my list of products

2458
03:23:50,600 --> 03:23:55,720
All I am is my list of projects and the fucking bullshit standing between me and them. What a beautiful future

2459
03:23:55,800 --> 03:23:57,800
I feel that I feel that hardcore Ben

2460
03:23:58,360 --> 03:24:05,880
Well, my my current plan is next year to downsize my living situation because I overexerted myself moving into a place

2461
03:24:05,880 --> 03:24:09,960
That was too expensive. So I'm going to move into a less expensive place

2462
03:24:10,520 --> 03:24:15,960
Uh, try to reduce my cost of living while saving up so I can pay off the debt

2463
03:24:15,960 --> 03:24:20,840
I have to the government over taxes. Good plan. Eventually pay off the taxes

2464
03:24:21,400 --> 03:24:23,400
Um, once that's sorted out

2465
03:24:23,960 --> 03:24:29,960
Try to move my career in a way that I don't have to be so focused on having to do anything mainstream whatsoever

2466
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:31,800
um

2467
03:24:31,800 --> 03:24:36,120
moving in a more artistic direction try to work with other people more because I'm

2468
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:40,920
Increasingly less interested in what I can do by myself and more and what I can do with other people

2469
03:24:41,560 --> 03:24:44,920
um, so try to do that and then uh,

2470
03:24:45,640 --> 03:24:47,640
Maybe two or three years from now

2471
03:24:48,600 --> 03:24:51,320
Fuck off from all of it and go have a kid

2472
03:24:52,120 --> 03:24:57,960
Somewhere and two or three years in the mountains become a you want you want you want big digi

2473
03:24:58,040 --> 03:25:04,680
You want to talk about you might as well be saying i'm gonna abort myself. They'll have a fucking kid. I want to abort myself

2474
03:25:04,840 --> 03:25:09,000
Why would I hold on? What's the point of living at all?

2475
03:25:09,880 --> 03:25:16,280
What's the point of making a new life if I make a kid? Maybe he can do something he can make good

2476
03:25:17,640 --> 03:25:21,320
The point of life is the experience of living which you are giving up

2477
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:25,160
You are giving up for some other person to have those experiences instead

2478
03:25:25,240 --> 03:25:29,880
Like consider this as a 27 year old nothing is fun to me anymore

2479
03:25:30,200 --> 03:25:37,640
However, having a kid I can experience fun again vicariously through that. Oh, you are a fucking idiot. What the fuck?

2480
03:25:38,680 --> 03:25:43,800
What's an idiot about that? What are you talking about? I think I think having a kid is not stupid

2481
03:25:43,880 --> 03:25:52,280
Everybody remember back when like christmas was fun and like you you you like enjoyed like doing things with people like

2482
03:25:53,800 --> 03:25:56,520
Stop chasing the pleasure of childhood and embrace the pleasure

2483
03:26:02,280 --> 03:26:05,640
They're about mastering your life and doing what you want and having a child can be one of them

2484
03:26:06,360 --> 03:26:08,360
What is more mastering your life than

2485
03:26:08,920 --> 03:26:12,200
Having well, I don't know what I'm arguing because it's fine to have a kid. Just I don't know

2486
03:26:12,440 --> 03:26:17,800
Man, yeah, I like I would like to see a new new lull arc of digi

2487
03:26:18,600 --> 03:26:22,120
Individually as human beings we have very little impact on the world

2488
03:26:22,280 --> 03:26:25,880
Continuing the legacy of humanity is far more important than anything we can do

2489
03:26:26,200 --> 03:26:31,800
That sounds like the most selfish reason to have a child imaginable. What is selfish about that?

2490
03:26:32,120 --> 03:26:37,560
What is selfish about wanting to continue the human fucking race like selfish would be being like

2491
03:26:37,640 --> 03:26:40,680
I'm gonna perfect myself and never continue humanity

2492
03:26:40,840 --> 03:26:44,680
Because I'm totally gonna have such a huge impact on the younger generation

2493
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:50,280
Like like you don't need to continue humanity like it doesn't need continuing. It's gonna continue just fine

2494
03:26:50,360 --> 03:26:54,360
Oh, well, I mean, okay, somebody's gotta do it. Take responsibility and do it. You know

2495
03:26:55,240 --> 03:26:58,280
Fuck fuck it. No, man. Oh, fuck you. Let me tell you

2496
03:26:58,840 --> 03:27:04,040
I just want to be happy. That's my hope for the future. I just want to find something that brings me peace

2497
03:27:04,040 --> 03:27:06,040
I'm already happy

2498
03:27:08,360 --> 03:27:12,520
The point the point of life the point of life is the experience of it

2499
03:27:12,520 --> 03:27:15,480
And I don't I mean sorry if this is fucking selfish or whatever

2500
03:27:15,800 --> 03:27:20,680
But I don't want to give that up so that someone else can have what is giving up about how I don't understand

2501
03:27:20,680 --> 03:27:25,400
How having a kid is giving up anything you fucking being a parent is fucking boring

2502
03:27:28,920 --> 03:27:34,360
Kids are automatically more interesting than anyone your own age. No everyone my age

2503
03:27:34,360 --> 03:27:40,680
I already thoroughly understand. You're all the same as me. You're all fucking boring. All kids think the same shit

2504
03:27:40,840 --> 03:27:44,040
All kids think the same shit. They haven't had an original thought and they're shitty lives

2505
03:27:44,200 --> 03:27:50,200
They're worthless like 14 and like they understand a world you can't even conceive of because they've been fucking

2506
03:27:50,360 --> 03:27:57,400
Don't be just by then you're already and you fucking thought all their shit every listen kids are boring because by the time you have them

2507
03:27:57,640 --> 03:28:02,760
You have already thought every thought they'll ever have like a hundred times over. Maybe when they're like 30

2508
03:28:02,760 --> 03:28:04,760
Maybe when they're 30 if they're a super genius

2509
03:28:04,840 --> 03:28:08,040
Maybe they'll like seed your fucking mental capacity and teach you something

2510
03:28:08,360 --> 03:28:12,920
You're you're so fucking smart that your kid has to be a super genius to teach you anything

2511
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:19,400
That's what you're saying then look at what what we do compared to what our parents experienced in their life and just

2512
03:28:19,560 --> 03:28:24,920
Just think about the radical difference and how they're able to kind of understand it through us

2513
03:28:25,160 --> 03:28:30,840
I'm just saying that has value. I don't want to understand things through people. I want if look, okay

2514
03:28:31,160 --> 03:28:35,480
Maybe maybe 20 years down the line. There will be a new cultural paradigm

2515
03:28:35,640 --> 03:28:41,640
I don't want to experience that cultural paradigm vicariously through a fucking, you know creature that I made

2516
03:28:41,800 --> 03:28:45,480
I want to fucking be involved in it. I want to be involved in it myself

2517
03:28:45,560 --> 03:28:51,640
I want to be I want to be relevant myself. Look ben. I completely agree which is why the smart man does both

2518
03:28:51,880 --> 03:28:55,960
That's what I say, uh by the way for the record. I think being a father is cool

2519
03:28:56,920 --> 03:29:01,560
I I think it's super cool. I mean if you do it well, you know, it's definitely the least cool thing

2520
03:29:02,600 --> 03:29:04,600
What are you?

2521
03:29:05,160 --> 03:29:07,160
All right guys

2522
03:29:07,560 --> 03:29:13,560
This is like a fucking it's always sunny episode. We're like they can't solve any problem without having a four hour argument

2523
03:29:13,560 --> 03:29:15,560
About nothing. That's pretty much true

2524
03:29:16,600 --> 03:29:20,600
This is absolutely true. All right, let's get to our final question. Shall we?

2525
03:29:21,560 --> 03:29:23,560
We're pretty split on all these

2526
03:29:24,760 --> 03:29:32,680
All right final message of the day. This is from it's from our boy crunchy crunches right again. No, I don't

2528
03:29:36,600 --> 03:29:43,240
Wait, it didn't it didn't load properly. Hang on nightmare. This is this is gonna be good. I probably uh, let's see

2529
03:29:43,880 --> 03:29:46,520
It's already fucking dark at 440. What the fuck?

2530
03:29:50,760 --> 03:29:52,760
You survived my missile

2531
03:29:53,640 --> 03:29:57,240
But you will not be so lucky this time

2532
03:29:57,720 --> 03:30:03,240
Will you see I have a new mission and it puts all of your lives at risk

2533
03:30:04,040 --> 03:30:11,480
The pcp dating sim is real and it is coming. We have made good progress

2534
03:30:11,800 --> 03:30:17,160
We have already completed half the entire soundtrack in just one week

2535
03:30:17,880 --> 03:30:23,240
Costume designs have been finalized and all assets are well underway

2536
03:30:24,120 --> 03:30:27,800
The only thing we're missing is writers

2537
03:30:28,280 --> 03:30:32,920

Venom and you will die

2543
03:30:59,320 --> 03:31:01,320
This is real loud

2544
03:31:08,600 --> 03:31:13,800
I just I just want to say that I'm very very disappointed that that cat is out of the bag about them

2545
03:31:14,440 --> 03:31:20,840
I really thought no one I thought I thought I could hide his existence forever. That that gave me a stroke. Yeah. Yeah

2546
03:31:21,400 --> 03:31:22,600
Yeah

2548
03:31:25,960 --> 03:31:33,000
I guess I just want to say that that that that was like probably one of the funniest things on like the past like

2549
03:31:33,240 --> 03:31:35,080
50 pcps

2550
03:31:35,080 --> 03:31:42,920
Like not just on the strength of it, but the fact that I was experiencing such emotional turmoil and then and then almost if on like

2551
03:31:43,160 --> 03:31:45,160
Q narratively

2552
03:31:45,480 --> 03:31:49,560
The levity accusations hurled at me have devolved into hello

2553
03:31:50,440 --> 03:31:54,120
It's me the the embodiment of a cartoon villain

2554
03:31:55,880 --> 03:32:02,520
Um, that's incredible. Um, I couldn't plan it better myself and frankly it almost makes me forgive you for being a part of the pcp

2555
03:32:02,600 --> 03:32:06,120
Dane sim which is a fake project which isn't actually happening

2556
03:32:06,360 --> 03:32:10,280
It's actually happening in the in in the sense that people say that it's happening

2557
03:32:10,520 --> 03:32:14,040
Blast eye check it's just been people sitting on their thumbs and doing fucking nothing

2558
03:32:14,040 --> 03:32:20,200

03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:32,120
