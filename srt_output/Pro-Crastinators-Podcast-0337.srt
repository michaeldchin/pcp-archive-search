1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy. That's son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, it's The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Woo!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's January 4th, 2018.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No it isn't.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh yeah, you're right. It's not.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well anyway, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't know what that was in reference to.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I just thought it was about The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You should let him know that he made a mistake.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It was in reference to the specific time in the past.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I did a lot of things this week actually. I have a number of things that happened.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Big week.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Big week for me.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Do you want to talk first about Twitter exploding a little bit?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I mean, what do you mean?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well you know, everybody thought it was going to die when all of the employees were locked out of the building.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Because Elon had fired so many people that it included the guy who was in charge of the doors and the locking security stuff.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Is that what happened?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, for a brief time, everyone was locked out of the building and then somebody projected some Elon hate onto the side of the building.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And I saw a video of it.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, like video projected?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, that's funny. No, I missed all this.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll be honest, like all the Twitter nonsense has just started to blend together and I've just kind of not even been paying attention anymore.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, I mean, I've been more on Twitter now than ever in part because it's funny.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But now's the time for it, I guess.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know. Well, it was really fun because like...

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now or never.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All the people I'm following, a lot of them are like, you know, they're doing funny bits, they're making jokes and they're also getting emotional because it's like all their friends were on Twitter and if it actually goes, it would be sad.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And I'm like, oh, shit, you know, it is kind of sad.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I mean, my base isn't on Twitter.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have like a groove from YouTube, essentially.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So like I have, most of my audience knows me elsewhere anyway.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But it is true that I have made some Twitter friends and I'm like, dang, I'm going to follow them.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But it is sort of like a, people are describing, it's like the end of high school.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Like the night when people were told that things, there was like no engineers working on Twitter and everyone's looked out of the building.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's like, well, this is probably it.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It wasn't.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But it was very fun.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's very funny.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I see.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I did notice an uptake and people saying like, this is it.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Twitter's really going down.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I hadn't really been paying attention.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And, you know, I guess it's easy to say in hindsight that it wasn't going to be the end.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My expectation is not that Twitter is actually going to like just blink off out of existence.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Although I guess I can see why you would think so if it's like the doors are locked and the headquarters is closed.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I get that.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That was like, like what?

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Huh?

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Like how, even then, I didn't think it was going to like immediately blink off because people who knew about technology, they had a few threads and I was reading them.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And they were saying basically that without the engineers that Elon has fired and, you know, all of the people that were good at stuff.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Eventually, if Twitter just continues going, it can work by itself.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But as soon as there's a bug and there's not somebody around to immediately fix it, it'll compound on itself and then the site will become unusable.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And certain vital things will be like your privacy options will be like all fucked up.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There's lots of possible things that could go terribly, terribly wrong and ruin everything.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So it would have been essentially, if any of those things happened, they still could happen because like, I don't know what's going on.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I mean, he's back in the building now.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They've got these, Elon's got his like, the little ragtag group of people who have agreed to work.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:39,000
His funny little, what do I want to call it, his funny little midlife crisis, you know, LARPing as a little startup company like, oh yeah, we'll just get my little team in here and we'll just problem solve.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We'll just draw stuff on a whiteboard.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ooh, it'll just like, yeah, just like when we were starting PayPal or whatever, guys.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We were just working out of our garage, just like the good old days, right?

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right, my like 22 year old intern.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr Musk, sir.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's kind of sad.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Call me, call me, Elon, call me, Elon.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's kind of sad that like, obviously a lot of people left because Elon asked them to work harder, longer hours for the same pay.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Right.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Which is what he called going hardcore in order to get the site working.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Right.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And most people said fuck that and left and then they got scooped up by other tech companies because they're talented.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But some people like have their visas tied to working for Twitter.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So they can't leave.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Cringe.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Cringe.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So there's just a few like hundred people, maybe a thousand.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And they're just either they like Elon Musk, Lamau, or they just they can't really get a better deal anywhere else at the moment.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll be perfectly candid.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm not like, I'm not overly precious about like the jobs of people working at Twitter.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Because like, you know, why should they be any more secure?

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why should they read moral outrage over firing people at Twitter as opposed to anyone else?

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm not like, no, you can't fire people that work at Twitter.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't see why you would defend anything Elon is doing in any way though.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, no.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I mean, I'm not like that.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What I don't understand, I genuinely, it took me a back and it made me feel like I was going crazy.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When I started seeing the pictures of like Elon Thanos snapping all of the workers at Twitter and they're all the screaming woman from when Trump got elected.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And they're all and I was like, what is it?

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What does this mean?

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like is I genuinely was not aware that like is the perception that like everyone that works at Twitter is like an SJW feminist or something?

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Like what?

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I think I mean, that's definitely that's definitely the angle that like Elon fans.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And Elon himself are sort of sticking with because there's no, there's no, there's no idea where that comes from.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There's no idea where that comes from.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There's no way that Elon Musk made a mistake.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It must be because the Twitter stuff, the workers, there's damn dirty workers.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They're just doing a bad job.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And this is the reason Twitter is dying.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Elon did them a favor by getting rid of them.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't know.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Did that stereotype just pop into existence overnight?

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Or was it already like a thing that like, oh, I mean, I know.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I know that there's sort of like the, oh, global homo, like every big, every big tech company is like liberal and donates to Democrats and they're all in the pocket of George Soros or whatever.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is it just that?

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I think it must be.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hmm.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I mean, I don't see that many people doing that.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Doing that is the hardcore Elon sims.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And it's just, it's terrible.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I mean, yeah, that's, that's just when I, when I, when I look at an Elon tweet and I look and you scroll down in the, in the replies, you inevitably see that picture of Elon Thanos snapping away all the SJW feminists.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And it's just, and it just, it, it's not even, it almost doesn't even make me mad because it's just so, it doesn't even like, it doesn't even comment on like a reality that I feel that I exist in or can even like understand.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Um, yeah.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, it is.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It has been a very, it's been a very odd time.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm, I'm, I'm thankful that it's still around.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I feel like what's going to happen.

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I would be very sad if Twitter actually died.

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Like I would, I would hate it.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Because that really isn't a replacement for it.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I have made a Tumblr, give and take art if you want to check that out.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I posted my Clarissa comics.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't know really what I'm going to do with it.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm thinking it's just as a backup for my main social media presence because I don't like any of the other options, but that it's not the same as Twitter.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You don't get that, that you can't really do replies to people in the same way.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You can do, you do reblogs.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Reblogs and it's like, I just want to speak.

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't want, whatever.

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I understand.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I've heard a couple times this week I got, I heard the notion being tossed around, and this is not a Twitter replacement, but like people said like Ben, you should make clips of your video.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You should make like highlight clips and put them on TikTok.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Like maybe the funny moments or like funny bits or interesting bits from like the Mega Man lecture, for instance, and just start posting them on TikTok.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I, honestly, I'm scared to do that because like I'd be starting a fresh account with no followers and like, I'm genuinely horrified of the prospect of doing that.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And then like, it doesn't go anywhere and like I wasted my time.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Like, I can't think of a worse feeling than if that happened.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I feel like, I mean, there's always a site that's like, oh, people are on this site.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You should check it out.

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I'm like, but I don't use it.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Like I'm going to be like weird.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm going to be like not the sort of thing that people want to see and it's going to take a while.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And I'm just like, I don't want to involve myself even though it's good for like marketing or whatever.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But marketing sucks.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I know.

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Clips of my videos are not the kind of thing that I think of when I see TikTok content, but like I'm sure that like other kinds of TikTok stuff.

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I've like, I've never even, I've never used TikTok.

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The only time I see TikTok is when a viral TikTok makes its way onto Twitter and I see it there.

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah.

163
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So I'm sure there's markets for other different kinds of stuff.

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Obviously your Mega Man lecture is about to release today as we're recording.

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
In about two hours, yeah.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh my God.

167
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But I clicked on the premiere thing and it's got that trailer, that snippet of you just listing all of the Mega Man games and there's so many of them and they just fill the screen.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That could make a TikTok.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How is it?

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Is it one minute?

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Do TikToks have to be under a minute long or three minutes?

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Vine had like a really short time.

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know what TikTok has.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But yeah, it's probably a short-ish time.

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I've seen kind of long TikToks before.

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think it could easily fit.

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You know, it was Doid Gaser of all people.

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It was Doid Gaser that DM'd me and suggested clipping stuff for TikTok and I thought maybe.

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You know, yesterday I called in to Astereos' show.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He was doing a watch along of Kick Asia, the Channel Awesome movie.

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And he told me on Twitter, you should call in and I was like, okay, and I did.

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And he also was like, he wanted to start clipping clips of the loudest podcasts and putting them on TikTok.

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not a Twitter replacement.

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And I'm not sure if I'm interested in using TikTok as a consumer.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I gave it a try once.

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah.

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's one of those like endless, you just scroll down and if you see something that's slightly interesting for the first few seconds or like half a second or a frame, it's like, oh, I guess I'll watch this.

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't care.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And you just keep going and going and going.

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's kind of a brain-empty like noise thing to me.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The YouTube shorts interface is kind of like that, right?

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Like he just kind of scroll like one after the other after the other.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And they auto-play.

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah.

198
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's a different vibe.

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm not really into it, but I could see the appeal of just sort of being like, whatever, just fill my brain with fucking pixels or something.

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I just need something.

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's what people say.

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's what people say about TikTok.

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's fucking hypnotizing.

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah.

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, I can imagine.

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They're getting you with that endless stream of crap.

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I mean, hey, that's just content, I guess.

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know, before we move on from the Twitter subject, I just want to ask if you are aware of the chili discourse?

210
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh, yeah.

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Did we talk about that last time?

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Did we mention it?

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We did.

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's been going on for such a long time.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I mean, maybe we didn't talk about it, but it's been like more than a week, I'm sure, that that has been like perpetually people freaking out over nothing.

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's ableist to give your neighbors chili.

217
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Maybe we did.

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Maybe we did talk about it last week.

219
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I just can't believe it.

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I just can't believe it.

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It just keeps going.

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What is it?

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's unfilomable.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Disabled people just have too many rights.

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
All right.

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
They've run them.

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
They've run amuck.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We gave them some privileges and they were abusing them.

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So we have to, I'm sorry, we have to roll them back.

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's not okay.

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They can't keep getting away with it.

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's just so presumptuous on the part of the people that she's making the chili for, that I just don't, like, I guess all of these people who are upset are thinking, God, I hope somebody doesn't knock on my door and say hello to me and give me something.

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What if I don't like it?

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What if I don't like to talk to people?

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's just sort of like so boring, like so petty, so insignificant.

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Don't worry about it.

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What if I don't want to have someone knock on my door?

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What if I don't want to meet my neighbors?

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What if I don't like the chili?

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What if the chili has an ingredient that I can't eat?

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What it, one of the most fucking buck wild ones I saw was what if they don't have bowls?

244
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah.

245
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What if they don't have, not everyone has bowls.

246
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Not everyone has the spoons to do dishes and have clean bowls to eat your presumptuous white people chili out of.

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Cracker.

248
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's like, I guess, like, if you don't have any bowls, the person making the chili could bring some.

249
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Like, these issues have such simple solutions.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can eat it with a fucking spoon!

251
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You can eat it with a fucking spoon out of the crock pot.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Out of the pot, yeah.

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's like, they don't think, like, one step ahead of like, oh, the consequence of that, like,

254
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
like potential, like, issue is that, oh, sorry, I can't eat, like, meat, or I can't eat this.

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But thank you.

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And then you close the door.

257
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Like, it's so insignificant of an issue.

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Like, it's really funny.

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The fact that, like, some people are saying it's like an issue of consent.

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Like, she didn't, like, she did not get their consent to give them the chili.

261
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's like, it's not like, you didn't, like, force this chili, like, through their fucking, you know, doggy door.

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You didn't force it on them.

263
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You just throw it at them.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You went to their house and you asked, would you like this?

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I made you this chili as a gift.

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Would you like it?

267
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
They can, they can, that's where the consent comes in.

268
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You fucking psychopaths.

269
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Just, like, getting a little stuff in their mouth.

270
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh, but you didn't ask consent to ask my consent.

271
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, you did.

272
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Okay, but you didn't ask consent to ask consent to ask consent.

273
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah.

274
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I sent a little letter to us for consent, but what if they can't read?

275
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Did you ask consent to write the letter?

276
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Did you ask consent to write the letter?

277
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What if you wrote it on paper?

278
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What if they can't read?

279
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What if they can't read?

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What if they can't read?

281
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What if they, what if they...

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Wasn't on vegan paper?

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah, it's like all of these fucking things.

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm like, I guess people are really bored.

285
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I guess people are just, they really want to get mad at something and they don't have anything.

286
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
At the moment, even though there's really so many things to get mad at, I don't get it.

287
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't know.

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You know, you know, to tie it all back, my hero, George the cat, made a triumphant return.

289
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Again, viciously attacking the disabled community once more as he is want to do.

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
There was, there was, it's not directly chili related, but it was somewhat, someone was

291
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
complaining that like the labor movement is bad because like people at like a Starbucks

292
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
strike, people, striking workers weren't wearing masks because so like they're anti, they're

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
against the disabled.

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They want to give me a long COVID or something.

295
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And George, George the cat politely disagreed, thereby setting back disability to say the

296
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
rights of disabled people hundreds of thousands of years.

297
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That cat is too powerful.

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That cat, I said on Twitter, I said, oh no, he tasted the blood of the disabled once and

299
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
now he's addicted.

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He can't get enough.

301
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Social anxiety, it's hard to say no to chili and now I have to eat it.

302
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah.

303
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't, I don't have, I don't know if I could throw it away.

304
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Then don't have the spoons to refuse the chili.

305
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh no, now I have to choose.

306
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Now I've given this this disgusting white person chili and now I have to.

307
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh God.

308
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Now I have to, I have to wash a bowl to eat it out of God.

309
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm having an episode.

310
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm having a fucking anxiety attack.

311
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm going down.

312
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's like, I don't know.

313
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Maybe an anxiety attack would happen.

314
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But like, why is it the chili neighbors like fault for thinking, like not thinking of that

315
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
potential eventuality?

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Like it's nice to try.

317
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
There's so many, so many universes in which nothing bad happens at all.

318
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's a good thing.

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You fuck.

320
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I think you're just racist, Gib.

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I think I am.

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Racist against the disabled.

323
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay.

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
God damn.

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah.

326
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Twitter.

327
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll miss Twitter though.

328
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I love Twitter.

329
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It'll never be the same.

330
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I've been doing more, more drunk posting.

331
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's great.

332
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh yeah.

333
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
My tweets, they're less funny and they're stupid.

334
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But there's more of them.

335
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There's more of them.

336
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes.

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Cool.

338
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes.

339
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And also it's just been, I don't know, very, very gender over there right now.

340
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I posted like, you saw the-

341
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
On your account, you mean?

342
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
On my account.

343
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And also just with people I'm interacting with.

344
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's just all like this.

345
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's been very gender.

346
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's been very gender.

347
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's very funny.

348
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I posted the image of me with the goth makeup on and stuff.

349
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And then I posted a picture of me wearing makeup out in the real world for the first time.

350
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I got so many likes.

351
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I feel so real.

352
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't got too many likes.

353
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I got more likes than my video announcement.

354
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I didn't appreciate that.

355
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That made me angry.

356
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You should have gone full goth.

357
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I would have made it better.

358
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

359
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

360
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000

True.

385
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Well, what's the other one?

386
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What do you say?

387
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't know what to do.

388
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Don't care, didn't ask?

389
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I think that's fine.

390
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah.

391
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I've come under-

392
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Too long in Rean.

393
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Or Redman comic?

394
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Too long in Rean.

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Can someone give me the TLDR on this Redman comic?

396
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Who is the last panel?

397
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I got to get back to it.

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah, with no words.

399
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
TLDR.

400
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No.

401
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
MMMm.

402
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
MMM.

403
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
MMMM.

404
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
MMM.

405
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And on the subject of gender?

406
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,840
not really but this is a segue that I'll use. I've made a big change in my life recently.

407
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:17,720
I have stopped friendship ended with rain sounds for sleeping. No more rain sounds. Rain sounds

408
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,080
are yesterday's news. Rain sounds are like Twitter and now the truth social, the new

409
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:32,320
platform that everyone's moving to instead is train sounds. Train sounds are the new thing for me.

410
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:40,760
Oh, so it's like tea rain. I was going to do like a teapane autotune thing but I can't do that with

411
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:49,400
my voice. Wait, why is that gender? Because you transitioned from one thing to another?

412
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:59,080
No, the gender part of it is that I had a dream. I was listening to train sounds for sleeping and I

413
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:06,120
had a dream and I don't remember the dream but I woke up. This was like the day after I had like set

414
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:14,760
the Mega Man lecture to premiere and so I woke up convinced. I woke up convinced that this had

415
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,240
happened and I was thinking why did I do that? Oh no, why did I do that? That's so like doesn't

416
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,640
make any sense that I did that and what I thought I had done was upload a train like a recording of

417
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:35,560
train sounds on a Japanese train platform that had included audio of a Japanese non-binary person

418
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,400
getting into a violent argument with a passerby about their pronouns. I was sure that this had

419
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,360
happened. I was sure that this was on my channel and I was like why did I post that like the day

420
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:55,000
before my Mega Man video? What was I thinking? That doesn't make any sense. That's such a specific

421
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,840
thing. I know and I rolled around in bed I was like oh I should get out of bed and I should

422
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,880
delete that off my channel but no I'm so tired. Was it like you filmed that video and you caught

423
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,680
that and you're just like oh fuck it I'll upload it? Yeah, that's what I thought happened. I wonder

424
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:20,920
what this means. Why did I record that? Why did I upload it? Why was I in Japan?

425
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:30,760
Somewhere there's some sort of connection here. Make an answer in Japan. It's just a

426
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:41,320
wires crossed thing. It's just like I uploaded a video and I'm listening to a video about train

427
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,400
sounds therefore I must have uploaded a video about train sounds and also pronouns.

428
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,680
And I don't know that's it. That's my story. Ben, when are you gonna come out as non-binary?

429
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:02,760
When are you gonna do it? Everyone's non-binary. That's not true. That's not true.

430
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Oh that's the classic like oh but everybody feels this way. Like literally everybody

431
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,000
every every guy wishes they were a girl obviously we just deal with it stupid.

432
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,440
We're all in the spectrum. We're all in the gender spectrum. Just like we're all in the autistic

433
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,880
spectrum. Yeah literally everyone. So I'm already out as non-binary. We all are one to one degree

434
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:37,480
or another. I'm just kind of like not very far along on the spectrum. Listen I accept they them

435
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,920
pronouns as does most everyone you know. Is that not enough? Is that not enough? Are you trying to

436
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,200
groom me? I'm being groomed. I'm being groomed. I'm grooming you right now. No you heard it.

437
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,600
You heard it. You heard it here. Oh man speaking of grooming. No but kind of. To make a man

438
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:06,520
lecture. Well I was gonna say um yeah I was on a stereosis stream the other day and it was pretty

439
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:15,880
fun. He knew he knew a surprisingly little about channel awesome stuff like he didn't know. I mean

440
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:24,200
he's a bit older isn't he? He's 40 I think. So he's a few years older than me. But he um he knew

441
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,760
who the nostalgia critic was but like he had no idea who Linkara was or the nostalgia chick or

442
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Lindsay Ellis or Spoonie or any of those people. I mean you kind of I learned through channel awesome

443
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,760
collabs who those people were as well back in the day. So if you weren't like following nostalgia

444
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,920
critic you probably wouldn't have found a lot of those other guys either. Well I never watched those

445
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,960
people but I mean as I explained because he had a couple of people in the call sort of explaining

446
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:59,960
it to him and I was able to uh I think I was able to discern like what he needed to know in order

447
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,920
to understand like what is the what is going on with this with this collective of people. So I

448
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,280
was able to jump in and explain to him that like okay so the thing about channel awesome is the way

449
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,320
that it was structured was that basically Doug just picked like a bunch of little clones of himself

450
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:24,280
with various gimmicks to become his weird little like empire. And uh and I and I it was like and

451
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,000
I think I was unusual because I'm like more familiar with a lot of these people from like

452
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,040
after they were involved with the nostalgia critic because I didn't actually watch channel

453
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:40,120
awesome but I'm familiar with Spoonie and Linkara and then and Lindsay Ellis like by reputation

454
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,560
uh mostly like in like a in like a largely post channel awesome world.

455
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,360
Wait when when did you learn about Linkara? Did you watch Linkara or just hear about like funny

456
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,800
things? I know you know what it was I learned about Linkara through I think it must have been

457
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,880
the something awful forums because people on you know yeah it was it was yes it was because back

458
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,920
in the day I would read something awful and I would read the threads about Chris Chan and I

459
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,120
would read the threads about um Control Alt Delete Tim Buckley you know the webcomic the lost

460
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,360
webcomic yeah yeah um yeah and on the something awful forums I would hear people yeah I would hear

461
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,000
people make fun of Linkara I would hear people say oh he's uh he's a chaser or whatever oh he's a

462
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,400
dweeb uh things like that and uh you know he wears a fedora haha oh he has a funny voice

463
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,640
uh he's he's fat yeah and um that's what I learned about Linkara I think I

464
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,600
probably must have well because you know because he made that webcomic he made that

465
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,360
terrible webcomic called the light bringer yes and so and so yes and I got this and so he got

466
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:58,840
discussed on like discussions of bad webcomics a lot of the time um other other people I think

467
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,080
I just heard about through like youtuber stuff like other youtubers mentioning spoonie and uh

468
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:14,200
nostalgia chick and stuff like that um yeah and it was pretty fun the video is probably like still

469
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,800
up if anyone's interested they could probably go still watch that uh on a stereosis channel

470
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:26,680
be watch along of kagassia and I'm in it for maybe like maybe like a third of it and like

471
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:33,080
after like an hour or two I don't know what's the time I oh it's I think I think the channel

472
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:40,440
is is actually called the loudest podcast it's yeah it's the loudest podcast channel on you

473
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:48,120
know what let me see if I can just find the video uh you know he uh I'd never actually

474
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,040
spoken I was sure that I had talked to him before because I mean I've met sarancha and I've talked

475
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,600
you know who that is right mm-hmm yeah I've met her and I've talked to her but I've never

476
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,280
actually met or talked to his dear I just assumed I had but he told me and I did not realize this

477
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,680
that he he told me he has the cancel ben saint shirt and that he wears it all the time he told me

478
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,680
that's on the stream I couldn't believe it and I asked like wait a minute but did you have the one

479
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,120
I didn't I didn't refer to her by name I did not refer to may by name but I said do you have the

480
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,120
one that my enemy was raffling off or do you did you buy one for me because he wasn't he was not

481
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:36,280
aware my enemy my I said my enemy because uh you know a person of such little importance a person

482
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:42,520
of such little uh grace or cunning or courage does not deserve does not deserve to be mentioned by

483
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:51,720
name but uh uh he he had the shirt I was like wow even I don't have the shirt but he he was not aware

484
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:59,800
that I had made that shirt in response to may raffling off one so I don't know this is very

485
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,240
it's very strange uh let me see the what does what does the stereos know about your work did he

486
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:15,640
watch your videos he like your lectures I think that he must well I think sarancia did because

487
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:22,760
like sarancia was like kind of a chris story in or kind of a chris fan so I think she was probably

488
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,040
familiar with the lecture and she probably showed it to him and so he's probably seen it that because

489
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,560
you know they have like a they have like a side show or like a patron's only show where they do

490
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,480
like chrystery stuff or like sarancia explains chrystery to the stereos I was I was I was supposed

491
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,080
to be on that we talked about it a long time ago pre-covid yeah the plan was that they were going

494
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,680
chris show and I was going to be a guest on that and then COVID happened and then there was no more

495
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:08,440
and then there was no more travel allowed so so there you go so if there's noises by the way I'm

496
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:18,200
eating lunch I got a venison stew it's very very nice oh it's really funny oh he titled okay it's

497
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,960
not on his main it's not on the main tab of the youtube channel it's on the live tab and it's

498
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,000
called the nostalgia nerd watch along he like could not remember that the guy's name is the

499
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:38,840
nostalgic critic he kept calling him the nostalgia nerd um anyway true the link there I found the link

500
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:54,040
I found the link so that was fun um let's see I have a lit oh well let me see if there's anything

501
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:02,840
else on my list before I get into that that other thing um oh I played a video game I played a video

502
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,440
game this week wow I think it was actually I think it was like immediately after the last week we

503
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:15,880
recorded I went and I played this video game just on a complete whim the video game in question is

504
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:24,360
called clash at demonhead on the on the NES are you familiar I'm familiar with the bands named after

505
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,920
it in the fictional universe of scott pilgrim I didn't actually know it was a game it is it is a game

506
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:37,480
yeah until what's you do what's you do in the game game it was so it was great it was I loved it

507
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:45,400
I loved it um the the uh wait a minute I was gonna say I've been watching uh this youtube channel

508
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:53,320
called hungry gorya which is a I think it's it's one of the legend of zelda bosses is a gorya

509
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:01,080
the one you have to give the meat to um yeah anyway I don't know zelda oh okay well anyway

510
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:12,200
hungry gorya does a lot of like retro reviews of mostly like rpgs on sometimes the nests but mostly

511
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:21,640
like the sega master system for some reason uh and I was just watching her videos and uh one of

512
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:29,320
them she there was one that was like you know top 10 uh like action rpgs on the nests and one of the

513
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,440
ones that was on there was clash at demonhead and I remembered oh clash at demonhead that's the game

514
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,840
that the band and scott pilgrim is named after and you know I watched the review of it and I was like

515
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,880
this game looks cool this game looks awesome I was like well I'm just gonna play it and I did

516
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:51,000
and it was awesome it was kind of like it's a bit like zelda 2 you know zelda 2 the one with

517
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,800
like the side scrolling yeah it's a bit like the down sword thing yeah yeah yeah it's kind of like

518
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,640
that only uh the differences are instead of like you know in that game you sort of wander around a

519
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:11,320
world map and you kind of get into random battles um in clash at demonhead there's a map let me let me

520
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:20,600
find a picture of the map right uh first of all the game is extremely anime it it feels like it's

521
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:30,120
based on like a uh who's the mangaka that did like ranma and inuyasha uh I don't know his name

522
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:39,720
it's a woman oh I don't know her name rumiko it rumiko takahashi it's like uh it it feels exactly

523
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,160
as though it's like based on like a rumiko takahashi manga but it's not it's they just made it a game

524
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:54,520
that that feels like it's that uh uh anyway so there you gotta rescue you know you gotta save

525
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,360
professor plum who's been kidnapped he made a doomsday bomb and you gotta save him kludo no

526
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:09,160
from earth uh uh clash demonhead map so you gotta go around you gotta go around this mountain

527
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,440
and post the map of this freaking world map of this mountain and uh you gotta go you gotta go

528
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,480
along these routes and so instead of wandering around around a world map and getting into like

529
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:26,840
environment battles you start at like the junction of route one and you just choose a route and you

530
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,960
just walk along the path between like you know you walk along route two between like the junction

531
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,400
that goes to up to the the route on between five and eleven and then from there you can take route

532
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,200
eleven to route nine and then after route nine you can choose oh do I go on three or on six or on

533
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,000
twelve or whatever and every time you go along a route there is you know the same little you know

534
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,560
terrain that you gotta go over and there's enemies and you gotta shoot them also you you have a gun

535
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,760
instead of a sword but other than that it's very similar to like side the side scroller uh zelda

536
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:05,320
two it's a little map yeah and um you go around and sometimes you find an npc who will give you

537
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:11,560
a hint about where to go okay the thing that sucks the thing that sucks is that in the game the routes

538
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:18,360
are not well they are numbered but you can't see the numbers on the map you can only see the numbers

539
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,120
of the routes that you're immediately adjacent to so you can see the whole map but you can't see

540
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,840
the numbers so if you want to have an actual I didn't do this I cheated a little bit if you really

541
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,840
were if you were playing the game on the nest back in the day you would have had to take a pencil

542
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:38,040
and paper and go around the whole world in every map and like label it on like a piece of paper so

543
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,200
you would know so that when fucking michael or whoever tells you you know that you gotta go

544
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,680
and stop the guy on route 33 you would have to refer to your notes and be like wait a minute

545
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,600
where's route 33 oh okay that's route there I gotta go there all right uh I didn't do that

546
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:02,440
I just cheated and used them out like a fucking pussy um it's interesting you say both route and

547
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,160
route interchangeably oh did I yeah you kept switching

548
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:17,800
I don't know why I don't know why I do that um it's funny because it's like a route

549
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,840
usually just means to like defeat an enemy and make them run away but a pathway is always a route

550
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,720
and like making pathways is a route and a you know a wireless router

551
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,760
in your home would give you why a wireless route it's a router it's a router

552
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,080
but you but it's it's it's connecting routes it's it's it's one of those words that is just

553
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:50,200
connecting routes it's connecting routes no I don't know to me to me route and route both

554
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:58,360
equally mean a way or a path so yeah I guess I just use either way I've never really looked

555
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,080
into the etymology of that why this they sound different I always thought it was just an American

556
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,040
thing but I've heard but now that I've heard you say a route is a route and also a route I'm like

557
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:15,320
wow what the hell is the rules well a well a route a route like a defeat in battle is r-o-u-t

558
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:23,720
yeah it's not it's not r-o-u-t-e yeah that's the uh who knows yeah I could wikipedia this I think it's

559
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,840
not well I think it's the same word I mean I think it's just like library versus library

560
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,840
just like people choose to pronounce library well that's that's just like a mispronunciation but you

561
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:42,680
know what I mean uh like often and often say it's the same word just two different people

562
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:49,960
choose to say it differently or regional uh I don't know why I say it both ways listen I just

563
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,840
want to I just want to it's going to express how much I just want to clash some demon heads I just

564
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:02,840
want to express how much I enjoyed clash a demon head there was the one one criticism I will say

565
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,640
of it is that they do have they do repeat terrain like a bunch of different routes have like very

566
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:14,040
similar shaped paths like they kind of did a little copy pasting which is unfortunate

567
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,760
um there's a shop there's a shop that sells like power-ups and sometimes you need a certain

568
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,720
power-up to like progress like to climb an ice wall or to like super jump over a gap or something like

569
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:39,960
that it's fun sounds fun sounds like a like a little metroidvania precursor oh yeah yeah yeah a little

570
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,960
yeah I mean it's I mean it's pretty similar I mean it's pretty similar to Zelda 2

571
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,880
except I think it's got a little more character because it's got like it's got very funny anime

572
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,120
cutscenes uh hold on every time you talk to an NPC these dialogue bubbles come up and it's and it

573
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:06,120
says it's talk time and uh yeah it's talk time and you know you gotta you gotta I mean here it looks

574
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:13,560
like this oh no it's talking time I don't know it's talking time it's talking time and uh and you

575
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:23,640
know bang bang has to uh you know confront his enemies or whatever yeah that's that style of the

576
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:31,320
guy at the top what is that guy what is that thing that's bang police no but like there's a style of

577
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,960
anime like manga I've seen it's old you know I think I know what you mean it's like a big

578
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:45,080
burly policeman a manga from like the 70s or something yeah no I I know what you're talking

579
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,840
about I know what you're talking about I know him mostly because he's in like all those shonen jump

580
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:59,400
manga fighting games yes yes yes of course how could how could we forget uh I I don't know what

581
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:10,520
it's called I know the one I know the one that you're talking about um I yeah yeah I like these

582
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:15,960
guys Tom Guycott the chief of governors and I'll be waiting for you in my desert fortress on route

583
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:23,320
33 uh every time there's like there's six well you gotta collect seven medallions but you gotta kill

584
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,760
six bosses and they drop a little they drop a little uh Hebrew a little star of David

585
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,360
little Hebrew one because they're part of the Jewish Illuminati they're all part of like the

586
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,320
bankers uh you know they control in the world governments and all that that's not true that's

587
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,640
not what I didn't mean to say that it just sort of slipped out it just slipped out uh uh Kanye told

588
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:50,440
me to say it um uh anyway now they got these demon medallions and there's also a demon spoiler there

589
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:58,360
is a demon do clash I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not gonna say you do clash I'm not gonna say you

590
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:05,640
don't clash uh suspense you just have to play the game find out for yourself uh took me around took

591
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:12,040
me around I think it took me around like eight hours like six or eight hours uh maybe maybe maybe

592
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:19,720
longer than that uh I don't know I guess I guess all I could say is it was just a lot of fun and I

593
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,600
liked the video and I was like hey wow video games can be good I was just impressed that like

594
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,840
this just feels like a really big just feels like just felt like a really big game

595
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,120
for like a freaking nest title you know I mean I guess there were other I mean I guess Metroid

596
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:43,240
was pretty big the Zeldas were pretty big how how long is a is a route on this um a route

597
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:49,480
is yeah you've said it already not especially long I mean it's probably like

598
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:59,160
they they vary but they might be eight or 12 or 60 or screens screens long

599
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,120
okay that's quite sizable and if each one of them is like multiple little screens

600
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,920
some they do they do copy paste some areas and you can tell that like oh this this little like

601
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,000
this little like uh section that I got to jump over is the same shape as this other one just

602
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,560
like with a different like you know a texture pack applied to the landscape or whatever or like this

603
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,120
this arrangement this arrangement of uh of enemies is the same they've just been like reskinned

604
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:36,200
into like a different like regional enemy type or whatever and that's fine and that's fine you

605
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,440
know they had to do what they had to do back then they had to copy and paste the little stuff to

606
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,480
like make the game to stretch the game out a little bit you know it's forgivable I mean I honestly

607
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,640
don't mind that in lots of games where like you've got the the green goblins in the early stages but

608
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,880
then you get to the harder places and you've got the exact same but they're different they're red

609
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,920
goblins now and they're slightly more powerful it's like oh I'm progressing that's true doesn't

610
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,560
really bother me that much I would I get you know I guess if I have to if I have to criticize a

611
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:11,800
little more not a lot not a huge amount of enemy variety a lot of the enemies just are like a little

612
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,520
guy that flies around and shoots a little bullet at you some of them like some of them like are

613
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:22,520
like tall enemies that like run at you but like they all mostly act the same the bosses are very

614
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,720
interesting there's like seven or eight bosses and they're all like completely different and they're

615
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:34,280
really fun uh so that was great the regular enemies some of them are some of them are pretty cute oh

616
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:40,440
there's a little red they're a little red man faces ah there's a little picture oh damn do you know

617
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,160
what they're called I don't know what they're called hang on maybe I could find like a list of all the

618
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:52,040
enemies little red man faces yeah there's this one route early on where there's these little these

619
00:44:52,040 --> 00:45:00,520
little like red man heads uh maybe I could find out that the sprite is resource or something

620
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:07,000
we got paid for like all the uh clash of demon head playable characters okay

621
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:16,200
no let's check out clash of demon head oh no there's a sprite sheet for bosses

622
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,920
but not for regular enemies you've got to be joking what about my little guys

623
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,720
there's a little guy uh representation little red little red head man

624
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:39,160
all right I'm gonna look for it later oh there is a oh yeah one of one of them is one of the

625
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:48,760
bosses is just undyne it's it's just like an anime like fish fish girl uh gotta play it

626

628
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,040
I didn't realize she was a girl but no she's definitely wearing like

629
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,680
cute boots and like a skirt and also the more I look the more I played it the more I was like

tell me that that fish girl wouldn't couldn't have been in Scott Pilgrim uh like as a human being

632
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:31,560
I don't know I mean whatever I I kind of know what you mean you'd see that it's it's this it's the

633
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:39,080
sort of the chibi sort of legs yeah big similar sort of like the big big round eyes the stump

the stumpy feet the stumpy leg yeah you know what I mean she's she's got that she's got she's got

635
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:54,200
the uh the Ramona flowers body type the feet phenotype you know what I'm saying I don't even know

636
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:02,120
what I'm saying um well shit I guess I don't have that much specific to say because I'm not very

637
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:11,160
good at talking about video games but what a cool game speaking about not being good at talking about

638
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:18,760
video games yeah mega man lecture yeah it's finished mega man lecture is finished it is

640
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,800
speaking from the future of this friday when this episode goes live I can confidently say that

641
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:40,200
everybody loved it it was a huge smash hit million views in a second oh my god so proud

642
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:47,800
channel's back channel's back baby um you could even say the channel is awesome yeah

643
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:59,320
um I'm just thinking you know I've said it before if it does well I have what I what I have done

644
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,200
what I have done what I have accomplished with this lecture is that I have unshackled myself

645
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:12,760
I've unshackled myself from the chains of radcon right I'm no longer before I was like I'll

646
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:18,600
make lectures at radcons and that was the plan I gotta be dependent on victor to film me or

647
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:25,720
whatever give me a freaking lav mic man no hate no hate but goddamn the audio quality in those

648
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:32,040
old lectures is ass it's truly ass I cannot I cannot believe going back to them that how

649
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:38,520
shitty they sound all of them I can't remember all of them well I don't know all of them like

650
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:46,440
the lav mics okay most of the time I don't know I mean I was lav mic'd in the sonichu 101 lecture

651
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:53,480
and in the um the um uh what do you call it uh the kokoro wish lecture I mean it's audible

652
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,920
it's not like a it's not like an unlistenable disaster but like it's not good it's not good

653
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:06,280
I mean compared to the new one where I used I used a real mic the difference is night and day

654
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,200
as far as I'm concerned um but anyway I I feel like I might want to do a lecture

655
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,600
but not because I want to tell people about something I just want to stand with a microphone

656
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,840
in my hand like a like a singing microphone and do like a stand-up routine but I'm talking about

657
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,640
stuff in front of what in front of what what what if I did a lecture but instead of like talking

658
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,760
about something I was just telling jokes just standing in front of a wall telling

659
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:34,280
like what would you call that what would you call that I'd be standing up probably hmm yeah I don't

660
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:41,400
know uh uh but but I was just saying what I've done is that you know I've I've I've invested in

661
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,080
all the equipment that I need and I've done a proof of concept to prove like I don't need to do I

662
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:50,920
don't need rad con I don't need there to be this big stupid thing nothing again you know and I say

663
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:56,040
stupid lovingly um I don't need to have this big like uh production underpinning

664
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:03,560
making a video I guess I can just make one if I want to um and I probably will so that's so that's

665
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:13,080
fun um best hope hope everyone pledges to my Patreon and gets me to a hundred patrons and you

666
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:20,120
can choose my next lecture I think I don't know I'm I might I might tip I might change my mind

667
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:27,800
at the moment at the moment I'm kind of thinking that maybe like a a a pcp history or like or the

668
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:35,720
downfall of digi bro or like or or the bro or a new the new brony lecture might be might be the one

669
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:41,960
that I want to do next hmm uh uh pot I don't know I don't think there's like really that big a market

670
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:48,200
for it no that'd be like a very indulgent that that'll be like an in-joke kind of heavy one

671
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,600
with the audience yeah maybe I shouldn't do that right away maybe I should do something

672
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,560
that could be a patron exclusive little secret lecture well the well the patreon

673
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:03,560
thing is like people get to vote on one so like honestly I'm not sure if if that were up for a

674
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:10,360
vote if that would win because that's like you know that's niche um wait wait I had I had a

675
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:16,680
couple of like possibilities written out on the list uh let me let me read off my list of like

676
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,040
lecture ideas uh what do they have here oh some of these are terrible

677
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,360
uh some of these are really shit but I'll but I'll read them anyway um

678
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,640
one idea was like the history of Oolulilia eh

679
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,960
uh one idea okay this one is fucking this one is stupid um df and stricks

680
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:47,240
uh I'm sure you don't know who that I do I remember is the pro Jared and what's her face

681
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:54,600
Holly's dnd characters yes my idea was what if I explained the fictional like in campaign history

682
00:51:54,600 --> 00:52:01,400
of pro Jared and ha and ha that was topical at the time pro Jared and Holly were like a big

683
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,680
thing I feel like if I release that now like nobody would give a shit

684
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:11,320
uh so I feel like that was there was a time there was a time limit on that one and in his past

685
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:19,800
um uh hit the history of nuzlocs was was one that's it's just about the comic wouldn't it be

686
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,080
the nuzzle leaf well it would start well it would start there but you know then maybe I mean I

687
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:31,320
would have to do some research but like I would track like okay well like how did they grow in

688
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:36,920
popularity from there like did was there like a youtuber that picked up the idea and like who

689
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:43,640
was the first person to make like videos about them you know um stuff like that um Andrew Dobson

690
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:54,200
was one you know who that is um oh I think maybe see like a comic guy that's cringe a little bit

691
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:01,000
yeah he's the guy that draws himself as like the blue teddy bear yeah I vaguely remember

692
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,720
hearing you talk about that guy I figure what he did he's pretty he's done I can't remember he's

693
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,680
done a lot he's done a lot of things but he's very he's pretty funny um oh then my next one was

694
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:20,200
mega man so you know cross cross that one off the list um strip search now there's one that I don't

695
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:26,440
know if it really needs a lecture I don't know if there's really enough to talk about I've talked

696
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:35,640
about strip search here you know you know I know no I don't okay I'm you don't know you do uh

697
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:43,080
people they strip you and they search you know oh no it was the um it was the the reality it was

698
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:48,920
the penny arcade reality show oh I've never been on penny arcade so I'm not aware have I not have

699
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,840
I not told you about strip search because that was like a formative that was like a formative

700
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:59,000
experience for me yeah that was like one of the things that made me want to like become an artist

701
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,960
was like oh my god I wait maybe you have shocking but yeah maybe you have I just forget what is

702
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,120
cool is it like an art people in a house together yes yes it was like a it was like a big brother

703
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:19,880
for comic artists living in a house and it was like it was managed like complete shit like the

704
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:25,880
penny arcade guys had no fucking clue what they were doing it's it's really funny because that

705
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:33,480
it was very it was very wholesome because the uh uh mike and uh oh god wait what's the other one

706
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:44,120
mike and not jay gays you know it's Gabe and taiko mike and jerry mike and jerry mike and jerry

707
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:50,760
have no fucking clue what they're doing they envisioned they envisioned the contest as like a

708
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:57,960
cutthroat like make these people kill each other sort of like thing uh and they have like challenges

709
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,160
and get voted out yes well they didn't vote each other out they had they had they had to beat

710
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:09,560
each other in challenges to eliminate one another and um it's really funny because in the in the

711
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:14,760
house all the artists are like they're all like we're all in this together you know like we're

712
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,320
not they don't they don't make enemies they're all very supportive one another they're all like

713
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:24,200
whoever wins no hard feelings like you know i'm just glad to have met all of you like they're just

714
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,520
they're just like really happy to be there and they're all so sad when anyone has to leave

715
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:34,600
and mike and jerry it's really funny because like it they only appear in the elimination

716
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,920
challenges they're mostly off screen except for there's and when there's an elimination

717
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,120
challenge like the two artists will come in and they're both just kind of like looking at each

718
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,760
other like huh i guess i guess we gotta do this like i'm really sorry about that and mike and

719
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:54,040
like jerry wears this like ridiculous like gold chain like he's trying to look like some sort of

720
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,960
like gangster like uh like i don't know like like a pimp or something he's just like oh i'm gonna

721
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,240
pit these guys to get each other and make them kill each other uh but like by the end it's all

722
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,320
like the the pretense is completely gone every time anyone there's elimination everyone's like

723
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:14,520
why do we do this why did we structure this so we have to eliminate someone uh i just want i just

724
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:22,040
want to hang out with all my friend my new friends guys and um and in hindsight i actually hate it

725
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:27,480
because it turned into this horrible like nepotism club where like everyone who's everyone who stuck

726
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:32,520
around in the contest for long enough eventually just got like a cushy job like working at at

727
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:38,120
penny arcade uh didn't matter didn't really matter if you won didn't matter if you if you lost the

728
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:45,320
winners and losers all more or less came out of it with the same advantages katie rice katie rice

729
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:50,760
ended up winning and katie rice is fascinating because she was one of the people not the principal

730
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:57,640
one but one of the the ones who like me toed uh john crick for lucy the the renon stimpy guy um

731
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:05,000
that's a total total coincidence but she ended up winning but then her winning webcomic idea

732
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,440
ended up i think it was ultimately less successful than the second place winner abby howards

733
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:16,600
webcomic uh the last halloween which she finished and then she kick started for like

734
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:22,440
$50,000 or something and then she went on to become like a children's like nature book illustrator

735
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:32,120
person and then i met her at mice the year before covid and then uh um uh there's there's more i

736
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:39,400
keep going uh amy clearly this is a lot for for a lecture in this because i have no idea about any

737
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,320
of this you know what that's funny i said there's not yeah honestly i could probably i mean it wouldn't

738
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:49,320
be that long of a lecture yeah in eight hours you know what i changed my mind honestly the strip

739
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:56,200
search diaspora the like where are they now sort of um oh yeah that could be good it's because it's

740
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,400
yeah like like half of them half of them just kind of disappeared and were never heard from again

741
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:07,480
and the other half basically got got cushy jobs like in the penny arcade like nepotism empire

742
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,800
and i hate them even the ones that i like i hate that's not true katie rife sort of didn't do that

743
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,840
the winner was supposed to get a wet they could make their own webcomic and it would be hosted on

744
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:25,640
penny arcade that was the ultimate prize and she got that and it was like a disaster for her because

745
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:32,280
honestly there was kind of an embarrassing sort of thing where her webcomic i forget what it was

746
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:38,120
called but the premise of it was about kids that were like abandoned by their parents forever at

747
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:46,440
a summer camp and so that's the premise and then there was this cartoon on like cartoon network

748
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,280
or nicolodian or something that was about kids being stuck at a summer camp and katie had the

749
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:58,360
sort of meltdown where she like thought they had stolen her idea is that craig of the creek or something

750
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:05,080
i don't think it was no i don't think it was that it was a lesser known cartoon that i don't really

751
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,120
hear anyone talk about anymore but the point is she had this meltdown and basically said that

752
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:16,680
she'd been plagiarized and like it's really not that similar and it's really not that novel to like

753
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,720
the idea of being stuck at a summer camp it's really not that unique um so that was a little

754
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:30,520
embarrassing anyway okay the strip search diaspora you know what i might move that one up the list

755
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:35,160
because that one's kind of interesting uh the next one the next one was like digi which would be like

756
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:41,960
that would that would probably it would be about like the rise and fall of digi bro and also the pcp

757
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:49,080
and like the and brony's brony stuff i don't know there's a lot that could go into that one

758
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:55,880
i think i think i think i think like i think of like the digi bro diaspora could be one that

759
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,560
like people would i would probably call i would probably call it the downfall of digi bro is

760
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:07,000
probably what i would title that one as a as an seo measure personally i just wouldn't want to

761
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:15,400
touch all of that but i mean i don't i'll do anything i'll do anything um that that's that's

762
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:24,760
maybe and then i had one occur oh kirby lore kirby lore is is good but also there are already

763
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,920
videos about kirby lore and also i don't know i kind of think that like the kirby lore is a little

764
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:37,240
bit like i you know people love the kirby lore because it's like oh a cute little pink puffball

765
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,240
oh but he he actually fights all these cosmic horrors it's like oh you wouldn't think so

766
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,960
but like there's not that really that much continuity like yeah like marx is in a lot

767
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:52,360
of different games and yeah you know pop star like there is continuity but it's also kind of

768
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,440
just like every game there's like a new crop of like weird fucking cosmic horrors that like

769
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:05,320
yeah i you know there's that i doesn't that i like be like do you mean the one in the cloud

770
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:12,280
cracko no there's like a like a zero like a i think it's oh the dark dark matter or dark

771
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:18,920
matter zero or uh there's some sort of big eye that's like very important i think i think you're

772
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:26,120
talking about i think you're talking about wait wait the white one with the wings yeah oh yeah

773
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:32,600
yeah i know the one from i've seen like an image that yeah there's an image i've seen that like

774
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:38,680
has all of the kirby villains and characters and their links to like who's a clone of who's related

775
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:44,200
to who from space like how is metonite related to kirby and all that sort of stuff

776
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:51,640
where does kobe come from what are the kirbies you know what that one probably could be election

777
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:57,960
i i that one's kind of been talked about a lot i don't know if maybe i would be kind of just

778
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:06,120
trotting on on like well trodden ground with that idea maybe um i mean i haven't seen another

779
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:13,880
like big kirby video but i'm sure they exist well i've seen um oh fuck was it uh was it woolly

780
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:23,080
that did those ones where he sort of like narrates the kirby lore i don't know uh there's um

781
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:33,720
um uh oh here it is here it is uh no it's not woolly no it is woolly yeah woolly versus he

782
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:41,160
did us like a little series where he does it he does a very sort of a dramatic he says sort of

783
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:48,840
like a dramatic reading of like a script explaining like you know the sort of cosmic uh kirby lore

784
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:57,720
prepared to hi um yeah i mean that's not that's not a lecture though okay okay so that's an idea

785
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:02,200
and the most recent idea i had was an infinite jest like explain the plot of infinite jest

786
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,160
which is something that you should cosplay as vincent for that one

787
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:13,400
um and that one's just uh i mean

788
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,120
you could you i mean you could already look up a summary of infinite jest on the internet

789
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:26,520
if you wanted to someone somewhere might appreciate a video explaining it i mean it does have

790
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:35,480
a fairly a fairly complicated plot so i mean yeah it could be it is something that one could

791
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:42,360
simplify a bit and explain in a in lecture format so i mean that's just an idea i don't know commenters

792
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:48,040
if you if you like any of these ideas or you know let me know in the comments you think any of them

793
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:54,520
are particularly appealing uh i'm i'm curious because i mean i i don't know i could do any of these

794
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,320
uh yeah those are just some anyway those are just some ideas for lectures that i could do

795
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,560
now that like i can just make them on my own uh now that i know how to do that

796
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:13,320
and i and i if i did one i would i would hire an editor at least for part of the editing like

797
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:18,600
for the rough cut just like cut out all the silences cut it down to like yeah cut out all

798
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,440
like the unusable footage i would hire an editor for that part that would save me like a week

799
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:30,040
um and probably none of these would be eight hours long so it would not take me like three

800
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:38,120
months to get it done well now how how long from the video being finished to it being uploaded did

801
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:44,200
it take for re-renders and and uploading and stuff you mean like from after i finished editing yeah

802
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:50,200
after you finished editing the first time how long did it take for you finally to get the final render

803
01:04:50,200 --> 01:05:00,840
uploaded oh man let me look at my my file history uh for a second uh let's see where did where did

804
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:09,640
i save that oh it was okay

805
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,520
oh god no that can't be true

806
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:26,680
what is it like oh no no no no it's not that bad it's not that bad okay okay okay uh all right it

807
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:33,560
looked from my file history it looks like the video was filmed uh it was filmed at the end of

808
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:41,160
september and then the rough cut where honestly this maybe should not have taken quite as long

809
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:48,760
the rough cut where i just cut out all the unusable footage was done by september 20th

810
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:55,400
and that really take me almost three weeks i must i mean i was busy i was busy moving and stuff

811
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:02,760
um yeah so that was done by september 20th and then i cleaned it up did it take me a

812
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:08,920
month to clean up the Jesus fucking christ looks like the cleaner cut was done by october 16th

813
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:16,520
and then the final cut that i considered like basically done no this was not done on the 10th

814
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:22,440
i must have like i'm some of these must be like saved later i don't know i think um

815
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:29,480
um i think the fine i think the final cut was basically done like around the end of october

816
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:34,680
i was like okay this is complete but then i did make a couple corrections because there was like

817
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,880
there were some mistakes in the render that i had to go back in correct and then i ended up

818
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:46,520
adding a little bit of extra stuff to like bring it over eight hours so yeah around the end of

819
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:55,640
october so about almost almost three weeks because it's the 20th today yeah fuck

820
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:08,840
fuck eight hours is too long eight i mean it just for rendering just just a just a render

821
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,480
now my computer if my computer were better it would probably go faster

822
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:19,000
rendering the eight hour video in 1440p resolution which is what i filmed it in

823
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:27,640
takes about like five or six days just just to render it uploading it only takes about like

824
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:35,720
10 hours and then okay okay this is weird i uploaded the video and it took it spent a whole week

825
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:40,600
processing like you know you upload a video and then it says like okay it's got a process

826
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,160
in standard definition and then it has to process in high definition and then once it's done then

827
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:54,280
you can watch it in high resolution right yes right uh it spent an entire week processing in

828
01:07:54,280 --> 01:08:00,520
high definition and i thought it was just stuck and then finished and then i was like oh cool and

829
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:07,000
i watched the video and it would not actually play in high definition like it said it was done but it

830
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,880
didn't play it and i was like what the fuck so i had to upload it again and i and i just uploaded

831
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:18,280
like i just uploaded the same final cut like several times it was like maybe if i just upload

832
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:25,320
three different ones maybe one of them will work and i was right the the second the second one out of

833
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:32,520
three it finished its standard definition render and then it started high definition rendering

834
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:37,560
and it finished high definition rendering within like a day or two and then i played it and yet

835
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:45,240
it played in 1440p as it should and that's the one that is going live in 54 minutes from now

836
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:51,320
the other ones just didn't do that the other ones just rendered the process for a week and then

837
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:56,200
when they were done the high res video wasn't there and you couldn't watch it and i don't know why

838
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:04,280
hmm i it's not it's not on my end i didn't do anything different with any of those videos just

839
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:09,720
some of them succeeded and some of them failed just like sperm it's just like when you nut into a

840
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:14,920
vagina you know some of the sperm they're gonna make it and it's just random chance it's just

841
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,560
random chance which one fertilizes the zygote you know and that's me that's me just coming onto

842
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:25,800
youtube just coming and coming into youtube until i fertilize one precious upload seed zygote

843
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:30,680
do you think your the sperm that made you was a standard definition or high definition

844
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:40,200
it was it was it was four by three uh 240p uploaded in like 2006 uh looks like shit

845
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:53,800
and it's one of those legacy baby no i would you know i would the one i would have liked

846
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:59,960
to record in 4k uh i recorded in the highest resolution that my camera would do which was

847
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:09,320
1440p or as colloquially known as 2k uh my camera could not do 4k i would have recorded it in 4k

848
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:21,400
if i can why 2k you ask why 2k because 4k was crossing the road that that that that that um

849
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:31,160
um yeah yeah um what was what was i talking about oh yeah so took took took took yeah took several

850
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:39,480
weeks even after finishing the video to actually get it rendered and uploaded because because it's

851
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:44,440
just fucking big files are just uh it's just a hassle they're just a hassle to deal with

852
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:53,800
hmm well what if what yeah what if it goes live and then i'm like oh no it won't it's still not

853
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,680
it's not playing in iris oh no the hd no the 1440p

854
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:06,680
yeah i wonder i guess it's up to the user to click on the little thing if it's not or automatically

855
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:13,080
hd sometimes it's happened to me where like a video starts playing in for it for no reason

856
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:21,240
where it could easily play 720 60 fps well um i mean my youtube generally defaults to auto which

857
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,920
is then like it plays the highest resolution that it can play without buffering yeah so yeah because

858
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:32,840
my connection is spotty sometimes it defaults to a lower resolution but sometimes usually plays in

859
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,480
the highest resolution or it usually plays in 1080 if if possible sometimes it just doesn't update

860
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:43,400
though even if it's on auto and my connection's good so i have to manually yeah i mean i mean i'll

861
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:49,960
be honest like i'm sure that like most people to most viewers it does not matter that much

862
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:56,200
whether the video is in 360p most people are not actually going to be watching the video no and that's

863
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:03,400
and that's okay just for my own peace of mind like i would like it so that if you if you do decide to

864
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:08,600
look at the video you'll see an image that is at least crisp enough that you can make out like what

865
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:14,760
is on the the little pictures on the board behind me you know i still want it to be crunchy well i

866
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:25,480
hope you enjoy it over the next six weeks because it's a long video six week oh yeah um i hope it

867
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:32,760
does well i hope it does i hope it does well the last thing uh that i had on my list of things that

868
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:39,800
i wanted to talk about uh is one piece i caught up on one oh you did that's that's right um did you

869
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:44,360
read i think didn't a new chapter come out like just yesterday don't they come out on like sunday

870
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:53,000
oh did they did one i didn't read one yesterday now i'm behind you i think you are i think i might be

871
01:12:53,720 --> 01:13:00,360
yeah it was 60 or 67 went out one we're definitely on this yeah the one uh spoiler for one piece

872
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,280
everyone leave everyone run away um we should have a jingle no no we we should have a we should

873
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:11,880
have a eliezer eliezer create a one create a one piece jingle yes create content create

874
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:23,400
content for it

875
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:32,200
thanks eliezer uh i i'm two chapters behind actually um no cringe sorry i just don't keep

876
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:38,440
up with it every week i just be like oh one piece yes and i go and read whatever there is um it's

877
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:45,080
usually only one or two chapters um but we can talk about wano in its entirety because that's over

878
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:52,920
now yeah i guess wano's over how did you like that you know i was ready for it to be over by the end

879
01:13:54,120 --> 01:14:03,000
yeah also um maybe i was like stupid i kind of like missed the part where kaito died

880
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,760
or lost i kind of like felt like i wasn't paying attention and i sort of like missed it

881
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:16,600
and then i didn't go back and like wait when when when did he win when did luffy win exactly uh

882
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:21,880
oh well i'm sure it happened at some point well never mind well big mom got smashed really far

883
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:29,160
into the ground and then like yeah too later luffy had his big like i don't exactly remember

884
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:37,240
it was like his whole body went giant because he's got joyboy uh pizzazz right now he's poppy

885
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:44,840
he's popping his his whole body his whole body went giant yeah for a bit i forget exactly am i stupid

886
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:50,840
i don't remember him maybe you skipped a whole chapter maybe i did oh my god you missed the

887
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:57,480
chapter where kaito was defeated i remember him and i remember kaito and mom being like smashed

888
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,920
into the ground right like they both got ended up like being like tunneled underground

889
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:10,600
basically right they got hit real hard and they went way down yes so yeah okay i mean i i understand

890
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:16,440
that so like we didn't we didn't see the body so they're definitely not dead right like that's the

891
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:23,080
takeaway i yeah i mean i i would i would assume so just because okay big mom has such a connection

892
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:28,200
to elbaf which is an island that they have been hinting at for so long i feel like that she's

893
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:33,240
gonna come back for that that's not to jump ahead not to get ahead of myself but like that's the

894
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:39,800
the thing that i'm the most hype for about uh egghead now is like fucking they're talking

895
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:47,240
about elba we the the giants we the giants took the books from from uh no you're spoiling your

896
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:53,480
spoiling yeah that's that's really that's uh not in no it's not i i've said i have two chapters

897
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:59,480
behind i'm i'm just reading that was too much that was not too i'm so i'm sorry that was a spoiler

898
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:04,360
but i thought that was more than two chapters ago no no i mean maybe he's talking about it in

899
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:08,280
this one i'm scrolling through i want to read it properly but yeah they're talking about i mean

900
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,600
it's just it's just it's just a passing mention but uh yeah i mean he mentions the uh he mentions

901
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:18,600
the giants of elbaf are connected and i'm like oh man fuck yeah i love the giants of elbaf

902
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:24,680
the giants of elbaf there's so many things usopp and all of his like um his friendships with the

01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:45,320
between a certain kingdom and 20 kingdoms the winners were the 20 kingdoms they founded the

926
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:50,520
world government the world knows today to make sure that nobody carries that kingdom's ideology

927
01:18:50,520 --> 01:19:00,680
the arrays is existence from history probably i'm guessing with the sky like like i'm i'm i don't

928
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:08,920
know what it is but you know the thing that im did to like sabo you know that the the king of the

929
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:15,720
world or whatever imsama the king oh wait the guy on the throne the guy on the throne the guy that

930
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:22,040
nobody knows exists except for uh the top government officials and shanks i guess maybe he doesn't

931
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:26,520
but i know who you're talking about i i mean i remember that you only see him very briefly

932
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:35,320
just his eye right um i don't know sabo saw him but like um oh i think we i think you see him again

933
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:45,720
but like uh sabo like obviously escaped marishwa with too much info and im ordered like destruction

934
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:51,240
of whatever island he was on they found him and then that island was completely obliterated i don't

935
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:59,800
know if sabo's dead he's probably not dead okay yes yes that's like a power that has and then i

936
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:05,480
really loved in that chapter where they had like the the you know the lower people in the

937
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:11,720
organization of the marines or headquarters or stuff they're like um they've been told to not

938
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:17,080
pay attention to anything that's happening radio silence please you're being ordered to

939
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:23,480
not pay attention to what is happening right now um go away and then they blew up the island

940
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:31,080
yes okay okay okay so i'm like ah cool so that's probably what was done to this kingdom

941
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:37,480
and the kingdom was uh i don't know socialist or something

942
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:44,360
what they were doing they were doing communism they were doing communism and it's like let's blow

943
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:50,200
them up all right they're not they're not buying our exports are you still are you still are you

944
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:56,120
still reading yeah yeah i'm reading the rest understood understood if ohara was erased because

945
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:00,200
of this theory that means the government had acknowledged that this theory is the truth

946
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,080
why is vagabond talking to these pirates about this that's the thing i'm not sure about yet

947
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:11,080
yeah that's a reasonable question and i'm similar to you too even if i work with the

948
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:15,880
government if i talk about it i'll be obliterated how do you know about that kingdom every book

949
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:20,600
that ohara had had gathered around the world had been destroyed the will of ohara still lives

950
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:27,640
oh pog pog pog no this this is this is hype this is hype that day the world was in an uproar

951
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:33,080
scholar island ohara that was famous worldwide for its knowledge got destroyed in one light with a

952
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:38,360
lone girl as its survivor the world government labeled them as this evil scholar group they

953
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:43,960
were plotting to take over the world about months later after that incident i went to ohara which

954
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:50,360
had become a burning field i met with an old acquaintance what he's survived the scholar leader

967
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:14,840
bus to call the scholars were trying to stop it they died protecting the remaining fortunes for

968

988
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:44,120
just working out of the library so dragon was also clueless acquaintance

989
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:50,920
they came from elba they knew the value of those books this is dragon talking their captain is a

990
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:56,040
strange guy with bandages covering his body he said i won't let the assets that ohara left

991
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:00,840
become a race from history you guys from the world government don't didn't realize its value

992
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,200
so i'm glad they didn't destroy it

993
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:09,160
wait i'm not a world government ah fuck you i'm tired of hearing it you even became the

994
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:15,480
government's lap dog idiot even though we the the liberation has invited you has invited you and

995
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:21,560
you rejected it don't be ridiculous even with my wisdom and technology what can your poor army make

996
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:28,200
he's he's a real science boy he's getting all that the going where the money is

997
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:34,360
look how smart he is look how smart he is i mean i yeah is this really the reveal of vikapunk

998
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:41,160
he's got a huge tongue this right like right by his balls and it's just out his balls i mean i

999
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:46,680
guess i guess that's true why is this tongue out i just realized that it's just talking right there

1000
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:53,320
i think he is based on that famous picture of einstein sticking his tongue oh my god i think

1001
01:26:53,400 --> 01:27:01,480
that's the idea oh this is so funny um world government is a massive organization especially

1002
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:07,480
the navy lots of people can understand me i will make an army that can fight it oh this is this is

1003
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:13,640
before the revolutionary army i think so because dragon didn't have his tattoos and stuff and it's

1004
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:18,920
also before luffy is born because robin's older than him yeah that's true

1005
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:29,000
i will change the world vega punk i won't let clover's death and the will of o hargo and vane

1006
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:36,440
that year dragon along with emperor of emporio evankov and bartholomew kuma established a revolutionary

1007
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:45,320
army what can what can three weirdos do i mean three weirdos that's us minus one ben

1008
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:54,520
yeah hey yeah and look what we've done we are pretty much like a revolutionary army yeah

1009
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:01,320
luffy's father's very passionate they went to elbaf there's oh they're all they're all

1010
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:06,200
parking at all this info yeah as was i i'm i'm right there with them

1011
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:15,720
the books of ohara didn't fall into the government's hands because i was very interested in them i

1012
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:21,560
secretly went to elbaf they let me read all of the documents in other words oh the guy in bandages

1013
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:28,840
is sol because he's because he was burned horribly it'll frozen yeah i forget yes yeah

1014
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:35,320
in other words i read all about ohara and secrets of the world it's all inside my head

1015
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:42,360
for progressing my research right sol isn't hiding no one will disclose his whereabouts

1016
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:48,680
oh robin's so happy dude sol dude are you sol's are you joking like are you kidding me sol is

1017
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:57,640
alive what the fuck what the fuck i forget what happened um i know that he was out kiji al kiji

1018
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:04,520
frozen frozen yeah he died he we thought he died smiling right like the d because everyone says you

1019
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:09,160
know like the thing about having the d is that everyone with the d in their name dies smiling

1020
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:14,920
and sol was frozen with the smile he was laughing she she she she but he's alive do you know what

1021
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:19,560
why they they say they smile die smiling because they have the d i'm gonna post in chat

1022
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:26,040
right this is why you're gonna post is because they got this colon d it's colon capital d that's

1023
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:35,000
why they always die smiling because of that yeah i feel like that's canon oda would probably agree

1024
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:41,160
i no odin's odas japanese he doesn't know what the letter d looks like

1025
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:48,920
that he writes it he knows the letter no he doesn't the wanted poster was in drawing english

1026
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:55,400
letters he writes it in he writes it in hiragana and then the translators translate the d i'll

1027
01:29:55,400 --> 01:30:05,880
translate your d i i i promise you won't you fucking wouldn't dare so robin's crying sol

1028
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:12,840
is alive sol is okay is in hiding okay sol's alive okay what the fuck second of all the giants of

1029
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:21,240
elba saved the books of ohara okay sure fine all right yeah let's just throw that out i wonder why

1030
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:26,200
sol was near ohara in the first place maybe it wasn't an accident that he appeared there

1031
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:34,600
well like you think he's from elba f and like it's near elba i mean like him going like knowing

1032
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:40,840
about the the importance of ohara and and being there well didn't he get sent there by the marines

1033
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:48,280
yeah so i guess i thought he just went because it was like official business is like and like the

1034
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:53,800
government like had their eye on ohara i forget exactly but i think he's sort of crashed well

1035
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:58,440
something with and he landed on the beach and he was like oh what's going on and then nika robin was

1036
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:04,200
there and he's like oh i gotta build a ship to get out of here like and and robin would hang out with

1037
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:10,760
him that would be their thing but uh who knows who knows what his true intentions were i'm just

1038
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:18,600
if he was like secretly a part of a pirate crew or like a giant sailing crew the new and cared

1039
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:24,040
about the these books maybe he got tipped off that they were the the marines were about to

1040
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:29,640
invade and he went over there to to facilitate i mean i think that's i think that's definitely

1041
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:38,360
some what was happening because like you know he was he was like right uh that was he he wasn't

1042
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:43,800
gonna let uh yeah i mean he saved robin from i mean i guess he might have just been doing it

1043
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:49,080
because he didn't want robin to die but i also thought like he probably also was like no i can't

1044
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:56,600
let the will of ohara die either yeah alkiji probably definitely as well because i know alkiji

1045
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:01,560
could have killed robin yeah alkiji could have killed him so alkiji definitely was like well

1046
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:07,320
i'll just okay so alkiji froze him this this and then like got him um somebody got him just like

1047
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:14,520
when he got luffy that all you need is a really hot shower yeah right you know what you know what

1048
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:19,320
it makes sense you know what knowing what we know about okiji it actually makes perfect at least

1049
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:26,200
don't let ohara's battle go in vain i'm an ally for every scholar ah my shoes are moving by my

1050
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,920
oh shit so what are they doing so fucking cool i still can't release you follow me oh it was

1051
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:34,680
that they got the magnet boots they got the magnet boots from wretched and clank

1052
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:43,160
right and we're in the ancient ruin part with the other guys

1053
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:50,600
oh it's vega punks in there wait which which vega punk uh it's like half coming out of the

1054
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:57,960
the ancient robot is wait please help me damn it it still failed someone please help me while

1055
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:04,040
i was warping the space got distorted it's like huh your dragon sun right i knew you would come

1056
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:12,120
here welcome also bonnie you grew up gramps are you floating wait vega punk i think wait what was

1057
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:20,200
bonnie's relationship it was to kuma right yeah she's kuma's we recently learned she's kuma's daughter

1058
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,200
we don't know how old she actually is because she's got the age fruit

1059
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:32,760
oh that's true she could just be preferring this age i mean i mean kuma is middle aged so she's

1060
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:38,280
probably 20 accurate but there's still the potential there's oh there's theories you could say like

1061
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:47,240
what if she's a hundred um i mean kuma's a robot so he could be really old i guess

1062
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,400
it could be that old because the pacifistas aren't that old no

1063
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,600
he's showing them boot stuff

1064
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:06,840
okay so luffy and dr vega punk who i assume is the real one because of the the flashback we just

1065
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:11,880
had because he looks like him and that's the end of the chapter and then there's another chapter

1066
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:18,520
that i haven't read but i assume there's not like another world destroying a world shattering

1067
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:27,160
revelation in that one right um the most recent ones it's not it's not okay let's keep going let's

1068
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:31,560
go keep on with the give reads one piece on a podcast where you can't see any of the visuals

1069
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:38,840
but it's fine that's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine what happened to your head this is vega

1070
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:44,040
punk's i just could just cut out the dead end really is our what happened to your head wasn't

1071
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:49,480
it larger like a light bulb oh yes his head became large like a light bulb and now it's cut small

1072
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:57,480
and it's got an apple on it like isaac yutin he is you know like as one does you know he cut his head off

1073
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:06,680
just got it uh i i do like that vega punk is the most fucked up character i've seen in a while

1074
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,640
he yeah he's really fucked

1075
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,280
my body size grew large just like the giants the truth is i am a brainiac man who ate the

1076
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:23,480
nominomi fruit with it i can remember every tiny detail of knowledge the brain is getting bigger

1077
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:27,720
and bigger with the data capacity after all i was born as a genius with unlimited data

1078
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:32,600
branch in my brain it has grown into the world's largest brain and continues to grow

1079
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,600
was he he says he was born as a genius with unlimited data capacity so what does he need

1080
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:46,520
the fucking fruit i don't know that's i don't get it i don't get it he actually got a fruit uh it

1081
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:50,760
sounds like he definitely ate the fruit he's definitely saying he ate a fruit that means

1082
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:55,480
that his brain gets bigger and bigger as he learns more stuff i don't understand what

1083
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:00,040
him being born a genius has to do with it maybe he means like born again a genius after he ate the

1084
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:09,560
fruit i mean you know i either way the takeaway is he's a brain brain man who knows everything

1085
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:16,600
yeah or remembers everything you know the more and his brain is giant i i think this is one of

1086
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:21,720
those things his brain is so giant he had to cut it out and put it somewhere for yeah that part

1087
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:28,520
i mean if you're a that that that i can buy as like a devil fruit power being able to absolutely

1088
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:35,720
maybe i don't know honestly cool fruit honestly cool fruit i like it it's one of those things

1089
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:44,200
though like you you hear about these amazing characters and i don't know it's sort of weird

1090
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:51,240
that there's no one that seems to be just exceptional in their field without a fruit

1091
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:56,040
except for like swordsmen like zoro and mehawk that seems to be like one of some of the only

1092
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:01,320
guys about dragon no wait does dragon i think he does i think he has a wind fruit or like a storm

1093
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:08,440
fruit isn't that just speculation it may be speculation actually but i can't remember like

1094
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:14,120
it wasn't it like at loathtown like smoker was gonna yeah like a light lightning struck when

1095
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:19,720
when luffy was about to be executed and it seemed like dragon before that there was like a very strong

1096
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:25,320
implication that smoker could tell dragon was around and then we maybe even see dragon we just

1097
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:36,120
don't know whether dragon is doing the storm okay yeah you know i i mean yeah the one exception

1098
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:44,440
is like gold gold roger which is uh yeah who uh kaito says like you know a strong fruit isn't enough

1099
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,960
roger didn't even have a fruit but he conquered the that i'm glad that is but other than him he

1100
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:57,720
seems to be he seems to be the exception though zoro doesn't need a fruit zoro's gonna be the

1101
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:05,320
strongest non-fruit user by the end swords yeah swordsmen well i mean i guess sanji doesn't have

1102
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:11,960
it kind of doesn't really have all all all the straw hat all the straw hats don't have a fruit

1103
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:18,360
except for some of them it's just sort of like frankie doesn't have a fruit but he's also like a

1104
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:24,680
genius uh and stuff he's a robe i mean he's a robot he made himself like he's so smart and good with

1105
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:31,320
engineering and robotics that he was able to do that and and all of vagabonds blueprints allowed him

1106
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:36,440
to make himself more cyborgian with a timeskip and it's like okay frankie's really smart so

1107
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:42,200
vagapunk must be even smarter which is true but it's because partially because he has a fruit

1108
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:48,280
that helps him and sort of makes frankie like more exceptional if he's able to like ever match him

1109
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:57,000
which i guess is a good thing it sounds to me i mean it sounds to me like vagapunk is a genius

1110
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,640
anyway but like the nomi nomi just lets him remember everything it gives him gives him like

1111
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:08,200
perfect memory like vagapunk probably would still be some sort of genius yeah i even without the

1112
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:12,280
fruit that's what i'm that's what i think i'm definitely like i know that there's like a sense

1113
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:22,680
that it completely removes uh like a character's like like uh accomplishments if they got a fruit

1114
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:29,640
but it's obvious that you need to work hard as well it doesn't mean you just mean like obviously

1115
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:33,480
luffy has a rubber fruit he wouldn't have got very far if he didn't try hard though

1116
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:38,760
like he's still well he doesn't actually have a rubber fruit oh you know what i mean like uh

1117
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:49,000
yeah yeah sure sure yeah as kaito said a strong fruit is not enough especially since because of

1118
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,200
the kata curry fight is like mochi is better than rubber even though it's not rubber now so it's a

1119
01:39:54,200 --> 01:40:01,400
little uh it's not that sort of changes retroactively yeah a little yeah a little bit but i did like

1120
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:05,880
that fight at the time showing that like wait a minute if it's not rubber then why could he punch

1121
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:13,960
enol um because it is rubber but it's also something else but it's also freedom yeah freedom is freedom

1122
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:17,560
from freedom from electricity freedom is when you have an elastic band and no matter how you

1123
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:24,760
change it it goes back to how it was freedom is when you don't conduct an electric current

1124
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:32,120
in my opinion so there it's a little bit of a last pull with the whole joyboy thing it's a

1125
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:38,760
little it's a little bit i don't mind it just because visually it means that when luffy's going

1126
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:44,760
at his strongest he's not more serious he's more silly and he goes full poppy like cartoon

1127
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:50,760
tom and jerry sort of fighting which is like the perfect like ultimate form that he could have

1128
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:57,880
yeah yeah i've i've decided i don't really doesn't it doesn't really bother me doesn't really take

1129
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:03,240
that much away from his care i mean he already had like yeah he had kind of a stupid fruit

1130
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:07,640
that he was doing cool stuff with but oh it turns out no he's actually got a really good fruit it's

1131
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:14,840
like yeah whatever yeah oh well yeah uh are you are you done with that sorry no i was just talking

1132
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:20,840
and i was okay over the page so old man you cut your head this is i mean you became an idiot says

1133
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:30,200
luffy yeah that's just what i would assume all true true oh there's a hanger for his brain in

1134
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:36,120
punk records is that how big it is i mean i guess egghead is like i think yeah i think

1135
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:43,400
that's what punk record is is just a giant contains a brain so his brain makes it grow

1136
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:50,280
whenever he learns something you that's fucking vile you know if he lives too long his brain will

1137
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:57,720
take over the entire world it's just gonna it's just gonna keep growing no it's okay i assume it

1138
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:05,080
grows linearly so eventually you know this the well how much knowledge could there be in the

1139
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:10,440
universe is probably big enough to make a mass larger than the earth what i'm saying what i'm

1140
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:17,160
saying is it grows it grows linearly but it you know volume is calculated uh quadratically so

1141
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:23,320
they're like it's not the the the the increase in volume will eventually become you know relatively

1142
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:30,680
insignificant in comparison to the the current the current volume okay sweet so i mean it's fine

1143
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:37,800
so he's he's got the six robot vega punk not surrogates but like versions of himself that

1144
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:45,400
like Naruto style you know what it's you know it's it's great that he made one of them just evil

1145
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:51,080
it's great that he was like let me just find like six versions of myself that like embody my traits

1146
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:55,320
and like definitely got to have one that's evil which one's the evil one like that's really the

1147
01:42:55,320 --> 01:43:03,160
girl the girl there's two of them yeah her the pretty one they're both i mean do you mean the one

1148
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:08,680
with the the first the first one they met the first the first one they met is she evil i thought she

1149
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:15,560
was just sort of like like security no it fighting no it listed it i swear it listed like what traits

1150
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:22,120
they embody and like the one that's just daft punk is logic and i forget the other ones but yeah

1151
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:28,680
that one is like evil is sort of trait i'm i'm and it's like good good job thanks for making one

1152
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:33,080
that's evil that feels like it's gotta be a translation thing maybe it could mean something

1153
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:38,600
else i think so i mean i don't know the version that's what my translation said the translation

1154
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:44,440
i'm reading did not translate the little icon so i don't i don't know how to read the i'm not japanese

1155
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:51,480
i'm not smart well let me let me let me look it up on the wiki but anyway um the one thing i wanted

1156
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:58,600
to say is that yeah i was i was so caught off guard by the one girl who eats food for everyone

1157
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:06,760
and takes shits and that's her job that's that's yeah that's good for her good for her i mean yeah

1158
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:17,560
hell yeah but like it's such a it's such a weird like i don't know it feels like fetish stuff it

1159
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:23,080
feels like like a weird sex thing a little bit but it's also like a silly cartoon thing so it's

1160
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:28,440
not and it's probably my brain that's fucked up it's it's it's it feels a little like that because

1161
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:35,000
like she's wearing like a thong and like while she does it and she's a sexy lady yeah and she gets

1162
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:40,920
all big and she gets all small i guess jewelry bunny all already does that so whatever okay i'm

1163
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:49,800
looking at the wiki according to the wiki um okay yeah this is not all right i thought shaka was

1164
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:57,800
logic but this the wiki says that shaka is good shaka is good and lileth is evil edison is thinking

1165
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:06,920
pythagoras is wisdom atlas is violence and york is greed greed so okay so they're an expert in

1166
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:12,440
their certain field the greed field yeah and york york is the one who eats and shits and sleeps

1167
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:19,160
well if it's logic maybe the other one is chaos instead of evil the wiki says wiki says they're

1168
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:26,520
good and evil huh like an expert in being evil or i don't know whatever they just they just embody

1169
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:37,560
the trait of evilness so every person in his in his six person vega punk thing can add their memories

1170
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:43,720
to the punk records if every person has access to my brain it's as if all mankind has acquired my

1171
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:49,240
knowledge also if mankind reciprocally can update the punk records isn't it is possible to create

1172
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:56,360
and see knowledge for far beyond my brain this brain will someday he's talking about and turning

1173
01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:01,320
the world into a hive mind everyone would be this they'd know everything hell yeah

1174
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:09,160
so much knowledge it's like cell phones we've all got access to the internet yeah we don't read it

1175
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:17,480
have you read every wikipedia article i'm working on it i'm getting through it i'm getting there

1176
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:21,720
going alphabetically give me give me give me a little give me a little bit

1177
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:26,280
means every researcher in the world can learn from it our chopper likes that learn about medicine

1178
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:33,320
jim jim is like are you gonna police my thoughts are you gonna be the woke police

1179
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:42,440
are you gonna tell me off you're not gonna you're not gonna you're not gonna cancel my hot takes

1180
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:49,400
of you and see into my my my my non politically correct thoughts are you vega punk you fucking

1181
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:54,840
democrat oh he's just like dr fouchy he's gonna cancel me for not wearing a mask

1182
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:02,520
uh so obviously bonnie is pissed because vega punk made her dad into a robot yeah

1183
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:09,480
i really want to know what's going on with that bonnie please think again if you kill him you'll

1184
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,280
end up making more enemies than you can imagine just turn off the switch

1185
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:18,520
that beam function is to attract a large number of insects so it's not a

1186
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:29,080
lightsaber oh you fools you got all the hisk to hisk poor bonnie you know there's one thing

1187
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:34,600
that i have enjoyed more and more because this happened more and more is a female one piece

1188
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:40,600
characters getting fucked up because there's a lot of there's a few characters over the

1189
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:47,080
course of the series that have just been like too pretty to be really beaten and more and more often

1190
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:52,440
nami and and sometimes robin they get a little fucked up and bonnie is also getting fucked up

1191
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:58,200
and it's sort of it's it's nice it lets them play on the same comedy playing you heard of here folks

1192
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:04,840
gib is pro violence against women it's true because it's it allows them to be parts of funny

1193
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:10,120
jokes whereas otherwise it would be just the guys being like beaten up see gib this is why

1194
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:18,840
you're one of the good ones and i'll tolerate you um excellent now i hear you though now i hear

1195
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:26,040
you now they should be subject to punishment comedy pretfalls are not just a boys club thing

1196
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,040
girls need to girls need to fall and get anvils dropped on them

1197
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:41,960
gaslight gatekeep and uh girl injuries that was terrible i know i know

1198
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:50,520
her reason to kill me makes sense i'm saved because the weapon she picked is a fail product

1199
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:55,560
by the way you guys recently went to warn her right it was a rumor is it true that there's

1200
01:48:55,560 --> 01:49:02,120
another dragon besides kaito ah momo yes it's devil fruit i left in punk hazard it seems to

1201
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:06,680
ate it it's a fail product it's an artificial devil fruit that i created it was created with a

1202
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:12,760
large number of research funds over 20 years from kaito's lineage factor but his growth won't be the

1203
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:18,600
same as the original fruit ah that's why he can be turned into a dragon like kaito why was that mean

1204
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:25,320
his growth won't be the same but he can be turned into a dragon but it was a success he spit fire

1205
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:32,520
and he was powerful what's the color it's pink oh it's a great failure oh that's why well

1206
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:41,160
no it turned into a perfect dragon replica of the real the dragon fruit but pink pink garbage

1207
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:52,120
god damn it a genius and a perfectionist i love this guy yeah i'm i'm vibing with egghead arc

1208
01:49:52,760 --> 01:50:00,040
yeah that's legend it's the giant robot here the legendary metal giant that attacked marishwa 200

1209
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:07,720
years ago you know i keep getting i keep losing track of like certain amounts of years ago this

1210
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:12,360
happened two years ago was the timeskip 20 years ago was when most of the characters in the straw

1211
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:18,680
hat crew were born uh so many years and years and what are they talking about like and then the void

1212
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:23,480
century is like a certain is it 200 years ago void century is 800 void century is 800 years ago

1213
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:27,960
okay there's so many like numbers of years ago that certain things happened i need a

1214
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:33,480
timeline i need like a map i can look at maybe it's maybe it's just because the ohara like void

1215
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:37,720
century stuff was some of like the most interesting lore to me but i remember that like void century

1216
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,480
was 800 years ago so when they say something happened like 800 or 900 years ago i'm like

1217
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:45,880
that's got that's something to do with the void century ah but this machine was probably created

1218
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:55,000
far more than 900 years ago i still don't know creation i heard that there was no damage due

1219
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,880
to a lack of energy the researchers the time was surprised with unknown science it has

1220
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:04,520
no one knows where it came from what it was trying to do is the eye and giant is came from space

1221
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:09,880
the world government ordered its complete destruction but because of their curiosity

1222
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:15,000
the researchers didn't do that it exists here because the information of it has been passed down

1223
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,800
from generation to generation the government didn't know about its existence

1224
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:24,680
huh oh the researchers just hid it and then all i'd just been passed down

1225
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:32,600
200 years ago that is the exact year when discrimination against fishermen started

1226
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:40,840
what that's what they say there was never any before that yeah even when they're that ugly

1227
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:47,960
i guess give me a break maybe it's uh they discovered them 200 years ago and they thought

1228
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:54,200
oh cool more slaves oh yeah yeah it could be because they'd be like under yeah fishermen

1229
01:51:54,200 --> 01:52:00,760
i don't yeah that makes that would actually make sense god there's so many things i'm trying to

1230
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:07,320
read like quickly but i don't want to like miss understand something yeah fair i mean no no rush

1231
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:12,600
i'm i'm taking this time to prepare a tweet about like oh five minutes till the video goes

1232
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:16,600
live oh shit you know i don't i don't actually need to be there for like the whole that's what i

1233
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:21,000
just want to be like there like when it starts yeah yeah uh but i don't have to like pay attention

1234
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:31,400
to the whole thing so wait those the two groups are both looking at this robot frankie and and

1235
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:39,320
robin and sangy and all that they're with number one and they're watching vega punk talk to luffy

1236
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:45,320
in front of the robot we created vega for us like based on everything we learned from it

1237
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:49,640
there are things i can't replicate with my science i can't believe it was a machine

1238
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:56,520
machine soldier made 900 years ago machine that even you can't replicate the problem is power in

1239
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:00,600
the past there was a power that was enough to change the common sense of the world today

1240
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:09,480
it was called coal we used to burn coal we need to go get some coal from the mines

1241
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:15,640
why do we why do we ever stop burning coal anyway yeah i mean yeah sure the the oceans

1242
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:18,360
rose and now we live on like an ocean planet but like it's fine

1243
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:26,440
it's just like wind waker with the industrial revolution it's just like the real world in

1244
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:32,360
like 50 years for now i'm happy luffy and the others are safe but who's that girl

1245
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:40,840
jewelry bunny yeah they should know her can you do something for me can you take me out of egghead

1246
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:46,920
what luffy wants vega punk wants luffy to take him out of egghead

1247
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:53,880
because he's uh wait he does did i miss something yes straw had luffy it is fated that you have come

1248
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:57,960
here can you do something for me can you take me out of egghead i guess because he is world

1249
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:04,920
government aligned he's monitored so he needs somebody to uh kidnap him if he wants to leave

1250
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:17,320
maybe this is cypher paul we wish to harbor here he is cypher paul fucking luchy they're back baby

1251
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:26,600
it's like they never left who kaku we're gonna get more kaku kaku uh i want to rematch i want to

1252
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:33,720
rematch with everyone but all the other guys are gone i like the chapapa guy whatever happened to him

1253
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:44,280
did he's we did is he dead remember chapapa chapapa wait who's that it's the big uh spherical guy

1254
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:54,440
with a zip mouth the big from cp9 and he's lobby uh is he the door door fruit guy no no that's

1255
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:59,560
balloono balloono chap up i can't remember his name but chapapa is the thing he says all the time

1256
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:05,160
oh yeah i i think i remember you think i remember there's someone like that

1257
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:12,920
i got uh information that jewelry bunny is heading to egghead she's an eyesore who repeatedly escaped

1258
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,280
but we no longer have any use for her right next time we meet i'll definitely kill her

1259
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:22,760
what used to check before it's the government ship it'd be bad if they knew we harbored pirates

1260
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:28,840
in here also the cp0 and luchy just let them enter rob luchy is an assassin right

1261
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:37,160
oh is that she's like this is the vega punk 2 she's evil so she wishes like

1262
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:42,040
for everyone to be killed so she's like oh happy that an assassin is going to come

1263
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:45,000
and kill all the straw hats oh let him in

1264
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:58,040
wait who's letting them in why what where where am i uh vega punk 2 the hot lady

1265
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:05,800
evil evil evil evil lady i mean she is also hot lily yes she is she is hot she is hot

1266
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:11,960
um said let them enter rob luchy is an assassin she looks really happy about an assassin i think

1267
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:18,120
i think that when you make an avatar of yourself that embodies your evil you should not let it call

1268
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:25,160
you should not listen when it says to let someone in but then the other version number one it says

1269
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:30,840
prepare to intercept and decline their request to the harbor so it's like both of yes and no

1270
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:38,040
in my opinion the good one is probably the one to listen to it's if i had to if i had to pick

1271
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:43,960
yeah i don't know i don't know who who's right you know who's who could say who could say who's

1272
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:50,520
right in this situation oh my god i like that namie i mean this in this translation namie's

1273
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:57,480
like oh no i hate rob luchy isn't he retired uh god not that guy again it's not even like

1274
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:02,200
terrified it's just sort of like fuck not that not him you nearly killed all of us

1275
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:09,160
oh it's it's coming back a kingdom oh they've got kuma they've got kuma and they're trying to like

1276
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:19,480
un roboticize him but he's been he's been like compelled to move because of something kuma no

1277
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:29,720
is it love is it love for his daughter oh is it love for his sexy ass

1278
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:39,400
i mean not wrong i'm not wrong though no you're not i was i was a thinking of it as like

1279
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:46,200
like a beacon like blipped an egghead is like oh you must come back you are programmed to come

1280
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:50,840
back and then maybe that's what you're supposed to think is happening but no it's actually because

1281
01:57:50,840 --> 01:58:05,240
he wants to save his sexy ass daughter maybe the insect beacon was actually a dad come home

1282
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:13,240
yes yes and he's like part insect that makes sense that that that let's go with that

1283
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:19,640
you know i kuma still has his like devil fruit power in this form like he's not a pacifista

1284
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:25,080
he's not like a made from the ground up robot he is still him that has been turned mostly cyborg

1285
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:28,760
to the point where he doesn't really have a self but he still has his devil fruit power he can like

1286
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:34,280
use his poor fruit to like blast himself towards egghead couldn't he

1287
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:40,440
can he do that he should be able to do that he can launch other people i don't see why he can

1288
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:44,920
launch himself i feel like that's the the way he appeared on thriller bark when he was introduced

1289
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:49,000
like he's just sort of there suddenly makes because he's able to do that guy can just be

1290
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:54,760
lit just could be anywhere yeah yeah i don't i don't see why not if he can launch anyone anywhere

1291
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:59,960
with his like precision paw paw fruit that's a good ass fruit oh yeah i love that i'm sorry but

1292
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:06,360
that's a good ass fruit it's such an odd like i i'm assuming there's some sort of pun involved

1293
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:12,760
with like a bear paw and like whatever the effect is like pushing people but i i'd like that it's

1294
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:19,880
like it's a it's a shockwave but in the shape of like a paw with the like little beans included

1295
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:25,480
okay and that's the end of the chapter beans little beans well i feel i feel like we've discussed

1296
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:31,400
the chapter pretty thoroughly as you've been yeah going through it with the disc oh no the

1297
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:38,760
discord link is dead discord oh in in my video uh oh yeah this is cool i'm really liking this yeah

1298
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:45,640
this is cool i've i've sort of lost track of what the cover arc is about is caesar clown and judge

1299
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:54,920
me too um he's hooking up with caesar hooking up with um not cp9 um the germans g twins the germa

1300
01:59:54,920 --> 02:00:02,360
and and judge or have judge wherever you say it um they're facing off in the top of this

1301
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:08,200
chapter but yeah i gotta i want to go back and reread because i think it's like how they escaped

1302
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:15,000
from big mom using caesar clown's help and because caesar clown and judge are both like

1303
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:22,120
super scientists they're probably going to end up teaming up and now the judge is like aligned

1304
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:27,800
with sanji at least they're not like on bad terms anymore at least not in the same way

1305
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:33,640
they'd probably be like straw hat aligned so caesar is still going to be an ally despite his

1306
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:41,080
best efforts to the contrary which is funny caesar is such a like wannabe the bad guy but

1307
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:47,800
he turns out to be the friend the the unwitting ally of the straw hats every time after he got

1308
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:58,600
punched by luffy love that guy caesar do i like i guess i don't really i don't really have much

1309
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:04,680
of an opinion about caesar he's fine he's kind of funny he's like uh like a buggy light he's like

1310
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:12,280
buggy the clown light um because buggy the the role the buggy filled early on is was filled

1311
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:20,440
by caesar clown in like the poll cake island arc i think it's it's very funny that uh buggy is

1312
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:26,280
offering bounties on marines now yeah i that's interesting the whole thing with like what a

1313
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:34,280
power move yeah i love the whole thing with buggy's um like falling higher and higher up the chain

1314
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:39,560
yeah he's failing upward failing upwards this whole career the whole thing with like

1315
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:48,360
him at like the the war at marin ford and all of the people who believed buggy was the one who

1316
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:53,160
orchestrated the escape from impel down and they love him so he's got all these impel down breakouts

1317
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:59,240
and then a bunch of other people who saw him being so cool at at in marin ford and they just

1318
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:05,880
used that to to like bolster his crew to ridiculous heights and then the shibukai

1319
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:16,920
like position allowed him to be like un like un uh messed with by the marines so he's just sort of

1320
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:25,320
like he's able to grow in size and relevance he's just his face is just appearing in all the

1321
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:30,840
right places just get he's getting that reach he's getting that exposure i hope everyone and

1322
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:36,200
everyone just so everyone just associates his face with like big important deeds that were done

1323
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:43,080
but like he he's totally useless yep i really would like this is something i've always felt for a

1324
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:48,680
crocodile and me hawker just like ah just let him take the blame for whatever yeah he could he

1325
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:54,440
can be the boss like yeah whatever yeah they just like yeah he'd be the fall guy um and so take the

1326
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:59,240
heat but they're with him and see dad if we need to and those two are so strong and they're with

1327
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:04,200
him so he's like he's he's safe even though shibukai is like no longer it's been dissolved so like now

1328
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:13,880
he's a pirate and because of his relation to luffy and shanks i'm i'm definitely expecting

1329
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:19,880
somewhere later when a huge event is happening is the shanks and luffy fighting over the one

1330
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:25,240
piece and blackbeard's there and then buggy's also there and so he's like seen by all who

1331
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:28,680
can see what's happening is like one of the equals in this battle and he's like oh my

1332
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:35,560
fucking god i'm not i shouldn't be here i'm gonna die i'm going to die right now he's he's

1333
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:41,240
he's he's host oh yeah but but he's gonna survive and then people are gonna believe people are gonna

1334
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:45,960
believe that buggy is the king of the pirates i think that's gonna be the end i think everyone

1335
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:52,360
who's there actually knows but then buggy gets to like like a lot of the credit or like or something

1336
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:56,440
really funny like that i really hope that happens that's like the ultimate conclusion to that is

1337
02:03:56,440 --> 02:04:00,520
the buggy accidentally becomes the king of the pirates and the hearts and minds of the world

1338
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:06,280
everybody believes buggy did it and luffy doesn't care because he's just totally free he doesn't

1339
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:11,560
he doesn't want the title he just wants the total freedom that's true we can all we can all

1340
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:18,680
unite behind the banner of buggy yes right or left you know whatever whatever your personal

1341
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:25,160
ball we all we all love buggy so we can all come together i so fucking cool

1342
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:32,680
dude i'm loving egghead i'm really liking egghead so far yes it's super super good

1343
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:39,880
bag of punk is awesome going at a pretty fast clip one oh i think just because there was so much

1344
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:46,360
they needed to set up before they could start like collapsing things down into a fight um it just took

1345
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:51,240
such a long time for all these characters to get introduced and the the lore of the one oh people

1346
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:59,160
and it took a long time i did enjoy it but like there's not a much the only thing we know about

1347
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:02,360
vega punk is that he's a scientist and so you can just also do whatever you want

1348
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:11,000
you just have have big revelations immediately and then seeping zero is already here it's great

1349
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:19,240
yeah things are uh things are things are moving pretty fast i mean i guess we're i guess these

1350
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:25,400
has got to establish a lot of stuff before we get into you know whatever whatever conflict ends up

1351
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:32,280
defining uh this current arc so you know we're we're learning a lot i wonder if we're gonna

1352
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:39,400
spend a lot of time elba we're talking about elba and and and ohara yes yes i'm just so glad

1353
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:45,880
we're talking about them again yes i you know i'm trying to think of like what can be done

1354
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:52,440
in this area like they see all this cool stuff i don't feel like because they're not constant like

1355
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:57,640
they're not antagonistic towards the the vega punk people they're just sort of learning stuff

1356
02:05:57,640 --> 02:06:03,400
there's like a little library session they're learning some stuff and then cp zero is gonna

1357
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:08,600
be like they're fucking around but i feel like there's too many straw hats for cp zero to really

1358
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:16,600
do a lot of damage to them like this isn't like um a warlord or or or something it's just a small

1359
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:23,240
group of strong guys that they could have fights i feel like this is more gonna turn into like a

1360
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:27,160
we gotta escape and we got vega punk vega punk is gonna tell us to go to elba because we need to

1361
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:34,360
do something we're like oh shit let's go let's go and then they will go i don't know if how long

1362
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:42,520
an egg head's like arc would be because like what are they gonna do here i mean probably fight cipher

1363
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:49,320
pole uh probably fight the vega punk clones or some of them yeah i mean i feel like they've already

1364
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:54,600
done that they did the bit with jimbay clone and they're like wow what the fuck but they're the

1365
02:06:54,600 --> 02:07:03,480
the jimbay pacifista is uh hey what's up with oh um is kuma a uh lumarian

1366
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:10,120
bonnie says that like her dad always says that he was part of like a very special race

1367
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:16,920
did you did you catch that i did catch that i don't remember and also when you see when you i think

1368
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:21,640
you see uh one of the i don't sure if it's a kuma pacifist or if it's kuma himself it's impossible

1369
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:27,320
to tell but you could see one of them and he had black wings in in one of these panels in like a

1370
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:32,920
recent chapter i swear to god i'm not making this up huh and also he was black and also jimbay was

1371
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:38,680
black and i don't know are all luminarians black i'm not sure about that um but no i swear there

1372
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:46,200
was a kuma with black wings and bonnie says that kuma is a lumarian let me go back to chapters to see

1373
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:51,480
because i i i remember that this is fucked up fucking lilith says that like if only there

1374
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:55,880
were an eternal flame like an eternal power source they're talking about they need a power

1375
02:07:55,880 --> 02:08:00,360
source to power this stuff bonnie says we need more power if only there was such a thing as an

1376
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:08,200
eternal flame my mind immediately goes to the lumarians backfire like that's that's what they're

1377
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:13,720
right that's the setup here right yeah i'm pick i'm picking up detail there's got they're they're

1378
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:18,120
making lumarians they're trying to duplicate the lumarian backflame yeah we learned about that

1379
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:24,600
through king and through kuma's involved somehow through like big mom wants uh one of every race

1380
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:31,720
at her tea party because she's like insane and one of the lumarians is the race she doesn't have

1381
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:39,560
and king and and kydo's crew was a lumarian he's got the wings so we learned about what the lumarians

1382
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:46,680
are so yeah where's where's the kuma you're looking at you're talking about because i saw the g

1383
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:55,000
there was just like one panel in it was maybe a couple chapters ago it was recent but i don't

1384
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,840
know if it was like one of these last two chapters but yeah we there was a you know what i mean maybe

1385
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:08,120
i'll i'll try to find it as well uh yeah i think it's maybe four chapters ago because yeah this

1386
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:14,600
is not where bunny says he's my dad uh 10 6 yeah it would have been in

1387
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:23,160
the my my video is live by the way it's going but i'm just i'm just gonna let it go i don't i don't

1388
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:27,080
have to i don't have to be i don't have to be that attentive to it it's gonna be going for a long time

1389
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:33,800
and i'm not that nervous because i have clicked i've watched through it enough times that i'm

1390
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:41,000
pretty confident there are no big fuck ups or uh anything like that so it's all it's okay

1391
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:48,680
um okay i think i see the panel you were talking about i don't think he has black wings he looks

1392
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:54,920
he looks like he has black fire behind him show me show me show me uh it's when after

1393
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:59,720
uh bonnie turned everyone young and jim bae is young here

1394
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:05,960
yeah it would have been around that time because i remember it was not very

1395
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:11,480
far from when we see uh you know pacifista uh jim bae

1396
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:18,600
guess it's the chapter how they turn jim bae black how they turn jim but fishmen are already black

1397
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:29,320
what the fuck um i'm scrolling i'm scrolling oh did you post it yeah put it in yeah

1398
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:35,800
let me see uh he doesn't look he doesn't have black wings but there is no this is not no this

1399
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:42,440
is not the panel i was talking about i think it was there's the one the one panel with with law

1400
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:47,880
as a female because of the funny fucking doc i think it's that i think it's after this or maybe

1401
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:55,000
it's before this no this was not the panel i was it was like a full page panel all right i'm

1402
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:00,840
scrolling through the next chapter it might have even it might have even been before this

1403
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:05,160
because i see okay the next one the next one has jim bae with the wings

1404
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:11,880
i mean pacifista jim bae why does he have the wings because what the fuck is that he's like

1405
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:18,120
lumarian crossbreed or something why they're they're they're i think

1406
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:25,560
my guess is that they're cloning they're like adding lumarian dna to their pacifistas in order to

1407
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:35,960
create like lumarian clones that will they'll use to power stuff right that's what's going on here

1408
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:39,720
yes if there's an eternal flame i can't remember what was said about the lumarians

1409
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:47,080
she mentioned an eternal uh well uh we just fire on their back they have fire on their back

1410
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:52,680
and they can turn it on or off at will and when it's on they're like invincible or when it's off

1411
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:59,240
they're invincible or something like that yeah i think it's it's like it was a defense thing like

1412
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:04,440
he has to turn his flames off to do an attack and that's when zoro realized he could attack him

1413
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:09,080
yeah it's something like that i don't remember exactly how it works

1414
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:16,280
okay i'm looking at i'm looking at chapter 62 1062 it's loading

1415
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:27,240
oh wait yeah did you find it yeah yeah yeah it's the cp zero you knew it what chapter is it 62

1416
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:33,400
it is 62 scroll down a bit i'm scrolling i'm scrolling yes look at that look at that shit

1417
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:40,600
what's going what the heck is this it's gotta be another wait no so in short our assignment is to

1418
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:49,000
return this problem child back to egghead so this is a this is a a problem child meaning that it was

1419
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:55,000
uh it's a failed experiment or like a world government issued it and it didn't work something

1420
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:02,520
went wrong and so they're bringing it back to egghead okay i can't tell i i think i think it's

1421
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:08,120
relevant it looks to me like this kuma is meant to have like dark skin like his skin looks darker

1422
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:14,520
than the shadow of the background possibly i'm i'm taking this i'm taking this to means that all

1423
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:25,640
that's what all the lumarians look like yeah and then but then okay bonnie saying that like her dad

1424
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:36,120
always said he was part of a very special race what the fuck is that yeah the bear guys no wait no

1425
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:42,200
that's just his fruit that's just his fruit it sounded like it sounded like she was talking

1426
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:49,000
that like kuma told her that he's a lumarian but there's no fucking way that that's true

1427
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:55,160
we never saw him with a fire on his back he never had he doesn't have wings he had light

1428
02:13:55,160 --> 02:14:04,120
skin which i think is relevant so i mean i don't think so i mean i think if kuma was a lumarian

1429
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:12,040
that's like a very it's a significant like rare thing so he would be like

1430
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:19,720
like if the reason he's like giving himself up to vega punk is like a good bargaining chip

1431
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:26,680
yeah it would be like we're gonna use him to duplicate the duplicate the lumarian dna and

1432
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:33,640
create that fire yeah and it's like uh yeah so like for some reason to protect someone maybe

1433
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:39,480
to to help dragon to help his daughter he did that maybe he just believes in science maybe he just

1434
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:45,800
believes in science that hard so yeah my eternal flame is he does have a flame he does you know

1435
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:50,120
in that panel you know he does have a flame behind him in that panel you posted and i don't

1436
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:56,040
know it's hard to say if that means anything or not well that's just jim bae's imagination of

1437
02:14:56,040 --> 02:15:01,880
of kuma but it could i know i know but jim bae's heard it could mean that jim bae's heard of a rumor

1438
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:08,440
of of kuma having like black flame around him that's that's really funny what does it says image

1439
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:13,480
it says image in front of the i guess that means it's his mental image is his mental image of kuma

1440
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:19,320
from what i've heard kuma's a real piece of shit your dad sucks the fact that here at this point

1441
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:23,720
in the story in the same like in with two chapters before there's there's this pacifist to kuma with

1442
02:15:23,720 --> 02:15:29,480
the wings and there's kuma with depicted with fire behind him but then you know jim bae clone also

1443
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:37,560
has the wings so maybe this is just unrelated could be oh boy we just don't know yeah we just don't

1444
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:43,320
know it would do something to add to like the reason kuma is the one that was turned into a robot

1445
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:47,960
as opposed to anyone else if he's like a special race lumarian boy

1446
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:57,880
like why him well he had special stuff they tore off his wings and they doused his flame

1447
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:02,840
so that's why you didn't see it before wait i gotta i gotta be mean to my chat

1448
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:08,840
wait he was already a robot when we meet him in thriller buck he already had robotic parts

1449
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:10,200
zora couldn't cut him properly

1450
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:17,080
he yeah but he hadn't he was like partially robot but he had not like lost his mind yeah

1451
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:21,400
yeah but he was partially robot that means they could have like surgically removed his wings to

1452
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:26,600
study them that's why he doesn't have wings when we see him like that that could be an explanation

1453
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:32,280
as to why he doesn't have wings when we first meet him or anytime we see him i suppose if he's

1454
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:38,920
already got gone under some like cyborgianness and then they whitewashed him so he doesn't look

1455
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:43,000
as dark yeah yeah they they made him more marketable well they were like okay we gotta we gotta make

1456
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:48,120
this guy but we can't sell we can't sell him in china if he looks like this we gotta why we gotta

1457
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:57,800
make him white do you know about do you know about the showbiz pizza gorilla what no i don't you

1458
02:16:57,800 --> 02:17:03,720
know but do you know about showbiz pizza and the yeah the big bear their their drummer was a

1459
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:08,760
gorilla oh no i do i do yeah and when they and when they franchise the showbiz pizza animatronics

1460
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:15,720
to china they made the gorilla white because i don't know they liked the gorillas the gorillas

1461
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:23,560
already they made him an albino they made him an albino gorilla to make him as fucked yeah i think

1462
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:28,520
it i think it was china i think it was china uh there yeah there's like one there's like one

1463
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:32,600
version of that animatronics that that has a white gorilla i think it's in china and they just

1464
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:41,880
they just asked him can you can you make him not black please sad cringe um i don't get it

1465
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:49,560
i don't get what's going on with kuma here but i mean i guess i guess we're gonna find out

1466
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:55,320
you know when i first read the like if only there was an unlimited power source

1467
02:17:56,280 --> 02:18:04,120
um we could do some crazy shit i'm like are the ancient weapons like used the the ancient

1468
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:11,480
weapons use the power source or are they do they create the power source maybe whatever destroyed

1469
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:17,880
that island that isn't like the world government has is using a similar thing maybe they've got

1470
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:25,240
the power and they destroyed the country that didn't want to be subjugated about it do you think

1471
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:35,400
so you think the the power that um it was lilet that says like no it was um it was dafpunk

1472
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:38,360
that said there used to be a power or someone said there used to be a power

1473
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:44,600
that we don't have anymore yeah i forget who i forget who said it um do you think like they're

1474
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:51,080
using that the the i mean i mean it seems like an unbelievably strong laser beam from space like

1475
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:55,320
what the hell else i would have thought that like that was something that like pluton could do

1476
02:18:56,600 --> 02:19:04,360
yeah um like if if the ancient weapons exist but they're not currently operational yeah like

1477
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:11,960
they're supposedly still buried in old wano right yeah but then this this other thing maybe that's

1478
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:17,720
just one of the ancient weapons that is around and in use there are other there are other ancient

1479
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:22,440
weapons i mean god if like if that's just what other ancient what i mean pluton is supposed

1480
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:29,480
to be the best one so do we know where the others are could that be urinus or something was it um

1481
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:35,080
i forget the names of them well i think okay correct me if i'm wrong but didn't in water seven

1482
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:42,760
frankie wanted the they burned the blueprints to neptune right i thought it was pluton but

1483
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:48,520
maybe it's neptune i thought i think it was a different one i don't know frankie still remembers

1484
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:53,720
that i'm pretty sure he does because that would be an obvious thing still remembers that like he

1485
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:58,680
read it once and then you destroyed it but like he could build it because he he had like a photograph

1486
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:05,960
eyeball he took a picture of it oh well sure why would you oh yeah of course he must remember

1487
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:10,280
wouldn't it be silly if he's like oh yeah i just forgot about that officer i just kind of like

1488
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:16,840
stopped worrying about it just didn't seem that important i i i i needed to clear my hard drive

1489
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:22,360
and accidentally deleted it yeah sorry i need to make space for like the new uh fucking update to

1490
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:29,720
my favorite mmo i'm playing in my head i needed to record a new lecture and you know it's a lot

1491
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:36,040
it's a lot of high-definition footage i needed a new hard drive so whatever it's fine nobody's gonna

1492
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:47,160
use it anyway um now i'm trying to think is there anything else uh wacky going on i need to pee

1493
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:54,520
i'll be back in a sec okay uh i'm back you back uh no i'm not here oh okay

1494
02:20:56,120 --> 02:21:05,240
haha trick to i'm indeed here um were we were we talking about uh one piece things what else

1495
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:15,880
has been happening that's crazy uh uh this is the most interesting one piece has been

1496
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:23,880
in a while i think i'm still trying to like do you know at the end of one oh when

1497
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:31,000
the the old shogun shows up he was the tango guy the whole time yeah yeah yeah the grandpa

1498
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:37,480
and he goes downstairs and he shows nika robin and trafalgar lord the um shows him the love of

1499
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:45,400
the road ponyglyph right yeah and then they learned some stuff and they got that's the third one and

1500
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:49,880
they need one more i think why no do they do they actually show the ponyglyph or do you just say it's

1501
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:56,840
down here and i don't know if i show it in the sunken world because i know they said that jack

1502
02:21:56,920 --> 02:22:07,640
was used to swim down and and see it or get it something i i feel like something in my i think

1503
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:12,840
i remember seeing like they don't really draw attention to it but i think while robin is

1504
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:23,480
talking to that old tango man tango man just like in mega man eight uh i think they talk about i

1505
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:30,840
think you can see like a ponyglyph etchings in like the background so i think they do find i don't

1506
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:40,120
know if it's the road ponyglyph uh but um they i think i think they got the etchings i don't

1507
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:47,720
know if we i don't know if we actually saw the the the cube yeah i remember i feel like that

1508
02:22:47,720 --> 02:22:52,760
should have been a big deal because like wano is the place where the ponyglyphs would come from

1509
02:22:54,280 --> 02:22:59,000
and the guy who knows the most about it oh that's right oh wait that's right they came from wano i

1510
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,760
forgot maybe that's why there there was etching in the background because like the yeah that's the

1511
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:10,760
language they used or i forgot is it that like only wano had like the knowledge of like steel

1512
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:16,120
craft to like make was it all ponyglyphs or was it just the road ponyglyphs it was all of them

1513
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:21,480
they all came from wano yeah because they're all like invincible right they're all like you

1514
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:27,080
can't they can't break like this the special metal metallurgy or whatever yeah they really

1515
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:32,760
called it forgot about that because they make swords they fold swords they can fold cubes

1516
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:39,080
natural i mean i mean in one piece sword metal is like the most powerful substance known to man so

1517
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:44,200
yeah it's it's the same as like when the plane crashes and they find the black box and they're

1518
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:48,040
like well why don't they just make the plane out of what the black box is made out of it's like

1519
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:52,360
oh a sword can cut through an entire mountain well why don't we just make the most important

1520
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:56,600
artifacts in the world out of the same metal that we made the swords out of well they did

1521
02:23:56,600 --> 02:24:04,280
that was the genius of wano amazing they thought oh no you thought of everything uh

1522
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:15,240
uh oh man um yeah i feel like um freaking my my understanding of of a lot of one pieces like

1523
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:21,640
bigger like things like the rocks pirates i'm not entirely sure what the hell that is like building

1524
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:28,920
to um well the rock pirates was the crew that was like it was the crew the big mom and kaito and

1525
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:37,560
and what's his face like that that that that guy there was a guy that garp and roger or white

1526
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:45,400
beard were fighting i don't know i i need to reread and get like reacquainted with all of these

1527
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:49,400
things because or maybe just look at the wiki because well they were like read one piece and

1528
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:54,600
there's so many fucking like plot threads going on rocks was like to keep track he was like a big

1529
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:59,000
captain like before roger right or like before white beard

1530
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:06,840
yes yeah and i think he might have been enemies with roger and or white beard

1531
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:15,320
it's unclear i feel like they definitely fought in like a specific island and it's very like

1532
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:18,920
secretive what happened there we don't really know

1533
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:25,800
and then they left and then roger eventually became the king of the pirates and the other

1534
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:32,520
guys the rox pirates disbanded and white beard and kaito and big mom they all went their separate

1535
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:39,720
ways i think white bro was also on that crew white beard yeah yeah yeah white beard was

1536
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:46,200
yes yes a bunch of him a bunch of important people used to be on the the rocks pirates crew

1537
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:55,240
and garb knows what happened because he was there he was like the hero from that battle

1538
02:25:56,520 --> 02:26:03,560
that's how he got his fame or something i'm typing sorry it's okay

1539
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:16,200
okay okay i'm i'm i'm back um yeah i guess that's in a week we've said about one piece

1540
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:23,160
so you know i guess there's a lot to say because i just caught up and and then also there was a

1541
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:30,120
huge lore dump just this week last week though i will you know i'm gonna keep i'm gonna keep reading

1547
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:07,000
uh what else is on the agenda well that was the last thing on my list of topics let me see where

1548
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:15,880
did i what did i put that that stupid list um yeah one piece clash of demon head train

1549
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:26,600
sounds chili and kagassia was my list so that's everything i am it's a i guess it's sort of a

1550
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:34,600
silly thing to say what's up but um i i've not been very productive recently but it's been for a good

1551
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:40,840
reason it's because i am too happy all the time i've had i think i have opposite depression

1552
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:47,000
i think i have when depression you mean mania is mania the word you're looking for

1553
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:55,160
it's like uh when you get depression you're like oh i can't do anything uh and everything is so

1554
02:27:55,160 --> 02:28:01,240
difficult and i have that but it's not because i feel sad it's because i'm too distracted with

1555
02:28:01,240 --> 02:28:06,040
how happy i am i'm smiling all the time and i'm enjoying things and i'm like oh shit i should

1556
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:12,680
have worked today but i was i was too happy damn hate hate that hate that hate that when that

1557
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:17,640
happens that's my week i've i've been doing a little bit of things here in there i suppose

1558
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:25,880
there are i suppose there are worse problems to have yeah so you know i'm all right i'm vibing

1559
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:32,520
vibing vibing okay i i do want to get uh chapter four of chelsea gunsmoke done before didn't you

1560
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:37,240
did you say on like twitter that you were going to be posting it you're going to post the new

1561
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:46,440
chapter pretty soon right um yeah relatively soon i haven't started like inking uh and stuff but i

1562
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:52,280
have all of the the blocking for the you know next 20 pages could turn into a chapter think of

1563
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:58,200
like a logical point to end it and then be like okay i'll draw these and i'll draw them i'll release

1564
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:07,720
them shouldn't take too long uh that's that's my main goal for the moment it's a good goal

1565
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:14,680
it's a good goal i've been i also want to to look into anison for printing i know i think i want

1566
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:21,080
to print on demand yeah i feel like um yeah i mean a kickstarter is a whole big like i'm adding a

1567
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:28,120
whole lot of like bureaucracy and and management and organizing to myself which is it is that's

1568
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:33,320
i'm like it definitely if i can get good enough quality on print on demand i'll i'll do it thrams

1569
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:41,000
them you know what you know what it's totally valid i get it that the is a pretty reasonable

1570
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:48,200
yeah uh it's um it's gonna be online anyway so it's just if people want a physical copy

1571
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:56,680
yeah yeah because i mean i mean then it's just kind of like you just kind of you know you set up

1572
02:29:56,680 --> 02:30:03,320
you set up the file and you and just let just let amazon handle because then they handle the printing

1573
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:08,200
they handle the delivery and the shipping and all that don't have to worry about it and i just get

1574
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:14,200
i just get currency you can get on your fucking kindle probably probably yeah no i'm pretty i'm

1575
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:20,440
pretty sure you can it's just you need the right kind of kindle that has a screen you can't get

1576
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:26,200
just the one of those kindles that are like low battery usage the only show text

1577
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:30,600
you need to be like a an ipad with a kindle app or something

1578
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:38,440
yeah interesting you know i never even thought of like putting any of my stuff on like amazon

1579
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:43,240
books or whatever but yeah i guess yeah i guess then it's available people can buy it

1580
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:48,440
downloaded digitally and like yeah sure it is up on your website but like i could see someone

1581
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:54,360
wanting to you know pay like a couple bucks just to get a file to read on there you know

1582
02:30:55,400 --> 02:31:00,600
their reader that makes i could do like a fucking audiobook where i read all of the characters

1583
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:05,560
all of the dialogue and then this panel she has a gun up and she shoots and goes

1584
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:11,400
then the next panel guy gets shot in the head oh blood everywhere

1585
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:17,320
and he says ouch that'll be the audiobook

1586
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:28,520
and that's the audiobook the audiobook version yes yes uh i think that's a great idea that's

1587
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:34,360
that's like a whole new medium this genre bending describing a comic uh

1588
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:43,000
yeah and then in dishpanel and then in dishpanel she and this panel is very small and and it is

1589
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:47,960
sort of showing that this character is insignificant compared to this big panel it's this bigger

1590
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:52,520
character and then wait and then this next panel yes she's grabbing the gun and i kind of fucked

1591
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:56,840
up drawing the hand the hand is kind of fucked up but like it's it still looks good it still looks

1592
02:31:56,840 --> 02:32:03,240
good okay next panel it's still good it's still good it's still good don't worry about it but

1593
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:08,600
you have to mention it you have to mention it but for the for the blind you know

1594
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:14,680
mm-hmm they should be able to enjoy claire's a gun smoke just as much as me close closed

1595
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:20,200
captioning i think i just i think it's strange i don't really get the logic of like you know how

1596
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:28,040
you can add like closed captioning to like twitter image posts closed captioning yeah like

1597
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:32,440
or alt alt text like you can post an image on twitter and you there's the little alt button

1598
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:36,200
on the image and you can click it and it brings up like a text description of the image

1599
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:46,600
uh uh yeah what's that for is is the idea that like someone scroll scrolling twitter might use

1600
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:52,520
like text to speech to like have it like read it out so they can hear the description of the image

1601
02:32:53,320 --> 02:32:57,960
you know that yeah text to speech would be the way because that's how you would navigate the

1602
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:03,800
internet normally as a blind person i mean i guess i just assumed that like blind people just

1603
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:08,840
like wouldn't use twitter because but maybe they do and they just like use it in like a text to

1604
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:14,280
speech i i feel like you could you could get a lot out of twitter because it's mostly text

1605
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:19,080
and you could just like scroll and it says things maybe they just play when they're on screen just

1606
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:24,040
the text to speech just plays like if you've got if you're scrolling really fast just loads of voices

1607
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:30,840
keeps shouting at you like as you're scrolling you just keep starting the next tweet yeah oh my god

1608
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:37,560
there's got a donation it's got a donation in chat oh my god i forgot that that's an aspect

1609
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:43,640
of premier is that they act like a stream so people can donate you can't donate to a video

1610
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:49,640
unless you have like a channel membership thingy i i checked i checked and my my super chats were

1611
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:56,840
enabled so um i've gotten a cup i've got a couple of donuts so far which is nice that's uh it makes

1612
02:33:56,840 --> 02:34:06,760
me happy i'd like to money i'd like to get to money you laugh but it's so true it's i laugh because

1613
02:34:06,760 --> 02:34:19,000
it's so true yeah um um right publishing uh quick quickly i'll note that i have been yeah the the

1614
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:23,240
thing that i've been doing to get slime and punishment done is i've been going through

1615
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:28,600
all the tweets i've been going through all the like twitter exchanges that me and chris had at

1616
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:33,160
the time and i'm just kind of i'm just kind of arranging them into a little into a little like

1617
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:40,200
narrative so like sort of interspersed in the like page notes and indexes and footnotes on every page

1618
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:45,880
it notes like when chris said something or this and like my goal with that is to sort of

1619
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:50,520
because some of the pages were sort of responses to things she said so my goal there is like if

1620
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:55,320
you want you can read through that and you can be like oh chris said this or like chris had this

1621
02:34:55,320 --> 02:35:01,320
reaction to this page and some of them are funny and some of them are informative and they're like

1622
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:06,440
oh that's why that next page looked like that or whatever uh so just kind of trying to like get all

1623
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:13,320
that before into into a readable into a format that's readable on the page and i guess i better do

1624
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:18,120
that before twitter dies uh because then all that will be lost like tears in the rain and that's no

1625
02:35:18,120 --> 02:35:25,960
no yeah yeah i see mary maryweather maryweather showed up for the premiere that's very kind that's

1626
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:32,200
very cool i see sims he's been i should probably go over there i mean yeah sure uh sim i've seen

1627
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:39,560

02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:41,160

1631
02:35:55,880 --> 02:36:00,120
the beginning you missed and i can you missed my shout out i shouted your website out that was

1632
02:36:00,120 --> 02:36:04,440
like at the very beginning thank you you see i'm wearing the pin you see i'm wearing the lord of

1633
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:15,000
ghost pin yes oh no i'm wrong okay someone in chat mentioned that there's a song about not being

1634
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:21,480
able to beat airman and i remembered that that was true and for a second in my fever brain i thought

1635
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:28,920
i think i might have worked for the guy that wrote that song but no i'm wrong that song's japanese

1636
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:35,880
i did work for a guy one time who was the member of a nerd folk band that wrote songs about things

1637
02:36:35,880 --> 02:36:43,640
like that but they did not write that song so i was confused uh yeah i'm kind of like oh yeah

1638
02:36:43,640 --> 02:36:49,560
i'm kind of blown away just briefly talking about your lecture how fucking huge this whiteboard is

1639
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:54,680
it's the whole yeah it's the whole wall it's the whole wall behind me oh it's a wall okay well it's

1640
02:36:54,680 --> 02:37:01,000
it's not a whiteboard it's uh it's a i bought like a a giant roll of paper so i pretty much

1641
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:06,920
just put it on one of those yeah okay so i pretty much just like papered the whole wall behind me

1642
02:37:07,480 --> 02:37:11,640
yeah i bought a whiteboard but it like wasn't big enough and i was like a whiteboard that's big

1643
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:17,000
enough for what i want to do would be like 200 bucks so it's by a big role it makes a lot more

1644
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:23,240
sense you know what i actually i have the i have the the roll you know like with all that stuff on it

1645
02:37:23,240 --> 02:37:27,720
i i rolled it back up and i saved it i was thought wouldn't it be funny if i like auctioned it on

1646
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:35,080
ebay or something like i had the the man lecture big old yeah yeah like i wonder if anyone would

1647
02:37:35,080 --> 02:37:44,920
buy it for a joke or something or buy it for real uh both buy it for real for a joke and to give me

1648
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:53,480
money to give me the money um yeah let's uh let's go to questions yeah let's go to let's go to

1653
02:38:20,680 --> 02:38:28,600

1654
02:38:28,600 --> 02:38:37,480
took a lot of extra data space to get that extra resolution oh well hope it didn't fuck up um

1663
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:43,480
minecraft wizard it's really it's really it's remarkable it's remarkable the things that he's

1664
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:49,720
made in that pcb server i've not yet been um a minecraft server with as much love and dedication

1665
02:39:49,720 --> 02:39:55,480
poured into all of the buildings and architecture and stuff no i said i sent him a message after

1666
02:39:55,480 --> 02:40:00,760
where it's being like sorry it took me like literally a whole year or more to finish that

1667
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:09,400
stuff that you made but like highly highly impressive highly impressive work uh yeah if you

1668
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:16,440
if you didn't catch the stream basically the i'm gonna try to summarize so in the pcb minecraft

1669
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:22,040
server there is a map of new los angeles city which is of course the setting of endless war

1670
02:40:22,040 --> 02:40:27,640
it's much of it is empty it's not all full of stuff but what's there there's a lot of stuff in

1671
02:40:27,640 --> 02:40:33,320
downtown and in copkill town and in the rowdy roughhouse and in some of the areas in between

1672
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:37,960
and in the rowdy roughhouse there is a quest you can find someone will give you a book

1673
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:43,960
that gives you a list of um marbles that you need to collect and these rowdy marbles

1674
02:40:45,400 --> 02:40:54,360
are based on they're based on a um a web comic that a rfck player named forks made a long time

1675
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:59,240
ago for a contest and this comic was about going around the rowdy roughhouse and finding all the

1676
02:40:59,240 --> 02:41:04,280
rowdies and you would have to basically best them in challenges to obtain marbles so in the

1677
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:09,160
rowdy roughhouse in the minecraft server you go around and find all these famous rowdies and you

1678
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:13,640
beat them in in pixelmon pokemon battles and if you win or sometimes you have to solve a little

1679
02:41:13,640 --> 02:41:17,720
puzzle or something and if you win if you beat the challenge they give you a marble and you have to

1680
02:41:17,720 --> 02:41:22,520
collect them all and if you get them all you can go inside the rowdy roughhouse and inside the rowdy

1681
02:41:22,520 --> 02:41:27,320
roughhouse you have to do an incredibly difficult platforming challenge a la getting over it with

1682
02:41:27,320 --> 02:41:34,040
ben at faughty uh where you have to jump around on all this stuff to climb the tower and then once

1683
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:41,240
you beat that challenge then you find uh the rowdy fucker himself munchy deep in the in the depths

1684
02:41:41,240 --> 02:41:46,760
of the roughhouse on top of and this is an incredibly deep cut that i could not believe

1685
02:41:46,760 --> 02:41:50,280
give you remember what i'm talking about you pointed out that the arena is based on that

1686
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:57,800
oh yeah comic that drawing that you did in ten paces and draw of the rock concert being held on

1687
02:41:57,800 --> 02:42:09,560
the giant amp suspended by chains yes couldn't it's it's amazing it is amazing i when you pointed

1688
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:15,640
out i was like i was like i can't believe it that's literally the deepest cut i've ever seen ever

1689
02:42:16,200 --> 02:42:25,400

1702
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:42,760
true they do but in my opinion in my opinion oh my god spark man helps with mining at night

1703
02:43:42,760 --> 02:43:48,840
in my opinion the the the story the actual story of x4 is actually pretty good it's just really

1704
02:43:49,480 --> 02:43:55,640
really badly told by these awful cutscenes and like the awful in-game dialogue like the terrible

1705
02:43:55,640 --> 02:44:01,960
localization what they were true what they were going for is pretty cool what they actually did with

1727
02:46:16,680 --> 02:46:22,760
magically change someone's cutie mark it would just fade back to the sjw libs tried to change the

1742
02:48:11,880 --> 02:48:18,360
yeah i don't know the hex i think i've made um the logo am i did phil fish work on the hex

1743
02:48:19,160 --> 02:48:25,240
i don't know i don't follow him no phil fish worked on a game called hexels

1744
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:33,960
okay i was i was close but i am vaguely familiar with the hex i've seen it i don't really know

1745
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:40,600
what it's deal is 172 people watching my premiere i feel like that's good i feel like that's a good

1746
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:48,280
number um 171 oh it's going down no it was 169 before now oh there it is again nice it's going

1747
02:48:48,360 --> 02:48:54,760
down baby uh next one is called did either you use the the painting in inscription

1748
02:48:56,440 --> 02:49:02,120
the painting um i guess not i don't know what that is i think there's a painting in the room

1749
02:49:02,120 --> 02:49:10,360
right like it's just looks sort of like a thing like a you can't click on it um is there

1750
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:19,400
wait maybe uh i know there's like there's like that that like picture frame that shows like

1751
02:49:19,400 --> 02:49:25,320
a a setup of cards every time you die and there's like a different set of cards on the thing i don't

1752
02:49:25,320 --> 02:49:30,440
i don't know what that is referring to yes is that like the like you get a special prize if you

1753
02:49:30,440 --> 02:49:39,000
managed to make that board or something i did manage to do it once or twice and um what is it

1754
02:49:39,800 --> 02:49:41,480
i forget what you get for i did do it

1755
02:49:45,560 --> 02:49:53,000
oh whenever you receive a set of cards well you get the four leaf clover oh oh weird okay

1756
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:57,960
i i only did it once yes you unlock the four leaf clover for the first one oh i didn't know

1757
02:49:57,960 --> 02:50:02,040
you could do it multiple times the second was the candlestick wait

1758
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:07,480
oh this puzzle gives you your third candlestick oh wow i didn't know that

1759
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:17,560
and squirrels to bees damn holy shit squirrels to bees is good i wonder if if you get squirrels

1760
02:50:17,560 --> 02:50:21,640
to bees does your squirrel like totem still work on them though

1761
02:50:24,280 --> 02:50:29,560
i guess it depends on in what order all of these things happen well if you well if you

1762
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:33,720
play it and then it gets a squirrel like buff because it's a squirrel then it turns into a

1763
02:50:33,720 --> 02:50:39,160
bee afterwards i i think it would mean that like just the deck just has bees in it

1764
02:50:39,880 --> 02:50:45,000
which makes me think that like yeah you wouldn't get the squirrel buff if that's how it works i

1765
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:48,840
don't know uh yeah i did i did get the clover i didn't know you could do it i didn't know there

1766
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:56,280
was a point of doing it multiple times uh it's it's a hassle honestly like it's a it's a hassle

1767
02:50:56,280 --> 02:51:00,200
just to check it like the annoying part is just remembering to check it every time you start the

1768
02:51:00,200 --> 02:51:04,600
game and then you just look at and if it's easy cards like squirrel and kingfisher then you're

1769
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:10,280
just like oh yeah i can do that and if it's hard cards like oh uh frickin longhorn and uh

1770
02:51:11,480 --> 02:51:19,000
and a beehive and like fuck that this is not gonna do it um yeah but i did but i did do it one time

1771
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:27,560
next one is ben's weekly reminder play delta room chapter two okay and then oh ben's weekly reminder

1772
02:51:27,560 --> 02:51:34,680
not to catch up on one piece but to keep up to date with one piece i am on it friend yes i am on

1773
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:43,240
the case next one is called a little uh a little song for ben three two one go

1774
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:11,000
i'm in south out but i'll never touch me because i have standards that face looks mad

1775
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:17,080
fucked up and those tits flap in the way here needs positive to be rented hi so is this

1776
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:22,680
fat and ugly as her god i know my husband that's why ben's saying it's my only love well actually

1777
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:27,960
give us better but i'm happy because she didn't post it's like she promised it's all stew and my

1778
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:34,280
little comments when i'm done with ben's this ass will never be home again

1779
02:52:37,480 --> 02:52:43,800
i understood some of that i understood bits of it i think that's like an like an ai voice of

1780
02:52:43,800 --> 02:52:50,840
somebody singing definitely um i would have posted tits if because like there are other people who

1781
02:52:50,840 --> 02:52:57,960
were doing that and i was like uh i could do that oh because i might be at because twitter was dying

1782
02:52:57,960 --> 02:53:01,400
it will be dead but like i didn't think it was actually gonna die so i was a little scared i was

1783
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:09,240
a little a little i mean it yeah i mean it didn't die so i guess uh lol true if it if it is like

1784
02:53:09,240 --> 02:53:16,280
guaranteed like countdown this is it then i'll do it but it probably wouldn't happen that's your

1785
02:53:16,280 --> 02:53:22,600
promise if it's guaranteed countdown shutting down yeah if it's like oh we're turn off the servers

1786
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:30,200
everybody well okay unless they lie and then i'll be a look at what if elon musk is listening right

1787
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:35,880
now and he and he's gonna he needs gonna lie to make that happen dang personally screw with you

1788
02:53:37,640 --> 02:53:39,000
he just wants to see my tits

1789
02:53:39,320 --> 02:53:48,040
maybe i don't i don't he could he would do who knows what he would he's what he's capable of

1790
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:56,840
um next one is called not much yeah next one is called what happened three two one go

1791
02:53:58,680 --> 02:54:05,160
okay now i'm sure some of my voicemails were deleted censored i don't know what happened

1792
02:54:05,160 --> 02:54:14,360
but i had recommended blasphemous the game and a ring of pain even though uh inscription is just

1793
02:54:14,360 --> 02:54:25,000
the same but better it's not blasphemous is like a uh a metroidvania i think right that's the one

1794
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:32,680
with the guy in like the big metal cone hat uh i don't know i think i've seen a cone hat

1795
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:37,640
somewhere it's like a pixel it's like a pixel uh side scrolling castlevania and there's like a it's

1796
02:54:37,640 --> 02:54:47,480
like a sort of like a spanish like uh uh inquisition sort of aesthetic to it's like a guy on like a

1797
02:54:47,480 --> 02:54:53,720
torture helmet it's like a big metal cone i think oh wait i think i've seen a bit of that

1798
02:54:53,720 --> 02:55:00,760
and then what was the other one he said uh blasphemous and ring of pain i've never heard

1799
02:55:00,760 --> 02:55:09,880
of ring of pain yeah we've if you did send the thing we didn't see it because we we look at everything

1800
02:55:09,880 --> 02:55:16,840
gib i know that you know what i'm talking about did you you played a game called data scape didn't

1801
02:55:16,840 --> 02:55:26,760
you yes i did i did i said a guy a guy on twitter sent me uh a code for it they said they made the

1802
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:33,480
game they wanted me to try it so i did and uh it was a little confusing um i was very bad at it but

1803
02:55:33,480 --> 02:55:38,840
i tried it it was it was like a hacking game where you go around a little well 3d realm and then you

1804
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:46,760
go to little nodes and you hack the nodes yeah like typing in in a little console uh i really cool i

1805
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:51,560
i saw that you yeah i saw that you had played it on my steam on my steam page it said that you had

1806
02:55:52,520 --> 02:56:00,280
so i yeah i assumed you got the same message that i did it was yeah i gave treat data scape a try

1807
02:56:01,240 --> 02:56:08,040
and it was i thought this i thought it was i thought visually it was very strong i liked

1808
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:15,960
how it looked a lot the puzzle hacking did you unlock any like new commands i didn't get that far

1809
02:56:15,960 --> 02:56:20,440
into it i was gonna go back to it i just just said like i'll play this for like 10 minutes i played

1810
02:56:20,440 --> 02:56:27,080
it for maybe like 45 minutes or half an hour or something and i i hacked a couple of the uh the

1811
02:56:27,080 --> 02:56:33,240
blocks or the ice blocks and i got into a couple of little programs and it seemed like each time

1812
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:37,000
you do that you get a little bit of like story progression you unlock a little piece of like

1813
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:42,280
uh i think there's like a you have to unlock like all of a poem and i think that's part of the story

1814
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:48,520
and yeah i got one that unlocked a new like uh command and i and i assumed that like the

1815
02:56:48,520 --> 02:56:52,680
way you unlock more and more advanced puzzles is you unlock more and more useful commands for

1816
02:56:53,400 --> 02:56:59,240
making your hacking stronger which was yeah i think what what i did was i did the tutorial

1817
02:56:59,240 --> 02:57:04,920
and then i couldn't complete it because it was a little hard to like type quickly enough um but

1818
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:10,120
then i finally did the tutorial and then i was in the main game and then i walked over to this like

1819
02:57:10,760 --> 02:57:16,360
record player because that was was like odd i went into the record player and then it was just a

1820
02:57:16,360 --> 02:57:21,080
big 3d model of like a like a vinyl record player wait that was in the demo right

1821
02:57:22,760 --> 02:57:27,320
was it the demo or i just i remember the record the record player was the same

1822
02:57:27,320 --> 02:57:33,160
was also the first one that i hacked but i went over there and there was a tutorial there was a

1823
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:39,480
tutorial yeah this was not in the tutorials like beyond this is in the main game or whatever it was

1824
02:57:39,480 --> 02:57:46,520
yeah but like i went in there and i just flew around in this like 3d zone like this void this

1825
02:57:46,520 --> 02:57:50,680
black void with a record player and like a bright light and i didn't know what i was supposed to

1826
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:55,080
do yeah and then i didn't know how to get out and so eventually i turned the game off because i

1827
02:57:55,080 --> 02:58:02,600
was stuck in there yeah yeah it was a little bit unclear i i got i got in there i heard some like

1828
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:09,080
narration uh i think i think eventually after the narration stopped i was like what do i do what

1829
02:58:09,080 --> 02:58:13,400
do i do and yeah i think you have to hit like the backspace key somewhere it tells you that the

1830
02:58:13,400 --> 02:58:18,280
backspace key brings you out of a program that could that could have been that could have been clearer

1831
02:58:19,400 --> 02:58:24,680
or i think i think when when like there's nothing left in the program i really think the game should

1832
02:58:24,680 --> 02:58:32,200
just deposit you out of the program or or indicate that it's time to leave um but i did i did that

1833
02:58:32,200 --> 02:58:36,680
with a couple of different programs and usually they each have like a little they each have a

1834
02:58:36,680 --> 02:58:41,400
little sort of like uh like digital like art piece of them kind of like a little 3d one of

1835
02:58:41,400 --> 02:58:45,720
them had a bunch of like neon eyes and like you had to walk towards the eyes and one of them had

1836
02:58:45,720 --> 02:58:52,360
like a big glowing thing inside of like a cage and there were some other ones uh one of them had

1837
02:58:52,360 --> 02:58:59,000
some text that you had to read and unlock a piece of a poem and you save the poem uh i i quit because

1838
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:04,920
there was one i was trying to hack a block and i kept hearing like voice lines and the voice

1839
02:59:04,920 --> 02:59:08,920
lines were saying like get out of there you're under attack or something like oh they're they're

1840
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:13,640
getting us like you got to do something and i was like what are you what are you talking about

1841
02:59:13,640 --> 02:59:17,320
and like i stopped hacking and i looked around and like nothing was going on and i was like

1842
02:59:17,880 --> 02:59:23,800
i don't know what this is telling me to do so i kept hacking and i kept hearing these lines saying

1843
02:59:23,800 --> 02:59:29,960
like you're under attack and i was like okay and then i just i just lost they were like oh they

1844
02:59:29,960 --> 02:59:36,440
got us and i was like i lost the game i was like well i don't know how i lost but i guess i i guess

1845
02:59:36,440 --> 02:59:44,520
i did uh so it was a little this bad conveyance this bad conveyance i don't know i wasn't quite

1846
02:59:44,520 --> 02:59:50,760
sure what was what was happening uh but there was some there was some neat stuff in it though uh i i

1847
02:59:50,760 --> 02:59:58,120
do like the the concept of of hacking by physically like like typing out your command in a little

1848
02:59:58,120 --> 03:00:02,760
command box rather than clicking around i mean i know you can click around but like the fact that

1849
03:00:02,760 --> 03:00:09,320
it's like an odd control scheme it was it was a really weird control scheme to get to grips with

1850
03:00:09,320 --> 03:00:16,760
there were like the you and o and j and l to like turn yourself 45 turn your camera yeah i think

1851
03:00:16,760 --> 03:00:23,560
the game would have benefited from a more traditional uh was the mouse look uh kind of setup or or

1852
03:00:23,640 --> 03:00:29,640
even just was the an arrow key yeah i did like i kind of liked it though i kind of liked it was

1853
03:00:29,640 --> 03:00:36,360
weird i i i was i i mean i i was intrigued enough that i gave it uh i put a little bit of time into

1854
03:00:36,360 --> 03:00:41,080
it and i unlocked i unlocked i was starting to think that the puzzles were a little bit

1855
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:46,280
dumb but then i unlocked a new command i was like oh i get it i get there's like there's a

1856
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:52,040
progression here you unlock new commands and it makes more and more difficult because i found one

1857
03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:58,760
ice block that was like you know how um you know you you put the the little pointy things on the

1858
03:00:58,760 --> 03:01:02,440
outside and then the one on the inside sort of like goes around to them and cancels them

1859
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:09,640
well i found well i found one that had like 20 arrows on the inside so like when you used um like

1860
03:01:09,640 --> 03:01:15,800
a scatter or um the one that puts all the different arrows on the swarm swarm when i use swarm like

1861
03:01:15,800 --> 03:01:19,160
tons of arrows on the inside appear and cancel them all right away and i was like what the

1862
03:01:19,160 --> 03:01:23,720
fuck am i supposed to do about that you know and obviously the answer is well you know some some

1863
03:01:23,720 --> 03:01:29,400
commands that i can find later will probably make that manageable uh so i thought that was interesting

1864
03:01:30,840 --> 03:01:35,560
anyway yeah just a pcp fan sent us a pcp fan sent us their game that they put on steam and it was

1865
03:01:35,560 --> 03:01:43,160
called data scape and it was kind of neat and i would recommend anyone check it out check that

1866
03:01:43,240 --> 03:01:46,040
i'll put a link i'll put a link i'll put a link in the description

1867
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:51,160
to data scape on steam it's cool it's cool um

1868
03:01:57,240 --> 03:02:01,480
i'm doing a shit i'm looking at my chat i'm looking at my chat and they seem befuddled

1869
03:02:02,120 --> 03:02:07,640
oh no did i say something stupid oh my god no please no no please no don't let me humiliate

1870
03:02:07,640 --> 03:02:15,560
myself on the internet oh no people are saying huh wait why no it's fine i think i'm talking about

1871
03:02:15,560 --> 03:02:20,440
like the database stuff and how it's like it like retroactively changes the canon that's true

1872
03:02:21,240 --> 03:02:26,280
i stand i stand by that okay anyway i'll stop paying attention to that next one is called fun gba

1873
03:02:26,280 --> 03:02:34,600
facts three two one go fun fact about gba hardware is that it actually does not have its own dedicated

1874
03:02:34,600 --> 03:02:42,040
sound chip that's why gba music and sounds just sound kind of bad a lot of time because it just

1875
03:02:42,840 --> 03:02:50,200
doesn't have the hardware to make good sound uh one famous example is castlevania harmony

1876
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:57,000
dissonance the soundtrack sounds like shit but that's because uh so much of the hardware was

1877
03:02:57,000 --> 03:03:02,440
done to just process the graphics that they literally ran out of processing space to

1878
03:03:03,240 --> 03:03:09,160
make any music and they're like oh shit well what the fuck do we do here oh wait the Game Boy Advance

1879
03:03:09,160 --> 03:03:16,680
is also a Game Boy emulator so we'll just use the built-in Game Boy sound chip to make music

1880
03:03:17,400 --> 03:03:21,640
and that's kind of their work around for how they got harmony dissonance to work

1881
03:03:21,640 --> 03:03:27,320
and i think that's just really fucking cool that's funny that's pretty cool that's interesting they're

1882
03:03:27,320 --> 03:03:34,680
using a previous console's audio for a gba game that's that's interesting and it kind of explains

1883
03:03:35,640 --> 03:03:41,560
yeah you know it's too it's too bad because like so much of the lasting appeal of mega man has come

1884
03:03:41,560 --> 03:03:50,120
from its iconic soundtrack yeah and like yeah the zero games just uh i mean not gonna say it

1885
03:03:50,120 --> 03:03:55,160
doesn't have any great tracks but i don't know if it has anything as memorable as like wily castle

1886
03:03:55,880 --> 03:04:04,680
from mega man 2 or or anything like that well but what are you gonna do um next one is called

1887
03:04:04,680 --> 03:04:14,040
the secret to success from phantom horn at sex dot you will 3 2 1 go ben i'm uh the video is probably

1888
03:04:14,040 --> 03:04:18,920
gonna be out by now and i will have watched a bunch of it's premiering right now the lecture

1889
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:25,720
but just wanted to say the reason your son at your video just keeps getting more and more

1890
03:04:25,720 --> 03:04:30,920
more views as opposed to everything else you've done is because of the thumbnail it's because

1891
03:04:30,920 --> 03:04:41,000
you're vaping in it vape more vape into your thumbnails that's gonna make it work it's you

1892
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:49,560
holding up your finger being like hold on hold on the pipe the pipe i had the pipe back that's

1893
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:55,880
what made the video that's what it was you know that's that's as good that's as good a theory as

1894
03:04:55,880 --> 03:05:01,320
as any that i've heard so i mean yeah it is a pretty good pose with the pipe it is a good pose

1895
03:05:01,320 --> 03:05:08,360
like oh you know let me tell you all about christian that is pretty good yeah i definitely

1896
03:05:08,360 --> 03:05:11,800
was a mistake to quit vaping definitely need to pick that back up again
