00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Greetings all, and welcome back to another episode of the Bro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Nate

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:19,800
Bodzman, who are joined by Ben... Ben the Bodd Saint. Yeah, that's the one. And Hippo.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,200
Justify your existence. Did you say Hippo? I did not. I was still asking you to justify...

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:34,600
You know I can't do that. Bibbon Bake is here. Hey guys, I'm here to bake cake. You know, I'm

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,680
absolutely certain that... By the way, Gibb, I'm sorry, this episode is sponsored by the

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,440
B emoji, the big red B emoji. Venus, yes. I prefer the blue one, but alright. Okay. For all of the

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,440
millions of people who are currently typing, oh my god, Ben, oh my god, Ben and Nate on the

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,640
fucking PCP. I can't believe it. I got it unsubscribed right now, they say. The 15th time they've said it.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,960
Hippo, I saw your comment on the last episode, and I really liked it. As much as I love people

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,960
shitting on Ben, you gotta give him a chance, ladies and gentlemen. So you don't have to go by,

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,640
someone made a comment that was just like, saw Ben was on this episode, did cancel, deleted,

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,960
and Hippo was like, guy, you don't have to be afraid of him. I know. If I can talk about animal

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160
crossings. I think you can too, ladies and gentlemen. I have to live with him. Nate tolerates it.

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,000
All the rest of the idiots deal with him. You have to pay, and that's great.

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,560
They love it. Well, there it is. They love Finn doming us. Wait, are they Finn doming us,

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,520
or are we Finn doming them? I think we're Finn doming them. Is Finn doming where there's a furry

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,360
dolphin and then double matrix? Is that guy from Adventure Time, or he tells you what to do, he

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,600
puts you in a hat? I can't hear anything. It's my fault, but I will quickly say that Finn doming

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,080
is when you're like, hey, hey, you fat loser who I will never have sex with, give me money,

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,160
and then they do. Right, like watching an episode of Adventure Time. It sounds like just bullying,

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,480
but, you know, smart. Well, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, the way I'm saying with it,

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,040
cuckoldery can be, and originally was, just simply a fetish that some people enjoyed,

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
even though they are weirdos, but you know, it's okay to be a weirdo sometimes.

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,400
Speaking of weirdos, all right, here's what I've been thinking about all the time, every day,

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,080
all day, and especially just right now, is the Digi's neuro typing chart that came out,

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,880
and the whole like, lexical and impressionist and lateral and linear and putting yourself on

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,040
the chart and thinking about the chart and seeing where all the things go on the chart,

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,160
and I really like charts. I really like it. I wish Digi was here to talk about it a little more,

29
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,720
because I am, I'm big stupid. Well, I'm not stupid, right? But I always thought I was stupid,

30
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,320
until I realized I just, I think in colors and shapes and feelings and entire videos, like,

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,360
instead of words. Well, that doesn't rule you out from also being stupid.

32
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes, this is also a case. But it's like, I was just thinking the other, like today,

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,560
it's like, wouldn't it be great if like, instead of somebody asked me a question,

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,880
and I have to like, think of all the words that like, creates. What do I miss? What do I miss?

35
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,360
We're talking about Digi's neuro typing. Can you hear me? It's still says I muted.

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
It still says I muted. Okay, whatever. Well, okay. If you hear me, it's on.

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,200
All right, there we go. Yes, yeah. Anyway, what did I miss?

38
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
Ellie, is there a cut that? No.

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,600
No, that was gold. Okay, I'm sorry.

40
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,240
Neurotyping, we're talking about.

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,760
Oh, what is all this I've been hearing about neuro typing?

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,480
It's, it's when it's when it's when it's when lol, that's what all you need to know.

43
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,520
Okay, I'm listening.

44
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,720
So, all right, I was thinking about the fact that I am pretty impressionist on this chart,

45
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,520
this, you know, made up bullshit chart, but it is, it does say some truths in a way.

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,920
What chart?

47
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,640
The neuro typing chart. Oh, Ben doesn't even know the basics.

48
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
You don't even know the basics. I don't know what you're talking about.

49
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,960
Digi made. I've been seeing this word thrown around a lot.

50
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,280
All right, I will, I will try to explain. There is two axes.

51
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,520
And we, is it, is it, is it galaxy brain versus smooth brain?

52
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,800
Not quite.

53
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,360
No, I think that was one I made.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
It was, what was the third axis?

55
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
Oh, cringian based.

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
Wrinkle? Wrinkle versus.

57
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,200
No, cringian based was one.

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,040
Galaxy. Smooth brain and galaxy brain.

59
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,520
And there's a third one.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,200
What was it, big brain versus small? Did you?

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,560
No, that's smooth and galaxy.

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,240
It's a, is it Chad versus Virgin?

63
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
Oh yeah, Chad versus, yeah.

64
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,840
No.

65
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah.

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,280
Okay, if you say so.

67
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,560
The chart, the virgin smooth brain, something or other.

68
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,400
I was, I am, I am definitely Chad, Chad cring galaxy brain.

69
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,120
Oh, we should put.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
Actually, no, no, no, I'm Chad virgin neutral on Chad virgin.

71
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,960
We should put, we should put all of the different iterations of that chart on the neuro typing chart.

72
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,880
Yes.

73
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,440
Right, right.

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,760
All right, so where each, the neuro typing chart is a thing Digi concocted, which

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,680
in a, in a brief summer summary,

76
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,480
depicts on a scale or a chart,

77
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,640
your way of thinking in terms of how you communicate ideas to other people

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,680
and how you think those ideas.

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,080
So on the left and right, there is lexical on the left and impressionist on the right.

80
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,520
Lexical is people who think heavily with words and can't understand things that are like vague

81
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,000
and sort of airy, fairy, weird, like, like jazz or whatever.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,760
They need things to be regimented and codified in a language that has rules that they can follow.

83
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,880
So they are very particular about words.

84
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,440
And the other side of the spectrum of that is people who understand the gist of things

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
far easier without needing words to be involved.

86
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,720
And they can use words interchangeably without feeling that there's any problem with that,

87
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,200
which is why there's so much, you know, miscommunication between different types of people,

88
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,240
depending on where you are on the chart, you, you know, I'm very impressionistic,

89
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
which is why I struggle with words constantly.

90
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,880
And I'm like stupid.

91
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,520
Impressionism sucks.

92
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,360
This post was made by lexical gang.

93
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
Fucking lexies.

94
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,120
I thought of, I thought of disparaging terms, right?

95
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,880
The lexies, that those, the thing.

96
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,600
And then the other time, the other side is the imps.

97
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,320
Fucking imp.

98
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,640
Yeah.

99
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,840
Fucking imp doesn't know how to fucking string a sentence together.

100
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,480
Stuttering.

101
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,800
What about, what about, um, what about pressies?

102
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,160
Pressies?

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,320
Oh, what's the drug over there?

104
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,760
Oh, no.

105
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,560
Oh, like imp, okay.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:56,960
Yeah, maybe.

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,720
Just talking around ideas.

108
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,320
You know, there's no such thing as a bad idea.

109
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,240
There's no such thing as a bad question, only a bad idea.

110
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,560
Sounds like impressionistic thinking, and I hate that.

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,360
Anyway, it's really funny as a meme, but I also really like it.

112
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,080
And on the other side of the, the graph going up and down.

113
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,560
I've been, people were calling me an externalist on Twitter the other day, and I didn't know.

114
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,640
Yeah, that's where he placed you, I think.

115
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,880
The graph is split up into like squares that have names.

116
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,480
I don't really, I'm not so far, like, that I understand all of these different titles

117
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,680
within the chart, but I do, I generally agree with the, the fact that there's a sliding scale.

118
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,040
Left to right, lexical, and impressionist.

119
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,920
That's the way you think.

120
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,960
If you haven't seen it, Ben, this is Digi's thing.

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,320
This is where he put all of us.

122
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,400
I found his tweet with the placement image.

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
Yeah, I am him.

124
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,480
And then a top to bottom, at the top is-

125
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,520
You're a centrist, Ben.

126
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,560
You're a fucking centrist.

127
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,040
At the top means, I guess so.

128
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,040
At the top is lateral thinking, and at the bottom is linear thinking.

129
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,160
I'm not quite as sure about what this means.

130
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,840
I've been struggling with this one too, but I know that lateral means you have multiple

131
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,040
lines of thought at any one time.

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Lateral is like thinking outside the box.

133
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,880
Yes, and linear is being like on one point focused on like one idea at a time, is my

134
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,360
understanding.

135
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
The way I've been thinking about it is that if you're very linear, you can focus on a

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,800
task a lot more easily than someone who's laterally minded, because-

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Maybe it's like one really thick band as opposed to many thinner bands or something.

138
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,600
So like a linear person will focus on one task, but will find it hard to multitask,

139
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,600
and a person who is lateral can, it's not always a rule that they can literally multitask,

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,840
but they can have multiple different thoughts going through the head, which may

141
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,800
like interrupt each other and get in the way of each other.

142
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,120
I know from, you know, you may have heard multiple times where I start a sentence,

143
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,960
and then I think of a better way to say the sentence before I finish the first sentence,

144
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,440
and then I start the next one, leading to confusion and like me sounding like I don't

145
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,560
know what I'm saying.

146
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
Sure, I would do that too.

147
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,040
All of this sort of like this stuff has been, it's been cool, and I can't think of the words,

148
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,880
but which is the frustrating thing.

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,600
Knowing that I can't think of the words is helpful for me just to think like a ground,

150
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,760
like a foothold from which I can start to like actually analyze how to do things in life.

151
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,240
But still, I don't have the words for it, and I need some lexical people to explain

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,080
this chart in more words so that I can understand it better and make videos about them and say

153
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
the words instead of writing them, because I can't read, I don't like reading.

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,920
You know what I think was a, did I mention this last time that like you and me doing

155
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,040
the potty cast together, it was funny at the beginning how we totally approached it from

156
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,680
like totally opposite sides of like appreciating this same thing that we both loved one piece.

157
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,720
It's funny how things fit on the chart so easily, because it's such a broad idea,

158
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
and you know, diametrically opposed things, of course, there's going to be the most extreme

159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,040
and the least extreme of that. So it's like it's a very, it's a good chart, I like it.

160
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:21,440
You know, maybe this is my lexic lexibias or whatever, but inherently I'm skeptical of all

161
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,800
sorts of charts like this and personality typing things, because I feel that they are designed

162
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,000
at least partially as a tool for people to jack off about how special they are,

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,040
and they could be sitting down and doing spreadsheets instead.

164
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,440
I mean obviously a two-dimensional chart can only tell you so much.

165
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Did you, of course, we can see that, he said so himself.

166
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,560
It's funny how it seems to be across the board, lexies always think that the chart is cute,

167
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,760
but whatever, and then impressionist people are like, this is so important to me, I need this

168
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,120
chart, I love this chart. I don't think it's so much that we want to feel special, I think it's

169
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:14,160
just that it is a way of understanding thinking patterns that goes a lot further than any other

170
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,080
like book we've ever been told to read, or like any other explanation we've heard before, this is

171
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:29,120
more of like a way to think that is, see, I don't know, sure, as like a tool of education

172
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,760
into how one thinks, I find this perfectly reasonable, but it does strike me typically,

173
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,480
because I think that probably men in general would be more left, or more lexical, and women would be

174
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:49,440
more impressionist, whatever, it does strike me as girl shit, like, like, like INJTP, it is girl

175
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,920
shit, but that's fine. And I hate girl shit. Girl shit is okay, sometimes, said Ben, coming out as

176
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:04,880
trans, coming out as girl, girl leaning, sometimes girl shit is okay too, he said. And you know what,

177
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,200
gun down in a hail of bullet. Michelle did this, see this is the thing, Michelle did this, and I

178
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,880
had to savagely beat her with my belt for it, she looked at the chart, and so originally externalist

179
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,600
was called Room Brightener, which was a very positive time. Room Brightener? It was called

180
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Room Brightener, originally. Did you intentionally tone down the positivity of several of these

181
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,840
categories, because they sounded too cool? Well, and tone down the negativity of some others.

182
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,560
That's certainly true, that's true. To make the words as neutral as possible. The mother's

183
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,840
basement one was intentionally designed to sound shitty. Well, because what he was doing,

184
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,800
the first video he made was he, it was the one where it's like how think with the anime girl

185
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,800
thinking, how anime characters think. And he placed a bunch of anime characters in these

186
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,680
categories, and at the time, Room Brightener's worked with all the anime characters that he was

187
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,080
putting there. But it's a little more like broader than specifically brightening a room,

188
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,000
like it's a bad description of that. So like, certain words were changed. It's all like,

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,760
in the process of being created, it's very like communal, people are coming up with

190
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,800
ways to interpret it and different, you know, tweaks you can make to make the chart more

191
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,240
accurate to real human thinking patterns. All our commenters would surely agree that I

192
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,280
brighten every space that I enter. I darken every doorstep I try to cross personally.

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,280
But it's interesting to note, me and Michelle have long said that there are some interesting

194
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,200
similarities and personality between you and Michelle. And I mean, yeah, we've kind of just

195
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,960
been like, well, specifically it comes into like my more, I don't know, like, I guess lexical is

196
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,080
one way to put it, like thought about things where Michelle is like more lackadaisical and

197
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,040
going with the flow and stuff. And I don't know, for whatever reason, it's come into discussion

198
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,880
that like, oh, you know, Ben's kind of more like you, Michelle. Maybe I want to fuck Ben. Maybe

199
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,680
that's, you know, the general idea. Let's discuss this at a later date.

200
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,720
Anyway, but of note, Michelle looked at the chart, didn't understand at first, like how it worked,

201
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,040
and said, I'm a room brightener. And I was like, Michelle, no, the worst thing you can do is look

202
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,720
at the chart and pick the one you want to be. But then we went through and we're like, oh,

203
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,600
you probably do fit in that category anyway. So it was like, why, why is it now called externalist?

204
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,120
I think straight up because room brightener sounds really, really positive. Yeah, yeah,

205
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,920
yeah. But why, why is it called externalist? What does that mean? I assume it's trying to

206
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:47,040
communicate the same idea that these people, they, they express, because if I'm supposedly one,

207
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,400
I want to know what that says. There's a Reddit made, there's a Reddit board about the Digi

208
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,320
neurotyping thing where people are discussing. I think there's a few like write ups of all of

209
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,440
the descriptions Digi gives and then people's commentary on like what each of these categories

210
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,440
names are and what they mean. So you can look that up. Actually, the creation of that first video,

211
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,960
which I'll, which I'll link Ben, you can just skip straight to the externalist section if you

212
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,360
want to hear what that is, which is cool. The real bombshell here is how when I watched this video

213
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,640
for the first time, it now had that new seek bar thing on mobile where you can fucking like,

214
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,680
it tells you like the chapter sections of the fucking episode on YouTube. It was like the

215
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,880
coolest thing ever. If, if on mobile, you go to this video, you haven't, I mean, it's on my phone

216
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,200
now. I don't have the app actually. I don't use the app because I can't add block through it.

217
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,920
The thing about room brightener is shadow guardian. I think that was changed as well.

218
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,200
What the fuck? Yeah, that was changed to overseer, which again, you can see

219
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,640
very weird. I mean, it makes sense if these are supposed to describe anime characters.

220
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,160
Yes. Yes. Which was the conceit origin, I think. And I feel like bottom left reasonable people.

221
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,160
And then far bottom left middle man, middle manager is highly derogatory. And of course,

222
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,520
that was mother's basement square in the center of that one. But that's been changed to bookkeeper,

223
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,320
which is still doesn't sound great. That's a little, that's neutral. That's fine.

224
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,560
Anyway, so the thing with, you know, all this, like it's totally like understandable

225
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,400
to question what is the point? Like who cares where you are on the chart? Everybody is on the

226
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,720
chart somewhere, but what does it matter whether you know or not? And I'm still trying to think,

227
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,960
figure that out. I would hope that what it does is allow me to like talk or like get advice for

228
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:55,440
people like me on how to think better, because I've noticed that this pattern, it really,

229
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,480
what it's done is that it's made me realize that a lot of the ways I think and a lot of the problems

230
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:08,320
in my life are caused by this way of thinking. And it's like a square peg round hole situation

231
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,080
where I haven't been trying to adapt my life to accommodate for this. I've just been trying to

232
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,320
force my way into the way everyone else thinks and does things. And so I'm like, sort of experimenting,

233
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:28,480
thinking of different ways to approach lots of problems, so that, so that I can better like,

234
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,960
you know, exist, you know, so that I can one stop being depressed quite so much, do art better,

235
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,240
various things that just sort of like hamper my life based on the ways that I approach

236
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,640
lots of things based on the ways I think. And so there's just been pretty, pretty cool

237
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:54,800
thinking about it, but I don't yet have the words. And I need a big, stupid, smart guy to

238
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:03,760
say all the words for me, a stupid, drooling lexical God to explain in clear terms what I

239
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,520
should do. Maybe what you need is, I mean, I don't know, it makes me think of like Bakuman,

240
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,440
how like the two guys were such a great team, because one guy was like the words man and the

241
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,200
other guy was the art man. Yeah, that's what I mean. It's like a, it's like a, I know the problem,

242
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,160
but the solution is like ridiculous, like, Oh, wouldn't it be great if like somebody just understood

243
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,400
me? That's all I need. Yeah, it's like, Oh, well, how are you going to do that? How are you going to

244
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,840
find that? I guess the good news is you're already working in like a career path that that's pretty

245
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,400
I mean, in the arts. Pretty good. Yeah. Here's the thing, right? I was thinking, wouldn't it be

246
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,480
right? This is this is tangentially related. But I was thinking about Google and how search

247
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,560
engines suck and I hate them. And they've never been good for me ever. Because specifically,

248
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
you need to know the words of the thing you're searching for before you can find it.

249
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,880
Ah, right, right. If you don't know the words to use, I mean, this is like a

250
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,680
tangentially related because Google is a computer and computers just work like that,

251
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,920
you need to know the words to use properly in order to like key words and all that.

252
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,400
So if you're looking for something like an image of a character, you already know what the character

253
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,120
is called. That's fine. But it's not searching. It's just like recalling. You're just gaining

254
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,120
like access to something you already know what it is. You type in Princess Peach, you know what

255
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,200
she looks like. You get loads of images of Princess Peach. You have reaffirmed what Princess Peach

256
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,760
looks like. You know, it's it's not learning anything. You're not getting anything. The

257
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,560
problem. And I totally understand this problem. It's like, but what if what you remember is,

258
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,360
I remember there's like a blonde prince or there's a blonde girl with a pink dress and there's like

259
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,400
a blue like you have a visualization, but you can't just communicate that to a computer. You

260
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,840
could type pink dress girl blonde hair. You can you can try you can try you can try really hard

261
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,680
to like get as many vague similar key words. But this is like a it's like a metaphor for this

262
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,560
this lexical impressionist thing is that I think so much in terms of like feelings and

263
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:18,560
emotions and and colors and shapes and like baby gay girl shit that when I go to try and

264
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,840
explain myself, I don't have the necessary words at my disposal to make people understand

265
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,080
anything I'm saying. And it's sort of like it's a brick wall I keep hitting like if in the future

266
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,280
if I could go, hey computer. So there's this like this this thing like and it's like this

267
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,960
and the computer's like oh yes, I understand exactly what you you're looking for. Here's what

268
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,520
it is called is called this is the definition and it's like oh god imagine a world imagine a

269
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,920
Star Trek world where I can go to a computer and the computer can understand me better than a

270
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,880
fucking human being can they can scan into my like fucking neurons and find it like here's all the

271
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,760
neurons here's where they're going this is what this is what this guy is thinking of in a picture

272
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,640
and I'm going to scan the entire internet to find out what it is and tell him I would love that

273
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,120
that's all I want you know what's funny about that that one tiny thing technology like that of

274
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,000
course does exist in Star Trek but like the main community I'm watching Voyager now and the main

275
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,240
communication things they'll say like computer access like all Starfleet records on you know Alpha

276
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,360
Prime planet or whatever give me like the historical context of like Vagundo Braxis the 14th like the

277
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,880
warlord and then they'll be like this man was a blah blah blah and he did XYZ it's all totally

278
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,080
lexical still in like the way that the Federation operates with their computers but then there's

279
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,040
like the weird episodes were like whoa this this alien race is like brain-skinning technology

280
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,600
like we've tried that but it's a little risky it's a little dangerous so I don't know I guess

281
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,880
there's probably there's probably like a lexical bias in the Starfleet way of doing things which is

282
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,360
interesting I mean that's why the show attracts me so much because it's like a big talky word show

283
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,280
or something yeah I mean I do like talky words I think that there was a thing Digi said at one

284
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,400
point in like a stream where he was talking about this neuro typing thing about the idea of the flow

285
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,960
of communication like certain types of people can explain things to other types in like a sort of

286
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,920
sort of swirly pattern or around the chart and so certain types of people are like really good at

287
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,320
communicating ideas like translating ideas from one area to another and I really want to see what

288
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,280
his like flow chart looks like because then if it's if it's accurate it would be handy to like

289
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,560
figure out what sort of people would maybe be able to figure out how to talk to me about things or

290
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,000
how I can explain things to other people and who they would be and I don't know I'm just really

291
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,440
interested in all of this because up until this point like I was saying it's all just been me

292
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,200
hitting my head against a brick wall thinking that I am just a retard that can't function in

293
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,640
society and it may still be the case but at least I have a label now and that's all I need

294
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,920
as I label and now I'm cool now I have an identity and I could cling to it with my claws.

295
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,120
I had an interesting experience to the day it was just a small microcosm of this I was just

296
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,400
watching the anime Dragon Maid is an awesome show and the opening is Aozorano Rhapsody

297
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,120
it's Blue Sky Rhapsody or whatever and it's by this group called Fana or maybe that's the girl

298
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,720
leader name I don't know and I was just like looking over their catalog at some of their

299
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,760
shit and I just like was looking at some of their song names and it's all in like Japanese and

300
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,920
fucking kanji and shit that I don't I don't actually understand or read but like as I was

301
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,640
looking over them I saw a bunch of kanji and I was like oh you know I can't remember how to

302
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,000
pronounce any of these kanji but I know that that is the kanji that represents like the concept of

303
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,840
like girl or woman and so I was I was looking at these like characters not actually knowing how to

304
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,200
pronounce them or say them but I got like a weird it was a weird sensation in my brain of like I got

305
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,200
the feeling of what these words were attempting to convey but not the actual like spoken definitions

306
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,600
of them and I don't know it was like a very impressionistic experience I saw like there was

307
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,400
like woman and like kind of like mother I think and I don't know girl and like school or something

308
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,480
and some of them I recognized outwardly others others I didn't but I knew like the meaning behind

309
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,280
them and I was like I don't know that's like an interest I with letters in general in English

310
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,360
every letter just has a sound and it's only in combination they take on any meaning but with

311
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:40,000
a language like that specific kanji actually means specific concepts sometimes so I don't know

312
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,720
I guess it's just like a a fast of the language that is slightly more impressionistic

313
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,760
I don't know I just thought that was interesting and I enjoyed it there's I thought that was

314
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,160
interesting yeah I thought lots of things were interesting um I that that is kind of an interesting

315
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:03,440
thing though it's like um no one person is entirely one thing or the other everybody can of course

316
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,840
be lexical I mean I'm speaking words that means I can you know parse words in language and get

317
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,320
them out um I can translate somewhat nobody is completely off the edges so that so that they

318
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:23,920
can't do any of the other things it's all I think uh like a a an ease of use how easy is it for you

319
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,240
to think in this particular way that's where you are on the chart when it comes to like getting the

320
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,440
gist I'm very good at that when it comes to explaining what the gist is it takes months

321
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,160
which is why it's so difficult for me to make like analysis videos because I do understand all of

322
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,360
this stuff but it's so hard to get it out it's so hard to get it out like all I would want to do is

323
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,640
like to open my mouth and like the video game would play an entirety out of my mouth that's all

324
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,880
right that would be the perfect translation for me you just play the video game I don't need to

325
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,960
talk about it you should just play and you'll get it but you can't you can't do that you need to

326
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,720
translate it so that people will understand because not everybody thinks like me and that's

327
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,000
that's just the way a lot of things are it makes me think our anime loving audience on this

328
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,280
anime exclusive discussion podcast uh would would would perhaps appreciate this example

329
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:19,840
in hunter hunter there are six different nen usage types that you can use and if you are on one side

330
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,600
of the hexagonal chart or whatever the opposite side you like lose efficiency at when you're

331
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,800
attempting to perform that type of nen stuff whatever so I think if you're like an emitter

332
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,120
which means you like send nen out of your body you can do that at 100 but like I don't know

333
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,040
whatever the opposite is of that manipulation someone's gonna tell me which is wrong or whatever

334
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,240
that's like the opposite type of nen so you're less good at it so it takes more effort for you to do

335
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,440
someone who would naturally be born that way or something like that like a like a yellow slime

336
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,800
way trying to attack a magenta slime way you know exactly it's just not gonna work out it's gonna

337
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,160
take more energy and yeah being yeah you better hope you uh you better hope you um you put some

338
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:08,480
stats into grit let's hope so well you know actually uh as a as a small segue from that I

339
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,320
was thinking how there if you are probably a more lexical kind of guy you'd probably have an easier

340
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,880
time uh with like the the pcp lecture format that uh that we have done and people enjoyed yes true

341
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,480
it's right there in the name indeed indeed it is uh but then again I mean guys like muncher way

342
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,160
impressionistic but then his style is very different when he does it and like wait muncher's not on the

343
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:38,480
chart no oh yeah he's on the top right he's uh he's that uh he's the fucking Kirby he's Kirby there

344
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,520
under devote oh i'm that's munch i missed it lol okay um well thank guys it's just the Kirby like one

345
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,880
of the yeah that's just Kirby uh oh and I was gonna say um uh as a as a segue from that I noticed

346
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,680
I didn't really hear much about this but I saw yesterday streaming apparently on corrupting

347
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,120
your kids I think this is like a May initiative or something ash vampire doing an online digital

348
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,960
bionicle seminar clearly in the style of like the uh the pcp uh lecture series I have not watched

349
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,120
a notification for that yeah yeah I haven't watched it yet but I notice it's scanning through it looks

350
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,000
like the lecture goes for about four hours and I think there's like an hour and a half of questions

351
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,160
at the end there is another um there was an older video from like a con like some at some convention

352
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:34,800
someone held a panel where they basically gave a um a bionicle lore lecture was it pcp inspired at

353
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:41,280
all no no it's older than that okay oh I say I say hold on bionicle I can find it a bionicle

354
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:50,560
panel ah shit videos New York comic con 2012 bionicle panel I always liked the original

355
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,360
bionicle masks and then the soon as they made the second generation they were stupid they were

356
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:03,040
sort of like blood to death yeah I mean I want to I want to check this out and swervy and too much

357
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,880
bells and whistles and it's like it was perfect before just stop stop right now I was never that

358
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,080
into bionicle but I can't help notice that in the comments people are referring to fans of bionicle

359
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:23,440
as bonkelheads and I love that I want to be a bonkelhead myself bonk uh incredible incredible uh

360
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,320
I I hope it's good I haven't checked it out but it seems people have long said that someone should

361
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,760
do a bionicle lecture because the lore is insane but none of us know they're they're already there

362
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
already is one I mean the one yeah you're right you're right if this is the one that I'm thinking

363
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,640
of it's not that long it's only like 40 minutes okay okay I'm sure there could be more but like

364
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:51,440
yeah it's it is a good it's a good idea for a topic there's like a super edgy one guy in there who's

365
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,120
like half demon half angel bionicle and he's the chosen one I I don't know I know there's one guy

366
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,840
that people always bring up as like the bionicle guy that makes this shit it's just pokemon like

367
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:12,000
all of the generations suck except the first one I wonder if you would agree well ash congratulations

368
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and pantsu for hosting or whatever but about the format itself a couple of people were saying like

369
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,720
hey you guys should do like online seminars or you don't have to know there might have been a voicemail

370
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,880
about this you don't have to wait for red foxy socks ketu I think oh yeah okay about don't you

371
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,920
remember don't you remember a voicemail from last week when he said that he had a couple in mind

372
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,880
and he was considering whether to do them online oh that's right I might have added another one this

373
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,920
week that was about a similar kind of thing no no matter but uh and you know I not to say anything

374
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,440
negative but I just think that obviously online you have questions there you got people right there

375
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,320
but having a real live audience is I'm sure you could do it and it would work yeah it would be

376
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,880
different I'll have to check this out I will have to watch at least a bit of this and see how it goes

377
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,680
and uh see there's engagement I mean I don't see any reason why you couldn't just like talk about a

378
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:11,680
thing in a Skype call or whatever just talk about it into a webcam yeah I mean that circle

379
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,440
ask questions as I'm sure it would work it might even be just as good I don't know I wonder how

380
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,960
much I mean this isn't really a credit to us or anything necessarily but like I wonder how much

381
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,760
the victor factor is uh is like uh you know like all the zooms and the pans to interesting things

382
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:35,360
going on oh yeah in terms of like product but I wonder how many people watch the entire thing

383
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,040
that's a great question victor would probably relatively few like the victor factor probably

384
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,440
helps in making it interesting to watch because it's high def and it's not a static shot so

385
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,160
people may end up watching the entire thing because you know that you're sitting down people

386
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,800
are also sitting down you feel like you're sitting down with the people I kind of even feel that

387
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,840
like the fact simply the fact that like there's people together in one place and there's a camera

388
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,240
gives a level of what appears to be like professionalism or like

389
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,480
legitness that like makes people feel like oh I want to be engaged with this this is like a thing

390
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,080
people cared uh I think that like videos that involve more than one person always seem to like

391
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,880
get a a layer of like legitimacy or I don't know cred because like oh I mean if you give the

392
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,160
impression that you're just like a guy talking into a microphone and that's like all there is to it

393
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,680
then yeah it's like you know you might come off as unprofessional or it's like just some guy who

394
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,200
gives a shit what this guy thinks it rad con though when there's organization and a budget behind it

395
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,280
you know you're like these guys are important I if I don't know what these guys are talking about

396
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,200
then I'll be out of the conversation but all that being said though I hate to even put any kind of

397
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,040
negative veneer this is really cool that ash did this with uh with the squad here so I would I

398
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,280
want to check it out and uh Gratz yeah sure hope it went well I don't know I have not watched it

399
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,200
that was interesting I I'm wondering like how good the image of the the whiteboard would be like

400
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,680
could people see it oh there is a link in the description to the whiteboard uh I'm going to

401
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:18,480
oh it's on screen a picture or something yeah here I'm I'll see if I can post it wait a minute

402
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:26,640
the url does and wait did it not work uh I think it's broken guys uh shout out to the

403
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,600
bionicle lecture guys I think your url is broken and it is not taking me where I need to go so uh

404
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,760
maybe check that out uh give that a double check uh oh they they made the amateur oh man I did this

405
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:46,400
myself when I was doing like um url shortners they made the amatoir mistake of they put a like

406
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,400
the short url dot blah blah blah blah but they didn't put the HTTPS which means I as a viewer

407
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,640
now have to copy type in pieces into the url stupid and I'm just telling you you're gonna lose a lot

408
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,560
of people in that process a lot of subscriber yeah it's going down the tubes uh so uh consider

409
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,680
consider editing that and also the it's just broken so uh yeah more to the point that might be more

410
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,640
important it simply doesn't work on the board I can see from here though it says oh my god

411
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:20,720
and even more fascinatingly on the bottom it says how could we have known I wonder what that

412
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,520
is about tantalizing he's setting up the intrigue right away it is good job good job that's good

413
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,840
does anyone remember I guess did either of you play bionicle or with bionicle at all no we might

414
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,320
have had like a couple of the toys all right well for any of the viewers do you remember getting like

415
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,640
in the cereal box like the gamecube sized cd that had like the the fucking small video game about

416
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,520
some of the bionicle characters that was that was that's that's an ancient relic I wish I still had

417
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,160
that that's sick I would love to do that today I had like a open up my had like a amv like of like I

418
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:01,920
think I had the the green guy the the Rui or something but what a new for the modern age I'll

419
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,680
tell you okay Jeff Bezos listened up this one's for free in every amazon package I want a percent

420
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:15,120
chance of getting a disc or a fucking a micro usb that contains a bionicle video game or I don't

421
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,160
know a fucking fortnight whatever the kids are into these days remember get me into a quest

422
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,720
a who could forget checks quest I don't know but I saw the AVGN episode on it I had that shit I

423
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,360
loved that shit I was AVGN's uh what was the verdict um what it was like well yeah it was like

424
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,760
who would have thought that a cereal game was so it would be great whoa yeah it's just like it's

425
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:48,160
just wolfenstein yeah with just doom with checks you can use yeah use brutal doom uh with checks

426
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,760
things and you can use this brutal doom mod yeah it's awesome checks man mod for like doom 2016

427
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,440
or whatever okay wait it can't be 26 oh okay well I assume it mods in checks man like into the game

428
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,640
or something uh yeah that's what I mean just okay make a whole new pack turn all the monsters into

429
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:12,000
new high resolution high poly renderings of the slime creatures did they now whatever those guys are

430
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,520
that's it like id software had like just invented first person shooters basically did they like work

431
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,160
with id like who actually made that game I think no I think the games like the code was just out

432
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,560
there and people were modding they have always been open source as far as I know so that's probably

433
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,640
what it was fascinating it probably just literally is a friggin doom mod yeah probably

434
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,120
true yeah I think it definitely is that yeah that's so cool uh awesome I I like hey what if we made

435
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,720

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:52,240
how to change my brain so I do things it's it's so shit like I I know that like being unproductive

446
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,000
makes me depressed yeah and being depressed makes me want to not do anything it's a it's a vicious

447
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,040
cycle yeah that I'm caught in and I know it but you know vicious black hole yeah I've been in the

448
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,080
vicious cycle of of lack of exercise last while I did an exercise yesterday I feel great of course

449
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,560
whenever you accomplish something you do something I keep thinking right start exercising again for

450
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,600
its mood boosting properties if nothing else that's like yeah one of the one of the great things

451
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,760
about it I've been doing yoga in the morning feel great exercise at night while I did like once

452
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,360
gotta get the pattern going uh yeah once is enough it takes energy it just takes energy

453
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,960
so I'm predisposed to just not want to and it's boring and sucks but I shall endeavor I shall

454
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,200
endeavor to uh to improve and grow and change fortunately I have infinite energy for um tending

455
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,040
roses and animal crossing uh relatable I now have like I have like eight black ones now nice and two

456
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,960
purples oh and I keep getting these fucking pinks and I hate them I don't want them

457
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,040
fucking keep them anyway plant them around your gay neighbors to the pink the rowdy the rowdy roses

458
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,400
just keep sprouting up when I don't want them just keep around invading my my space no matter how

459
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:14,800
many times you claim all districts they just pop back up damn it we have to we have to answer the

460
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,200
the rowdy question we have to find the final solution and destroy their fun house we what are

461
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,960
you the whole game the whole all of endless war is about trying to solve the rowdy the rq but we

462
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:33,840
haven't done it yet one day the bq the bust a question hello there man oh you know I've been

463
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,680
getting really funny like using like the the the bad word in like a term that is supposed to be like

464
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:47,120
softening the blow like who it's great we uh no I uh I've been getting a series of questions on

465
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,600
like whoa from the one piece lecture like whoa because the the buster call like whoa what's

466
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,760
with the hard art like what what was that about am I missing something oh yeah I saw the ball

467
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,080
I've seen a bunch of we got I mean obviously we got that on the buster cast as well of course

468
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,400
guys it's an old word please it's been around yeah you should understand why is the buster call

469
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,200
called the buster call I feel like because it busts all the people I I feel like gun buster die buster

470
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,000
and the buster call I don't know does that word have like some connotation in Japanese it's probably

471
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,440
sounds cool yes one of those things like they it's a hey buster you and they hear it in an American

472
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:35,120
TV show or movie and they're like haha yes but like you like we we don't call things that

473
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:41,200
like no nobody's ever I don't know it just seems like a name like an English name that an American

474
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,000
thing would never be called so I have to wonder like that's definitely true why does it pop up

475
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,520
here and there I think that unexpected places in other languages particularly Japanese which we

476
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,120
hear a lot of people who watch anime and play video games and shit uh I think they just like don't

477
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,080
have I don't know the same kind of like thought process we have when we hear like a word in English

478
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:08,080
and they they really do just lean on what kind of just sounds the coolest and yeah you know I mean

479
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:13,600
the buster call in one piece it is in fact a phone call that is made yeah five admiral five

480
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:20,080
vice admirals and they come in and they bust the place up with cannons and stuff so okay understandable

481
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,560
gun but you know I think there is a reason why I don't know about gun buster I think that one was

482
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,480
just called that because it was cool I think die buster has a meaning but I forget what it is I

483
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,160
think I looked it up one time it's when you get shot with a gun you die right isn't a die butsu

484
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,720
the like buda statue yes it is like diamonds die means great oh my god that's obviously what it is

485
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,040
why am I a fucking idiot yes that's okay I don't know that for sure but die does mean big so it's

486
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,200
just the it's really big I think I think it's just a sort of anglicization of them calling it the die

487
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,920
buster as in the great buster or whatever like a bigger version I will give a slight my suspicion

488
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,880
sure sure while gun buster being called gun buster is wholly appropriate and makes every

489
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,320
totally makes sense and it's thematically you know obviously the right way I don't know about

490
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,360
like it still seems random it still seems like they just picked a word oh well I put on the front

491
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:22,480
that's not like the show is about guns well no no I mean it's a robot that is the most important

492
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,480
robot ever that happens to be called gun buster so it makes sense yes they should know why but why

493
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,600
is it called run buster why that name it doesn't bust guns I don't know it has a gun and it busts

494
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,520
it's not it's not a critique of when I think about both things when I think about the gun buster the

495
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,560
titular gun buster yeah what I imagine it doing I would not describe as busting per se I don't know

496
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,000
does make you feel good though all I'm yeah true all I'm saying is I would be interested to perhaps see

497
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,720
like a like a breakdown maybe or maybe a list of like usage of that word in anime and see if there's

498
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,960
like some sort of like genesis point where like it started just comes from ghost busters that maybe

499
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,960
just come from fucking ghost busters maybe maybe but I bet you could at least get Amino to comment

500
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,000
on where he assuming he's the one who came up with the name um I there's some information about

501
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that somewhere yeah please do um but I was gonna say I have always thought that while ghost ghost

502
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,960
buster was 1984 gun buster was 1988 88 okay that's plenty of time that's plenty of time for uh you

503
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,920
know you know I thinking about it that is the obvious answer isn't it like the the phrase the word

504
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,400
buster surely like it ghost busters must be the thing oh and of course we should forget

505
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,720
the actual Japanese name of the show is aim for the top gun buster uh or is it just aim for the top

506
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,880
I can't remember aim for maybe maybe they maybe means aim for the top gun buster I either way

507
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,680
in Japanese the robot is still called the gun buster yes certainly true certainly true I was

508
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,640
gonna say I've always thought the the the second show is called die buster I don't even know if

509
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,000
they say the word die buster in the show I think they definitely don't they don't okay and you just

510
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,240
watched it uh they so they don't even say well I don't think so I couldn't infer okay there's no

511
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,400
there's no robot called the die buster I well I think the die buster is the really big Noriko

512
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,080
mech that shows up in the last episode to do oh that stuff I pretty sure that's the die buster

513
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,680
you know what I think you're right right and I'm wrong and that is like the great version the die

514
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,880
version of the gun buster is this ultimate you know conglomerate and that's fine and that's

515
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,840
fine I'm just gonna say I just wanted to say I always wanted to say about that that in gun buster

516
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,600
gun buster is central to like everything that happens so that's cool die buster sure in the

517
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,800
final battle it's relevant it should have been called like I don't know no no gun buster because

518
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,040
it's all about no no no no is so much more important than the die buster itself and it always seemed

519
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:10,960
stupid and dumb I mean I think they probably use the name for name recognition I'm sure I mean

520
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,720
you're right it's the die the top two aka die buster which is the bigger one I think you could

521
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,120
make a case that the gun buster is not really that central to the story of gun I mean it's there

522
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,640
well hey every every story is just about men in conflict with himself no so sure yeah it's true

523
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,080
that the die buster only appears in like one episode mm-hmm and was gay doesn't even look cool

524
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,320
who gives a shit the other men are so much cooler in die buster but the gun buster the gun there's

525
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,520
not really anything special about the gun like all it is is just a bigger robot basically yes that

526
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,720
just is better at fighting the aliens that the other robots were less good at fighting what can

527
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,880
episode two of the buster cast everybody and also also I think it is actually made up of many little

528
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:02,160
buster machines as I recall which I think I think all those little guys the die buster yeah yeah yeah

529
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,320
yeah yeah yeah the die buster is it's made up of the um the like planetary defense robots which I think

530
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,760
are buster machines because that is a specific thing in I believe they no they are maybe collectively

531
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,840
they are one buster machine together yes they are all they are all part of um gun buster number seven

532
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,720
which which is no no no no no is buster number seven and all of those planetary defense like

533
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,160
droids are like a part of her oh you're making me I mean I do wish I had kind of spent the time to

534
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,320
watch the show if for no other reason now I have not to be on the buster cast just to re-experience

535
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:40,160
one of the greatest anime ever made die buster it's so good hey guys they are unbelievably good

536
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,320
hey audience if you want to hear more about die buster gun buster go listen to the buster cast

537
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:50,000
it's me and Tom we got a lot of things wrong uh you can get mad like I said I said in it that I

538
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,800
thought that it was um Anna was first to directorial role which is wrong oh yeah they're enough oh my

539
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,480
god remember I think it's episode three of die buster where uh like the girl the mean girl with

540
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,920
the blue hair has her little arc and she gets the buster and no no selfishly gives up her buster

541
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,880
machine so that that girl can pilot one instead and she fucking does that amazing like negative

542
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:20,240
170 trillion like ice beam blast or whatever yes it makes it makes it snow on uh on the music

543
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,920
plays oh the fucking ending theme song that plays as that shit goes down oh god it's so good it's the

544
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,800
best show ever made groovy magic groovy magic is the greatest opening of all time except for it is

545
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,520
gurren logins but that's me hype every friggin time you know what's funny when I when I first

546
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,720
met Michelle and we were talking about anime and stuff and I was just like hey you know this one

547
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,680
grooving magic and Michelle's like I know this one and I was like whoa you've seen die buster

548
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,040
she's like no I was like what what she had like heard it on like Japanese radio or like Hawaiian

549
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,320
radio or some stupid normie shit well that if you live in Hawaii I guess you hear more of I'm a

550
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,040
little surprised but I'm glad round table is a popular group I guess it's a good song and it does

551
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:08,400
so so oh was it not made for the show I believe that it was but uh I assume it also made the rounds

552
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:15,120
elsewhere I guess why wouldn't you know I don't know if it's a good song yeah and it was a good song

553
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:21,360
god that's not so fucking fuck yeah I don't know all right well there you go anything else to say

554
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,400
about gun buster um I love it it's good obviously the ending of gun buster is kind of like the most

555
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,960
amazing thing that's ever happened in the history of anime but overall I'm saying it again I like

556
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,960
die buster we talked we talked about it I like the ending of die buster better because of how it

557
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,040
relates to the yeah because that's certainly understandable it is when you when you realize

558
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:47,920
the connection you go whoa it's just it's that other thing I you know couldn't agree more oh but

559
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,920
that ending of gun buster is so legendary because it is you know it is it is damn I mean die buster

560
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,040
would be nothing without gun but it wouldn't be nothing at the end of die buster after all the

561
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,960
sacrifice uh I forget like lark lark is gonna be there to continue the legacy and to do the thing

562
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:11,520
that no no always wanted to do but you didn't get the chance she didn't get the chance he's gonna

563
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:19,200
help her live her legacy oh god buster it's too good hey cool it I'm sorry oh are you excited for

564
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:27,600
uh uh aim for the top three big buster I can't wait David buster please call it big buster right

565
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:33,840
buster the last thing I want to say about die buster is it is weird how much it is just fully

566
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,400
cooly sometimes yes it is like sometimes it just looks exactly like fully cool like they just

567
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,560
like it's almost like they traced it it's almost like sometimes they just traced scenes from fully

568
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,200
cooly and put new characters in them I believe it was made I want to say two years after fully

569
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,760
cooly if I remember correct yeah something like that I think it was like 2002 it looks it looks and

570
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,360
feels very similar a lot of the time which for me is great right it's awesome I love that yeah it's

571
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:03,360
great it's a it's probably a better sequel to fully cooly than the fully cooly sequels are

572
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,960
have you watched either of those which I have not seen them now then I'm sure that you that is

573
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:14,080
true uh I have no doubt everybody hates them I don't want to watch them I have not seen them but

574
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:20,560
I'm not interested um by the way that wasn't a joke aim for the top three was announced to be

575
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:26,720
worked on uh a while ago I don't know if you were aware of that uh no they but the weird it is

576
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,160
absolutely in developer hell it was announced like several years ago and there has been exactly

577
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,760
zero updates since that time so I I hope they literally just let it go and they just don't do

578
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:45,280
it um let it maybe maybe let it die let it die hard to imagine them improving on what they've

579
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,320
already got you know what they'd fucking do they'd fucking bring in the like your name guy or you

580
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,760
know whatever that and they have that guy do his vision no is that you yeah yeah that's my

581
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,080
masaki usa I believe I think um I don't know you're so good everything he does is great guys

582
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,720
that's like letting nomura direct funnel fancy seven again wasn't that a great idea I mean it was

583
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,960
part of the original team how what could go wrong isn't masaki usa really good or you think it's

584
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,840
someone else wait I'm thinking of the wrong person wait masaki is the pink one guy uh and yeah he did

585
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,760
that yeah okay fuck you guys know he's like the most popular anime man right now whatever the

586
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:31,920
fuck his name is your name uh yeah garden words I think uh Garfield this is Garfield yeah Jim Davis

587
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,640
right yeah um love him Jimu Davis hey I'm sorry did I tell you guys I might have already said this

588
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,240
did I tell you my discovery that uh in reading the most recent one piece SPS it turns out that

589
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:51,440
Neko Mamushi the big cat his favorite food is lasagna uh no it's it's canon yeah that's true

590
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:58,240
that's amazing it's obviously a Garfield reference and like the other the dog Inu Inu Arashi

591
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,680
Inu Arashi loves bones which isn't odyspecific but based on his ear shape and his general coloring

592
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,800
I think it's fair to say they are inspired by Garfield so wait wait hang on does that mean like

593
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,640
who who is who is um who is what's Odin or uh Momonosuke no no the uh what's the guy's guy's

594
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:25,600
name in Gar Garfield the John John who is John it's gotta be is that oh guys from the guys from

595
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:31,200
the animal island from the elephant that's right yeah that's right oh god who's the John who's the

596
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:38,000
John to these guys I guess Odin it's gotta be Odin it's gotta be Odin now where could my sword be

597
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,400
you haven't met him yet he shows been one but he's Momonosuke's dad um okay yeah he's like

598
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,880
he got a flashback with him later and stuff we always he's like he's like the old king or

599
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,160
something who was like he was the old emperor he was not the shogun but he's like the old ruler

600
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,880
who was like too nice and wanted to open his borders yeah yeah that's correct that's something

601
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,720
happened I don't he got assassinated or something yeah he was killed yeah yeah yeah you spoiled it

602
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,040
but we we already know that god damn it that's that's ancient ass history that's set up for the

603
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:16,960
one or it is did you know Japan exists what I hate that Ben have you you've seen big mom's

604
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,200
flashback already right Odin is just Odin is just Bernie Sanders and like Bernie gets buried

605
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,080
because he's too good but he was too good for this world that does happen to him basically

606
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:34,240
but uh what was I gonna say oh all right you so you already saw uh big mom's flashback of course

607
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,040
during during hulking out and whatnot but did you also Ben get the same sense of

608
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:44,720
what the fuck is that when for exactly one panel okay there's a there's a lot of things I think we

609
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:51,440
did talk about like she ate her friends no no no there's that which is amazing but not right now

610
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,440
do I want to talk about that I want to talk about how uh big mom was on Elba is where her

611
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,360
like orphanage was and for exactly one panel you can see that there's like an island there and you

612
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:10,080
sit at the house but directly to the right there is some sort of gigantic mountain or cliff face

613
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:16,000
or something that looks bigger than like anything we've seen in the entire series thus far and I

614
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,440
want to know what the fuck that thing is do you have Elba I don't yeah you're gonna have to show me

615
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:29,200
a screenshot or something Elba island let me see I bet it did read this part but I don't remember

616
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,240
yeah okay here boom from the anime I gotta fucking catch it I'm only like 40 chapters behind

617
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,600
I gotta just catch up make like a tomato yeah look at this there's like the ship pulling up

618
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,960
that you can see the house and just for size comparison you can see that is a giant mountain

619
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:51,600
and then there's that thing oh my god yeah what is that is that yiggers soul is that what that would

620
00:54:51,600 --> 00:55:01,600
be maybe maybe it is the world tree or like Adam tree maybe oh yeah so that is that is Elba right

621
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,440
this is yes this has stayed to be on Elba this is the only image we've like ever seen of it

622
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,400
shit maybe that is a tree it doesn't look like bark oh yeah you know in the in the manga it's a bit

623
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,080
more obvious that it's probably a tree oh my god that that it sort of goes outwards I never noticed

624
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:24,480
that going outward until right now shit that probably is a tree cool it it looks like it might be

625
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,400
a tree I don't know is there supposed to be like some kind of super tree I mean I feel like with

626
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,120
Elba is Norse and we all know Norse mythology has yiggers ill the world tree and whatnot so

627
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,880
damn sounds I just learned that at this very moment how godmother caramel was incredibly

628
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,080
hot when she was young and had like an amazing arc with big mom wait awesome you know mother

629
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:52,480
caramel oh oh caramel yes yeah yeah yeah yeah she smoked that was sick good stuff hey smoke she

630
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,400
someone updates that old image someone update that old image of all the smokers in one piece

631
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,400
and please put mother carabelle as a young hot self on that smoking looks so cool it sure does

632
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,080
like in manga and stuff it sure does fucking base spike spiegel got me got me on the train

633
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:16,400
back in the day cool base um let me see uh was that gonna bring up something else there was a smoke

634
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,960
that like burned for the same amount of time and looked exactly the same and was not bad for you

635
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:29,520
like could could that not be fabricated ben ben takes a hit of his vape damn if only there

636
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,000
were something like that no that's that's a metal thing I want to like a piece of paper that could

637
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,360
light like half of the coolness of the cigarette is the burning you need the fire there you need

638
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:44,880
the lighter you can get the vapor at least when you exhale which is uh which is something I suppose

639
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,120
it's it's a different flavor it's a different feeling it's certainly cool in its own way but

640
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:54,640
it's not one is far more so do you want to go for like the cowboy cowboy bebop jazz aesthetic or do

641
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:00,560
you want to go for like the techno futurey uh you know vape I like I like the jazz you want to

642
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,640
look like a bounty hunter from the future you go with the vape indeed that's true that's true

643
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:12,240
hmm but the real cool guys just use a lighter on their vape they burn it down every time

644
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,480
hey uh I just wanted to say in my ongoing struggle uh between the duality of man lexical and

645
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:26,560
impressionism um I've been uh watching factorial speed runs there is nothing in this world more

646
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:34,560
like a fucking spreadsheet uh or like lexically minded than a factorial speed run I I'm I'm not

647
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,760
sure it's like lexical because like lexical you're right I'm using the word very loose it's definitely

648
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:46,320
linear there's there's either the the lateral or the linear I think factorial might be more of a

649
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:51,280
lateral thing because you have to think of so many steps ahead um I know it shouldn't be the most

650
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,120
efficient well the way that I think it's it probably just boils down to math at the end of

651
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:02,480
the day there's probably just like a mathematically optimal ladies and gentlemen ben and gib I invite

652
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:09,600
you to enjoy this experience with me one of these days on this factorial speed run quest and the thing

653
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:16,320
is this man uh shout out to my boy nephrums the current world record holder for both any percent

654
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:23,680
and 100 completion on factorial speed runs um he's down to sub two hours now baby I want to be

655
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:29,680
the summoning salt to make the fucking legacy of the my boy nephrums killing the game at factorial

656
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,120
how many how many views does this have like this is this one is the world record 10 000 the guys

657
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:40,160
got only less than five k subs but like this is what he does my favorite thing and not my favorite

658
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,120
thing but something I really like is when I watch like a summoning salt video he'll talk about like

659
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,880
these people who are like these people that like loom large in the speed running can be like this

660
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,040
person like basically invented the way it's like everybody knows this guy this guy's like a legendary

661
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:59,280
speedrunner he'll show like a screenshot of his youtube channel it's like no avatar 2.5 k subs

662
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:07,360
are you like 700 subs I kind of love it's got it's got a real like like um like secret like um uh

663
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:13,120
what's the word it's a certain type of aesthetic that's sort of obscure but like you know you walk

664
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,080
into a bar and like there's people that you don't know are like super genius badasses in their

665
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,240
community and you're just sort of like oh i'm stupid I don't know and then and then later you

666
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:29,920
realize and you're like I was talking to that guy that's true every human is a is a a series of

667
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,840
mysteries and accomplishments that you can't know so like like this this video like revolutionized

668
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,320
the uh the the mario sunshine speedrunning community he shows a screenshot it's got like

669
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:46,320
150 views yes but but to the people who care it's like such a big deal I mean how many people go

670
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:51,280
and read those like uh like I don't know you got like a youtube uh video by someone like a million

671
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,200
subs like a news guy about like how you know like youtube has just changed its policy and it's gonna

672
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,440
ruin everybody uh you know whatever no no no I don't give a shit if that's true or not but he

673
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,480
makes a video like that and then like the actual like document that youtube published about this

674
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,080
will have like 100 views like like barely anybody actually read the source material

675
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:14,240
which of course is how it works and I understand why you know you know what's cool about it it's

676
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:21,360
it's like um it gives validity to it like like the story is real because nobody knows about this

677
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:26,720
thing like imagine yeah imagine how boring and lame it would be um if somebody was talking about like

678
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:32,000
the most influential song of an age and then they link to gangnam style it's like yeah yeah yeah

679
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,040
everyone's heard of that that's a big song who cares it's it's not special I think I think it's a

680
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:43,600
lot of um I don't know but thinking about when it comes to like the ff7 remake and whatnot I've

681
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,320
been thinking a lot about and I think I'm definitely going to address this in some way like uh what do

682
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:54,480
people really mean by soul versus soulless and whatnot and in short what the fuck are you talking

683
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,200
about these are common terms these are common terminology that's used to describe like old

684
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,920
versus new games and how people feel about them and why they feel like something is weird and

685
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,440
different about about new game styles and I what it really comes down to the short version is like

686
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,960
when for example in final fantasy seven the original they had these blocky models and like every

687
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:22,640
everything they did like every unique okay here's a here's a perfect uh uh idea of what soul is for

688
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:28,560
specifically only the final battle of cloud versus sephiroth at the very end where it's like the

689
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:33,600
battle within clouds mind to rid himself of the final traces of sephiroth where it's got super

690
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:38,160
sexy shirtless sephiroth and he does omni slash even if you haven't learned the limit oh my god

691
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:45,520
like the most kino battle of all time for that specific battle they made updated new better

692
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:52,400
looking 3d models of both cloud and sephiroth just for that one battle because they knew that they

693
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,360
wanted to like focus and more on of them have like cinematic camera angles and stuff happen there

694
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:04,320
like that is pure soul the effort they put in to like enhance that experience uh you know like for

695
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:10,240
the viewing public and stuff by doing extra work or like in an old like 8-bit game or a 16-bit

696
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:16,000
adding extra sprites just for like one little scene that the developers want to do all that

697
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,320
feels like soul as opposed to what feels soulless by comparison is just for example I think most

698
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,120
people would agree on this in ff7 remake you got a lot of characters who have like little

699
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,280
little side stories little arcs they're doing on the side and little like side missions you got to

700
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:38,080
do but the thing is all those characters look like generic fallout wastelanders who are just like

701
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:42,960
they look like unity assets that have just been imported and they do not feel special or unique

702
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,160
especially in comparison to like the main crew which are very colorful and beautiful yeah um

703
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,720
that distinction is really clear in stuff like that I think I think with things like

704
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:59,520
that it's like the the decision to make a whole model is a big deal because of how much I mean

705
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:06,560
Final Fantasy was already on three discs um yep there's so much space required to do those things

706
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:11,440
but like nowadays the the hardware limitations basically don't exist you can do it right in

707
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:17,120
anything the graphical capabilities of the PlayStation 4 are phenomenal and um games can

708
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:24,400
look incredible and there's like there's almost no excuse for not having everything

709
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,520
possible yes yeah and so like we feel that we feel that I think it just sort of feels

710
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,480
and it's like an unfortunate it it's impossible for something to feel

711
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:40,160
soulful because you can't you can't get a sense of how hard they're working to make something

712
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,480
happen I think it's nobody's fault but I think that kind of is the reality yeah what I thought

713
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,720
you were gonna say Nate was like okay so like yeah they made these updated like higher res models

714
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,640
just for this one moment so you get this moment of like whoa we've ramped it up but like yeah on

715
01:03:54,640 --> 01:04:00,000
like a new like a triple A game or whatever like everything is fully rendered everything is like

716
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,240
fully realized and fleshed out because the budget is enormous you know they're they do that with

717
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:09,520
everything so there's no like moment wherein you go oh whoa they really they ramped it up for this one

718
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:14,240
what it's all because it's because the fucking processors are blasting it 100% all the time

719
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,280
I think when people say soul I think what like when I think of what that term means really it's like

720
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,080
I'm playing this game and I when I see something like I'm playing Final Fantasy 6 or something I

721
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:29,360
don't know and I see the like the sprite of Terra like there's that one famous sprite of Terra

722
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:34,080
going like blah and like kind of like spazzing out like in like embarrassment or surprise

723
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:40,000
or something like that and sure that that gets used a bunch but like they could have

724
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,840
done something far simpler you know what that's actually a bad example but what I'm trying to

725
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:49,920
convey is the the emotion of feeling the developer like despite all the limitations that existed for

726
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,800
them in the context they were making it you can feel them going above and beyond and the problem

727
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,720
is exactly what you were saying the context these days has changed where it now just feels it like

728
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,120
there is an expectation that everything will it look at least a certain level of quality and a

729
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:12,240
certain level of amazingness and stuff so um yeah I mean I mean there's still like potential for that

730
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:17,120
feeling if you know that the person is an indie developer and they make something oh yeah no doubt

731
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:23,280
so like I absolutely do you think do you think large budget triple a big things are impossible

732
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:29,200
to feel soulful I would say it's it's gonna be way harder it's not impossible but yeah what would it

733
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,560
take is the question art from adversity and a triple a budget a triple a title with a triple a

734
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,600
budget faces less adversity you know what I mean that's definitely true I don't know I'm trying to

735
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:44,480
think of an example of something I have played oh I got it I got it I know exactly what it is or

736
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,000
this is one example love like Dark Souls 3 and that's like a you know I love that game too it's a

737
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,960
triple a game is so much it looks beautiful and it's like a lot of soul like would that you know

738
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,360
I don't think I would I would argue that have you seen it have you seen that Matthew Matosa's

739
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:04,640
video where he talks about the lost souls how about that he talks talks about one is the one

740
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:10,400
people generally think is is the most soulful and I guess at the time you could say that I was a triple a

741
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:18,000
it wasn't a triple a it was it was gone the cusp they were like they had a they had a success in

742
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,520
Demon Souls and they that was the first actually big game Dark Souls I think a lot of it was that

743
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:29,120
like expectations really were like low like Dark Souls is where things really exploded and like

744
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,840
that game for many reasons that maybe people have made a million video essays about no one expected

745
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:40,960
that game to have as much like depth and I don't know cool game design stuff going on so that's

746
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:47,360
not exactly soul but it was just like good and like soul soul would be for example in Dark Souls

747
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:53,920
the fact that Ash Lake even exists in as hidden a place as this you know what that shows me that

748
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:00,400
shows me those developers were willing to make an entire huge awesome section of the game they're

749
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,680
willing to make it sculpted populated with characters unique NPCs an entire like the dragon

750
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,560
quest line or whatever they were willing to say you know what many characters are just many players

751
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:15,120
are just not going to find this and you know we're okay with that we don't need everything we've done

752
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,600
to be thrust in the face of every developer of every player and we were comfortable with that

753
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:24,000
because we're confident that the game will be better for this being a mystery for many players

754
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,960
because mystery was a big important part of much of Dark Souls early life it's it's better when

755
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,800
yeah there's things that not everyone even even knowing what it is before you play it for the

756
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:40,640
first time because I the first time I experienced Dark Souls was watching the digi bros play through

757
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,960
and so I learned about Ash Lake through them doing it talking about and playing it and even

758
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:53,440
knowing that it was there it still feels incredible to go there it does it really does just the just

759
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,000
the fact that you know the knowledge that the developers put it in there and didn't tell anyone

760
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,640
just because the knowledge is now out doesn't mean that that that is different and so it still

761
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:08,000
feels soulful in that way knowledge of the context is important and I think we're all pretty I think

762
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,960
we're all pretty aware of that but by the way a modern to be fair a modern example of modern day

763
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:18,480
soul easy one like okay this isn't this isn't the most soulful thing ever because as you'll see

764
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:24,000
like you have to pay extra money for it and like the game itself was lacking in many ways but

765
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,520
the remind dlc of kingdom arts 3 much of the dlc has horrible cutscenes the final fantasy characters

766
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:36,560
are shitty but the boss fights themselves are soulful as hell most of them not not all of them

767
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:44,400
are amazing the the my favorite part so far the marluxia data battle fight in kingdom arts 3

768
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:52,160
is so fucking soulful uh it's got all these references to like old marluxia fights throughout

769
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:59,040
history it's got this new remix of the fucking lord of the castle theme from uh chain of memories

770
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:05,280
that fight is so good and I I just love replaying it because it not only is it is a challenging

771
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:11,040
gameplay experience I just feel like saturated in the classic kingdom art stuff that I love

772
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:17,760
while being challenged by the game I I cannot get enough of it it's so good uh but and you can

773
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,840
contrast that with other fights that I feel in the data you know remind ones that are

774
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:26,640
significantly less soulful faithfully recreated a lot of the time but unfortunately recreated

775
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:32,800
from games that aren't as good you've given examples yeah what could you define in words

776
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:40,000
the what it means to have soul in a game yes it's kind of it's kind of a calculation I would

777
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:47,200
argue it's like effort put in like extra effort beyond what would be just the bare bones need

778
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:53,680
to like convey the idea across like over like technical limitations that existed at the time

779
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,000
so like everything's going to be like a degree of how much it is relative to like the context it

780
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,440
was in what technology was available and like your your savvy gamer should or you know consumer of

781
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:08,560
any media should be able to tell uh like what was there you know this reminds me of someone in my

782
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,440
stream yesterday said this was a Sam Hyde quote uh I don't know from what and I would actually love

783
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,840
to find it if anybody knows but it was just something like when developers in the old days

784
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:23,440
or when when like artists only had oil paints to paint with they like weren't distracted by

785
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,360
I don't know like fan expectations okay maybe that wasn't quite true but like miscellaneous stuff

786
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,840
they had they had their they had their patrons they had their rich Italian family they did they

787
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,080
didn't have to please those people but please the king or whatever they weren't distracted by

788
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:44,880
things like you know I don't know like should I put like a QTE in to that would break up the flow

789
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,840
of this segment of the game here I don't know just like an example of they had very limited tools

790
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:55,600
so it had to stand on just how good is your oil painting technique whereas with modern games I would

791
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,800
just argue that there's tons of things that you can put in as a distraction and I don't think

792
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:06,640
distractions from like the main pieces of the game aren't are always a good idea FF7 original had

793
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:13,360
tons of minigames but those minigames given the context of the time and place felt insanely soulful

794
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,400
out of nowhere in Final Fantasy 7 you're suddenly on a motorcycle chase that was like inconceivable

795
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,720
that would be in a game of this type at that's out of nowhere you're doing a fucking snowboarding

796
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:26,640
mission which is like my favorite part of the fucking game that you're just snowboarding out of

797
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:32,240
nowhere that's soul and it's all about the time and you can play him again in the gold saucer yeah

798
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:37,600
you can it's amazing it's amazing all right given that then I think something that would be a triple

799
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:43,680
a soulful experience yeah would be for a game to not have tons of miscellaneous side quests

800
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,160
and for it to be relatively short and sweet and good all the way through

801
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,480
that would be that would be a thing that is like a bad monetary decision you want your game to last

802
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,280
for 50 60 70 hours and you have what you want it to have like tons of collectibles that don't mean

803
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,280
anything tons of side characters that don't mean anything that don't have any like rich

804
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,480
character they just sort of say a few lines and they have a like please do this for me

805
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:13,360
like a game that comes out in the modern day that doesn't have all of the bullshit things that

806
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,920
modern games are expected to have would be a soulful moment I would respect that in a game yeah

807
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:24,320
yeah and you know like really tightly focused on you know telling the story I can imagine in my head

808
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,880
like if they were ff7 suffers from this to a degree the remake does but like for example

809
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:35,840
chrono trigger amazing game one of the greatest rpgs ever made that game is packed to the gills

810
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:41,600
with side quests but all those side quests are insanely soulful look I mean some are better

811
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:47,440
than others but like the fact like that game is basically modular you decide at what point you

812
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,520
want to fight lavos you decide how many party members you want to do it with you can even

813
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:58,880
decide if you want to ff7 revive chrono when he ff7 dies those side quests are insanely soulful

814
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:04,560
because they all tie directly into the plot give you components that like make the game

815
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,840
like you get like frogs final weapon they tangibly improve your experience of the game

816
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:15,440
they play with the main mechanics of the game and they do not feel like a waste of time because the

817
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,640
whole game is set up such that you are in control of time travel so like doing side missions would

818
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,600
not interrupt like anything you're doing I suppose it could have a few I think it's just like there's

819
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:32,720
a balance to strike where as soon as you feel like something could be copy pasted like a character

820
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:40,480
model or you know a mission seems very similar to another one and the rewards are like you know

821
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:48,080
crafting materials as opposed to like interesting story progression and you know things that move

822
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:56,560
the main story forward yep as long as it feels like I don't know it's hard to it's hard to figure

823
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,960
out exactly where that balance would be that's that's true and you know here's another soulful

824
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:05,600
moment just of history uh yes this was there they were a big studio very successful at this point

825
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:12,000
but but simply Square Enix putting in the entire opera scene from Final Fantasy 6 giving sellies

826
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,600
like the Maria costume like a full new sprite sheet set and making her like sing like this was

827
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:23,040
revolutionary this has never been done before and like a sprite based game insanely soulful in

828
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:27,600
off the chart soul in that whole section which is why it's regarded as like one of the most amazing

829
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:34,320
moments of all time but I mean now like if you just separate context you can look back in Final

830
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,680
Fantasy 6 and be like eh graphics aren't even that good man graphics like okay yes sure they're not

831
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:44,880
even that good because it was made like 20 fucking years ago or like 25 years ago more than that yeah

832
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:51,280
yeah almost 30 I think at this point and um it's like you gotta keep a lot of people these days

833
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:57,680
really seem to want to strip context out of everything and I think that's a bad I especially

834
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:02,160
there's a lot of people who want to defend the remake and I understand there are perfectly valid

835
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:07,440
remake like reasons to defend the remake on all kinds of points I would simply want them to just

836
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:12,720
remember the context of the original I think it's important and when you've got a remake you cannot

837
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:18,160
avoid being latched to the original because you call it a remake you didn't call it Final Fantasy 7

838
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:22,080
2 or anything like that you call it a remake and where does a bunch of meetings but okay I don't

839
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,520
want to get a whole thing about about the remake but hey Nate did you see my video about Final Fantasy

840
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,640
7 thoughts I did I did um forgive me I forget exactly what you said you want you want to recap

841
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,640
it for me real quick no I forget what exactly what I said as well it doesn't matter I remember

842
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,520
that there were some things that slightly disagreed with my opinion and that made me insanely angry

843
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:47,360
as all opinions that don't 100% adhere with mine do uh I'm exaggerating I think I had some

844
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,480
slight differences but I think your point was overall I think my point was like

845
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:03,280
you know there's always this this idea that the original you know needs to be preserved because

846
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:09,680
it's good and I want it to be something that other people in the future can play and a remake

847
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:18,080
sometimes at the argument not necessarily the argument you make is that it can obfuscate the

848
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:24,000
original by being the one that people play instead and if it's slightly wrong then that's

849
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,280
unfortunate because the better experience is being lost and not everyone's gonna play the original

850
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:37,120
and it's it's it's it's unfortunate and I was just thinking like could it even be is is the idea that

851
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:43,120
you could play Final Fantasy 7 today even feasible and still enjoy it in the same way and that was

852
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:49,360
just sort of like a thought process thing that is that's a good question I would emphatically

853
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:56,880
argue the answer that question is 100 yes uh but some people might disagree um yeah it's really

854
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,880
just sort of raising the point that like yeah there are a lot of more there are a lot more context

855
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:07,520
things that go into the enjoyment of anything um like the year it came out compared to all the

856
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,920
other things that were coming out how many how much revolutionary it is doesn't matter anymore because

857
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:17,120
things have come out since and now those moments aren't going to be as mind-blowing

858
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,440
to people who are experiencing it so it's like it's going to be a different experience no matter

859
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:26,560
what you do well that's true I would definitely say that like Final Fantasy 7 is a great game

860
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:32,160
to play now because I played it not too long ago for the first time and it was good yeah yeah uh

861
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,280
yeah I mean if you can do that I would argue a lot of people can too by the way my favorite thing

862
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:40,240
about that video by far is your artwork uh uh on the the main thumbnail everyone should go

863
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:46,560
look at it why is why is Tifa so hot it's just how it is man look at her uh oh I really like

864
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,680
your tron I gotta call the ethics department those bazoingas are are offending me they're far too

865
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:58,000
large but I like that's it that's what I like about them yeah I was just I was just sort of

866
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,960
scribbling doodling I drew the cloud and I was like haha it is great you know what I like how you

867
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:09,760
are um erasing the only um person of color in the cast by putting him in the bottom right corner

868
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,800
where the timer will appear directly I didn't realize that I was like oh shit thanks man I don't

869
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,840
know about you guys literally like a sense of bar over his mouth the time I feel it's great I feel

870
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:26,400
so happy uh that I have acquired an infinite supply of of end passes and word passes because

871
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:32,720
I love barrett so much a proud black man because I have such a deep bond with barrett if he were here

872
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:38,880
he would give you the n word pass I know he would I know he would thank you barrett and you got you

873
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:47,520
guys would fist bump yeah um and he would I don't know he would say nah brah sol good he would that's

874
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,160
just what he would say in my mind that's how it would go that's the greatest character ever

875
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:57,520
conceived in history man barrett might be the best character in final fantasy seven uh in terms of

876
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,840
how happy he makes my pp oh my god when him and more leaner together I feel like I feel like I

877
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,000
feel like discussion about the remake has largely has like a lot of it's been focused on barrett and

878
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,960
like I guess I forgot I don't remember a lot of people like I don't remember barrett being a lot

879
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,760
of people's favorite character but I hear a lot of people saying that they like the remake say like

880
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:23,680
oh barrett's so good I hear that the white women have been going gaga for this guy uh is that true

881
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:29,280
I don't know I did see some article or some like Twitter post about I don't have have I ever told you

882
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:34,240
the first time like when I played final fantasy seven yeah the first time for like that g rpj

883
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:40,800
by the way I'm right with you white women I'm one of you I'm yeah um that uh I did like I didn't know

884
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,000
all of the like different things you do to get like uh things to happen like yufi I didn't know

885
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,160
how to make her appear oh yeah yeah um script so I have to look at look at that shit up you got to

886
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:56,320
go on game fat yeah man you gotta print out 50 fucking pages on your mom's printer staple it together

887
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:02,400
keep it next to your console fuck yeah dude I I didn't want to try that um uh just because I wanted

888
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:07,680
to see what would happen and I ended up with barrett in the date scene oh fuck yeah you got the best

889
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:13,200
arc man that's the best part it up although to be fair I was thinking like oh wait why is barrett

890
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:19,520
here what is going on like and when people were talking to eris and tiva the entire time intentionally

891
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:25,600
I guess I did I like didn't know what it was funny because like because they go on that thing I didn't

892
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,600
even know there was a quote unquote date scene yeah and people were talking about I was like what do

893
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,840
you mean I just went on a ride with barrett at some point that's why just railroading everyone

894
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,480
down the exact same experiences gay as hell and fucking different stories and different shit

895
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:45,920
give you shit to talk about it's fun it's cool it's soul is what it is it's soul dating barrett

896
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:51,520
is the peak soul you think you think in remake part two they're gonna allow you to date anyone

897
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,960
except eris I would bet a thousand fucking dollars that they force you to date eris and no one else

898
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:01,040
they're gonna let you I think they're gonna let you do that that that would I feel like that would

899
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:09,200
be like an like overt sort of like downgrade I think people would hate that here's here's what I

900
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:13,360
might do you guys money you want to put money down I'll do it I'll bet a hundred dollars they

901
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:20,160
force you to date specifically eris I will put money down all right hmm I don't want to put

902
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:25,760
down honestly dollars one hundred dollars I want to take that bet because I think you're wrong

903
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,640
but I would feel bad winning a hundred dollars yeah uh you want to do 10 I'll do I don't know

904
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:36,320
50 I will bet you ten dollars let's do um like like a hundred million slime coin how about that

905
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:41,920
I don't have any slime coin dammit I'm broke I will ten dollar all right you and me ban if you

906
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:48,400
want to do a give two ten dollars it's on the books I have like absolutely no dog in this race at all

907
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:55,040
sure but my my gut instinct is that that is an iconic scene from the original and for them to

908
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:01,520
and like it might just not do it I feel I feel like the mission statement of the remake is to pay

909
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,160
homage to the original and I agree that would be the opposite of that so I don't think they would

910
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:11,600
do that well you know I haven't actually done the research I believe see here's my evidence I believe

911
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:17,520
that they just removed now I need to test this but I think that they removed the option of

912
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:23,040
Don Corneo to date any to take any girl back it used to be eris tifa or cloud because I did it

913
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:28,480
and I got cloud I think that he will always pick cloud now I'm not sure I gotta double check that

914
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,720
because I get everyone the worst possible dress in the remake you can give him different dresses

915
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:38,400
and stuff uh so I'll double check that but I'm pretty sure that they already flattened that out

916
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:44,560
I mean I'll stick to the but I will take the bet the bet is there it is that there will be a scene

917
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:50,960
if not exactly a similar scene at like a similar point in the story and they will allow you to

918
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:57,680
there will be a variable option that includes Barrett and it will be a thing I think so I'll

919
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:02,480
give you buckaroos I will give you anything just like you don't need to define your position my

920
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:09,760
position is there will be a date you will be forced to date eris specifically if anything else happens

921
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,280
like if the date happens in any other format I will give you ten dollars I'm happy to take that bet

922
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,080
so what if there's if there's no date do I win yes you win you win well okay I mean that's just

923
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:24,480
stupid but I sure I mean I guess you win that too okay um um what if I think no one knows if that

924
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:29,120
that's true I think there will be a date it's too iconic there will be a date yeah no one wins if

925
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:34,480
there's no okay here's what I think will happen it won't I think there will be a choice but it will

926
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:41,280
be very obvious it won't be like cryptic like it was before they already do which might be like a

927
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:46,240
little bit like oh it's like just press the button go up to the person to talk to them and that's

928
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:51,840
obviously it will be this are you sure you want to initiate date with barrett are you sure you don't

929
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,320
want to save and and go and like grind friendship points with someone else first are you sure you

930
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:01,520
don't want to hit this button to just to just switch to options right now uh carefully careful

931
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,400
get on your back and go back and forth to build up friendship with barrett

932
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,880
leave dropping the daycare let them uh level up a few times they I'm sure they'll fuck around

933
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,560
with it but there will be some sort of like variable thing I need to google this can don

934
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:27,440
corneo pick eris ff7 remake I might have just been totally wrong about that wait wait um clown

935
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:35,600
if um clown stress hey so we were talking before about animal crossing and how I've

936
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,480
unlocked the I've I finally understand the true meta yes tell me it's now the time okay

937
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:46,400
so I've been grinding animal crossing water in my flowers breeding roses got got a good little

938
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:52,720
collection going yeah that's all cool but I have I have seen I have pierced the veil and seen the

939
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:58,480
code behind the matrix and I understand the true meta of how to win animal crossing and it is this

940
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:06,240
it's it's all about recipes hmm it is all about getting bells is about having more recipes because

941
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,600
and this this unlocked this unlocked the key to my potential right to my financial future

942
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:19,840
every recipe that you make every item that you craft sells for double the amount of

943
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:25,600
what you would have sold the ingredients for so the way to maximize your money is you have

944
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:31,920
enough ingredients that you can use as many of your resources as possible to craft items so what

945
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,680
I've been what I've been doing is I've just been waiting for a hot item that I know how to craft

946
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:40,560
and then just blowing all my iron and all my all my wood and all my clay and stone and stuff

947
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,000
just making as many of it as possible right right because that's because it's double the price of

948
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,120
the ingredients and then it's double the price of that because it's a hot item so you're quadrupling

949
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:54,800
your value on these raw materials that you got and that's it that's it it's it's you want to have

950
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,840
as many as many recipes as possible so that you can make full advantage of the most of your ingredients

951
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:05,600
like uh my friend Toby he's got a coconut recipe he's a palm tree lamp I'm jealous because I have

952
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,800
nothing I can do with these coconuts I'm selling at their base price wasted potential now however

953
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:20,000
apparently uh off like non-native fruit in terms of like how more native fruit sells for 100

954
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:27,280
non-native fruit sells for 500 but but a crafted recipe calculates the value as though it were

955
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:32,640
just a native fruit all fruit counts as native in terms of that so you actually do get more just

956
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:38,320
selling non-native fruit raw and not crafting it okay but native fruit like I've got apples I've

957
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:42,640
just every I've just been picking tons of apples crafting them into apple umbrellas I've just been

958
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:49,680
selling all my apple umbrellas yesterday uh uh the hot item was brick ovens and so it was clay

959
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:56,480
iron wood I just I just I had like stacks and stacks of clay I spent it all sold it all to

960
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:04,400
the nooks made like 100,000 bells um that's it not bad not bad get get recipes get recipes take

961
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:10,560
advantage of hot items uh a horde resources yep for the moment for the moment when when when it's

962
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,920
your time to shine you can use all those sticks and all those weeds or whatever yeah double your

963
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:21,040
shit I've done that once or twice uh a little bit doing the hot item thing I suspected that it was

964
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:26,320
the right way to go but uh good to have uh clarification on that it is it is it is the

965
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:30,960
thing if you're if you're um if you're playing by yourself the recipe will always be something

966
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:36,480
that you have unlocked uh I think because I'm not like the main islander like my friend Caleb

967
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:41,520
owns the switch so it's his game so I'm pretty sure it picks a recipe from things that he has

968
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,440
so sometimes it's something that I can't craft but other times it is something like like a

969
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:51,520
DIY table or something and it's okay I've been grinding wood now's the time got it got to spend

970
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:58,720
it all this is this is how to maximize its value oh man okay there you go I'm so close to my fourth

971
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:04,240
I'm so close to getting that second side room oh yeah I you know I now have I have a back room

972
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:11,360
and a left room in my house yeah yeah that's where I'm I'm almost at the right room I have like 100

973
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:17,520
I would have gotten it today but I decided to invest in turnips I spent about a hundred I invested

974
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:23,120
about a hundred thousand bells huh that's the real money right that's how you get it can be it

975
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:30,240
sometimes um I invested a hundred thousand bells in the turnips I because last week last week the

976
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:35,040
turnip price has just went down it was just a complete bust it was terrible it lost like half

977
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:39,840
your investment I didn't do it that week this week I'm counting on it being different I'm waiting

978
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,520
for it to peak around Wednesday Thursday fingers crossed and it'll all be worth it I don't have to

979
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:49,040
wait a little bit I have to wait a little bit on that house expansion but it'll all be worth it in

980
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:55,120
the end I've been trying to figure that out what uh how do I buy turnips I have not figured this

981
01:28:55,120 --> 01:29:01,280
shit out on Sunday morning okay sometimes there is a little pig walking around who has a plate of

982
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:07,760
turnips on her head and she sells you the turnips okay okay it has it's like before like 10 a.m. or

983
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:14,240
like before noon Sunday so you can only buy Sunday but you can sell anytime you can buy on Sunday

984
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:19,360
you cannot sell them on Sunday you can sell them to the nooks on any other day right and the price

985
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:25,440
varies twice every at midnight and at noon the price changes so you got to check at least twice a day

986
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:29,680
if you won't really want to be on top of but if you wait until the next Sunday uh your turnips

987
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:35,280
all go bad so you have to sell them before Sunday or it's all wasted I see I see hey by the way I

988
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:41,520
was just trying to confirm this I do believe that Don Corneo always picks cloud in the remake I

989
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:48,560
have not found any evidence so that's lame that's bad news that's bad news for me it is that's bad

990
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:53,360
news for my bet prospects but I'm this is this is different though I'm aware this is a different

991
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:59,760
kind of situation but I'm seeing a flattening of choices across the board aka anti-soul and uh

992
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:04,400

996
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:29,440
we're counting on you the collective unconscious the the pcp episode 700 yeah seven seven seven

997
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:36,480
lucky it's a it's a lucky one final fantasy seven oh did you guys know that if it before before

998
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:42,560
uh well what were you gonna say I was just going to say video game speaking of soul did you guys

999
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:49,920
know that at any point in final fantasy seven if your hp ever hits for a character for any reason

1000
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:57,600
healing taking damage 7777 exactly the character goes berserk and this never happened to me at

1001
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:04,640
any time playing the game but it can be manipulated to do so um then uh you just do I believe 77

1002
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:11,040
basic attacks in a row which kills almost anything in the game uh if it did know that I've never seen

1003
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:17,360
it it's I mean god there's so much so in those games uh pretty pretty cool pretty cool funny

1004
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:24,480
uh speaking of like doing like managing stuff and selling resources I've been playing slime

1005
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:31,040
rauncher oh yeah there's another one hey and I'm I'm pretty far in uh I'm in the glass desert

1006
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:36,960
I'm finding all the the special guys and I'm uh the slimes and the give give a quick question

1007
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:42,160
about that uh my main thought about the game does that game have any played in a no I've never played

1008
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:46,320
though watch you play a little bit you and munchie does that game have a satisfying arc where like

1009
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:52,000
you grow resources which like unlocks new areas of the island to explore and then you kind of yes

1010
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,200
basically all right sounds fine yeah it sounds fine yeah the the loop is pretty fun yeah and I

1011
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:02,800
love that loop I've got to a point where I've got like drone bees uh that I can oh I love the drone

1012
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:10,640
bees and so in in the main area I have uh all slimes that like fruit and their favorite fruit

1013
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:16,640
growing so I have like one drone be give all of the slimes fruit and one of the others collect

1014
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,880
the plots and sell them and so I have like hundreds of thousands of gold every time I

1015
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:26,720
walk through them like hey yes the you have to you have you still have to like keep track of it

1016
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:32,800
because you have to like water your yeah to water the water your drones or they get dehydrated and

1017
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,520
they can't collect your shit which is silly because they're bees and also robots that like they

1018
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:43,120
be double effect like weak to water you would think no they love it but they love splashing

1019
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:48,240
with a bit of water and they wake up and they continue um and yeah I've been I've been uh

1020
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:54,240
collecting all these things I mean it's just a fun game I got all I've never once I guess

1021
01:32:54,240 --> 01:33:00,640
I've been pretty careful I've never once had a calamity in my ranch and like all of like like

1022
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:06,400
tar slimes have not appeared um it's happened to me I mean if you've got like a water the water

1023
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:12,480
cannon it's not that hard to deal with uh tar slimes die pretty quick they do but like I've never

1024
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:20,080
even I I don't usually like making Largo slimes I like having each slime like a bunch of them

1025
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:27,040
small and you um you know like their own thing I had like a I wasn't sure for a while whether

1026
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:34,320
because like a Largo slime gives two podrons lol a Largo slime gives two plorts when eats

1027
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:42,160
um but but but you can fit more small slimes so like I think if you have like more resources

1028
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:47,840
to feed them it's better to fill up a tank with small slimes but if you have fewer like like

1029
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,440
crops and you want to get more out of them it's better to have Largo slimes this is like my

1030
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,840
theory I don't know if there's like a spreadsheet about the things the thing with it is like if I

1031
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:02,560
want to relocate I can't do the Largo slimes without extreme bullshit and with the smaller ones

1032
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:09,280
if I need like oh um I want I wanted all the fruit enjoying because the the drone bees can

1033
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:15,840
like deal with vegetables or fruits or specific things or like chickens um and and plorts and all

1034
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:22,240
that um so I have all of like the vegetable slimes in one area all of the meat slimes in another

1035
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:29,600
and so I I in order to make that happen you need I needed to transport like tons of slimes

1036
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:34,800
and if they were Largo uh that would have you have to move them one at a time yeah would you be

1037
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:42,640
in hell so um have you gotten to any of like the uh like bonus like end game content uh

1038
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:50,560
like be like side farm areas that have like weird shit to do yeah yeah I've I've got to the guy

1039
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:56,080
who is like uh he wants you to find the purple fruit I did all that I got to the point where I

1040
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:02,800
have his ranch now so I have more space nice I've done I've been doing the uh the uh the glitch slime

1041
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:08,640
simulations which are pretty fun I didn't find that for like a long time and like I got back into

1042
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:13,360
the game for like just for for no reason after thinking I had done everything and then I found

1043
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:21,280
that glitch slime area I was like what the fuck is this I just like didn't find it so baby it's um

1044
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:27,840
have you done the quicksilver slime stuff yeah I've just started that it's uh that's pretty fun

1045
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:32,880
it's pretty fun I I kind of didn't understand or what some of the things do I know you've got to

1046
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:38,080
shoot the slimes and I'm trying to figure out like the best strategy for doing it yeah because it

1047
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,000
seems like if you're running forwards and and the slimes are running ahead of you it's still hard

1048
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,280
to hit them if you turn around though you can go like yeah you you run backwards and shoot at the

1049
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:52,240
slimes coming at you that was mostly how I did and you use the like um I mean you can use like

1050
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:57,360
the thunder shot to hit an area I liked using like the time slow area to like group up a bunch

1051
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:03,120
together yeah I'm just like fire into the crowd that's a good game that's a good fucking game

1052
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:10,080
it's just it's a lot of like it's management and running around and it's also cute yeah I really

1053
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:14,800
like the sound effects there's a specific sound effect where like I think it's just some stock

1054
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:20,960
thing but it reminds it's it's in an old game of like the the pc version of cluedo from 1998

1055
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:29,200
um where it's like a click sound a very distinct click sound that sounds like somebody's switching

1056
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:36,640
off a light but with like low bit rate or whatever like click click and and that's how you change

1057
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:42,400
the items on your hotbar so it's like oh I just enjoy doing that I know that every uh whenever

1058
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:47,280
you uh right click to I've said this before but in Metal Gear Solid 5 when you right click to like

1059
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:52,560
aim a weapon the click click as you like put the weapon into position is so satisfying to me

1060
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:59,040
I just love aiming my weapon it feels good so tactile holy artists sound effects engineers

1061
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:06,000
based unsung heroes of video games you're right but by the way the so good when they're so good

1062
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,800
it's true which is the only time I really remember this standing out to me was Metal Gear Solid 5

1063
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,040
but the more I more I play games the more I'm aware of all this stuff by the way the uh quick

1064
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:20,160
silver slime thing we're my sorry there's just this meme on 4chan where you know how metal slimes

1065
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:25,280
will run away really fast in in dragon quest there's a uh no there's a meme I think it's metal

1066
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,880
slimes there's a meme where you you have an image of a thing and when you click on an image in 4chan

1067
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:34,000
you make it big uh actually the image is a gif and the metal slime is there for exactly one frame

1068
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,920
and then it disappears and there's just an empty gif for the rest of the uh that's it because it

1069
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:49,840
runs away really fast I love it every time I smile well I've got I've got voicemails if you guys

1070
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:56,240
want to get to them um yeah if there's something else you want I'm trying to think about anything

1071
01:37:56,240 --> 01:38:00,240
else to say about animal crossing sure did you have images for a spend did you want to give us

01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:10,160
about getting it um and you know that's how that's how you maximize your turnip games oh yeah as you

1084
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:14,640
you visit you you take your native fruit and you sell it on other islands and you you go to other

1085
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:19,040
other islands and you sell your turnips there if they've got a good asking price that right right

1086
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:22,960
game the system plus uh what what fruit what fruits have you got what fruits have you got right now

1087
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:29,520
I'm I've got all five fruits now oh god I need to steal some of my friend Toby Toby went to um

1088
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:34,720
he got the he did multiplayer and he went to one of his friends island and that guy had pairs

1089
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:39,440
which was the last one we've got but I've got on my little on my little sides my little section

1090
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,520
of the island my little peninsula that I live on I have turned it into a peach grove it's just

1091
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:49,200
peaches over there nice Toby's got pears and Caleb has oranges and John's just got trash nothing

1092
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:53,520
but trash how close your peach trees together because I'm debating if I should move them to be a

1093
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,560
tighter knit thing do you have one space between them or two or three no I have them pretty loose

1094
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:04,320
pretty loose okay okay I've got them in a nice grid uh there we have an orchard that's like that

1095
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:11,840
yeah um there's um uh uh uh uh uh oh did I okay so my friend John he's he's he's building trash

1096
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:17,360
island I think I mentioned this yeah well I had an experience right I went on an expedition

1097
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:23,920
to a wild island and it seemed like a normal island at first but what I realized is that

1098
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:30,000
it is a trash island and there were no fish only trash oh oh I see there was nothing in the water

1099
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,920
except trash to fish up so I fished up tons of it and I unlocked a recipe for a trash wall and

1100
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,320
trash flooring yeah I did that too and I made and I was like well I gotta make this so I made them

1101
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,400
and I sent it to him and they're in his house now and we're all you know it's cooperative you know

1102
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:49,760
we're all working together for the betterment of mankind somebody wants trash by god we're

1103
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:57,760
gonna give them trash that's beautiful one last thing yeah um uh think talking about slimes and

1104
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:04,880
slime runcher and puddle slimes reminded me of of this funny little chart that has been I made

1105
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:12,000
for like a conversation in the endless war disco about types of slime girls that could exist

1106
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:20,080
lakroy girls totally formless and transparent lakroy girls puddle slimes are basically lakroy

1107
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:26,960
girls um so like there's the formless formless to viscous so like the the the you know the the

1108
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,920
goopier they are yeah and then saturated to transparent because we were trying to decide

1109
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:36,400
this is the one that the people need to be on where am I so these are all technically slime

1110
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:41,200
girls we decided that that is an umbrella term yeah because uh slime is the main thing of endless

1111
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:48,640
but specifically types of like you know types of slime girls goo girls are making a big thing

1112
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:55,120
people know in in what a goo girl is goo girls limited is like an up and coming conglomeration

1113
01:41:55,120 --> 01:42:00,880
that's what started this thing keep hearing about this I see I don't know if I don't I'm a little

1114
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:07,120
iffy on this whole on I feel like golem girls and sludge girls should be swaps I was gonna say

1115
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:13,200
how can I sound like a solid a golem come on yeah I added that I added the golem girls thing but

1116
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:17,280
like I didn't want to have them overlap and sludge girls was already there it was like a

1117
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:25,120
cooperative like uh graph creation I say I see no glue like glue girls glue girls yeah because

1118
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:32,080
they're the transparent but also yeah like epoxy resin girls oh I want that fruit girl

1119
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:37,040
glue girl so I live in orange juice girl that'd be an orange juice girl that was like a glass of

1120
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:43,440
orange juice with an anime face and for I forget what is a gunge what's a gunge girl gunge is like

1121
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:51,520
the the watery extremely neon green slime that is used in Nickelodeon the kids and stuff okay okay I

1122
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:58,800
see oh is it I remember in the UK is is they get you get gunged and then like what the fuck okay

1123
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:05,040
on Nickelodeon uh Nickelodeon and things of that nature you know those sorts of kids kids kids

1124
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:11,360
game shows where kids compete to do stuff and if they fail they get gross gunge poured on them that

1125
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:18,000
is very perverse um I don't like it I remember one time Carl Pilkington was talking about tv

1126
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:25,360
and he called tv that he doesn't like glunge telly um nobody speaking the word nobody knows what it

1127
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:33,280
means I think it's like a little I think he's a glunge telly I don't know classic classic moment

1128
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:40,480
I love this I'm gonna put myself I want to be um I think I'm I think I'm

1129
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:48,000
newt viscous formless I'm kind of in the middle but I'm heavily saturated like I'm kind of like

1130
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,560
right in the middle like closer to the top yeah I feel like I've got to be further viscous than

1131
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:58,480
formless personally and fairly saturated as well that's that's where I feel you kind of about where

1132
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:03,200
ooze girls are uh yeah maybe slightly upper right a little bit more but yeah in that area that's

1133
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:07,920
that's where I feel yeah okay yeah what's the girl are you this is the chart I'm closest to ooze girl

1134
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:14,000
yeah I suppose I let's see a highly saturated kind of middle of the road viscosity would be like um

1135
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:21,200
um no there's already a jelly girl uh yeah like a really sweet jelly or really like some sort of

1136
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:27,840
toxic waste syrup syrup girl maybe yeah maybe yeah maybe syrup I don't know that's kind of viscous

1137
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:35,840
but kind of formless maybe magma I mean I don't know a workshop it yeah a workshop it yeah I love it

1138
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:41,200
uh place yourselves on the chart everyone oh where would mercury be that's gotta be uh

1139
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:46,080
ooh that's good how about that would be that would be a sort of like gunge but all the way to the top

1140
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:52,000
because it is certainly very saturated you cannot see through it yeah but it is very liquidy

1141
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,560
yeah oh gunge girls but at the top yeah yeah to the right of fruit yeah perhaps

1142
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,640
although it's fruit really more but it's heavy though mercury is like thick and heavy even

1143
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:08,160
that it's very like fast flowing but it's yeah like all the way to the top a maybe middle to the

1144
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:13,920
right I I don't know so I top I'm not sure it's certainly not transparent certainly not certainly

1145
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:20,800
we can all agree on that experts agree they call it quick so I feel like because it moves quick

1146
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:26,960
for a goop it should be more formal I don't I don't know yeah yeah I get it all right that's a good

1147
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,560
girl it's a good girl and debate the nuances of this you know indeed we could spend all day with

1148
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:35,920
that but we've got voicemails to get to and oh wait sorry on the subject of slime I do want to

1149
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:41,760
mention that the rfck pin Kickstarter oh yeah is doing really good we've had a bunch of people

1150
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:47,760
have just pledged at like the 250-dollar tier because to which lets them just pick their own

1151
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:52,000
design like no vote like they just get to choose what they want cool we've had a bunch of people

1152
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,680
we're up to like three thousand dollars almost nice which is what I was hoping yeah two thousand

1153
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:03,360
seven hundred and two dollars and the next vote the next pin design that we're gonna vote on will

1154
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:09,200
be at three thousand unless someone else pledges the 250 and then it'll go up by that much

1155
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:15,360
the because you know because because it's each we get we get a voted one at every 250

1156
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:20,800
dollars of like free donations as in not ones that are like okay this is specifically for

1157
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:25,680
this design that I choose myself and I see that you have updated with all the pins that are available

1158
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:30,000
right now are big in the center there we're getting we're getting the cop killer pin rowdy

1159
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:35,920
fucker pin smear ghost nega slime pin the slime the slime coin challenge coin

1160
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,240
fuck yeah which is like it's like the big like sort of display coin it'll be like it'll probably be

1161
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:46,880
like half dollar silver dollar size so cool roughly so cool um uh we get the the the the

1162
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:57,200
slime core pin i'm glad that made it in um a sort of like night sky design by labla labungus p and

1163
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:02,560
and uh smear like collaborated on that one it's glorious there is a this is i'm really excited

1164
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:07,440
about someone should taco chose an iron-on pat you know how people were like the german flag

1165
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:12,400
patch yeah on their like shoulder it's like that but it's the endless war flag really cool that's

1166
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:18,160
a really i think that's super cool and i am gonna have to get a new jacket just yeah put it on

1167
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:23,280
oh it's so cool i love it i know i remember all the struggles about choosing the perfect flag and

1168
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:28,320
all the voting and all the debating i'm so happy with the flag that was eventually chosen it was

1169
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:33,120
yeah it was like a huge ordeal we had like we did another like vote thing like people submitted

1170
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:36,800
their designs then we had like a bunch of rounds of voting on them and then like a couple of the

1171
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:40,480
winners like sort of got together in a call and like collaborate and sort of like put them all

1172
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:45,440
together and decided on like okay here's a good like sort of mixture of all the elements that we

1173
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:52,080
like it's great so i like endless war i try it's running i try to run it very democratically i try

1174
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,880
to make it very you know community driven of course is one of the i guess one of the mission

1175
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,520
statements of it one of the main sustaining factors i'd say that's what we're that's what

1176
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:06,880
that's what it'd be that's what's up that's what's happening did you clarify that like at 3000 there's

1177
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:13,440
like a new stretch goal or something because i just see uh unless unless someone else donates

1178
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:21,440
the 250 the 3000 would be the next time we hold like a vote unlike which uh which new design to

1179
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:27,600
make i see i see okay we actually got a little behind um right now it was further behind before

1180
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:35,680
but it's caught up um we were behind where like uh uh um more people had pledged to make specific

1181
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:41,280
designs we had basically we had voted on more designs than we had actually gotten money to make

1182
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:45,920
so we were in the hole for a minute and i was just gonna have to like pony up like a couple hundred

1183
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:54,960
dollars how did that even happen it was you masked that out okay well no i didn't that's the problem

1184
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:01,200
because like the initial goal it was 600 at first later on i decided that we could do it for 500 so

1185
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:06,720
i moved the stretch goals down later sure sure but so effectively the initial goal it was 500

1186
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:15,040
dollars to make the first two pins and then 250 on top of that basically um okay we had a bunch

1187
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:21,680
of people had pledged and that had been enough to fund uh it ended up being the the smear pin

1188
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:27,440
and the coin and then i was like hey i've got an idea if someone pledges 250 they're basically

1189
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,040
funding the whole pin themselves they should be able to choose whatever they want so i made that

1190
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:36,160
a tier sure okay 250 dollar tier pick your own pin and a bunch of people and i don't want anyone

1191
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:40,560
to like feel like they shouldn't have done this it's fine it all worked out but but some people

1192
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:47,440
that had already pledged up to their pledges to a 250 tier so those are actually doing it's only

1193
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:54,640
adding like 200 or whatever yeah so their previous pledges had gone towards like you know the amount

1194
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:59,760
that meant that we could have new pins to design right right so that was no longer going because

1195
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:06,160
now it was going towards uh you know an individually decided pin so because we had already you know

1196
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:12,640
voted and agreed like yes we will be making these two this the the the ghost and the coin uh we ended

1197
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:19,200
up being you know in in the hole for that i see i see not anymore we've like basically caught up

1198
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:27,680
now well cool i feel like a i'm sorry i fucked it up to to uh to get like the patch and the slam

1199
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:34,960
court pin because i want yeah i want all of these i i don't know whether i want will have the money

1200
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:42,240
to like buy all of them to get funded but probably a lot yeah um i'm hoping i'm rooting for if we do

1201
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:48,320
another one i'm hoping that the muck cup i want the podron i want the podron as well and i would

1202
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:53,760
all i would really like the muck cup uh badge too would be pretty cool um but what's fucking there's

1203
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:59,200
like digimon with a hat going on on here what is that shit about digimon with a hat there's like

1204
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:05,440
some white nibba with blue on him with a backward what's that guy's story that's um that's red five

1205
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:10,800
rainbow a couple of people just like submitted their own guys i mean pizza chan i know everyone

1206
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:17,280
loves pizza chan everyone loves pizza yeah it's you know there's a t-fap red man wait what is this

1207
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:22,160
image you scroll down on the kickstarter page on the kickstarter the ones of like potential future

1208
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:27,680
designs okay first one is podron and muck cup and then yeah so some people were just like hey

1209
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:35,200
make me a pin and i was like well i said i would accept anyone's submissions so god damn it i will

1210
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:39,520
very so i did it and i put them on the list and they're available to be voted on i wouldn't mind

1211
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:46,080
if that's the will of the people then so be it pizza chan's cool um sure yeah one question because i

1212
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:51,120
am going to pledge i just wanted to decide when and how much so i i can pledge for a certain number

1213
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:56,720
of pins and then is it afterward i'll be sent like a thing to like fill out a form of which ones i want

1214
01:51:56,720 --> 01:52:01,920
is that the yes okay yeah i can pledge now without worrying about which ones if new ones get added or

1215
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:08,000
yeah you can like like if you pledge you know 50 or whatever right now then you get five pins

1216
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,080
and then after the kickstarter's overall send you a message and be like okay well which five do you

1217
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:16,640
want okay gotcha and the slime part one is two the big the slime uh yes people have been confused

1218
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:20,320
i've said it a bunch of places but people still are confused so i should keep saying it over and over

1219
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:26,000
again the coin counts as two so if you pledge for two you get the coin you just get the coin if you

1220
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,760
pledge for three right you get the coin and one others if you want the coin because the coin is

1221
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:36,240
like way bigger and it's way more it's way more metal you know yeah yeah that's why i want uh yeah i

1222
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:43,120
want one i did make by the way ben a smoother version of the red man face if we needed that for a pin

1223
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:49,040
i i mean if that if that got like funded or anything because i don't know whether the the the harsh

1224
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:53,520
angles could could you post it i'd love to see it just i saw that i posted in the main hit but i saw

1225
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:58,880
that and i put it on i thought i put it on this image i definitely put it on the next like grid

1226
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:05,200
for voting uh i thought i had updated this one with it too i guess i didn't but yeah i have that

1227
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:11,040
i made like a pin mock-up out of it and i just forgot to friggin put it here nice yeah yeah yeah

1228
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:16,000
it would be very hilarious to have a serious would be pretty funny i do like red man a lot

1229
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:20,480
red man it's the boy it's so fucking weird

1230
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:29,360
oh geez his face is off is that red is that red on the on the list

1231
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:37,840
well because you know uh there's only there's only certain colors available uh oh this red i

1232
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:43,840
didn't check oh it's exactly the the the red selection is pretty robust so probably something

1233
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:48,880
very similar would be there but yeah like especially like greens like there's a couple of like

1234
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:53,760
they don't have any greens that are like quite what i would have wanted they're like

1235
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:58,720
none of them are quite as bright as i want it's kind of a shame but like yeah you there's a there's

1236
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:03,280
a guide there's like a formula there's a pantone guide and it's like okay all the colors that we

1237
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:10,320
can use on the pins have to be from this selection although i it's weird because there's no white

1238
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:16,000
on that list and yet i know that white is available because i got the poobah pins and the endless war

1239
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,920
pins yeah not the and the infinite chess pins and they've got white on them so i sent them an email

1240
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:25,840
asking like hey what's up with that is there like yeah other colors that are available that aren't

1241
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:31,200
on the list like i don't know because i would like to know but it's it's a little weird but white is

1242
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:37,600
definitely a thing but yeah gotta follow the guide ah anyway i was curious about like the

1243
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:43,120
challenge coin and the one below it like the the rfck town or whatever the endless war those are

1244
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:46,720
like fairly intricate but i assume none of those are probably even though i guess the cop killer

1245
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:53,120
and the munchie one they should be the the one with the sky yeah it might cost like five bucks

1246
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:58,000
more to make because it has like i think it has six colors instead of five yeah but like it's like

1247
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,920
not even a big deal um yeah it can be as intricate as it wants to be as long as like the metal sections

1248
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:09,360
are like a minimum width size they have to be like a like 0.2 millimeters or maybe like or half a

1249
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:15,280
millimeter yeah cool and like it's not it's it's you can get pretty fine with the detail and like

1250
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:21,040
you can even you can even put like a hole like on the slime core pin if i if you wanted i could

1251
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:25,280
have put like little gaps in between like the red parts you know what i mean yeah yeah okay there

1252
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:30,240
could like you can get like what's called cutouts like holes in the design it costs a little bit

1253
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:36,240
more but like not that much more it's doable sure sure so yeah they can fucking they can make them

1254
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:42,640
they can make them fucking many old friggin way you dang want pretty fucking sick hey ben how did

1255
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:48,160
you make these images was it like a did you just put it in and it makes an auto-generated like fake

1256
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:54,880
thing or did you actually like photoshop no i i photoshop them i have a process it's um could

1257
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:00,160
you do a youtube tutorial explaining do you want me to i really would because it looks great

1258
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:06,640
it's like they do look great such a really good way to make it look 3d and shiny i could straight

1259
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:15,200
up do that if you wanted one man wants at least i'd watch it um i'm curious i could explain the

1260
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:21,600
technique or i could yeah all right maybe i'll just make a little tutorial it's like how to make

1261
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:27,520
how to do the very specific thing of taking an image and making it look like a pseudo 3d shiny

1262
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,880
pin lamel i have i have a little technique that i just go through with and it takes me like

1263
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:38,240
five ten minutes apiece it's not that it's not that complicated like i like i could probably

1264
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:46,800
figure it out but like yeah there's a few things i'm not quite sure about i i um yeah i i'll do it

1265
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:54,080
because it's uh you know i'm a i'm a genius uh only i could have done this um i must share

1266
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:58,560
my technique with the world it's the grand follow-up to the jennifer diane writes lecture

1267
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:04,960
that everyone's been waiting for how to turn an image into a pin it was shiny pin oh maybe i don't

1268
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:10,080
want maybe i don't want to like shit up my channel with that oh well no you can you would not hurt

1269
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:14,560
anything at the same time that's true oh yeah i mean that's true that wouldn't hurt that's true it

1270
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:20,960
would also serve as a ad for the kickstarter interesting okay well well let ben debate

1271
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:26,640
would struggle uh for a long time on his own let us now get to our voicemails we've got like

1272
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:34,560
how many uh eight total oh christ don't worry we'll move through quickly fuck yeah yeah okay first

1273
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:41,760
up is a fitter weeb than nate uh has something to say let's listen go hey pcp just finish the old

1274
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,680
workout because when you're quarantining your apartment what else are you gonna do like any good

1275
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:50,320
anime trash panda i listen to a decent amount of opz and covers while i lift and run and do all the

1276
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:54,480
other things that nate claims that he does it never gets around to doing listening to this music

1277
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:59,520
got me thinking though our covers of music really art all you're doing is trying to imitate the work

1278
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,440
of let's face it more talented musicians and writers maybe there's some argument to be made

1279
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:07,200
that when you have to translate lyrics there's a value in that but it still seems like a lesser

1280
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:11,200
art form nobody cares about the copies of the Mona Lisa no matter how good they are after all

1281
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:18,880
anyways what do you guys and gals think um simple a good a good cover is a reinterpretation of the

1282
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:25,760
original song to a degree well he said two things in there he said is it art but then later he said

1283
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:32,400
like is less art you could certainly make a case that it's like lesser art i mean i think everything

1284
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:37,360
that's lesser like everything that's unoriginal about a thing is a point against it so yeah to

1285
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:44,000
a certain extent i agree but i think there is an art to doing a cover and like you can take an old

1286
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,280
song and do an original twist on it and that's a good cover if i feel like i feel like generally

1287
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:57,120
if the cover is trying to do its own thing too much but it's still recognizable as the first

1288
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:02,000
thing it's just annoying and i'd rather listen to the real thing like very rarely would cover

1289
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:10,800
like transcend the original um you are forgetting about the the techno remix of discord

1290
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:15,520
yeah that's a really right that's that's a different sort of thing if we're talking about

1291
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:22,080
covers i suppose where do you draw the line that's true i mean they're all in the same ballpark

1292
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:31,040
i'd say i feel like a cover is just you know like a lady singing a song uh but doing like a little

1293
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:37,360
stranger like well well well well well well you've just described a shitty cover yeah yeah what about

1294
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:44,000
the best cover ever hey for example um i think Nina Simone originally made the song don't let me be

1295
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:50,480
misunderstood but then the monkeys no no wait it was what the fuck no who was it somewhat the

1296
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:56,320
and it was the animals not the fucking monkeys uh the animals made the most famous version of

1297
01:59:56,320 --> 02:00:02,720
don't let me be misunderstood that most people know uh that was a cover of a song and i mean

1298
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:07,040
throughout history of music there have been many famous songs that are more popular and more

1299
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:13,440
beloved in their remake form you've got an original shoutouts to the uga chaka cover of hooked on a

1300
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:21,680
feeling indeed um that isn't wait that isn't the original one no no it is not yeah that's right

1301
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:27,920
right i just thought it was strange you know i guess it comes down to i don't know there's there's a

1302
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:33,920
there's a there's a Todd in the shadows video about that song yeah apparently there are other

1303
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:39,760
there was like another cover of it that also says uga chaka and like strange yeah nobody

1304
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:44,800
he doesn't have any like explanation for why it's there maybe it's actually a cover of the

1305
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:49,040
animals version or not the animals whoever made that fucking umba umba whatever the fuck the

1306
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:56,800
orange skiffs okay i'm fucking about their names well blue suede is the ones that did the cover

1307
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:59,680
i don't know there's like there's like four different covers of it so i don't even know

1308
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:07,680
who's the original i as with everything i will i will say remakes and redoes can be good but

1309
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:14,560
nonetheless i always think it's a waste of time which is different by the way from a remaster

1310
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:20,160
a remaster is a different sort of animal and can usually be what the fuck are you talking about

1311
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:26,240
well like for if you that's a wild opinion well like if the Beatles go remaster like their album

1312
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:30,720
and then re-release it as Nate oh it's slightly i still don't like it Nate but there are different

1313
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:37,920
things a cover a cover is a reinterpretation of source material a remaster is literally just

1314
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:43,760
the same thing again uh okay you know what literally the same thing yeah all right we

1315
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:50,560
just like courting the music to music to we'll worry about that later okay uh by by the way

1316
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:55,520
i forgot to say uh speak pipe is where you leave the voicemails at the beginning uh there's a good

1317
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:00,320
cover you know brings something new to the table and it the way it interprets the thing and in that

1318
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:06,560
way yes it is definitely art in of itself yeah that's my but ben isn't it fair to say no any cover

1319
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:10,800
we'll introduce things that are different that you could call introducing something new even

1320
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,280
if it's just like the vocal instructions of the singer yes of course that's true what's your point

1321
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:21,200
then doesn't it just matter like it's it's a matter of deducing is that change good or bad so you

1322
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:26,320
just have to have a totally separate conversation of you know yes what is the nature that you idiot

1323
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:32,480
that doesn't friggin idiot obviously yes you have to determine did the change make it better or worse

1324
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:38,240
obviously yeah ben was not making a quality judgment you just say it is art like i don't think

1325
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:45,280
like quality necessarily has anything to do with whether something is like like changes something

1326
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:49,680
you can change something in a bad way or a good way that's the the original question was about

1327
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:55,280
whether or not it counts as art itself which i think we all basically agree with yes yes didn't

1328
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:59,680
didn't you just say no didn't you just say they're a waste of time well just because something's a

1329
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:05,760
waste of time doesn't make it not art it might just be bad or you know well okay are you no i'm

1330
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:10,080
not gonna let this go are you are you really are you really gonna put your flag in the sand right

1331
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:17,280
here and say that all covers are or or or re or what was the other thing you said remastered no you

1332
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:20,800
said you liked remasters what was the other thing you said i didn't even say i liked remastered i

1333
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:24,240
said they were a different thing okay that's what i said okay let's just stick with covers are you

1334
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:28,800
really gonna stick your foot in the sand and say all covers are a waste of time um

1335
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:35,040
uh well okay well you say a waste i wouldn't recommend it i i think your energy is better

1336
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:41,040
spend making original stuff i'm already talking about making it or consuming it making it right

1337
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:46,240
because that is a distinction i'm talking about making it talking about making it i i i i i sometimes

1338
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:53,200
feel that because it's like from a monetary standpoint at least you're not able to profit

1339
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:58,800
off of the work you put in as much as if it was an original thing because you gotta i just want

1340
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:04,160
new ideas you gotta play royalties to the original look look look okay you're not you're not always

1341
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:11,600
in control of your own creativity sometimes like imagine you hear a song and you're like ooh

1342
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:15,600
you know this is a good song but like what if it did this instead of this like oh like what if it

1343
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:19,840
was kind of performed like this a little differently like that would like totally change the the feel

1344
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:24,240
of it that like it could sound really good that way hmm that's a good idea that would sound good

1345
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:28,720
and then so you go and you like you record it and you produce it and you make a new version

1346
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:34,960
of the song and it's a cover like why is that a waste of time you know i i guess when i think

1347
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,840
about it i i i i of course i have the ff7 remake in my mind you know there is a major distinction

1348
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:46,880
here in terms of the medium because music isn't like you can make music way faster than a video game

1349
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:53,200
and the cultural impact of these things is very different when like the company makes a remake

1350
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:57,840
of a thing it's like there was the original there were a bunch of remasters for various platforms

1351
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:03,200
now there is the remake and like that's what exists when you've got like lots of people able to make

1352
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:09,120
covers all the time uh like sure it can't like the whatever like Nina Simone's version of don't let me

1353
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:14,480
be misunderstood kind of has been forgotten uh for like the animals cover because it's more popular

1354
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:19,760
people like it more uh is that bad i don't know but it's it's it's a different situation because

1355
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:24,480
it's not like the copyright holders of the song made another version of their thing it basically

1356
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:29,680
is like a fan version that happened to be popular there was no like corporate stamp saying we need

1357
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:36,240
to upgrade this thing i don't know it's just different and there's nuance to it i don't know okay

1358
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:43,200
all right there's there's words i'm satisfied let us go to our next voicemail which is from

1359
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:51,120
your loyal fan all right oh hi pcp uh it's me your loyal fan i just wanted to say that these

1360
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:57,200
lectures lately have been amazing they've been worth every penny yeah um truly the best content

1361
02:05:57,200 --> 02:06:04,880
you guys ever make are these long form deep dive personal lectures as a team i mean it's just

1362
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:09,600
probably true more of these more of these and you know what we shouldn't have to wait for radcon to

1363
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:16,880
do these um just hop into a discord everybody be in a chat and just do like a podcast recording style

1364
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:23,360
lecture like this shit is so good i'm addicted i'm a coke addict is what i'm saying i understand

1365
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:28,800
the one i was thinking i was thinking about i understand the desire but i just don't think

1366
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:33,600
it would be i mean it would be like a progress in his podcast like with the with the small

1367
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:39,440
latency issues somebody like there's always gonna be a difficulty with trying to be the

1368
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:46,320
main guy when everyone else can interject as loud as like like equally loud when you're standing up

1369
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:51,040
and everyone is sitting down it's a very different atmosphere that is true i don't think there are

1370
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:59,520
enough things in the world that i could make like a lecture length video discussing that i would have

1371
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:04,720
like the interest in making i don't think i could do that like once a month or or that like i would

1372
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:09,920
run out of things i would have to i would have to like investigate and spend some time to like

1373
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:15,520
learn about things it could be done but i'm also i agree with ben's point such that i'm happy to

1374
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:20,400
space these things out maybe like once a year that you'll get one maybe two for me like there are

1375
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:26,160
all things that i have like a long-standing interest in yeah i mean i guess i could find a new thing

1376
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:31,520
and like deep dive it and then but would it turn into a full band would that have soul i feel like

1377
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:39,600
it might i feel like it could end up having less soul perhaps that's the risk that is the risk

1378
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:43,360
i think this is one of the negatives of my final fantasy lecture by covering the whole series

1379
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:49,520
including like 11 and 14 which i've like barely played if at all and don't care about it i just

1380
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:55,440
felt i had to as a checklist yeah it has to be something that i'm genuinely interested in and

1381
02:07:55,440 --> 02:08:02,160
you know i can't make i can't make that happen indeed indeed i'm definitely going to do a better

1382
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:08,320
job next time i feel like i didn't didn't truly explain i mean it's a silly topic the risk are

1383
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:14,960
you gonna do brisco 102 i literally could um because i didn't talk about the epilogues or

1384
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:20,880
homestuck 2 which i might be funny follow up but homestuck 2 could go on for years and i'd rather

1385
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:26,880
like have that finish before i even think about that but um sure i could do one on the entirety

1386
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:32,240
of homestuck which would be hilarious like because of how long it is but there's also other things

1387
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:40,240
that i have like i have a big interest in and that's a good one yeah i only know like of the very

1388
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:44,720
minimum about that but like from what i know i think that could make a really good yeah lecture

1389
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:52,240
agreed yeah agreed and uh yeah that that's that's potential in fact actually alias cut that out

1390
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:58,000
bleep it bleep it so that nobody knows what it is okay just in case somebody has the smart idea

1391
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,960
of like stealing my lecture before i have a chance to do it oh yeah i do hate that i do hate that

1392
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:07,520
and uh you know i just it's a different situation because it's not us or anything but like on this

1393
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:13,520
idea of like the online ones i am good i am curious to hear what the reception to like um uh ash

1394
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:18,320
vampires uh like bionicle one i'll be curious to see what people think about that in terms of the

1395
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:25,040
format and whatnot just uh you know just for fun hi but uh no matter in any case let us move on to our

1396
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:35,440
next voicemail please this is the uh ff7 mandela effect okay go so i was sleeping after jacking

1397
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:41,360
off for like 10 times because i'm in quarantine you know and then nelson mandela came to my bed

1398
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:46,960
and with his black magic transported me to a parallel universe where the final fantasy seven

1399
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:53,680
remake is good uh i mean it's amazing the boxer is actually a square they made it specifically

1400
02:09:53,680 --> 02:10:00,080
a square despite all other ps4 covers being rectangle they even made it soft like soft square

1401
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:07,520
i think i think the box is made of uh japanese noodles also there's no gay shit like a fact that

1402
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:15,280
there's only 80 of sexual shit speaking of that tifa's tits are huge like not that huge

1403
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:22,960
that ben sehn would goom instantly at the merseys but bro they are big her thighs also are big

1404
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:28,240
so uh yeah too bad for you but uh in this universe the remake is great

1405
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:37,440
i dream too bad that in this universe hitler won oh yeah i was waiting for it i was waiting

1406
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:45,360
for a twist i'll take that trade any day of the week hitler won um you know the the japanese

1407
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:51,360
were became the master race of the oriental world uh and so square square was better than ever

and he grew up reading the first chapters of one piece and 70 odd years later he amassed fortune

1415
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:42,560
so he could make one piece real and he had a treasure the fen treasure like over a million

1416
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:48,640
dollars somewhere in the red line of the united states being the rocky mountains and he left

1417

from santa fe new mexico claims before he died is hidden in the rocky mountains of the united states

1421
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:20,160
and he did leave cryptic clues to try to get people to go find it uh it has not been found

1422

vampire there is a oh yeah okay okay there is what's the video game version okay there is a

1430
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:24,640
this is all gonna make sense this is all gonna make sense there was a book there was a book

1431
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:30,720
called masquerade and it was a an art book by a guy named kit williams and the art in the book

1432
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:37,920
was like it contained like cryptic hints that if you solve the puzzles you could find a real

1433
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:44,080
treasure that was buried somewhere in england in it was like a piece of like golden jewelry it was

1434
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:50,640
it was a golden hair it was like a rabbit pendant right oh okay and um yeah so that was like it was

1435
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:57,280
like a really popular book it was an international sensation did that happen that yes um cool and

1436
02:13:57,280 --> 02:14:04,400
there but there was like a due to some like weird like the guy who like won the contest with an

1437
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:10,880
asterisk there's an asterisk on he won it um but he like he got the hair and he like used it as

1438
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:17,680
startup capital to start a company and he basically like self-funded a video game sequel

1439
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:24,400
to masquerade that that purported to also tell you where you could find the golden hair

1440
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:30,960
that's so cool well it was awful it was a terrible game and probably it was a scam and probably

1441
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:38,240
there was no fuck there is a great fucking video on youtube about this um youtube.com

1442
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:46,160
this sword quest otari or is that something else wait um um was this an old video game it's yeah

1443
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:55,280
it's all like the old freaking otari or whatever oh who is this okay i gotta look at my subscriptions

1444
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:59,120
right because i'm subscribed to this guy he does these like he's done a couple of like really

1445
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:03,280
interesting videos talking about like old games you've never heard of and shit and he is just like

1446
02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:10,080
it reminds me of that one AVGN episode where he's talking about sword quest which is a game

1447
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:16,320
that gave out real gold prizes for beating the otari game and like the chalice and the crown

1448
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:20,640
and the sword and whatever and like the the real mystery is like where the final prizes are because

1449
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:25,520
all the games didn't come out because they went bust it's like where's the fucking magical sword

1450

1498
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:30,800

it is okay this one's epic ben you're gonna love it it's uh ben saint says something leftist

1507
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:31,200
rest of the pcp this voicemail okay so let's hear what we have to say uh oh should i say something

1508
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:41,280
leftist beforehand yeah oh please do what do you guys um um i you know in my humble opinion in my

1509
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:51,840
humble opinion a wage theft not a fan not a fan of that i rest of the pcp you useless piece of

1510
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:59,600
shit you absolute waste of space and air you uneducated ignorant idiotic dumb swine you're an

1511
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:04,960
absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole the magnitude of your failure just now is

1512
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:11,040
so indescribably massive that 100 years into the future your name will be used as an insult by edgy

1513
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:16,480
12 year olds even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there's no conceivable

1514
02:22:16,480 --> 02:22:21,680
way they could have thought of a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did when jesus

1515
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:26,480
died first since he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing

1516
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:31,760
because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have

1517
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:37,360
never become reality after you die your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically

1518
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:42,400
researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure because

1519
02:22:42,400 --> 02:22:48,480
every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degraded them to a useless piece of trash

1520
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:54,800
into burden on society we might as well never have formed the pcp because surely not any amount of

1521
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:59,840
rotten adults would be able to affect the world as negatively as you just did the only reason i

1522
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:05,360
am not reporting you to the police as we speak is that i know for a fact that they're weak pathetic

1523
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:13,840
prisons will never be able to hold such an indescribable evil no wonder your dad just keeps going

1524
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:18,320
it turns out he was trying to guard the world from the colossal mistake he had created

1525
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:27,040
couldn't have said it better myself keep going uh come on that's all he got and stay out that's

1526
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:32,480
for starters that's for starters uh you know what got he you know what shit maybe wage theft's pretty

1527
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:38,000
good after all yeah i gotta agree i gotta agree on that it's been a pleasure as usual everybody uh
