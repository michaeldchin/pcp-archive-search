1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a-

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,720
That son of a-

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,720
That son of a-

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,720
That son of a-

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,720
That son of a-

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,720
Son of a-

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,720
Ah, hello, good morning!

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,720
Ah, good to morgan!

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,720
Good morning!

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
To an early morning,

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
PCP, I am up at five?

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
Well, actually I woke up at three.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
I didn't mean to wake up until five, but I woke up early.

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,720
Oh, so you woke up, I was assuming you would stay up.

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
For such an early-

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,720
No, not this time, I woke up-

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,720
I had stayed up all night the previous night,

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,720
so I wanted to go to bed early last night,

19
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,720
and then wake up early this morning.

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,720
I appreciate you agreeing to move the episode earlier.

21
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,720
The reason why I wanted to record

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,720
early this morning

23
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,720
is because I want daylight.

24
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,720
I wanted to record early this morning,

25
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,720
because I want daylight.

26
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,720
I wanted to record early this morning,

27
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,720
because I want daylight.

28
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,720
I want daylight.

29
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,720
I wanted to record before daylight

30
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,720
and have daylight available.

31
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Big day for me.

32
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
I'm gonna try and record that video

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
that I've been teasing

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
forever.

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
I think I'm gonna try and make today the day, yeah.

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Yeah, alright.

37
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
That's good.

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
That's what I wanted the daylight for.

39
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
Yeah, I'm moving

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
two days from now,

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
so I

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
don't know if I'll be able to do anything tomorrow,

43
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
because there's been like guys

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
working in my house, like doing renovations

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
on the building,

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
and they come during the week,

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
and so on tomorrow's Monday, so they might be

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
all around making noise

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
and stuff.

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
They might, they might.

51
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
So I don't know if I will be able to

52
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
do anything today, but

53
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
or tomorrow.

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,720
So I'm gonna try and do it all today,

55
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
and just see how it goes, see how it works out.

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm pretty nervous.

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm scared. What if it's bad?

58
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
I don't know.

59
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
How many hours of recording do you think

60
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
it will take to get through?

61
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
I don't know.

62
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
I could see it.

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
I don't know.

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
It could take all day.

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
It could take multiple days.

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
I might not be able to finish.

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
But I'm not sure.

68
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
There's nothing wrong with like

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
having the second part

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
of the video, and you just say,

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
yeah, I'm somewhere else now. Okay, continuing.

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Yeah, it wouldn't be,

73
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
it wouldn't be the worst thing

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
in the world.

75
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
I want to continue to be cagey about it.

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
I don't want to say exactly what it is

77
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
until it comes out.

78
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
But I have, let's just say

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
I had to make

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
a prop.

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
And the

82
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
prop will be used

83
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
during the video.

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
He's going to shove a dildo up his ass.

85
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
It will be, this is my only fans

86
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
announcement.

87
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
The prop will be used

88
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
and irrevocably altered during

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
the video. And so should I have to

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
re-record, I would need to make it

91
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
again, which would, I mean,

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
it would probably take me a day to

93
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
remake it, which would be annoying, but

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
it's fine.

95
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
I would do it.

96
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Damn, what else

97
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
do I have to say about that?

98
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Oh,

99
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
I bought a

100
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
man, I've been trying to get the

101
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
lighting right, and that's been

102
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
weird, because I have my

103
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
all right,

104
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
let me explain. I have my overhead

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
light, which is just,

106
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
you know,

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
regular, I think they're incandescent bulbs

108
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
in a lamp on the ceiling.

109
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
And I thought that would be fine.

110
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
But then when I tried to do some

111
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
test filming, things were

112
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
it's not the

113
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
thing, you could see everything, but

114
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
the colors were washed out. I think there wasn't

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
enough light.

116
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
I think my eyes are adjusted to it, but I

117
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
think the light is too dim for

118
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
the colors to be

119
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
visible. Yeah, the lighting

120
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
a set or whatever.

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
It's so much brighter

122
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
than you would imagine.

123
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
It's funny,

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
compared it with

126
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
that and an extra light, and

127
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
when I don't have the extra light,

128
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
the image looks just as

129
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
bright, but it's just more colorful

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
when the second light is

131
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
on it, is the only real

132
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
difference. And I think the colors

133
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
are important.

134
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
I had

135
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
considered ordering a ring light

136
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
or something, and I had put it off

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
and put it off and I never did it, because I thought

138
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
maybe I didn't need it. Turns out I did need it.

139
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
But it was too late,

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
it wouldn't get here in time, so I went to the

141
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
hardware store and I picked up

142
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
an LED work light,

143
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
which had a

144
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
it was one of the brighter ones they had, and it

145
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
had a nice middle of the road

146
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
temperature, like light

147
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
temperature.

148
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
So it's pretty good,

149
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
it works, it's what I'm using

150
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
to light the scene,

151
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
and it did make the colors pop, and it looked okay.

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
The problem is

153
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
that it was really bright, and it's

154
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
not bright enough that I could, but it's not

155
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
bright enough that I can put it a long distance away.

156
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
So I have to put it fairly

157
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
close to me to light the shot,

158
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
and it is

159
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
um,

160
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
it's bright that at that distance

161
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
it glares off of me, and it

162
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
casts a big shadow behind

163
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
me on the...

164
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
almost.

165
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Yeah, and that's bad.

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
That's not good, it doesn't look good, so

167
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
I tried

168
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Did you put a piece of paper

169
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
in front of it to diffuse it?

170
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Yeah, I tried that,

171
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
it didn't really

172
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
it didn't really make a difference,

173
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
you know, to really diffuse light

174
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
you actually have to shine it

175
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
on like a big

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
on like a big piece of paper

177
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
or something.

178
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Some of those, the lights

179
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
that I've seen, they have

180
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
like the light, and then like

181
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
an umbrella, like a big

182
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
cone that goes around it

183
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
and at the end of that is like...

184
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
The softbox sort of things.

185
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Yeah.

186
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
I tried to sort of make an artificial one,

187
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
I tried to, I cut out some cardboard

188
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
and I made a thing to fix on the light

189
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
and I put aluminum foil

190
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
with the idea being

191
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
that it would sort of reflect

192
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
the extra light

193
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
that was going to the sides, reflect

194
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
and sort of keep it in this like sort of cone

195
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
that I built, and sort of direct it

196
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
straight forward, so that I could put

197
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
the light further back

198
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
but have more of the light

199
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
shine on me in a more narrow

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
direction

201
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
to light the scene just as well

202
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
from a further distance back

203
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
and it didn't really

204
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
make much of a difference, I think it was

205
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
kind of a waste of time.

206
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I think...

207
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Okay, the alternative

208
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
was leaving my window open because I do get

209
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
bright sunlight through my window.

210
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
The problems with that

211
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
is that, one, I have to record

212
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
during daylight hours.

213
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Two,

214
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
it's variable if there's like cloud coverage

215
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
which is a little annoying.

216
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Yeah.

217
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Three, it's actually,

218
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
the sunlight is not directly

219
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
on me, but it's nevertheless

220
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
bright enough that there's sort of

221
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
it sort of glares off me, it sort of gives

222
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
me sort of white highlights on my forehead

223
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
and stuff if I leave the windows open

224
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
and that's not good.

225
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
So, before I try

226
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
anything today, I'm going to try

227
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
and I have some sort of like see-through

228
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
gauzy curtains, like a purple one

229
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
and a black one. I think

230
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I'm going to try and just put up very

231
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
thin curtains and see if maybe that

232
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
diffuses or softens the light enough

233
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
that I don't get the glare while still

234
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
lighting the shot well enough with

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
like, you know, the sunlight

236
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
and I think that

237
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
might be the best.

238
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
I think that's going to be

239
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
probably how I do it

240
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
because I just want the shot to look

241
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
not ugly, right? It's not

242
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
anything fancy.

243
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
I just want it not, I want it not to be

244
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
glaring and I want it not to have

245
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
like a strong backshadow behind me which

246
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
would be distracting.

247
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
I want the light to look natural.

248
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
I just want a nice neutral

249
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
natural, bright

250
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
shot.

251
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
You know?

252
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Surprisingly difficult to achieve sometimes.

253
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Yeah, the very like default

254
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
nothing going on shot is very

255
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
hard to get happening.

256
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
I think in

257
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
when I did like all the stuff in my

258
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
hypocrite like skits

259
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
I didn't invest in a light.

260
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I had like a lamp

261
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
and sometimes I would place it somewhere

262
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
and it would do.

263
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
It would be like very

264
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
very like DIY

265
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
and then I would only do a skit for like a few

266
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
seconds so it's

267
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I changed camera angles.

268
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
I don't think any of my shots

269
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
looked like terrible except when they did.

270
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Yeah.

271
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
But I did not have like a professional setup.

272
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
It's just about getting the right

273
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
amount of light mainly.

274
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Yeah.

275
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
So if you have anything fancy like having like

276
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
ooh a nice little

277
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
what do you call

278
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
is it called an edge light?

279
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
You know when they try to be fancy and they have

280
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
a little like colored light behind

281
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
the subject that sort of gives them like a little

282
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
like you know colored sort of outline

283
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
on one side of them.

284
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
And if you're like a really fancy streamer you have

285
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
two of them you have nice bisexual

286
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
lighting so you've got one edge light

287
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
one pink edge light on one side of you

288
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
and one blue edge light on the other side of

289
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
it up pink on one side blue on the other.

290
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Yes I've seen such things.

291
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
And you get on twitch you get on discord

292
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
you start.

293
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I was wondering like

294
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
I was wondering like

295
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
the lights

296
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
are always those colors

297
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
like why is there no like

298
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
green and orange streamer?

299
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
You know there's

300
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
when I think about edge lighting

301
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
the first example

302
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
that pops into my head

303
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
I know you've seen some

304
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
folding ideas Dan Olson videos

305
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
I've seen all of them yeah.

306
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
You've seen all of them okay so the one where

307
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
he talks about

308
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
not the flat earth documentary

309
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
no not in search of a flat earth

310
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
the other one

311
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
where he's talking about that other documentary

312
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
made by the Christian people

313
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
and they interviewed a bunch of physicists

314
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
and they didn't tell them what it was for

315
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
they had a hideous

316
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
green edge light

317
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
that they put on everyone

318
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
to make them look I don't know

319
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
sciency or something

320
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
sciency or sinister or slime core

321
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
I don't know

322
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
who knows what they were thinking

323
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
yeah

324
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
so

325
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
not doing anything like that

326
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
so I think I'm gonna have to

327
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
rely on the sun

328
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
which just means I have to

329
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
get everything recorded between

330
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
you know maybe like

331
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
7pm and probably like

332
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
7pm or 8pm

333
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
or something like that

334
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
the sun is like

335
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
I mean you have to be very lucky

336
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
to get a very long stretch

337
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
of the sun not being

338
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
interrupted by clouds

339
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
or anything

340
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
yeah

341
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
if you know it's a really nice day

342
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
then it will be alright but like

343
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
it's not gonna be like fully sunny

344
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
I think there probably will be some moments

345
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
when the clouds go overhead

346
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
and I think maybe I can just

347
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
either just deal with it

348
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
or maybe I can do a little bit

349
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
of adjustment in posts

350
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
to sort of brighten things

351
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
when it's dimmer

352
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
because the sun is extremely powerful

353
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
and like it fills the room

354
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
it makes everything so much brighter

355
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
the camera is like oh this is great

356
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
plenty of light as soon as the cloud comes up

357
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
all of that light goes really

358
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
like really far down on the camera

359
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
it's sort of like maybe it loses focus

360
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
as well if it's autofocus

361
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
you should definitely have

362
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
a light on you at all times

363
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
as well

364
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
I am going to have

365
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
I'm gonna use the LED work light

366
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
it looks pretty good

367
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
it's a good light

368
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
it's just too much at too close

369
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
and the back shadow

370
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
I need the sun to avoid

371
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
I need the work lights for it to be bright enough

372
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
that the colors aren't washed out

373
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
the back shadow from the work light

374
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
but the sun

375
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
the sun itself

376
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
gives sort of an uneven light

377
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
like you can see like I'm very much lit

378
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
more from one side than another

379
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
and that's not good

380
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
and I'll leave my room light on

381
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
just because why not

382
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
if you get a mirror in the room

383
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
you bounce that sunlight all over the place

384
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
oh you know what

385
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
that's what they do in like

386
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
to make a room like in

387
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Victorian era or just

388
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
an old tiny room before lamps

389
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
and stuff

390
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
were that easy to use

391
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
get a huge mirror

392
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
brightens up a space

393
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
hmm I would have to adjust

394
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
the position of the mirror

395
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
as the day progress in order to

396
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
like continually move

397
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
but yeah I don't have a big mirror

398
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
but I mean I could

399
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
I have a cork board

400
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
in aluminum foil

401
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
and place it where the sun is shining

402
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
through the window

403
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
I don't think I actually

404
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
really get like direct sunlight

405
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
into my room

406
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm not sure if I could really do that

407
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
well the thing with a mirror is like whatever light is in the room

408
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
will be bounced around

409
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
more

410
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
so it's not like you don't need to direct

411
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
some beam like in a video game

412
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
you just need it around so that

413
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
if the light is hitting it

414
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
somehow like bouncing off a wall

415
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
into the mirror it bounces back on to the wall

416
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
makes the wall brighter

417
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
you know what? I've got aluminum foil

418
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
I've got my cork board

419
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm gonna do it

420
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
right now

421
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
just and I'll just see

422
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
we'll just see if it doesn't

423
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
you know I tried this with the artificial

424
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
the fake the DIY

425
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
softbox that didn't really

426
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
work out that's okay

427
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
that's fine

428
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
I'm just imagining

429
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
like your whole room is like

430
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
covered in foil

431
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
you're wearing like a mirror bowl suit

432
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
my whole room is covered in

433
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
bits of scrap paper

434
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
little pieces of tape

435
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
one corner is covered in

436
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
boxes

437
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
you know because I'm moving as well

438
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
as doing all this so I'm packing

439
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
nervous about moving

440
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
my current house

441
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
but the one thing that it does have

442
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
is that I do have privacy

443
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
I don't have to deal with

444
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
other people in this disgusting little

445
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
hole that I live in

446
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
is that not true for the

447
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
new place?

448
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
well it seems like the new place is gonna be a little more

449
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
like my old place where it's kind of

450
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
it's not it's like a house

451
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
you know

452
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
right now I live in an apartment

453
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
building

454
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
with you know everyone else lives on the

455
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
second floor

456
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
you live on a different floor and I hardly ever see them

457
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
I might sometimes pass them

458
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
in the kitchen and other than that we have nothing to do with each other

459
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
I might

460
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
have to see other people more

461
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
in my new place

462
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
and I don't know

463
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I feel like that's probably good actually

464
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
but

465
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
it still makes me

466
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
anxious

467
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
what if I have to explain what I do

468
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
honestly yeah

469
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
I mean you remember

470
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
I told you I went to that birthday party

471
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
and mentioned being a

472
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
podcaster and I

473
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
felt so bad

474
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
I felt like I was a zoo animal

475
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
that has escaped from its

476
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
enclosure

477
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
I'm sorry is this tinfoil annoying?

478
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
I can't hear the tinfoil

479
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
I think discord

480
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
or something might be noise

481
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
removing it but you are

482
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
getting quieter because you're doing it

483
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
it's because I'm not facing

484
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
the microphone

485
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
well I will talk about something for a minute

486
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
you may have noticed

487
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
the RuneScape video I put up

488
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
on my pick and take

489
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
first comment

490
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
you liked it

491
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
you gave me a little like on that

492
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
yeah

493
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
yeah that's

494
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I made it mostly for people

495
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
who like you who are like

496
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
what huh what's RuneScape

497
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
I don't know hardly nothing

498
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
about the mechanics of RuneScape

499
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
yeah it wasn't really mean to be

500
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
like here's how RuneScape works

501
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
but

502
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
I just wanted to like document this little thing

503
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
go watch the video if you're curious

504
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
it's a little challenge run

505
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm doing on

506
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
old school RuneScape

507
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
are you gonna make follow up videos

508
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
is it gonna be like a series

509
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
if there's interesting things

510
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
to talk about I probably will

511
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
if I do like follow ups

512
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
I'll probably put them on Hippocrite

513
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
mostly because

514
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
on the off chance that

515
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
it blows up or is otherwise

516
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
just well received

517
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
I want it to be on the channel

518
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
that has monetization enabled

519
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,720
instead of the one that doesn't

520
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
take not have that

521
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
I remembered because

522
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
you know I made

523
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
9-11 jokes a couple times

524
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
in some videos

525
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
like a while ago

526
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
I think I may have talked about it already

527
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
but a while ago my channel was just like

528
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
super flagged saying oh you

529
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
your videos promote

530
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
terrorism

531
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
because you said 9-11 and you showed footage

532
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
in like a joke video

533
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
it's because you wrote in your diary

534
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
we're gonna shoot up the school that one time

535
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
they heard about your principal

536
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
called YouTube and said this kid

537
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
this kid's trouble

538
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
that's so true

539
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
we gotta get her on something

540
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
we gotta get

541
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
get them on the

542
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
the YouTube

543
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
9-11 jokes there

544
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
9-11 jokes

545
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
I think it's literally just because in those jokes

546
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
I have footage of the thing

547
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
happening on a green screen with a Kirby

548
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
plush or something

549
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
and they're like that's

550
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
that's

551
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
that's bad they didn't

552
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
think about it and now my channel

553
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
can't get monetized

554
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
and I think I repealed it

555
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
I said please give me money please

556
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
and they said no

557
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I even took down the videos and they just

558
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
didn't do anything so

559
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
what's up with

560
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
your channel just has a black mark on it

561
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I think it's just a black mark

562
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
and also like following up

563
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
it's like we'll get back to you in like

564
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
117,000 months

565
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
and it's like okay well

566
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
it's the give and take channel

567
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
I'm not missing out on that much

568
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
revenue so fuck it

569
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
I don't wanna bother

570
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
so if any future

571
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
RuneScape videos I make will go on Hippocrite

572
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
cause that's the video game channel anyway

573
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
and uh yeah

574
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
I don't know how I would make a series of it

575
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Hippocrite's back baby

576
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
no no it is just an illusion

577
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
the ppt is back

578
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
I'm making a video you made a video

579
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
it's just like it's just like old times

580
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
it's just like old times

581
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
you were you were so known

582
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
for your video making

583
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I mean

584
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
I mean I mean you say

585
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
you say that like a joke and yet I am almost

586
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
certainly better known for the videos that I made

587
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
than anything else

588
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
when I think of like classic like oh

589
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
the horseshoe crew and everyone in it

590
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
um you were like

591
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
the art guy of tbap

592
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
as well as the co-host

593
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Nate was the edit guy of tbap

594
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
and then Nate went on to make videos

595
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
before you did

596
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
so I was always like oh Ben was the art guy

597
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
yeah I mean that's how I

598
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
kinda see myself

599
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
but uh I mean

600
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
I told you that the reason why I was

601
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
the reason why I resolved

602
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
that I should make another video

603
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
make another video

604
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
and show us what you got

605
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
remember that

606
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
you don't remember the cutie mark

607
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
kerfuffle episode 2

608
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
oh well I don't remember

609
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
that line from it

610
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
that's when

611
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
keg standard pushes give and take out

612
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
onto the dance floor

613
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
oh

614
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
no no

615
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
no it's not that

616
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
I remember that happening

617
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
he pushes anypony

618
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
in front of his computer

619
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
to make a shitty react video

620
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
oh yeah that's why I don't remember

621
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
because I don't care

622
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
oh yeah okay

623
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
make another video

624
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
okay

625
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
no no no no no

626
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
it's when

627
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
you say make another video

628
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
and show us what you got

629
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
and then it becomes a give and take video

630
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
and then the head pops out

631
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
of the edge of the screen

632
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
and goes like

633
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
hi everybody

634
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
it's me I'm back

635
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm back and better than ever

636
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
oh my god it's so

637
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
the fans wanted it so much

638
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
and then the rest of us

639
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
all pop out from the sides and we go

640
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Gibbon and you go ah god

641
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
yeah

642
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
I remember that bit

643
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
oh jesus christ

644
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
yeah

645
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
you don't know why you're there

646
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
but we really want you to continue

647
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
okay

648
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
that was a

649
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
how did I get on that

650
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
subject?

651
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
the reason why

652
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
I was

653
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
inspired to resolve to make a video

654
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
was because Maryweather

655
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
messaged me to tell me that he thought

656
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
that I should make more videos because he likes my other ones

657
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
and I said

658
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
well that's it

659
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
okay

660
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
this guy

661
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
I'll listen to Maryweather

662
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Maryweather is no fool

663
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
I'm almost done

664
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
with my mirror

665
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
yes it's all coming together

666
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
oh god

667
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
what are you doing?

668
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
you're wrapping tinfoil around

669
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
like

670
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
stabbing it onto a cork board

671
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
no I'm just wrapping

672
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
I'm wrapping it around the edges

673
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
you know what I'll take a picture

674
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
it's complete

675
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
it's done

676
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
let me take a picture of a mirror

677
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
post-selfie

678
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
it's not a clear image

679
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
but you can kind of see my skin tone

680
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
reflected in it

681
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
that's disgusting

682
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
and you know what I feel about my skin tone

683
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
you know how I feel about my skin tone

684
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
we don't want to get my fucking

685
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
oh there's a

686
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
a secret prop that would give away the

687
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
video was almost in the

688
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
shot

689
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
that's fucking scary

690
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
you can see

691
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
actually this is funny

692
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
in

693
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
the in the shot

694
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
which I'm going to post in just a second

695
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
in the mirror

696
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
you can see some green reflected

697
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
and that's the

698
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
that's the jug of slime

699
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
that I made

700
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
that's my leftover slime

701
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
from when I made those bottles

702
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
for the rfck people

703
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
it's

704
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
in a jug and it's sitting on my

705
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
bookcase here which I put

706
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
in the middle of my room to stand

707
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
the light on because I didn't want it shining on me from the floor

708
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
I wanted it at

709
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
middle height

710
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
um

711
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
post in general

712
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
oh yeah

713
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
a rectangle

714
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
oh it's a rectangle alright

715
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
is that harmonica in the bottom right?

716
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
harmonica?

717
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
oh that's the role of aluminum foil

718
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
that is empty

719
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
oh this is a lot bigger than I thought

720
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
glancing at it yes

721
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
it's probably like 2 feet by

722
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
3 or 4 feet

723
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
alright you got a mirror

724
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
no I've got a mirror

725
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
oh my god I can't see your reflection are you a vampire

726
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
you a vampire or something

727
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
oh no I gave it away the video

728
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
it's a video where I show that I'm a vampire now

729
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
proof that I'm a vampire

730
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,720
I'm getting into

731
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
the occult

732
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
and the conspiracies

733
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
and magic and shit

734
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
startin

735
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
ever since I became a vampire I just find

736
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
stuff so interesting

737
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
so fascinating

738
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
you're really playing with fire

739
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
filming during the day

740
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
yeah I gotta use that

741
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
sunlight for visibility but if even a little bit

742
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
of it directly shines on me I will be obliterated

743
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
this is why vampires can't make videos

744
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
this is my dedication

745
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
do vampires

746
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
not show up on film

747
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
is that a

748
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
I think that might be a thing with them

749
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
actually

750
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
it's always a question

751
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
because like

752
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
obviously when vampire mythology was created

753
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
mirrors were the only way

754
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
you could do such a thing

755
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
you could draw a picture of them

756
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
yeah

757
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
but like

758
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
there was no such thing as film

759
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
but

760
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
I think

761
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
since you can see a vampire physically

762
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
when you're looking at them

763
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
I would say that a camera would be able to take a picture

764
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
of a

765
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
of a vampire

766
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
but by that logic a mirror should be able

767
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
to see it because it's just light reflecting off

768
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
the mirror

769
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
mirror special

770
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
mirror special

771
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
it's the silver

772
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
wait but no

773
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
it's like silver oxide

774
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
is what is the

775
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
the compound

776
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
so you can't take it black and white

777
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
but you can't take a polaroid because it's a different chemical

778
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
if you do it

779
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
DSLR

780
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
single lens reflex is where they have the mirror

781
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
come out of the way

782
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
you can look through the viewfinder

783
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
you see nothing you take a picture

784
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
there was a vampire there

785
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
because you're looking

786
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
what you're seeing through the viewfinder is

787
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
the mirrored version

788
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
and then the mirror slides out the way to take the picture

789
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
that would be a cool scene

790
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
fascinating

791
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
it would be a cool movie if that happened

792
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
and then the whole movie is explaining

793
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
how that worked

794
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
and why

795
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
alright my mirror is done

796
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm gonna put it over here on the side

797
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
lean it against the wall until such time

798
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
that's

799
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
that's good

800
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
that's exciting I wonder if that will help

801
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
achieve a

802
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
one issue is that

803
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
the

804
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
the shot is a bit

805
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
brighter on the side

806
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
with the window

807
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
and I

808
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
wasn't able to completely

809
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
fix that unfortunately

810
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
maybe this will help

811
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
hmm

812
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
well

813
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
that's what I've been doing

814
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
I just woke up

815
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
well not just woke up

816
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
I went on a dog walk

817
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
I came back

818
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
and I did my morning workout routine

819
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
I had breakfast

820
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
and I had a shower

821
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
and then I'm immediately podcasting

822
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
so it's a pretty

823
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
productive morning for me

824
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
yeah

825
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
my breakfast today

826
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
is

827
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
a box of almond milk

828
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
I'm trying to drink

829
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
every fluid

830
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
that I have in bottles and stuff

831
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
to maximize pee

832
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
to

833
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
so that I don't have to move it

834
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
in boxes and stuff

835
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
you know what I just finished the first

836
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm gonna crack open another one

837
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
I'm gonna crack open another

838
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
almond milk right

839
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
you just you're gonna store your almond milk

840
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
in your stomach sack

841
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
sorry actually

842
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
this is not almond milk

843
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
this is an almond non-dairy beverage

844
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
from Kirkland

845
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
what the hell does that mean

846
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
I don't know

847
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
but it doesn't go bad

848
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
it doesn't expire

849
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
I found this out the hard way

850
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
almond milk will expire

851
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
whatever the hell this stuff is

852
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
as long as you don't open it

853
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
as long as it's sealed

854
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
it keeps forever

855
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
why does almonds make milk

856
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
I understand why mammals make milk

857
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
because it's like a protein thing

858
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
for a baby to easily

859
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
ingest

860
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
and almonds

861
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
but like why are they dairy

862
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
if they how do they expire why is it milk

863
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
is this a real question

864
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
I don't know I've never looked into what almond milk is

865
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
I just assume you squeeze the almond

866
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
and milk comes out

867
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
do you think that like the almond lactates

868
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
and that's where the almond milk comes from

869
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
I don't assume it has breasts

870
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
I just assume like why is there

871
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
milk inside like a coconut

872
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
like what is going on

873
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
a very funny

874
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
a very funny

875
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
thing to even wonder about

876
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
honestly

877
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
they make almond milk they just soak the almonds

878
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
in water and it leeches

879
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
out some nutrients

880
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
and that makes the almond milk

881
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
okay why does it go bad though

882
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
I don't know

883
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
because it's freaking

884
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
I don't know

885
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
it's got fat in it

886
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
it's got fat in it that would go rancid

887
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
I see

888
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
yeah

889
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
you know they had almond milk in the middle ages

890
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
like medieval people drank almond milk

891
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
how about that

892
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
you think about it as some alternative milks

893
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
new age soy

894
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
soy

895
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
but no

896
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
they had almond milk in

897
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
I know this from Max Miller's Tasting History

898
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
and I don't know it because I am stupid

899
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
that's right

900
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
that's right Gib

901
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
okay

902
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
almonds with tits

903
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
that's the new craze on the old

904
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
on the old art world

905
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
I liked your theory better

906
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
I never thought about it before

907
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
but when I was thinking

908
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
are they like tiny coconuts

909
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
is there milk inside

910
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
I understand not knowing

911
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
how almond milk is made

912
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
it's just funny to be like

913
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
wait

914
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
I know mammals make milk

915
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
but why do almonds make milk

916
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
not what is almond milk

917
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
made of where does it come from

918
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
how is it made but why do almonds make milk

919
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
as though it is a natural

920
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
thing that the almond does

921
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
that's what I think of milk

922
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
it's not like you soak a cow

923
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
in water to make milk

924
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
that's true

925
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
but you know coconut milk

926
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
you just crack open the coconut and it comes out

927
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
so it's more akin to that

928
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
it's more like blood

929
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
it's more like almond blood honestly

930
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
but we don't say that

931
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
for marketing reasons

932
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
almond blood would be cooler

933
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
I think also

934
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
what confused me

935
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
is that milk-ing is like a verb

936
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
you probably milk an almond

937
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
so it's like

938
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
you soak an almond

939
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
almond like

940
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
liquid residue

941
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
almond juice

942
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
would be

943
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
well you don't juice it either

944
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
you don't exactly juice it

945
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
almond runoff

946
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
it's almond runoff

947
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
it's more like a tea

948
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
it's more like a tea

949
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
almond stew

950
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
I'm gonna try

951
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
I have a number of verbal tics

952
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
that I want to avoid

953
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
when filming today

954
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
and one of them is

955
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
I don't want to not say um

956
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
I want to not say like

957
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
I want to not say um

958
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
I want to not go

959
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
after I laugh which I always do and I hate that

960
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
you go what after you laugh

961
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
what after you laugh

962
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
did you not

963
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
like I suck in air through my teeth

964
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
I don't know listen for it

965
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
I remember you talking about that before

966
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
I did talk about how much I hate it

967
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
yeah I just have

968
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
just make sure to blow instead of suck

969
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
I suck in air through my teeth

970
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
in an audible way

971
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
but um

972
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
like pausing and saying um

973
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
and ah is like the worst

974
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
and like like like

975
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
I should really avoid those

976
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
I mean I cannot

977
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
to some extent I can edit them out

978
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
later um

979
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
but

980
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
if they're all through

981
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
if they're peppered all through my speech then that's bad

982
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
you might have to do multiple tics then

983
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
because it's so natural

984
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
I think it's um

985
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
the

986
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
like uh

987
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
um

988
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
uh

989
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
or

990
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
beep boop

991
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
you're making space for yourself to think of the next word

992
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
so like if you have a sentence

993
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
in your brain

994
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
uh you can say it

995
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
yeah

996
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,720
uh I can I can I can always

997
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
just pause and think what am I going to say next

998
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
and then formulate

999
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
that and then say it and then edit out

1000
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
the pause

1001
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
uh

1002
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
that's true that's true

1003
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
um I want to

1004
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
yeah

1005
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
I want to sound a little more

1006
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
considered

1007
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,720
I don't want to sound completely like off the cuff

1008
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
I don't have a script

1009
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
but I do have notes

1010
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
that I'm going to be referring to

1011
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
I think I feel like I'm going into too much detail

1012
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,720
you know what

1013
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
uh nevermind

1014
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
I don't want to talk about this anymore

1015
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,720
people are going to guess what it is

1016
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
I've got a small

1017
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
story it's called

1018
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
I forgot my steam

1019
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
password and it sucks

1020
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
hmm

1021
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
but then I remembered it but here's the story

1022
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
that was a great story

1023
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
the story goes I forgot

1024
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
my steam password I'm like okay

1025
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
I do the steam recovery like oh I

1026
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
can't remember my password

1027
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
put in your email and

1028
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
we'll send you an email about it

1029
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
but first do this

1030
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
capture

1031
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
it says click on fire hydrants

1032
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,720
I click all of them

1033
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
I guess I missed one I click

1034
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
the crosswalks I click the traffic lights

1035
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
I click the buses

1036
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
it just keeps giving me captures

1037
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
and after I've done like eight

1038
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
it says invalid response

1039
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
you redo the capture

1040
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
yeah

1041
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
so I do another eight captures

1042
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
and I do it again

1043
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
I make sure to not make any mistakes

1044
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
and it's not right

1045
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
again

1046
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
and then I do it again and again

1047
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
and then I'm like you've done too many captures wrong

1048
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
you're probably a robot

1049
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
try again tomorrow try again later

1050
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
and so I couldn't

1051
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
I couldn't play my game

1052
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
I couldn't play my games

1053
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
and the capture

1054
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
system is fucked

1055
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
and I was like okay there's something

1056
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
definitely wrong you failed the reverse

1057
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
turning test I did

1058
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
there's something wrong

1059
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
I realized like

1060
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
there was no reason it didn't work

1061
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
there was no reason on my end that it didn't work

1062
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,720
it just wasn't going through

1063
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
and so I tried different browsers

1064
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
for this capture thing

1065
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
no browsers worked

1066
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
I tried looking up like

1067
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
what the fuck

1068
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
what do I do about this

1069
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
and the

1070
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
you have a problem with capture so you go on google

1071
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
and you type in what the fuck

1072
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
what the fuck

1073
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
well they're watching me at all times

1074
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
they know what's going on

1075
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
they probably do yeah

1076
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
so

1077
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
I look and there are like tutorials

1078
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
like oh steen giving you this problem

1079
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
from like

1080
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
2017, 2019, 2020, 2021

1081
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
2022

1082
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
this problem is still around

1083
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
capture just sometimes doesn't work

1084
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
and

1085
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
there is no solution that

1086
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,720
worked

1087
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
okay there's no solution

1088
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
I guess I have to go to steam

1089
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
some other way and like ask them

1090
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
for help but they don't have

1091
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
customer support for steam

1092
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
you go to their thing and it's like

1093
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
okay I need help getting my account back

1094
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
and they send me to the same page

1095
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
where it's like input your email address

1096
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
or your phone number and

1097
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
do this capture and that's where it all breaks down

1098
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,720
so I was like okay

1099
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
I guess I gotta go to

1100
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
twitter and at

1101
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
steam hoping that they would respond

1102
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
but like it's steam

1103
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
it's valve they're not gonna fucking say anything

1104
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
I did make a tweet

1105
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
but then I remembered my password and I got in

1106
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
so it's like

1107
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
all for nothing

1108
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
well I mean what it does

1109
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
tell me is that if I do forget my password

1110
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
there's no way I can

1111
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
there's nothing I could do if I could call

1112
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
a number if I could email somebody

1113
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
that'd be something but if the

1114
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
capture doesn't work and there's no way

1115
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
for the capture to work

1116
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
well I will forever be

1117
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
locked out of my steam account and I don't know how

1118
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
what about would do anything about it

1119
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
what about some sort of do you have like

1120
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
two factor authentication with like Authy

1121
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
or something I do but like it

1122
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
asked me to like if I want to

1123
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
change my password I need to do the capture

1124
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
hmm

1125
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
I couldn't figure it out

1126
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
maybe there's a way to do it

1127
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
but it sucks because

1128
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
so wait I don't understand

1129
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
why did the captures fail

1130
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
I don't know I did the capture

1131
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720
like it comes up with a little white box

1132
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
so click on these things until there's

1133
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
none left and then you say

1134
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
next and then you do it again

1135
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
a few times and then it's like

1136
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
okay then the box disappears

1137
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
and then on the page

1138
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
where it says like I'm not

1139
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
a robot and like

1140
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
all that an error message comes up

1141
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
saying you did not

1142
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
the capture could not be completed

1143
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
there's like a string of

1144
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
like numbers and letters

1145
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
like here's the ID

1146
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
for this error

1147
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
but it's a different every time so it's like

1148
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
an individual case thing

1149
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
um

1150
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
I would have taken a picture of it

1151
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
but I forgot

1152
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
if it ever happens again

1153
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
I will

1154
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
scream about it

1155
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,720
I've done the capture and I've seen

1156
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
um

1157
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
fire hydrants, traffic lights

1158
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,720
crosswalks

1159
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
pick out the bus

1160
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
pick out the plane

1161
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
pick out the sea plane

1162
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
pick out the train

1163
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
I saw a new one

1164
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
the other day

1165
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
recently I've been seeing

1166
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
it's like pick out the giraffes

1167
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
pick out the

1168
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
horse made of clouds

1169
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
was one

1170
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
pick out the

1171
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
horse facing right or horse facing left

1172
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
uh

1173
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
and then the creepiest one that I

1174
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
really hate is pick out the lion

1175
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
with its eyes open or the lions

1176
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
with its eyes closed

1177
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
and those are creepy because

1178
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
the images that they show like they show lions

1179
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
but

1180
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
I think a lot of them are like they've been

1181
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
digitally altered to have the lions

1182
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
eyes like appear open or closed

1183
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
and like they look weird they look almost

1184
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
like their eyes have been sewn shut sometimes

1185
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
these uncanny pictures of lions

1186
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
uh

1187
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
and I'm not a fan of them

1188
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
why does AI need to know

1189
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
whether a lion has its eyes open or not

1190
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
what are they doing over there

1191
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
because it's something that a robot

1192
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
is bad at

1193
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
identifying

1194
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
in theory

1195
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,720
but like I understand the road stuff

1196
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
is like practical oh we can use all that data

1197
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,720
from all the billions of people

1198
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,720
finishing captures we collect that data

1199
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
we can say okay robot

1200
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
this is what a fire hydrant looks like

1201
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
uh the humans have verified it

1202
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
and the human the robot will be like

1203
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
okay now I know what that looks like

1204
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
I can drive a car now

1205
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
but like what is the lion for

1206
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
I know

1207
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
I know how to like stare down a lion now

1208
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
what what what purpose

1209
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
wait a minute is that

1210
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
is that why it's like fire hydrants

1211
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
traffic lights crosswalks

1212
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
it's to train AI to drive

1213
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
it's to train AI to understand

1214
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
and recognize things on the road

1215
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
so it doesn't like drive wrong

1216
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,720
and that's why the the images

1217
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
are often like very hard to

1218
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
determine for a robot but like like

1219
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,720
they're blurry but a human can understand

1220
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
through context like yeah that part is a crosswalk

1221
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
wait a minute

1222
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
okay hang on I don't understand

1223
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,720
this because

1224
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
it knows which

1225
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
pictures are crosswalks

1226
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
and fire hydrants like it knows

1227
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
the answer and it knows

1228
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
and that's it's using this to verify that

1229
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
you are human so how is it learning

1230
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
anything from having you pick out the answers

1231
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
that it already knows

1232
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
um probably because the images

1233
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
were like screened

1234
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
by a human first before they go into the

1235
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
machine then it already

1236
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
knows no no no I mean like

1237
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
a person says okay this is

1238
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
well

1239
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
you know I've heard

1240
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
that that is the why it does that

1241
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
I don't know how it works that way

1242
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
maybe maybe like cross

1243
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
like maybe it's like a

1244
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
like a um

1245
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
the majority of people say this

1246
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
therefore that's the correct

1247
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
one

1248
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
like it it calculates based on

1249
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
all the inputs

1250
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
I suppose maybe

1251
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
something yeah it could be

1252
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
it could be something like that

1253
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
like there's it doesn't like it only

1254
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
it decides what's a fire hydrant based

1255
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
on consensus yeah that might be

1256
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,720
true

1257
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
that doesn't explain how

1258
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
like the first person who sees

1259
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720
a capture

1260
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,720
did they just get to decide

1261
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
like they click

1262
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
like nobody's clicked on this capture before

1263
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
this person clicks on

1264
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
this it says it's a fire hydrant

1265
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
the computer doesn't have any other data

1266
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
to cross reference it with to know

1267
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
whether that is the consensus or not so it just says

1268
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,720
yeah you're right yeah there would

1269
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,720
either have to be one guy or some guy

1270
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,720
who is picking out the images

1271
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
in the first place and being like this is

1272
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
a picture of a fire hydrant

1273
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
or there would it would have to be

1274
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720
showing you images

1275
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,720
that might have fire hydrants in them

1276
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,720
and then letting like internet

1277
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
consensus builds

1278
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
the consensus about where they the fire hydrant

1279
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
is

1280
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
maybe it's like a computer

1281
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
in like a self-driving car

1282
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,720
is taking pictures and sending them off

1283
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
like I don't know exactly

1284
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
what this is can we verify it with humans

1285
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
okay like this is

1286
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,720
a traffic light

1287
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
it's like the car is approaching a crosswalk

1288
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
and there are kids walking across the crosswalk

1289
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
and as it's driving it's like

1290
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720
hmm take a picture send it off to capture

1291
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,720
I need to verify whether there are kids and I need

1292
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
to swerve

1293
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
I need to know right now

1294
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
it's doing 70

1295
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,720
or super computer

1296
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,720
hang on

1297
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
waiting for a consensus

1298
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
waiting for a consensus to be reached

1299
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
we just got to lock people out of their camps

1300
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
so they do captures quick

1301
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,720
make sure the capture doesn't work

1302
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,720
so they can do it over and over again

1303
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
uh

1304
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,720
it doesn't work

1305
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,720
the technology will never work

1306
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
AI will never replace

1307
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
artists

1308
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
you know I had an idea

1309
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
what if

1310
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
the story of John Henry

1311
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
but

1312
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,720
it's about artists and

1313
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,720
paint and art AI

1314
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
you know

1315
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,720
I don't know John Henry

1316
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
John Henry was a

1317
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,720
I think he was probably a real person

1318
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,720
who has been mythologized somewhat

1319
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,720
he's sort of an American folk

1320
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,720
character who

1321
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,720
his thing is that he was a railroad worker

1322
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,720
and I guess they

1323
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
invented a fricking machine

1324
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
that was going to put all the railroad workers out of work

1325
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
and he like

1326
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,720
was so good at railroad

1327
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
building that he proved that man could

1328
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
beat the railroad machine

1329
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
because he built better than the machine

1330
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,720
I don't know whatever that's the story

1331
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,720
these horses coming over here thinking they can pull our carts

1332
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,720
better than I can

1333
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,720
well so then

1334
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
yeah

1335
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
I think he died

1336
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,720
I think the story is like

1337
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
he drove those railroad sparks

1338
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
so hard that yeah he beat the machine

1339
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
but he fucking died doing it

1340
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,720
but he proved something

1341
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
god damn it

1342
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
he proved that

1343
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,720
if you grow a human for so many years

1344
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
and then they die after one attempt

1345
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,720
they can beat a robot but it's not very good

1346
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,720
not very

1347
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
sustainable

1348
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
according to legend John Henry's prowess

1349
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,720
as a steel driver was measured in a race

1350
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,720
against a steam powered

1351
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
rock drilling machine

1352
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
a race that he won only to die in victory

1353
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
with hammer in hand as his heart gave out from stress

1354
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,720
okay

1355
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,720
that's really just saying the robot

1356
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,720
wins because it did die

1357
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,720
I think the idea there

1358
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
is not so much that

1359
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,720
like oh he proved that man is

1360
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,720
better than machine

1361
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,720
it's not so much an applejack

1362
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
at the end of the super speedy

1363
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,720
cider squeezy episode I was right all along

1364
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,720
you gotta make cider with love

1365
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
you gotta drive those rail spikes with love

1366
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
only a human can do that

1367
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,720
robots don't know how to drive rail spikes

1368
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,720
with love

1369
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,720
it's more of just sort of mythologizing

1370
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,720
or remembering

1371
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
this guy

1372
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,720
lived and died

1373
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,720
history

1374
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,720
the tide of progress

1375
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,720
ended up making this guy irrelevant

1376
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
but he won one

1377
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,720
glorious symbolic victory

1378
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
before he was

1379
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,720
overtaken by the march of time

1380
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,720
you know

1381
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
it's not a practical victory

1382
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
it's a

1383
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,720
symbolic one

1384
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,720
the whole discussion of AI art

1385
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
it absolutely will replace

1386
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,720
some kinds of artists

1387
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,720
jobs

1388
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,720
you can't replace art because it's like

1389
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,720
an emotional

1390
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
practice you do it because you feel good

1391
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,720
or something you feel emotions

1392
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,720
when you do it

1393
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
the capital

1394
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,720
you gain from having a job in the arts

1395
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
that might

1396
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,720
be in problem

1397
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,720
that's a capitalism thing though

1398
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,720
we gotta destroy capitalism

1399
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,720
you see

1400
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,720
and then we can do all the art we want

1401
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,720
and then the computers can do the advertising

1402
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,720
stuff

1403
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
they can make the movie posters

1404
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
and the illustrations on the books

1405
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,720
and then we can go in there

1406
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
and throw in the wall with our shit

1407
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,720
and then they

1408
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,720
and the computers

1409
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,720
can use the algorithm to

1410
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,720
advertise that

1411
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,720
to steal everyone's data

1412
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,720
and put the ads into their minds

1413
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,720
so that our art can be

1414
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,720
so everyone

1415
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,720
so every little twitter artist

1416
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,720
can have the AI

1417
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,720
can maximize the algorithm so that

1418
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,720
everyone's getting blasted with art ads all the time

1419
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,720
everyone gets exposure

1420
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,720
exposure's free now

1421
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,720
no one has to work for it anymore

1422
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
we've decommodified exposure

1423
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,720
that's

1424
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,720
space communism

1425
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,720
fully automated luxury space communism for me

1426
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
anyway

1427
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,720
so much exposure

1428
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,720
that nobody even

1429
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,720
understands or knows anything

1430
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
no one can separate

1431
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,720
noise from signal anymore

1432
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,720
so there's no point

1433
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,720
there was already no point

1434
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,720
true

1435
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,720
I really do like

1436
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,720
my mid-journey

1437
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,720
avatar though

1438
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,720
I really do like the

1439
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,720
oblivionfall made some more

1440
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
he made some more gorgeous ben saint

1441
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,720
and slime city

1442
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,720
AI mid-journey

1443
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,720
images and he sent them to me and they look so good

1444
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
mid-journey really is good at certain things

1445
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,720
it really does

1446
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,720
yeah it's good at like making a sci-fi

1447
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,720
like sci-fi

1448
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,720
sci-fi landscapes fantasy land it's good at

1449
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
painting landscapes

1450
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
it's good at like figures

1451
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,720
but not faces

1452
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,720
I mean

1453
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,720
I could see it on like the front

1454
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,720
cover of like a thriller

1455
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,720
sci-fi book

1456
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
where there's aliens

1457
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
and slimes

1458
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,720
and it's all fucked

1459
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
yeah the man with the hood

1460
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,720
and the face but he doesn't have a face

1461
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,720
it's not it's not good at

1462
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
depicting characters

1463
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
expressions

1464
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,720
people

1465
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720

1469
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,720
in that one episode of tasting

1470
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
history max miller reads a

1471
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,720
excerpt from like a medieval doctor

1472
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
who is extolling the benefits

1473
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,720
of almond milk and one of the things he says

1474
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,720
about it is that it provoketh urine

1475
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,720
it soothes

1476
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,720
the belly and provoketh urine

1477
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
that's what it's doing for me right now

1478
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,720
alright be back in one

1479
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
sec

1480
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,720
one little second

1481
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,720
so for the viewers at home

1482
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,720
you may if I've

1483
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,720
done a bad job of editing

1484
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
my audio you may have heard

1485
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,720
my mouse clicking

1486
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
over and over and over again

1487
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,720
and that's because I'm playing RuneScape

1488
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,720
right now

1489
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,720
I'm covertly gaining

1490
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
lots and lots of iron ore

1491
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,720
in RuneScape by clicking on it

1492
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,720
it's very quiet so hopefully it's not

1493
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,720
a problem

1494
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
I'm gonna noise remove it I'm gonna click

1495
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,720
remove it before I send it over to Eleazar

1496
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,720
but if it's still there

1497
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,720
that's why and I don't

1498
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,720
I don't

1499
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,720
apologize for it

1500
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,720
it's my grind

1501
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,720
it's my Sigma grind

1502
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,720
you must respect me

1503
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,720
and my stupid stupid ways

1504
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,720
I've got

1505
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
190,000

1506
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,720
experience left until I'm level

1507
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
83 mining

1508
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,720
and let's see on my bank

1509
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
how much iron ore I have

1510
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
I have 68,981

1511
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,720
iron ore

1512
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,720
are you RuneScaping

1513
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,720
I'm mining

1514
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,720
I'm scaping

1515
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,720
are you mining and crafting

1516
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,720
in RuneScape?

1517
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,720
not crafting yet

1518
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,720
my crafting level is 35

1519
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,720
okay

1520
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,720
it's gotta get higher before you craft

1521
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,720
I don't think I need to do crafting

1522
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,720
crafting is like

1523
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,720
it's an odd skill

1524
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,720
because

1525
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,720
it's just sort of

1526
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,720
like a bits and bobs, knickknacks

1527
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,720
a skill where

1528
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,720
it doesn't have any specific

1529
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,720
thing it's like you can have

1530
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,720
a skill like wood cutting

1531
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,720
and that makes sense you cut trees down

1532
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,720
and it's how good you can cut trees

1533
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,720
but crafting is like

1534
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,720
you can make jewelry

1535
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,720
you can make leather

1536
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,720
items

1537
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,720
you can craft

1538
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,720
bow strings

1539
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
you can have a look

1540
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,720
you can weave

1541
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,720
you can make pottery

1542
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
pottery, glass, blowing

1543
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,720
and it's like

1544
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,720
they're all under one

1545
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,720
that's true

1546
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,720
remember that character from pop culture

1547
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,720
okay sorry

1548
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,720
so yeah it's like all of these different things

1549
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,720
so in RuneScape you could

1550
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,720
spin a bunch of clay pots

1551
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,720
and somehow be very very good afterwards

1552
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,720
at making

1553
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,720
gold jewelry for no reason

1554
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,720
because you didn't actually do

1555
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,720
any of jewelry before

1556
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,720
it's all in the same skill

1557
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,720
I see

1558
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,720
sorry to change the subject

1559
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
but I did have a thought while I was peeing

1560
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,720
and that is about the video

1561
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,720
and that is that

1562
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,720
if it goes on really long

1563
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,720
if I'm recording it and it's getting

1564
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,720
really long

1565
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,720
there are some natural breakpoints

1566
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,720
in it that I could decide

1567
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,720
this is going to have to be in parts

1568
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,720
so

1569
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
I'll end the part here

1570
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,720
and that would be a pretty natural place

1571
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,720
if I move in between parts

1572
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,720
who cares

1573
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,720
I would still make the video

1574
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,720
one big video because people love

1575
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,720
seeing that long number

1576
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,720
that's the plan

1577
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,720
you would still cut it together into one

1578
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,720
I would cut it together into one big

1579
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,720
video file yes

1580
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,720
they could be chapters but

1581
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,720
people like seeing a big chunky video

1582
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,720
so

1583
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,720
this is something I was wondering

1584
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,720
do you think that people prefer

1585
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,720
one big

1586
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,720
let's just say six hour video

1587
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,720
two hour part one

1588
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,720
part two part three videos

1589
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,720
yes because

1590
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,720
much less clicking is involved

1591
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,720
and

1592
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,720
the

1593
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,720
if they want to rewatch it

1594
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,720
they just have to do one click

1595
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,720
and also it's just a fact

1596
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,720
that part one of anything

1597
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,720
will have more views than part two or three

1598
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,720
that's

1599
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,720
true the click through rate

1600
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,720
that is true

1601
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,720
so you might as well just put them all together

1602
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
I think you're probably right

1603
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,720
I guess the one thing

1604
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,720
that's scary about that

1605
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,720
is that like should the video ever become

1606
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,720
flagged

1607
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,720
or like be

1608
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,720
decided that it violates something

1609
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,720
it would be the whole thing would go

1610
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,720
instead of just a part of it

1611
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,720
but like

1612
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,720
I mean flagged in what way

1613
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,720
I don't know

1614
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,720
like copyright I think there's ways you can cut

1615
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,720
little bits out like audio

1616
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,720
or like a tiny scene

1617
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,720
that I don't know

1618
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,720
I mean that's probably not going to be in

1619
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,720
YouTube but it's not the best

1620
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,720
better than it used to be

1621
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,720
yeah

1622
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,720
you know I've been noticing

1623
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,720
stock

1624
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,720
YouTube music

1625
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,720
a lot

1626
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,720
recently

1627
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,720
just the first example

1628
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,720
that comes to my head is like

1629
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,720
the sad music that plays sometimes

1630
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,720
in

1631
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,720
the action button reviews

1632
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,720
I've heard I've started hearing it in other

1633
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,720
places and I think

1634
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,720
it's like YouTube stock music

1635
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,720
and that's

1636
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,720
weird

1637
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,720
I guess I had assumed that it was

1638
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,720
a bespoke sort of like

1639
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
picked out specifically

1640
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,720
for this video but no

1641
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,720
it's just what YouTube tells you

1642
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,720
to use

1643
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,720
yeah it is always a bit weird when

1644
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,720
like one YouTube creator

1645
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
has their intro music being this

1646
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,720
song and you're like oh yeah

1647
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,720
it's that creator and then

1648
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,720
anyone can use it it's royalty free

1649
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,720
it's a fucking Kevin MacLeod

1650
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,720
it's like

1651
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,720
that's the summoning salt videos

1652
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,720
right there's like the Kevin

1653
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,720
I think the summoning the iconic summoning

1654
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,720
salt song is just a default

1655
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,720
YouTube song

1656
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,720
I don't know that that's

1657
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,720
the case I feel like it's like a video

1658
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,720
a song that's on

1659
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,720
YouTube

1660
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,720
maybe it's also part of the YouTube because like when you do

1661
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,720
like

1662
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
a library that you can access

1663
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,720
through YouTube that they say

1664
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,720
oh here's a bunch of things you can download and use

1665
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,720
yeah and like the benefit

1666
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,720
the benefit of that is that all the stuff that's

1667
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,720
on there is stuff you know won't get flag

1668
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,720
yeah

1669
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,720
which is good which is like a big deal and pretty good

1670
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,720
honestly

1671
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,720
I can never be able to go

1672
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,720
through that and like find anything

1673
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,720
I just use like

1674
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,720
very quiet video game soundtrack still

1675
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,720
I totally understand

1676
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,720
why that's useful and

1677
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,720
and it makes perfect

1678
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,720
sense however

1679
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,720
when I the the sad music

1680
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,720
from action button when I when I heard that somewhere

1681
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,720
else and I realized that it was not

1682
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
a like really

1683
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,720
a personal choice

1684
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,720
I it retroactively

1685
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,720
was like cheap and I was like oh

1686
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,720
he just picked it from a list and that's lame

1687
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,720
thought it

1688
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,720
was pretty effective in context but now

1689
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,720
now I hate it

1690
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,720
I feel less

1691
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,720
I feel less about it

1692
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,720
it's I don't know where that

1693
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,720
royalty free music is from there's lots of

1694
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,720
places you can get royalty free music

1695
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720
that work on YouTube that aren't from

1696
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,720
YouTube

1697
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,720
and

1698
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,720
like

1699
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,720
like red litter media huff in the bag

1700
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,720
all those songs they use for that

1701
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,720
you can find them there are playlists

1702
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,720
people have found have made of like oh

1703
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,720
this is the

1704
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,720
little piano bit with the

1705
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,720
huff in the bag

1706
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
skit stuff

1707
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,720
they use that all the time

1708
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,720
but because it's like a relatively obscure

1709
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,720
royalty free music

1710
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,720
channel or whatever people don't tend to

1711
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,720
find that when they're looking for royalty

1712
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,720
free stuff

1713
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,720
you can have a bit of an identity

1714
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,720
as long as you're looking as long as

1715
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,720
you're searching for something

1716
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,720
you haven't heard before

1717
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,720
no I think I do think that

1718
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,720
the summoning salt one is just a default

1719
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,720
but I mean he nevertheless

1720
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,720
sort of made it his iconic

1721
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,720
track

1722
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,720
it's irrevocably linked

1723
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,720
in people's minds with summoning salt

1724
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,720
I guess there's room

1725
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,720
for inspired choices

1726
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,720
I guess

1727
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,720
something I'm always

1728
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,720
impressed when I

1729
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,720
am watching a YouTube video and there's music

1730
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,720
and at some point either they say it

1731
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,720
or I realize by reading the description

1732
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,720
like oh this guy made their own music

1733
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,720
like the background

1734
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,720
for this guy's videos

1735
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,720
is like he's also a

1736
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,720
musician and he made all his own

1737
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,720
oh yeah like

1738
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,720
Geo wizards the straight line

1739
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,720
mission guy

1740
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,720
all that 8 bit or

1741
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,720
Commodore 64 sound and music

1742
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,720
he made it himself

1743
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,720
it's like wow cool

1744
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,720
so iconic

1745
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,720
yeah

1746
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720
a skill that I don't have and so I respect

1747
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,720
it

1748
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,720
I always thought I could make music but

1749
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,720
like

1750
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,720
I'm not like

1751
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,720
I'm mostly good at guitar

1752
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,720
and I don't really know how to like make a

1753
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,720
whole big song

1754
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,720
so I would do like acoustic guitar things

1755
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,720
and I could do that but it's like

1756
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
acoustic guitar is a certain

1757
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,720
vibe you can't use it just

1758
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,720
anywhere

1759
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,720
you know I tried to make

1760
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,720
I made a contest entry for the

1761
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,720
um

1762
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,720
that Homestuck music contest

1763
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,720
um

1764
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,720
the one that ended up being

1765
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,720
it was like the troll

1766
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,720
and all an ancestor

1767
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,720
themed it was like two

1768
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,720
two CDs

1769
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,720
and each one had like each

1770
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,720
one CD had a track for every troll

1771
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,720
and then the other CD had a track for every

1772
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,720
ancestor

1773
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,720
that ended up being

1774
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,720
but I made a track

1775
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,720
as a contest entry for that contest

1776
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,720
didn't win obviously didn't get into

1777
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,720
the CD

1778
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,720
how'd you make it

1779
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,720
I used um

1780
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,720
it wasn't Fruity Loops

1781
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,720
it was shit it was some

1782
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,720
free like you know

1783
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,720
track editing

1784
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,720
software I made it

1785
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,720
and this is I made that

1786
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,720
on my laptop as I was working

1787
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,720
as like the cashier

1788
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,720
at an ice cream store

1789
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,720
parlor

1790
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,720
huh that's some Ben St.

1791
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,720
Law

1792
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,720
yeah I've probably never mentioned that but yeah I

1793
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,720
remember making that

1794
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,720
track this was probably

1795
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,720
shortly after I had graduated from

1796
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,720
college

1797
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,720
and I was working

1798
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,720
for this one summer I didn't have anything

1799
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,720
to do and so I

1800
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,720
my mom like

1801
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,720
she saw a hiring sign

1802
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,720
in this one ice cream store

1803
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
and I was like okay whatever and I went

1804
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,720
and I worked there for a few months

1805
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,720
and I remember

1806
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,720
I would bring my laptop to work whenever there was

1807
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,720
downtime I would fuck around on my laptop

1808
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,720
and one of the things I fucked around at was

1809
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,720
I don't remember what

1810
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,720
music software it was but it was something

1811
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,720
I could get for free and it wasn't Fruity Loops

1812
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,720
and

1813
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,720
I don't know

1814
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,720
I tried to make my track

1815
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,720
because the contest

1816
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,720
prompt didn't specify

1817
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,720
that this was going to be about trolls

1818
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,720
it said that each of the entries would be

1819
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,720
themed for a character

1820
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,720
like

1821
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,720
I tried to pick a different character

1822
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,720
I tried to pick a character that probably

1823
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,720
most people wouldn't make a track for

1824
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,720
so I picked Typheus

1825
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,720
the Denizen

1826
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,720
and so I made my track

1827
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,720
if I remember it I wish I could find it

1828
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,720
I don't know where it would be

1829
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,720
now maybe on an old laptop

1830
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,720
I guess

1831
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,720
it sort of was

1832
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,720
I tried to make

1833
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,720
I only used wind instruments

1834
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,720
or I mostly used wind instruments because

1835
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,720
he's the air

1836
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,720
he's the breath guy

1837
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,720
I sort of made an organ

1838
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,720
I started it with

1839
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,720
a bombastic

1840
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,720
organ intro

1841
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,720
and then I think I introduced a little

1842
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,720
drum beat and I introduced

1843
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,720
a little

1844
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,720
melody over top of that

1845
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,720
the background was

1846
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,720
organs

1847
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,720
wind organs and I think I had pan pipes

1848
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,720
I think the melody was pan pipes over

1849
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,720
organs and a drum beat

1850
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,720
wind themed

1851
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,720
because John plays

1852
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,720
because John plays the wind organ

1853
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,720
the pipe organ in the palace of

1854
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,720
Typheus

1855
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,720
I've heard

1856
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,720
there's like the

1857
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,720
I think Typheus does have a track

1858
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,720
somewhere

1859
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,720
in one of the albums

1860
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,720
yeah I feel like they made an album

1861
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,720
of like the denizens

1862
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,720
and there's a bunch of songs

1863
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,720
fan made songs for that

1864
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,720
wouldn't it be funny if it turned out it was

1865
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,720
my track

1866
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,720
yeah I'm wondering what if they just

1867
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,720
didn't credit you or didn't contact you

1868
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,720
oh this is good

1869
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,720
oh I think it was the land of

1870
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,720
fans and music

1871
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,720
that I think

1872
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,720
yeah that could be it

1873
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,720
that's about the

1874
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,720
medium and the planets

1875
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,720
which could also be about the denizens

1876
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,720
I feel like I've seen

1877
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,720
songs

1878
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,720
based on them somewhere

1879
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,720
if you can find

1880
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,720
if there is an official

1881
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,720
Homestuck song

1882
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,720
for Typheus

1883
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,720
I would like to hear it

1884
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,720
if any thoughts on whether mine was better

1885
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,720
okay well I can look in my folder

1886
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,720
or if any if

1887
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,720
this is to the listeners

1888
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,720
if a listener knows

1889
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,720
what album this was on

1890
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,720
oh man I always really liked the denizens

1891
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,720
I like them a lot

1892
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,720
they're so mysterious

1893
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,720
I still don't know anything really

1894
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,720
they're very

1895
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,720
mysterious the way they're

1896
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,720
the way they're depicted with like you can't

1897
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,720
they're sort of like

1898
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,720
there's a very biblical angel

1899
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,720
thing about how

1900
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,720
you can't look at their faces

1901
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,720
like the way they're depicted as

1902
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,720
like

1903
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,720
their face is just

1904
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,720
this light that you can't

1905
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,720
look at

1906
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,720
it's like you can't comprehend

1907
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,720
what it really is

1908
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,720
until like

1909
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,720
there was a

1910
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,720
there was like a flash

1911
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,720
where

1912
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,720
Caliborn

1913
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,720
was fighting his

1914
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,720
I think it was a game over or something

1915
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,720
y'all the bear

1916
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,720
yeah he was fighting that in like a flash

1917
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,720
maybe it was

1918
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,720
it was one of the things in access I can't remember

1919
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,720
but for a brief moment

1920
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,720
you do see a little bit of a face

1921
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,720
and I'm like oh

1922
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,720
well I remember

1923
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,720
hmm I remember there's a big um

1924
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
it's not a flash

1925
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,720
but it's a big animated page

1926
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,720
where like you see

1927
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,720
the whole body

1928
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,720
of it reaching up and you see like

1929
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,720
the head with just this light coming out

1930
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,720
and Caliborn is like standing

1931
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,720
really small in front of it

1932
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,720
looking up at it with his gun out

1933
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,720
that's when he like first

1934
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,720
enters the chamber

1935
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,720
yeah I think I remember that you do

1936
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,720
see a little bit of face

1937
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,720
you do see a little bit it's like um

1938
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,720
Caliborn in his sprite form

1939
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,720
is jumping around and hitting him with a crowbar

1940
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,720
and stuff and then

1941
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,720
Yalla Baoth does like a big beam

1942
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,720
thing and you can see it sort of like

1943
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,720
screaming like

1944
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,720
hmm and the the beams

1945
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,720
like rotate around like it's

1946
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,720
a bullet hell

1947
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,720
there's there's happens for a second

1948
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,720
does it look like

1949
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,720
you know

1950
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,720
he in like in the in the browser

1951
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,720
icon and in like the statues

1952
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,720
he's just sort of got a sort of problem

1953
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,720
sleuth like

1954
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,720
non-descript face

1955
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,720
no I think it was more like

1956
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,720
like the detailed

1957
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,720
hmm I can't

1958
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,720
remember what it looked like I remember it feeling like

1959
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,720
kind of gross

1960
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,720
being like oh

1961
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,720
hmm

1962
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,720
now I'm

1963
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,720
curious I don't remember

1964
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,720
it could be game over

1965
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,720
it could be

1966
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,720
fucking

1967
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,720
the one where everybody fights

1968
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,720
collide it could be that

1969
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,720
does he fight Yalla Baoth

1970
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,720
and collide

1971
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,720
I think that maybe

1972
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,720
maybe that one and maybe another one where

1973
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,720
Caliborn is depicted fighting

1974
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,720
for like a few seconds

1975
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,720
hmm and then it

1976
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,720
goes back to whatever else is happening

1977
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,720
I

1978
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,720
this is just reminds me

1979
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,720
how

1980
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,720
disappointing it is

1981
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,720
that like the actual like game

1982
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,720
of spurb and like all the mythology

1983
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,720
around it gets like so little

1984
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,720
attention at the end of the game

1985
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,720
or it's like towards the end of home

1986
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,720
suck yeah

1987
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,720
it's my favorite shit

1988
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,720
and it's just it's just not

1989
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,720
the priority

1990
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,720
oh

1991
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,720
oh you see

1992
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,720
I think I see it

1993
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,720
oh yeah it sucks

1994
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,720
okay is this it

1995
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,720
um

1996
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,720
yeah

1997
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,720
if this is it

1998
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,720
I think this is it and it's bad

1999
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,720
oh my god

2000
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,720
yeah I saw that

2001
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,720
what a head in my head

2002
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,720
that blue bit wasn't there

2003
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,720
I think it's mostly just the white

2004
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,720
the black lines drawn

2005
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,720
I guess it's a little bit

2006
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,720
blue lit is like it flies

2007
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,720
off really quick but yeah that's the face

2008
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,720
I guess it's a little bit

2009
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,720
it's it's like um

2010
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,720
what do you call him what's the bad guy

2011
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,720
from problem sleuth

2012
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,720
mobster kingpin

2013
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,720
mobster kingpin I think it's

2014
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,720
meant to resemble that and like yeah

2015
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,720
I right yeah

2016
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,720
it's got a bit too much detail

2017
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,720
it looks like a snake because it's a snake

2018
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,720
it's just sort of makes it more

2019
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,720
of a beast and less of a cool

2020
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,720
like um

2021
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,720
yeah like cool

2022
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,720
I don't know magical

2023
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,720
undecipherable energy

2024
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,720
being much much cooler

2025
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,720
when you didn't

2026
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,720
know

2027
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,720
you know what this looks like it looks like that

2028
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,720
that fucking rick and morty joke

2029
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,720
where the sun

2030
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,720
is screaming all the time

2031
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,720
oh yeah they go to a planet

2032
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,720
and it's like oh this is great and then

2033
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,720
the sun rises and it screams

2034
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,720
yeah

2035
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,720
you are right it does look like that

2036
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,720
it's silly it makes me

2037
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,720
I think it's meant to be silly

2038
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,720
I think it

2039
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,720
I think it's meant to be

2040
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,720
dumb but I just

2041
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,720
think it's a bad choice

2042
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,720
I don't know if it's meant to be dumb because

2043
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,720
like in the moment it's like a really hype

2044
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,720
like oh Caliburn's fighting everyone's fighting

2045
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,720
so much stuff is happening and it's like

2046
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,720
I could imagine somebody

2047
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,720
who just doesn't understand the importance

2048
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,720
of mystery being like

2049
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,720
oh but we've never seen like the face

2050
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,720
of one of these guys

2051
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,720
maybe this would be a good time

2052
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,720
we could see the face at last

2053
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,720
and now we can put that in a wiki

2054
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,720
and now everybody knows how many teeth they

2055
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,720
have

2056
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,720
the tone of collide is

2057
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,720
kind of comical though

2058
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,720
so I think this face

2059
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,720
is meant to be

2060
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,720
a little bit goofy

2061
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,720
I would make it goofier

2062
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,720
I

2063
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,720
if I was gonna do that

2064
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,720
I would make it as goofy as a problem

2065
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,720
sleuth face

2066
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,720
oh I see yeah

2067
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,720
yeah I

2068
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,720
I think I

2069
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,720
I'm pretty sure this is a mobster kingpin reference

2070
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,720
which I get it

2071
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,720
I get

2072
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,720
the desire to do that

2073
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,720
with your final boss monsters so you use

2074
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,720
a callback to the other big

2075
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,720
final boss monster from the other story

2076
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,720
I get it

2077
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,720
I get it but

2078
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,720
it's bad for Yalda Bea

2079
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,720
it's a very

2080
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,720
it's if

2081
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,720
the denizens... Yalda Gaoth

2082
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,720
more like Yalda Gaoth

2083
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,720
the denizens had so much like build up

2084
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,720
and then like

2085
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,720
I don't know if you're gonna like

2086
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,720
subvert their build up by having them look

2087
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,720
goofy yeah I think

2088
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,720
to have it be like such a

2089
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,720
fleeting throwaway moment

2090
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,720
in the course of this one

2091
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,720
it's very

2092
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,720
if they wanted to reveal the face

2093
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,720
if they wanted to really reveal the face

2094
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,720
for some reason

2095
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,720
it should be like a huge

2096
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,720
impressive panel

2097
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,720
it should be

2098
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,720
it should be a

2099
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,720
it should have been a moment

2100
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,720
not a thing you could literally like

2101
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,720
miss and not even notice

2102
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,720
because it's like every depiction has been like

2103
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,720
we don't see what's really

2104
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,720
going on in the interaction between

2105
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,720
the denizen and the kid

2106
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,720
yeah

2107
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,720
and earlier on we only hear about

2108
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,720
what happens and you know John dies

2109
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,720
because he goes to see Tytheus

2110
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,720
mm-hmm

2111
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,720
and we don't see any of that interaction

2112
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,720
so fucking cool who know what what happened

2113
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,720
why what was it like nobody

2114
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,720
John doesn't remember because the version of him

2115
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,720
that lived didn't do that

2116
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,720
so mysterious

2117
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,720
this this this this only this only takes away

2118
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,720
this only takes away

2119
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,720
some of the appeal I still

2120
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,720
I still really like the denizens

2121
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,720
I think they're a really cool element of the

2122
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,720
story another another cool

2123
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,720
part of spurb lore that

2124
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,720
the homestuck that ladder

2125
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,720
homestuck seems

2126
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,720
almost obsessed with not

2127
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,720
paying any attention to

2128
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,720
yep yeah

2129
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,720
yeah

2130
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,720
but that is a conversation that has been had a billion

2131
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,720
times I know I know

2132
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,720
I'll never get over it

2133
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,720
it's never it's never gonna be okay

2134
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,720
it's never gonna be

2135
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,720
okay what happens

2136
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,720
well

2137
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,720
uh speaking of

2138
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,720
comics yeah I've been working

2139
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,720
a little bit on Clarissa

2140
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,720
oh um

2141
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,720
there was a bit of there's a bit of a script

2142
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,720
thing where I'm like I had

2143
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,720
a few sketches

2144
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,720
and I wanted to

2145
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,720
something was off about the way

2146
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,720
the story ended so I

2147
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,720
I had to like go back and like rearrange

2148
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,720
panels and add some new panels into

2149
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,720
the sketches and do some script

2150
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,720
stuff so that's

2151
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,720
that's something not a lot yet

2152
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,720
I'm not like really sitting down and like

2153
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,720
okay

2154
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,720
let's go let's draw

2155
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,720
it's a lot of thinking and being like how do I

2156
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,720
make the story like so

2157
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,720
okay like

2158
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,720
not bad this is what I'm

2159
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,720
aiming for is that it's not stupid

2160
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,720
that is the challenge

2161
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,720
yeah

2162
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,720
but I think I made a bit of

2163
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,720
a not a breakthrough but just sort of like an

2164
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,720
improvement so that's good

2165
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,720
it is not going to be

2166
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,720
too long now before I can sketch

2167
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,720
the rest of

2168
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,720
the pages and then I will have a page

2169
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,720
count that I can tell people

2170
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,720
and then I will draw it all

2171
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,720
you have a

2172
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,720
okay wait so this is chapter

2173
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,720
two or three

2174
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,720
of Clarissa

2175
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,720
I don't remember let me go to giveandtake.site

2176
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,720
yeah

2177
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,720
.site to find out

2178
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,720
you're going to definitely want to hit up

2179
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,720
giveandtake.site

2180
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,720
giveandtake.site there she is Clarissa

2181
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,720
Gunsmoke and the bandit king

2182
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,720
um also the top

2183
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,720
of the page got my site sucked

2184
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,720
so much um

2185
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,720
come on

2186
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,720
come on

2187
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,720
show me the show me the money oh no

2188
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,720
it's so inefficient

2189
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,720
I just want to I don't see the chapter

2190
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,720
page how many chapters

2191
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,720
do we got

2192
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,720
was that button knocked over there okay forget

2193
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,720
it one mile

2194
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,720
um so we have this first chapter

2195
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,720
and then the second chapter

2196
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,720
we got three chapters

2197
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,720
scrolling down

2198
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,720
and I think it's three chapters

2199
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,720
yes so this will be chapter four and onwards

2200
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,720
I think I have more than a hundred pages

2201
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,720
sketched

2202
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,720
um more like 90 actually

2203
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,720
but uh there's a lot still

2204
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,720
to sketch

2205
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,720
so who knows

2206
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,720
I don't

2207
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,720
I'm sorry wait

2208
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,720
you see you already have 90

2209
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,720
pages let me let me double

2210
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,720
check it's probably not 90 it's probably like

2211
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,720
50 but it's

2212
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,720
sizeable amount sketched and then I still

2213
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,720
need to like sketch the last

2214
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,720
bit wait wait you've got

2215
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,720
50 that are sketched but not

2216
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,720
finished not finished

2217
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,720
not public yet yes oh wow

2218
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,720
that's a lot

2219
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,720
yeah I'm not very efficient

2220
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,720
with my writing how many are done

2221
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,720
and published now

2222
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,720
three chapters worth so that's

2223
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,720
like how many pages like

2224
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,720
20 pages a chapter

2225
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,720
uh so yeah

2226
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,720
something like that so you're gonna make

2227
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,720
more than double it with all this

2228
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,720
oh it's new possibly

2229
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,720
possibly yeah sounds sounds

2230
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,720
like it's headed that way

2231
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,720
hmm interesting

2232
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,720

what the conversation was but the

2258
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,720
sure the result was

2259
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,720
um I should start

2260
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,720
things that I want to

2261
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,720
get done rather than waiting for myself

2262
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,720
to finish this one thing

2263
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,720
I think it gets stuck

2264
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,720
too often and I'm like I want to do things

2265
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,720
linearly I had the commissions earlier

2266
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,720
I said I would do all of the commissions

2267
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,720
and then work on other things

2268
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,720
so and because of

2269
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,720
that I have just not done anything

2270
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,720
and so like if I do the

2271
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,720
Clarissa stuff at least

2272
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,720
I'm getting something done and maybe

2273
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,720
it'll just make it easier for me to

2274
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,720
get into a working mood and

2275
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,720
organize my life and get everything

2276
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,720
else done I see so

2277
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,720
like in the case that like

2278
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,720
yeah

2279
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,720
if you're not getting the commissions done

2280
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,720
rather than not do anything else

2281
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,720
until they're done you might as well

2282
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,720
do something else yeah

2283
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,720
I see that makes yeah I mean sure

2284
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,720
that makes it make sense

2285
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,720
not that like huge brain

2286
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,720
thing that's just right it is

2287
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,720
a consistent problem I love

2288
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,720
doing things in order

2289
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,720
and I love finishing things before moving on

2290
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,720
because I feel like I'm gonna get overwhelmed

2291
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,720
with like juggling too many different projects

2292
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,720
it is good to do

2293
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,720
if possible

2294
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,720
it's a good instinct

2295
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,720
to have in general

2296
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,720
yeah I mean I was starting

2297
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,720
to feel bad as well because

2298
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,720
I had this idea to make a little video

2299
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,720
about my RuneScape thing

2300
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,720
and that was being like well

2301
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,720
you should do the commissions first before you do that

2302
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,720
right

2303
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,720
but if you did that

2304
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,720
but it would only be a little thing

2305
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,720
but if you did that there would just be no video

2306
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,720
you would never make it

2307
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,720
I would never make the video yeah

2308
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,720
so like I forced myself to make a video

2309
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,720
because I wanted to do it

2310
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,720
and I would feel bad about not

2311
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,720
doing it and it wasn't gonna

2312
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,720
take that long and it didn't because

2313
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,720
I didn't make it a big

2314
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,720
edited thing

2315
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,720
it was just like a little explanation

2316
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,720
few PNGs on the screen that's all you need

2317
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,720
so that's done I feel good

2318
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,720
that that is done

2319
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,720
and now I will do the commissions

2320
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,720
and work on Clarissa

2321
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,720
at the same time

2322
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,720
yeah

2323
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,720
oh

2324
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,720
oh yeah

2325
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,720
yeah yeah

2326
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,720
woo

2327
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,720
I need to go toilet quick

2328
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,720
I will be a moment

2329
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,720
you know what me too

2330
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,720
lol

2331
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,720
I am back

2332
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,720
ah boy

2333
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,720
okay scared

2334
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,720
scary

2335
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,720
hey

2336
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,720
you know

2337
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,720
when you're waiting for a bus

2338
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,720
and there's not been a bus in a while

2339
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,720
and then suddenly

2340
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,720
two buses come at the same time

2341
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,720
that's what just happened

2342
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,720
in the toilet

2343
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,720
what?

2344
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,720
because I had a shit

2345
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,720
and then suddenly after I was done

2346
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,720
it was followed by another shit

2347
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,720
what?

2348
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,720
you know what I mean

2349
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,720
I

2350
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,720
yeah you ever get that

2351
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,720
I guess

2352
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,720
it's like it was like one meal

2353
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,720
comes down

2354
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,720
and then a different meal

2355
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,720
I mean I would probably describe that

2356
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,720
as I

2357
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,720
as one shit that I just had

2358
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,720
I thought I was done

2359
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,720
I guess that's exactly the same

2360
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,720
as what I said

2361
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,720
that's how I would phrase it

2362
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,720
but I get what you're saying

2363
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,720
I was gonna say that took a while

2364
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,720
I was gonna say

2365
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,720
my headphones fell out

2366
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,720
I must grab

2367
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,720
a spell suit

2368
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,720
okay I can hear again

2369
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,720
hooray

2370
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,720
what were we talking about

2371
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,720
jeez what were we talking about

2372
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,720
we talked about Homestuck then

2373
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,720
I talked about Clarissa

2374
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,720
oh I think that was it

2375
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,720
I think we were talking about Clarissa when you left

2376
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,720
we talked about my video

2377
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,720
that's my big thing for the day

2378
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,720
my move

2379
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,720
oh

2380
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,720
frickin yeah I said last week

2381
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,720
or something

2382
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,720
that I had really screwed up

2383
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,720
and by not getting a truck

2384
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,720
and that's true

2385
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,720
this blows

2386
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,720
there was no

2387
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,720
there was no truck available

2388
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,720
in Boston like at all

2389
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,720
anywhere I could not find one

2390
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,720
my mom found one

2391
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,720
in

2392
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,720
a town that is closer to

2393
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,720
where I grew up

2394
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,720
and it's like an hour away

2395
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,720
so I'm gonna have to take a train there

2396
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,720
pick up a truck

2397
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,720
like an hour away and then drive it back

2398
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,720
here

2399
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,720
fortunately I only have to drive it one way

2400
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,720
because I can drop it off

2401
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,720
at a different location

2402
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,720
but yeah I have to drive this fucking moving

2403
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,720
truck on a highway

2404
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,720
for like an hour so that's gonna suck

2405
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,720
and plus they charge you by the mile so that's a bit

2406
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,720
it's gonna cost me like 50 bucks

2407
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,720
for nothing

2408
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,720
yeah but it's all

2409
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,720
it's all I could get

2410
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,720
maybe you should learn to live

2411
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,720
smaller

2412
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,720
less items

2413
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,720
like the Buddha

2414
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,720
I don't have that many items Gib

2415
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,720
I called

2416
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,720
U-Haul

2417
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,720
and I was trying to get something more

2418
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,720
nearby and I asked the guy

2419
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,720
I was like

2420
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,720
what if I just rented one on like before

2421
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,720
he was like no we don't have anything on the 30th

2422
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,720
I was like what if I rented one before

2423
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,720
what if I got one on the 29th

2424
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,720
and he was like well you'd have to have it back the next day

2425
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,720
and I said what if I didn't

2426
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,720
and the guy was like

2427
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,720
well then some family

2428
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,720
that needed a truck wouldn't have it

2429
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,720
and I said yeah

2430
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,720
but what would happen to me though

2431
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,720
and he was like well

2432
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,720
I guess we'd find you and I was like

2433
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,720
hmm okay

2434
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,720
how much?

2435
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,720
honestly I mean

2436
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,720
fine by me

2437
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,720
kind of

2438
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,720
decided it was easier to just

2439
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,720
drive an hour that's fine

2440
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,720
I wouldn't feel good about depriving

2441
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,720
someone else of their rental

2442
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,720
hmm

2443
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,720
but I'd cope

2444
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,720
yeah I'd be okay though

2445
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,720
um

2446
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,720
yeah so

2447
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,720
that's what I gotta do

2448
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,720
not tomorrow but the next day Tuesday

2449
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,720
I'm gonna have to get up early on Tuesday

2450
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,720
morning

2451
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,720
because apparently

2452
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,720
frickin my landlord asked me

2453
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,720
when I'm gonna be out and I said

2454
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,720
well the lease says the 30th so I guess

2455
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,720
I'm gonna leave on the 30th

2456
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,720
and she emailed me and said

2457
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,720
like

2458
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,720
the guys that I've been saying

2459
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,720
have been doing renovations on my place

2460
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,720
they're gonna be, she said they're gonna be here

2461
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,720
on the 30th early in the morning

2462
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,720
on the 30th they're gonna be like

2463
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,720
drilling into my wall or something

2464
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,720
so

2465
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,720
I don't know I guess I'm gonna have to work

2466
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,720
around them or something

2467
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,720
that's gonna

2468
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,720
be annoying

2469
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,720
I don't

2470
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,720
I don't know

2471
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,720
I feel like she

2472
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,720
I feel like she might be overstepping her bounds

2473
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,720
a little bit lately sending dudes

2474
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,720
to like

2475
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,720
spend time in our rooms to like

2476
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,720
do work on our walls and stuff

2477
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,720
I feel like maybe she's not allowed to do that

2478
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,720
while we're still living here

2479
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,720
yeah

2480
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,720
but whatever it's inconsiderate

2481
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,720
at the very least

2482
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,720
but whatever it's too late

2483
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,720
I'm gonna leave now and I'll be gone soon

2484
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,720
I

2485
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,720
I think I successfully

2486
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,720
hoodwinked her out of a month's rent though

2487
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,720
I don't think I'm gonna have to pay

2488
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,720
that last month's rent

2489
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,720
nice

2490
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,720
yeah so

2491
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,720
pretty good honestly

2492
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,720
that's

2493
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,720
you should leave

2494
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,720
like a

2495
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,720
a calling card saying that you didn't do that

2496
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,720
you didn't pay last month's rent

2497
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,720
that's like haha you've been swindled

2498
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,720
by the great Ben saying that's a great idea

2499
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,720
there's no way that that

2500
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,720
could be used against me in any kind of civil

2501
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,720
settlement

2502
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,720
leave a card

2503
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,720
saying um

2504
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,720
yeah I did cry

2505
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,720
I stole here's some money that I stole from you

2506
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,720
here's the exact amount here's how I did

2507
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,720
it here's my new contact information

2508
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,720
in case you want to reach me to talk

2509
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,720
about it

2510
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,720
bye

2511
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,720
mm-hmm it's just like what a great criminal

2512
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,720
does when they steal the priceless jewel

2513
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,720
that's what they put their calling card

2514
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,720
and they laugh in the face of the

2515
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,720
authorities mm-hmm that's yeah

2516
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,720
that that's why they're great criminals

2517
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,720
criminal masterminds is because they make it

2518
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,720
really easy to catch them

2519
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,720
they put their alter ego they say Batman

2520
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,720
was here except Batman is not a criminal

2521
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,720
no if Batman were really good

2522
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,720
he would just leave a card that says

2523
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,720
the exact address

2524
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,720
of the Batcave detailed instructions

2525
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,720
for entering it his name

2526
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,720
security number

2527
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,720
etc etc that would be

2528
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,720
if he was really the world's greatest detective

2529
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,720
that's I think what would happen

2530
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,720
man oh man

2531
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,720
so that's gonna suck

2532
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,720
I don't

2533
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,720
they're like oh somebody stole the crown jewels

2534
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,720
or like they opened the safe and like

2535
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,720
oh it's gone

2536
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,720
what's this and somebody's driver's license

2537
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,720
with their face

2538
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,720
and all their information

2539
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,720
I have a

2540
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,720
I have a mattress I have I replaced

2541
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,720
my mattress at some point

2542
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,720
because my old one was gross

2543
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,720
so I still have it like

2544
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,720
it's sort of like against a wall

2545
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,720
I never I never got rid of it

2546
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,720
so

2547
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,720
I'm considering like

2548
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,720
I'm not exactly sure how to dispose

2549
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,720
of a mattress

2550
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,720
there's probably a right way I don't think you can just

2551
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,720
have the fucking trash guys pick it up

2552
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,720
on the sidewalk

2553
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,720
but

2554
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,720
I have some

2555
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,720
I think I might have to pay to get it

2556
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,720
disposed of and alternatives

2557
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,720
that I'm rolling around

2558
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,720
in my mind are one

2559
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,720
leave it on the sidewalk

2560
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,720
anyway because

2561
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,720
what are they gonna do

2562
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,720
come and find me no

2563
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,720
nobody's gonna know that it's my mattress

2564
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,720
someone the landlord

2565
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,720
will have to deal with it

2566
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,720
to

2567
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,720
maybe just leave it in

2568
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,720
the room of one of the other guys that has already

2569
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,720
moved out

2570
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,720
just put it in there and put it on the floor

2571
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,720
and leave and she won't know

2572
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,720
that I left it

2573
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,720
uh

2574
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,720
what would they do

2575
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,720
I think the second one

2576
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,720
might be better

2577
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,720
because maybe the person moving in

2578
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,720
is like oh cool free mattress

2579
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,720
yeah

2580
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,720
possibly

2581
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,720
yeah I might just do that

2582
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,720
I don't really see any downside

2583
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,720
and it means I don't have to deal with it

2584
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,720
it's a bad

2585
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,720
mattress and I don't think anyone would really want

2586
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,720
this mattress that's why I replaced it

2587
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,720
but

2588
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,720
um

2589
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,720
what's the right way

2590
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,720
how

2591
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,720
to dispose of a

2592
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,720
mattress

2593
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,720
you beat the shit out of it

2594
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,720
discard literally

2595
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,720
oh yeah discarded mattresses

2596
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,720
and boxers can be notoriously difficult to

2597
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,720
manage they're expensive to transport

2598
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,720
so recycling

2599
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,720
or use

2600
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,720
okay mattresses and textiles are

2601
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,720
banned from disposal or

2602
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,720
transport for disposal

2603
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,720
okay most mattress

2604
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,720
and box spring components can be easily

2605
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,720
disassembled and recycled

2606
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,720
okay

2607
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,720
so spring mattress

2608
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,720
mattress recycling

2609
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,720
incentive programs

2610
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,720
I think it is a spring mattress

2611
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,720
donate

2612
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,720
you can donate to a charity

2613
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,720
find a commercial mattress recycler

2614
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,720
okay there there might be

2615
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,720
there might be a municipal

2616
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,720
program for like collecting mattresses

2617
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,720
for recycling

2618
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,720
I don't see my town on here though

2619
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,720
where you live you go to eat

2620
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,720
the mattress to get rid of it

2621
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,720
I don't see

2622
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,720
Alston or Brighton on here

2623
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,720
so that's

2624
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,720
hmmmm

2625
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,720
Cambridge is not too far

2626
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,720
hmmmm

2627
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,720
whatever

2628
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,720
I'll leave it in someone else's room

2629
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,720
fuck it

2630
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,720
uhhhh

2631
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,720
I hate this landlady

2632
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,720
I hope she has more problems in the future

2633
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,720
I hope she has to deal with it

2634
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,720
I consider that a

2635
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,720
bonus is that it would be annoying for her

2636
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,720
um

2637
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,720
yeah

2638
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,720
anyway those are my moving

2639
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,720
concerns

2640
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,720
I'm tired just thinking

2641
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,720
about it

2642
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,720
hmm I'm gonna have a nice long nap

2643
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,720
on this mattress about it

2644
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,720
because of how tired I am

2645
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,720
I don't want to sleep on this mattress

2646
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,720
it doesn't smell great

2647
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,720
my new mattress is great

2648
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,720
it's delightful

2649
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,720
um

2650
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,720
hey

2651
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,720
what is

2652
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,720
HD

2653
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,720
resolution

2654
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,720
high definition

2655
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,720
that's HD

2656
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,720
1920 by 1080

2657
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,720
ok well my camera

2658
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,720
will record in

2659
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,720
uhhhh hang on

2660
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,720
hang on hang on

2661
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,720
my camera can record in

2662
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,720
ok 2

2663
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,720
560 by 14

2664
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,720
42

2665
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,720
which is not 4k

2666
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,720
ok apparently 4k

2667
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,720
is

2668
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,720
3 by 2160

2669
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,720
I assumed it would be 4000

2670
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,720
yeah it's the 38

2671
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,720
but it's close enough to 4 so I think

2672
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,720
that's why

2673
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,720
so my

2674
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,720
my camera will it will not record in 4k

2675
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,720
but it will record in like

2676
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,720
in above HD

2677
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,720
which is

2678
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,720
fine I think I kind of wish I had

2679
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,720
I kind of wish I could film in 4k

2680
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,720
I think a little more resolution would be good

2681
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,720
but I feel like

2682
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,720
I feel like the expectation

2683
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,720
is not that videos need to be

2684
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,720
in 4k on youtube

2685
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,720
I don't think anyone's going to be like

2686
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,720
this isn't in 4k I can't watch this

2687
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,720
um

2688
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,720
yeah it's still like HD

2689
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,720
is good enough

2690
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,720
from most anything

2691
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,720
yeah

2692
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:18,720
I'm surprised

2693
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,720
I could film in this

2694
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,720
above HD resolution

2695
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,720
and a minute of footage

2696
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,720
is about 125

2697
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,720
megabytes

2698
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,720
so like

2699
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,720
15 minutes of footage is like

2700
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,720
1.8 gigs

2701
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,720
and my phone is pretty empty

2702
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,720
so it has like 40 gigs of storage on it

2703
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,720
so I can store like

2704
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,720
I can store like

2705
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,720
uh

2706
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,720
I think um

2707
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,720
I think 30 minutes by

2708
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,720
10

2709
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,720
I can store like 300 minutes

2710
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,720
I can store like 5 hours of

2711
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,720
footage on that thing

2712
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,720
that is quite a big

2713
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,720
amount

2714
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,720
my phone

2715
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,720
I don't know how much my phone has actually

2716
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,720
so I might have to like

2717
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,720
set it to start recording

2718
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,720
let it go and then I'll have

2719
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,720
I have to

2720
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,720
it will

2721
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,720
I want to record it in chunks because

2722
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,720
if anything happens I don't want to lose everything

2723
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,720
the downside

2724
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,720
to that is that

2725
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,720
I can only tell it to restart recording

2726
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,720
up to like 10 times

2727
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,720
so if I'm recording like

2728
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,720
15 minute segments

2729
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,720
I can only record 10 of them

2730
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,720
and also there's a little bit of a break

2731
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,720
like it's not a smooth continue

2732
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,720
I check this there's a little bit of a cut

2733
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,720
each time it stops recording and starts again

2734
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,720
so I will just have

2735
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,720
to keep an eye on the time I'll like

2736
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,720
I'll start it at exactly

2737
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,720
a 30 minute point on the clock

2738
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,720
and I'll just have to keep my eye on the time

2739
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,720
and any time it's getting to be

2740
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,720
an hour or half hour

2741
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,720
I'll just have to know like there's going to be a cut here

2742
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,720
I should like wait to start my next sentence

2743
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,720
until

2744
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,720
until the half hour mark

2745
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:06,720
passes and then I can start again

2746
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,720
mmm

2747
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,720
that's my plan

2748
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,720
I hope it works

2749
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,720
okay thank you

2750
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,720
I'm rambling

2751
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,720
now

2752
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,720
I have

2753
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,720
been thinking a lot

2754
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,720
about how this all works

2755
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,720
it's very complicated

2756
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,720
literally just to like

2757
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,720
this is all just in service

2758
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,720
of just like setting up a camera on a tripod

2759
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,720
and telling it to record

2760
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,720
I have had to consider

2761
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,720
all of these things

2762
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,720
it's so hard

2763
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,720
being a content creator

2764
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,720
it's so hard

2765
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,720
being a successful content creator

2766
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,720
like Ben St

2767
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,720
it do be like that

2768
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,720
yeah

2769
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,720
well hey

2770
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:02,720
we've been going for an hour 40

2771
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,720
what do you think about going to the

2772
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,720
Ask PCP questions

2773
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:08,720
uh

2774
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,720
sure

2775
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,720
I can't think of anything

2776
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,720
off the top of my head else that I need to

2777
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,720
there's only one thing

2778
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,720
and it's that I'm going to be doing

2779
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,720
like Sunday assessments

2780
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,720
of my work

2781
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,720
there's another thing the therapist told me to start doing

2782
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,720
Sunday assessments

2783
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,720
assessment time

2784
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,720
where I go over the previous week

2785
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,720
and what I

2786
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,720
accomplished

2787
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,720
and it's not supposed to be like

2788
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,720
an opinion piece

2789
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,720
it's just sort of like

2790
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,720
factual information what was done

2791
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,720
and then make a plan

2792
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,720
for the next week so what am I going to work on

2793
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,720
next week and I feel like

2794
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,720
having like a time

2795
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,720
a thing happening an event

2796
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,720
a Sunday assessment period

2797
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,720
will help me to be like alright

2798
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,720
let's actually like plan out the next week

2799
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,720
so today is going to be my first one of those

2800
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,720
and I hope it works

2801
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,720
for productivity

2802
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,720
makes sense

2803
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,720
makes sense so

2804
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,720
it's just like you write

2805
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,720
a list of everything that was done

2806
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,720
yeah I just sort of go over

2807
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,720
the things that I accomplished

2808
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,720
um

2809
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,720
and not to like make it into like a

2810
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,720
like a

2811
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,720
talking down to or like a telling off

2812
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,720
like oh you didn't meet the quota you motherfucker

2813
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,720
it's not about

2814
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:36,720
punishing myself it's just about like

2815
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,720
keeping track I suppose of what

2816
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,720
I was able to do

2817
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,720
so that when I plan things

2818
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,720
going forward I can adjust

2819
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,720
plans to be like okay

2820
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,720
uh

2821
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,720
do less work because it was too much

2822
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,720
or do more work because

2823
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,720
uh you can

2824
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,720
and you or whatever

2825
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,720
I don't know how to do exactly

2826
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,720
I'm gonna figure it out but like I like the idea

2827
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,720
I like the idea of

2828
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,720
of

2829
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,720
getting a little document

2830
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,720
little like clipboard and I like

2831
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,720
writing down notes

2832
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,720
ah yes

2833
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,720
my life is

2834
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,720
within my control because you see I wrote down

2835
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,720
a lot of numbers

2836
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:22,720
yeah makes

2837
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,720
make sense to me checks out

2838
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,720

2843
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,720

2872
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:34,720
there's more extreme examples I can't

2873
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,720
really think of them though it's the top of my head

2874
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,720
but like yeah

2875
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,720

01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,720
170,000

2885
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,720

we literally just started running

2962
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,720
since there's 10 episodes per floor

2963
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,720
Nate should be 10 floors down

2964
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,720
room

2965
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,720

2966
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,720
PCPHQ

2967
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:44,720
PCPHQ just gets built

2968
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,720
taller the more podcast episodes there are

2969
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,720
PCPHQ 10 episodes per floor

2970
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,720
PCPHQ infinitely tall

2971
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,720
paid for by Trixie's big money

2972
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,720

2976
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,720

01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,720
yeah

3007
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,720
you look looking like

3008
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,720
you two look like you're solving some kind of

3009
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,720
Mary Drew

3010
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:18,720
Nancy Drew mystery

3011
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:20,720
yeah

3012
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,720
okay

3013
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,720
what the hell are y'all standing around

3014
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,720
for

3015
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,720
I sense a strong adversary behind this

3016
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:32,720
door do you wish to proceed

3017
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,720
select options below yes no

3018
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,720
fuck off bozo

3019
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,720
fuck off bozo I did it

3020
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,720
you did it

3021
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,720
strong adversary

3022
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,720
shut your cringe in

3023
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,720
my forehead

3024
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:50,720
there isn't even anything

3025
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,720
down here

3026
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,720
sniff sniff sniff oh no

3027
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,720
what's sniffing

3028
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,720
wait I know

3029
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,720
that's a great nose

3030
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:02,720
too woo

3031
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,720
wait look how cute you are in this door frame

3032
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,720
yeah

3033
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,720
sniff

3034
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,720
I love the fucking perspective stunts

3035
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,720
like strongly

3036
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,720
in the doorway

3037
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,720
tiny little feet down there

3038
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,720
tiny little feet

3039
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,720
actually

3040
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,720
you know actually look how tiny my feet are compared

3041
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,720
to the door frame

3042
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,720
it's exaggerated

3043
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,720
why would he

3044
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,720
exaggerate

3045
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,720
perspective for

3046
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,720
artistic effect why would he do that

3047
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,720
I don't know it seems impossible

3048
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,720
it seems impossible it's impossible

3049
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:42,720
but true

3050
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:44,720
snort

3051
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,720
I was a snort

3052
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,720
snort and then

3053
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,720
my god we're collapsed

3054
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,720
camel toe shot

3055
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,720
that smell

3056
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,720
oh this face on the next one

3057
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,720
look at that so earthy delectable

3058
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,720
pungent it smells just like

3059
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,720
nay

3060
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,720
oh my god

3061
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,720
this is berserk all of a sudden

3062
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,720
hideous

3063
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:10,720
it's the sniffer

3064
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,720
it's the I don't even remember

3065
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,720
what he was called

3066
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,720
does he even have a name

3067
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,720
yeah it's hideous

3068
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,720
fucking naked mole rat looking

3069
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,720
teeth here

3070
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,720
I'm gonna throw up

3071
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,720
this is great

3072
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:28,720
nay

3073
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,720
yeah

3074
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,720
there's rules oh my god

3075
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,720
what do we do with these

3076
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:40,720
they should be in a museum

3077
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,720
they should be in a comic

3078
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,720
that I could purchase with my money

3079
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,720
yeah

3080
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,720
yeah I'd buy this

3081
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,720
if it were printed

3082
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,720
this is so good I

3083
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,720
love it

3084
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,720
I'm glad that I was wrong but it's not

3085
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:58,720
the last

3086
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,720
the last art meal

3087
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,720
how could this be the end

3088
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,720
how could this be the end

3089
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:06,720
leave me hanging

3090
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,720
in suspense

3091
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,720
delightful

3092
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,720
alright well I'm glad I almost missed it

3093
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,720
because it was posted last week

3094
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,720
but I found it

3095
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:20,720
gonna save that image

3096
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:22,720
yeah

3097
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:24,720
next one is from rip dot

3098
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,720
what is your favorite musical

3099
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,720
do you ever listen to musical soundtracks

3100
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,720
on their own or do you only enjoy seeing them

3101
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,720
in person

3102
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,720
funny if you assume that I see musicals

3103
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,720
in person I don't think I've ever seen

3104
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,720
a musical in person

3105
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,720
I think I've seen

3106
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,720
I've seen spam a lot in person

3107
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,720
I've never seen that

3108
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,720
yeah it's a Monty Python musical

3109
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:50,720
yeah yeah

3110
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,720
that's pretty good

3111
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,720
I haven't really seen that many

3112
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,720
I have seen

3113
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,720
actual musicals that I've seen

3114
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:02,720
and again I have never been to one live

3115
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,720
I saw the Spongebob musical

3116
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:06,720
of course which I thought was great

3117
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,720
I've watched

3118
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,720
I guess it wasn't really a musical

3119
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,720
because I watched the

3120
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,720
the 70s filmed version

3121
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:16,720
of Jesus Christ Superstar

3122
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,720
which is based on musical

3123
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:20,720
yeah I

3124
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,720
I guess I'd have to say the Spongebob musical

3125
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,720
is the only actual musical

3126
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,720
that I feel any

3127
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,720
particular way about

3128
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,720
is Peter and the Wolf

3129
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:32,720
a musical

3130
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,720
you know Peter and the Wolf

3131
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,720
I know of it I've never seen it

3132
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,720
it's set to

3133
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,720
an orchestral score

3134
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,720
yeah it's like an orchestral score

3135
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,720
and it's an animation

3136
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,720
the most famous one I think

3137
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,720
is a stop motion animation thing

3138
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,720
Peter and there's a cat and there's a wolf

3139
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,720
I feel like a musical

3140
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,720
as this guy means to say

3141
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,720
is like

3142
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,720
performed live on stage

3143
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,720
sure because I went to see

3144
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,720
like a live

3145
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:04,720
like orchestrated

3146
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,720
Peter and the Wolf but the animated

3147
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,720
show was like on the screen

3148
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,720
and then the orchestra was playing live

3149
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,720
that was pretty good

3150
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:14,720
interesting

3151
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,720
um

3152
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,720
mappa

3153
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,720
mappa

3154
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,720
mappashidepan

3155
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,720
because why the fuck do you guys have so much lore

3156
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,720
like I want to listen to your podcast

3157
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,720
but every five minutes you're representing some person

3158
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:30,720
who hates your channel

3159
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:32,720
because some con that happened four years ago

3160
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,720
or shit like that

3161
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,720
I guess we've just been on the internet

3162
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,720
long enough that we've collected

3163
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,720
we've accrued

3164
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,720
lore

3165
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,720
through time

3166
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,720
we've accrued relationships

3167
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,720
and with people

3168
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,720
that have

3169
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,720
played out in various ways and now

3170
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,720
that's all part of

3171
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:56,720
the stuff that happened

3172
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,720
see what we're doing

3173
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:00,720
is we're making it

3174
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,720
so long and confusing

3175
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,720
that we can make a lecture about it

3176
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,720
and rake in the big bucks

3177
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:08,720
that's the plan

3178
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,720
if only

3179
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,720
if only someone had the idea

3180
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,720
to make a lecture that explained

3181
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,720
the origins of the horseshoe crew

3182
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,720
and

3183
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,720
the

3184
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,720
formation of the pcp

3185
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:24,720
that would have been a lecture that I think people would have wanted to watch

3186
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,720
oh yeah

3187
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,720
I didn't realize what you were referencing

3188
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,720
I am of course referring

3189
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,720
to the brony lecture much of which

3190
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,720
was concerned with the

3191
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,720
formation of the horseshoe crew and the pcp

3192
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,720
but

3193
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,720
I spilled some shit

3194
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,720
okay

3195
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,720
and it's wiped

3196
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,720
next one is

3197
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,720
from jade

3198
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,720
how are you doing be honest I care about your well being

3199
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,720
well

3200
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,720
for me

3201
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,720
I am feeling hopeful

3202
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,720
about this video project

3203
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,720
I feel

3204
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,720
that makes me feel hopeful

3205
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:10,720
that I think it will do well

3206
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,720
I think it will

3207
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,720
be nice to have done something

3208
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:16,720
in a while

3209
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,720
I'm feeling

3210
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:20,720
stressed about the move but maybe not stressed enough

3211
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,720
because I haven't packed

3212
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,720
I mean I've packed somewhat but I have a lot more to do

3213
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:26,720
so

3214
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:28,720
there's that

3215
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:30,720
and that's it

3216
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,720
I feel

3217
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:36,720
I feel

3218
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,720
similar

3219
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,720
I'm optimistic for projects

3220
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,720
I feel

3221
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:44,720
I mean it did kind of have a breakdown

3222
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:46,720
like just the other day

3223
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:48,720
but then by the end of the day I was okay

3224
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,720
I think there's just a

3225
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:52,720
talk about that

3226
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,720
nah

3227
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,720
it was mostly a gender dysphoria thing

3228
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,720
but like

3229
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,720
things like that happen from time to time

3230
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:02,720
and it's just sort of

3231
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,720
what changes is my ability

3232
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,720
to deal with it and work through it

3233
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:08,720
and then feel better afterwards

3234
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:10,720
and I think that has improved

3235
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,720
since having a therapist

3236
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,720
and

3237
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:16,720
yeah

3238
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,720
I'm more capable

3239
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,720
your therapist is a cis woman

3240
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,720
I believe so

3241
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,720
yeah okay

3242
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,720
you should kill her

3243
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,720
you should punish her

3244
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:32,720
no she's great

3245
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,720
is she

3246
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,720
uh oh

3247
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:38,720
bad news

3248
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:40,720
I'm getting indoctrinated

3249
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,720
yeah

3250
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,720
but yeah

3251
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:46,720
I think my life is

3252
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,720
is alright

3253
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,720
and I'm feeling okay

3254
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,720
it's

3255
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,720
things can come my way

3256
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,720
and it'll be like oh that's bad that sucks

3257
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:58,720
obviously the news is always depressing

3258
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,720
but I'm more

3259
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:02,720
capable of handling things

3260
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:04,720
no not all news

3261
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,720
actually

3262
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,720
I think we did

3263
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,720
you know what

3264
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:12,720
I'm not gonna mention it

3265
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:14,720
because there's a question

3266
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:16,720
coming up but there was

3267
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:18,720
some good news this week that was very funny

3268
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:20,720
so

3269
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:22,720
we'll get to that in a minute

3270
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,720
yeah I'm alright

3271
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,720
yeah

3272
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,720
um

3273
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:30,720
aboro asks

3274
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,720

3275
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,720
anything and anyone you want

3276
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,720
what would you create artistically

3277
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:38,720
so anything

3278
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:40,720
you could do anything at all

3279
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,720
what would you make

3280
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,720
infinite time money

3281
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:46,720
and access to anyone I want

3282
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,720
also presuming they want

3283
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,720
to work with me on this

3284
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:54,720
yeah

3285
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,720
I mean that's kind of like too many options

3286
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,720
or you can pay

3287
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:00,720

01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,720
you can get friggin

3289
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,720
I don't know who's the

3290
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:06,720
most expensive celebrity

3291
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,720
in Hollywood right now

3292
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,720
the no

3293
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,720
doja cat

3294
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:14,720
doja coin

3295
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,720
I would

3296
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,720
get

3297
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,720
I get

3298
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,720
Sergio Leone

3299
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,720
and Ennio Morricone

3300
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,720
the duo that made the movie

3301
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:28,720
and music for

3302
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,720
spaghetti westerns like the good the bad and the ugly

3303
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,720
I'd get those two guys

3304
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,720
and then I would have them make

3305
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,720
the Clarissa Gunsmoke Wild West

3306
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:38,720
movie

3307
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,720
I don't know who would play Clarissa

3308
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,720
maybe it would be even it

3309
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,720
animated I get Quentin Tarantino

3310
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,720
and

3311
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:48,720
Sergio Leone

3312
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:50,720
to co-direct

3313
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,720
the movie

3314
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,720
with Hayao Miyazaki's team

3315
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,720
and

3316
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,720
sure Hayao Miyazaki as well

3317
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,720
and then Ennio Morricone for the film

3318
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,720
and his Clarissa Gunsmoke the Wild West

3319
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:04,720
feature big film

3320
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:06,720
that's what I would do

3321
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,720
so you would make

3322
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,720
a western

3323
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:12,720
yeah

3324
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,720
okay westerns are so fucking cool

3325
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,720
they're like pirates

3326
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,720
but on the desert

3327
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:20,720
a little bit

3328
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:22,720
did you see the new red letter media

3329
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,720
where they talk about the good the bad and the ugly

3330
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,720
it did remind me of how much I love that

3331
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:28,720
yeah

3332
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:30,720
I went back and

3333
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,720
I listened to the soundtrack

3334
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,720
and I'm like

3335
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:38,720
Ennio Morricone is like the Toby Fox

3336
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,720
of

3337
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,720
cinema

3338
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:44,720
now there's a comparison

3339
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,720
um

3340
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,720
do you mean because he makes

3341
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,720
his own soundtrack to his music

3342
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,720
no no Ennio Morricone is the

3343
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,720
musician he's the

3344
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,720
orchestrator and Sergio Leone

3345
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:58,720
is the director

3346
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,720
but Ennio Morricone is just like

3347
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,720
the songs he made for the westerns

3348
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,720
and the films he worked on

3349
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,720
are just so powerful

3350
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,720
and cool and like perfect

3351
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:10,720
and how could somebody be that good at making

3352
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,720
music

3353
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:14,720
and it's the sort of thing where you listen to it

3354
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:16,720
and everything

3355
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,720
the experience of watching the film comes back

3356
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,720
and it's like

3357
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,720
just like Toby Fox

3358
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:24,720
yeah

3359
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,720
yeah

3360
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:28,720
I found

3361
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:30,720
a disgusting thread on twitter that I hate

3362
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:32,720
and I'm not going to look at it anymore

3363
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,720
with infinite money time and resources

3364
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:36,720
I would make angry posts

3365
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,720
on twitter I would say fuck you

3366
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:40,720
um

3367
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,720
god

3368
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,720
infinite

3369
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,720
I could make anything I want

3370
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:48,720
anything at all

3371
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:50,720
and the Muppets would be there

3372
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:52,720
the Muppets I would have curbed

3373
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:54,720
the whole Muppets

3374
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,720
troop yeah

3375
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:58,720
it would be like a multimedia thing

3376
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:00,720
it would be like there's live action stuff

3377
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,720
with the Muppets but also

3378
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:04,720
a Ghibli film animation

3379
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,720
segments

3380
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,720
with Clarissa Gunsmoke

3381
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:10,720
and she shoots her gun

3382
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,720
and she's so cool

3383
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,720
when she does it

3384
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,720
I

3385
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,720
I don't know

3386
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,720
I don't know if I can answer

3387
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:22,720
I can't think of anything

3388
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:24,720
would I make

3389
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,720
like a cartoon

3390
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:28,720
would I like make a whole studio cartoon

3391
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,720
of something I don't know

3392
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,720
what would it be

3393
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,720
maybe I would

3394
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:36,720
maybe I would

3395
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,720
maybe I would

3396
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:44,720
maybe I would get

3397
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:46,720
some writers together

3398
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,720
or something maybe I would just

3399
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,720
workshop

3400
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:52,720
with some writers

3401
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:54,720
maybe I would get a team together

3402
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,720
and we would just come up with something

3403
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,720
we would come up with something we wanted to make

3404
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:00,720
and maybe that's what I would

3405
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,720
I would first invest in

3406
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:04,720
getting people together to come up with something

3407
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,720
that we wanted to make and maybe it would be

3408
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:08,720
I'm thinking maybe a cartoon

3409
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:10,720
or maybe a video game

3410
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,720
you know I would probably make a video game

3411
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:14,720
I think I would probably make a

3412
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:16,720
I don't know what it would be but I think if I could

3413
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,720
yeah if I could make any

3414
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,720
piece of art or tell a story

3415
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:22,720
in any medium and there were no limits

3416
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,720
I think I would go with a video game

3417
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:26,720
and

3418
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,720
the details beyond

3419
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,720
that are

3420
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:32,720
I don't know

3421
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,720
that's all I got

3422
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,720
my answer sucks

3423
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:40,720
alright

3424
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,720
next

3425
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,720
where

3426
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,720
was I sorry I lost my

3427
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:48,720
lost my place

3428
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,720
Brody Pujas says

3429
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:54,720
no voicemail no watch okay

3430
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,720
oh and then some people commented

3431
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,720
on the bonus episode which I'll remind

3432
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:00,720
people I did release the

3433
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,720
Bencast Ben commentary

3434
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:04,720
bonus episode

3435
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:06,720
oh yes I haven't seen that

3436
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:08,720
it is about an hour long

3437
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:10,720
as was the original

3438
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,720
Bencast

3439
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,720
and also

3440
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,720
what was I gonna say

3441
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:18,720
someone pointed out someone else on

3442
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:20,720
Twitter pointed out that

3443
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,720
why didn't I call

3444
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,720
the calm Ben Terry

3445
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:26,720
and I definitely should have

3446
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:28,720
so that's my bad

3447
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,720
well that would be like a comb

3448
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,720
like a like a

3449
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,720
like a honeycomb or a hair comb

3450
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:36,720
comb Ben Terry

3451
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,720
yeah I guess but like what's the

3452
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:40,720
joke in Ben commentary

3453
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,720
there's it's

3454
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:44,720
yeah

3455
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,720
combination

3456
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:48,720
combination Ben Saint and Ben Saint

3457
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,720
the next one

3458
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,720
is

3459
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:54,720
it's from Roxanne Kaiser

3460
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,720
and it says check out this guy's work

3461
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,720
and I think this is links to

3462
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:00,720
more Vinny

3463
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:02,720
more Vinny art

3464
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,720
so I guess let's

3465
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:06,720
Vinny has continued to

3466
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,720
DM me on discord

3467
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:10,720
and I have continued to not look

3468
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:12,720
at them because I generally

3469
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,720
look at them on

3470
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:16,720
the podcast

3471
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,720
okay this is

3472
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,720
this is Saber spark so

3473
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,720
that's not

3474
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:24,720
a podcast member

3475
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:26,720
Saber spark with Tom in a wheelchair

3476
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,720
stand

3477
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:30,720
God please you will just kill me now

3478
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:32,720
wait are you that's not the first one

3479
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,720
this is the second one I'm looking at

3480
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,720
okay the first one gets heavier

3481
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,720
the more clout his opponent has

3482
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,720
his sword gets

3483
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,720
Tom says God please just kill me now

3484
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:44,720
so I was watching a children's cartoon

3485
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,720
and making very artistic critics

3486
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,720
and posting about it on twitter today

3487
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,720
many many people retweeted my hot takes

3488
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:52,720
on pause of fury and how the one cat

3489
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,720
wears a thong my precious good boy persona

3490
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,720
had to have many points of dialogue over

3491
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:58,720
how there are always perverted images being

3492
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,720
snuck into my otherwise wholesome children's media

3493
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:02,720
furthermore my patreon has exploded

3494
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,720
from mom

3495
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:06,720
moms retweeting it and giving me money

3496
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,720
to take down furry cartoons

3497
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:10,720
with too many subliminal messages ruining

3498
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:12,720
the innocent minds of their children

3499
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:14,720
watching these shows

3500
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:16,720
is that a thing?

3501
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:18,720
I don't think he

3502
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:20,720
does he have a patreon?

3503
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:22,720
surely

3504
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:24,720
I don't think he makes most of his money

3505
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,720
through patreon

3506
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,720
I guess he doesn't seem like the type

3507
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:30,720
that would have patreon like fans

3508
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:32,720
but he could get a lot of views

3509
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:34,720
yeah

3510
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,720
no I don't see a patreon

3511
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:38,720
when I google

3512
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:40,720
wait saberspray pink

3513
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:42,720
no I'm wrong

3514
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:44,720
I'm stupid yeah there is one

3515
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:46,720
how much does he make on patreon

3516
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,720
$17,000

3517
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:50,720
he has

3518
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:52,720
okay

3519
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,720
$315 patrons so he's probably making

3520
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:56,720
$1,000 or $2,000

3521
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:58,720
that's not

3522
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,720
I think he makes more money

3523
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:02,720
through ad revenue and partnerships

3524
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,720
and sponsorships and stuff

3525
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:06,720
who cares

3526
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,720
anyway

3527
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,720
back to whatever we were looking at

3528
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:12,720
shit I lost

3529
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:14,720
the page

3530
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:16,720
is

3531
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:18,720
I think it's

3532
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,720
some jojo things it's you

3533
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:22,720
and then me with our jojo stands

3534
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:24,720
oh

3535
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:26,720
yes yes it's

3536
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,720
it's the owoopity

3537
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:30,720
is that my stand?

3538
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:32,720
is that my stand?

3539
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:34,720
I guess so

3540
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,720
gibbon takes stand platformer

3541
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,720
they posted some

3542
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:40,720
other images to me of this

3543
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:42,720
that's like ray woman

3544
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:44,720
because she's a platformer

3545
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,720
I think that's jack

3546
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:48,720
but female

3547
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:50,720

3548
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,720
I can see it

3549
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:54,720
I don't know who the goblin

3550
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:56,720
on the right is

3551
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:58,720
goblin lady

3552
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,720
yeah that's rayman

3553
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,720
and

3554
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:04,720
I don't

3555
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:06,720
why do I always have the cat face

3556
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,720
wait a minute

3557
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:10,720
okay all these three are your stand

3558
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,720
I guess so

3559
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:14,720
yeah

3560
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,720
gibbon takes stand platformer

3561
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,720
cute ai girl gamer

3562
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:20,720
can manifest a character based on

3563
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:22,720
sony playstation platformer games

3564
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,720
the manifestations have the powers of the game they came from

3565
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:26,720
the limitations that it can only

3566
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:28,720
be from

3567
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:30,720
sony playstation exclusive titles

3568
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:32,720
okay it's tauna

3569
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,720

I'm pretty sure

3574
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:44,720

3575

3794
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:20,720

02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:36,720
there are a lot cheaper than like of course

3799
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:38,720
unlimited or even first edition

3800
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,720
even though they're much much newer

3801
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,720
I want to shout out Derek H for selling me these

3802
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:44,720
sold me these at a good price so that we could make a video

3803
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,720
talking about Yu-Gi-Oh cards

3804
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:48,720
because I always love opening these up

3805
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:50,720
and these are the 2017 print

3806
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:52,720
so if you don't know, Legend of the West has many many

3807
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:54,720
different prints and originally came out in 2002

3808
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:56,720
the first edition print

3809
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:58,720
and then many prints after that

3810
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:00,720
but these reaper packs started in

3811
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:02,720
2010 out of the legendary collection

3812
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:04,720
binder edition then they made the

3813
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:06,720
game board edition in 2013 and 2017

3814
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:08,720
so these packs have been around for

3815
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:10,720
not as long but they're still

3816
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,720
actually kind of over

3817
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:14,720
okay good that's the

3818
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:16,720
voicemail experience right there

3819
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,720
yeah I miss it

3820
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:20,720
no killer kauri says

3821
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:22,720
what y'all think about the white house

3822
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:24,720
dunking on republicans and biden being

3823
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:26,720
based for once this was the news I mentioned

3824
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:28,720
before uh yeah biden

3825
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:30,720
did some student loan forgiveness

3826
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:32,720
shockingly

3827
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:34,720
some good news

3828
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:36,720
actually did it

3829
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,720
yeah I wish I hadn't paid my loans

3830
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:40,720
off

3831
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:42,720
but oh well

3832
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:44,720
I got a little bit punked

3833
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:46,720
yeah I got a little bit punked by that

3834
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:48,720
should it just kept being delinquent

3835
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:50,720
but

3836
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:52,720
oh well

3837
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:54,720
it's uh yeah it's like

3838
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:56,720
I'm pretty sure it's like

3839
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:58,720
they're pulling out like the big guns

3840
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,720
for the midterms like

3841
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,720
well now people think we're cool

3842
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:04,720
and I'm like well uh I mean

3843
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:06,720
it is student loan forgiveness so

3844
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:08,720
fine that's pretty good

3845
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:10,720
yeah I do like the way they've been

3846
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:12,720
handling like

3847
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:14,720
uh like

3848
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,720
shitting on republicans for just being

3849
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:18,720
anti everything good

3850
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:20,720
I haven't really seen a lot of it I've

3851
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:22,720
been hearing that the

3852
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:24,720
the verbiage coming out of

3853
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:26,720
the white house has been based lately but

3854
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:28,720
it's I think it was a

3855
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:30,720
twitter account like the white house twitter

3856
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:32,720
account was like

3857
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:34,720
quoting

3858
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:36,720
republicans saying oh this forgiveness

3859
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:38,720
is so bad and then

3860
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:40,720
they're just pointing out like

3861
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:42,720
that this person got like

3862
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:44,720
subsidies from the government

3863
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:46,720
to like repay loans

3864
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:48,720
for stuff

3865
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:50,720
you can do it you can always do it

3866
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:52,720
everyone everyone who

3867
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,720
bitches about it is some rich

3868
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:56,720
asshole that

3869
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:58,720
has some fucking stupid

3870
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:00,720
business loans or ppp loans

3871
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:02,720
that they've taken out and had forgiven

3872
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:06,720
yeah good it's never about

3873
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:08,720
it's never been about like fairness

3874
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:10,720
no they always

3875
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:12,720
talk about how it's not fair but like

3876
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:14,720
it really has never been about it

3877
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:16,720
no they don't actually care

3878
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:18,720
they're just already

3879
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,720
they're already on top and they want to stay

3880
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:22,720
that way

3881
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:24,720
every time

3882
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:26,720
so yeah

3883
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:28,720
killer cowrie I guess I would say

3884
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:30,720
that it seems cool

3885
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:32,720
I guess I wish he did it more often

3886
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:34,720
but I'll take what I can get

3887
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:36,720
Biden does some

3888
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:38,720
some okay things sometimes

3889
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:40,720
even though even though

3890
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:42,720
he's like

3891
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:44,720
even though he was like historically like anti

3892
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:46,720
abortion

3893
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:48,720
and I think he was also kind of a little bit of a

3894
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:50,720
segregationist

3895
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,720
that's bad but like the things he's

3896
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:54,720
done

3897
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:56,720
as president

3898
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:58,720
he's been pretty like good about like

3899
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:00,720
protecting trans rights

3900
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:02,720
he's been pretty pro-abortion

3901
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:04,720
I mean he has

3902
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,720
but like

3903
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:10,720
I don't know what

3904
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:12,720
he can do to like

3905
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:14,720
stop certain things

3906
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:16,720
so it feels like he's not doing anything

3907
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:18,720
and he is just saying

3908
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:20,720
I have solidarity

3909
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:22,720
and then Roe v. Wade is like

3910
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,720
what can be done

3911
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:26,720
for about that I don't know

3912
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:28,720
yeah

3913
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:30,720
can he do anything

3914
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:32,720
he's at least

3915
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:34,720
made his

3916
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:36,720
stance clear I guess

3917
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:38,720
stance is clear which is good

3918
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:40,720
I don't think he can do anything

3919
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:42,720
personally about

3920
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:44,720
Roe v. Wade

3921
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:46,720
that's a judicial

3922
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:48,720
I guess wait

3923
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:50,720
something something codified

3924
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:52,720
is that something you do by executive order

3925
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:54,720
or is that something you do in congress

3926
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,720
I don't actually know how it works

3927
02:14:56,720 --> 02:14:58,720
I think

3928
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:00,720
I don't trust Biden to be like

3929
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:02,720
suddenly like

3930
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:04,720
a super progressive

3931
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:06,720
person

3932
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,720
but if he does good things then that is good

3933
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:10,720
right

3934
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:12,720
like if it helps him stay in power

3935
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:14,720
to be more socialist

3936
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:16,720
and more progressive

3937
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:18,720
then I guess that's good for everyone

3938
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:20,720
yeah

3939
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:22,720
next one

3940
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:24,720
Kuzco asks

3941
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:26,720
when will Ben continue his new adventures

3942
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:28,720
of Winnie the Pooh retrospective

3943
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,720
I'm craving for it for almost three years now

3944
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:32,720
and I feel I'm going to explode

3945
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:34,720
has it been three years

3946
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:36,720
that sucks

3947
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:38,720
Jesus

3948
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:40,720
I do mean to finish it

3949
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:42,720
I have always intended to finish

3950
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,720
uh

3951
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:46,720
I don't know exactly when

3952
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:48,720
but definitely after this current video

3953
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:50,720
is done

3954
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:52,720
after that's done

3955
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:54,720
I probably won't do it right away

3956
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:56,720
but I do have

3957
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,720
I think it's going to be

3958
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,720
when I kind of don't really have anything else

3959
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:02,720
that I'm like

3960
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:04,720
actively working on

3961
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:06,720
I'm going to be like okay now is the time

3962
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:08,720
I can you know take a little

3963
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:10,720
time and just finish that

3964
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:12,720
series up because I

3965
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:14,720
I do want to but it's not like a super high priority

3966
02:16:14,720 --> 02:16:16,720
there are other things that are more

3967
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:18,720
pressing

3968
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:20,720
so when the pressing things are

3969
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:22,720
relieved

3970
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:24,720
that will be

3971
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:26,720
when I do that

3972
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:28,720
um

3973
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:30,720
number one

3974
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,720
Ikutsuki Stan account

3975
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:34,720
asks have you explored each other's bodies

3976
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:36,720
Gabe do you want to

3977
02:16:36,720 --> 02:16:38,720
feel that one

3978
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:40,720
uh well

3979
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:42,720
not

3980
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:44,720
from the inside

3981
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:46,720
not from the inside

3982
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:48,720
yeah that's a good

3983
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:50,720
I would agree with that answer

3984
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:52,720
um

3985
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:54,720
Andrew Starkey asks

3986
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:56,720
utopian fupor or future

3987
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:58,720
or dystopian future

3988
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:00,720
are you asking which one I would prefer

3989
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:02,720
or which one

3990
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,720
yeah dystopia please

3991
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:06,720
dystopia please

3992
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:08,720
I would I don't expect I don't think we're

3993
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:10,720
actually headed for like a super dystopian

3994
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:12,720
unless you think I mean we kind of already live in one

3995
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:14,720
I don't think we do kind of already live

3996
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:16,720
in one I mean depending on

3997
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:18,720
your financial stability

3998
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:20,720
uh living in

3999
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:22,720
like a first world

4000
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:24,720
country may feel like a third

4001
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:26,720
world at the moment if you

4002
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:28,720
don't have a lot that's

4003
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:30,720
social safety nets have been

4004
02:17:30,720 --> 02:17:32,720
eh it's not good

4005
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:34,720
it's not I don't think I don't feel

4006
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:36,720
like it's it's necessarily

4007
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:38,720
on like a

4008
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:40,720
guaranteed track

4009
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:42,720
like I think

4010
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:44,720
the thing that's

4011
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:46,720
potentially the most worrying is like

4012
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:48,720
Russia doing a whole cold war

4013
02:17:48,720 --> 02:17:50,720
but then actually going through

4014
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:52,720
with a nuke or two

4015
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:54,720
but I don't know that that's any more

4016
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:56,720
likely than it ever has been

4017
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:58,720
yeah

4018
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:00,720
oh god I forgot

4019
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:02,720
about that

4020
02:18:02,720 --> 02:18:04,720
I mean he's always saying it

4021
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:06,720
he's saying um

4022
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,720
I still have a nukes guys

4023
02:18:08,720 --> 02:18:10,720
I could like blow you up

4024
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:12,720
I should be scared of me

4025
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:14,720
I guess if I had nukes I would probably

4026
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:16,720
also do that so I get it

4027
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:18,720
you know when when all you when all

4028
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:20,720
you've got is a nuke everything looks

4029
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:22,720
like a big red button

4030
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:24,720
with a key behind it

4031
02:18:24,720 --> 02:18:26,720
yeah if you know what I mean

4032
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:28,720
and then of course climate catastrophe

4033
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:30,720
uh oh sure

4034
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:32,720
sure it's like that's

4035
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:34,720
definitely going to result in

4036
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:36,720
thousands upon thousands of deaths

4037
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:38,720
over the next hundred years

4038
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:40,720
unless I mean even if

4039
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:42,720
I mean changes are made immediately

4040
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:44,720
it's gonna people are gonna be

4041
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:46,720
displaced to the very least

4042
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:48,720
so I don't know

4043
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:50,720
I mean if climate

4044
02:18:50,720 --> 02:18:52,720
stuff gets

4045
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:54,720
going I mean over the next hundred

4046
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:56,720
years I mean I would say probably

4047
02:18:56,720 --> 02:18:58,720
millions and maybe billions even

4048
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:00,720
depending on like how

4049
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:02,720
severe

4050
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:04,720
yeah I mean even just the heat

4051
02:19:04,720 --> 02:19:06,720
waves and like the coming

4052
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:08,720
like cold wave

4053
02:19:08,720 --> 02:19:10,720
I guess of winter

4054
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,720
like whether in

4055
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:14,720
Europe at least is getting more extreme

4056
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:16,720
so like the hotter times

4057
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:18,720
are gonna be hotter the colder

4058
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:20,720
times are gonna be colder so

4059
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:22,720
if you don't have

4060
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:24,720
the infrastructure you might

4061
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:26,720
just die from

4062
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:28,720
a heat stroke

4063
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:30,720
or die from

4064
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:32,720
being too cold then you can't turn

4065
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:34,720
on your radiator

4066
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:36,720
because it's way too expensive

4067
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:38,720
because of the war

4068
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:40,720
in Ukraine

4069
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:42,720
so you know

4070
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:44,720
I'm expecting

4071
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:46,720
I mean people are predicting

4072
02:19:46,720 --> 02:19:48,720
like yeah people are just gonna

4073
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:50,720
freeze to death today

4074
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:52,720
this year there's just gonna be a thing

4075
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:54,720
that will happen a lot

4076
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:56,720
mostly older people

4077
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,720
who like don't have people to

4078
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:00,720
oh well okay then

4079
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:02,720
but oh fine

4080
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:04,720
I mean just like

4081
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:06,720
just like covid right like

4082
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:08,720
it's only gonna kill people that are like old

4083
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:10,720
or people that have pre-existing conditions

4084
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:12,720
and like you know so whatever

4085
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:14,720
I mean it happens every year anyway

4086
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:16,720
the older people you know

4087
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:18,720
if they don't have family and they get

4088
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,720
snowed in they just

4089
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:22,720
they're just fucked

4090
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:24,720
but like

4091
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:26,720
everyone's

4092
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:28,720
feeling

4093
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:30,720
the energy increases

4094
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:32,720
Vlad I'll never be old or dead

4095
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:36,720
it's hard to be like

4096
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:38,720
just blanketly

4097
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:40,720
oh yeah we're not heading for a dystopia

4098
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:42,720
we're not gonna it's not gonna be terrible

4099
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:44,720
because it definitely is

4100
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:46,720
I mean disasters happen

4101
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,720
there's always been

4102
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:50,720
disasters

4103
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,720
I think what's gonna happen

4104
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:54,720
is that we're going to just get more

4105
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:56,720
used to whatever

4106
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:58,720
dystopian things are happening

4107
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:00,720
and just continue to not call it a dystopia

4108
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:02,720
because it does feel like that

4109
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:04,720
has already happened a bit

4110
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:06,720
yeah I mean it's happened a lot

4111
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:08,720
yeah

4112
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:10,720
yeah and it'll probably

4113
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:12,720
probably continue to happen

4114
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:16,720
so what I'm saying is so yeah by the time

4115
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:18,720
we get to what we consider a dystopia

4116
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,720
now by that point we'll have been

4117
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:22,720
acclimated to it and we'll feel like it's

4118
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:24,720
alright so

4119
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:26,720
so don't worry about it

4120
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:28,720
you're gonna feel

4121
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:30,720
yes I really like you're gonna feel like it's

4122
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:32,720
normal when the time comes

4123
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:34,720
and then you'll be able to like ignore it

4124
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:36,720
and play video games and it'll be fine

4125
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:38,720
that's right that's that's

4126
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:40,720
correct

4127
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:42,720
next one is from never paint

4128
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:44,720
asks Ben are you already

4129
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:46,720
or still awake right now

4130
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:48,720
recording this episode I

4131
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:50,720
answered that at the beginning

4132
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:52,720
yes I woke up early this morning

4133
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:54,720
I slept

4134
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:56,720
woke up a little earlier than yeah I went

4135
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:58,720
to sleep and I woke up very early in the morning

4136
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:00,720
and now I'm awake

4137
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:02,720
um the next one is from

4138
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:03,720
dream man

4139
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:05,720
beescapades conclusion when

4140
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,720
I crave it

4141
02:22:07,720 --> 02:22:09,720
uh yeah I do want to finish

4142
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:11,720
beescapades obviously it has been a while

4143
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:13,720
since I did anything with it and I

4144
02:22:13,720 --> 02:22:15,720
would have to

4145
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:17,720
kind of pick it up again and figure out

4146
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:19,720
where I left it off

4147
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:21,720
kind of the same as the Winnie the Pooh

4148
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:23,720
retrospective that's something that I want

4149
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:25,720
to pick up at some point but only after

4150
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:27,720
like other more pressing

4151
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:29,720
matters are dealt with

4152
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:31,720
I would probably do the Winnie the Pooh

4153
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:33,720
one first because that one is not

4154
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:35,720
gonna take as long

4155
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:37,720
because it's easier

4156
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:39,720
so yeah at some point

4157
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:41,720
in the not too distant future I hope to have

4158
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:43,720
this video done

4159
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:45,720
and the slime and punishment kick

4160
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:47,720
starter underway

4161
02:22:47,720 --> 02:22:49,720
and then maybe after the kick

4162
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:51,720
starter is over at that point maybe

4163
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:53,720
I'll be like well nothing to do but

4164
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:55,720
finish my Winnie the Pooh retrospective

4165
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:57,720
and then when that's done well nothing

4166
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,720
else but might as well finish

4167
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:01,720
beescapades that's

4168
02:23:01,720 --> 02:23:03,720
kind of the plan

4169
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:07,720
and then the next this is the last one we've got

4170
02:23:07,720 --> 02:23:09,720
is from CJ who says

4171
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:11,720
when is the next oops all

4172
02:23:11,720 --> 02:23:13,720
guests

4173
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:15,720
uh well it's never

4174
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:17,720
any plan to do multiple

4175
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:19,720
definitely there why would you

4176
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,720
why would you want there to be another one

4177
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:23,720
it was a

4178
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,720
clusterfuck it was unbelievable

4179
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:27,720
it took me all week to organize

4180
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:29,720
that and I don't

4181
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:31,720
yeah I don't want to do

4182
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:33,720
another one it was really hard and the results

4183
02:23:33,720 --> 02:23:35,720
I mean it was fun I guess but the

4184
02:23:35,720 --> 02:23:37,720
results were not worth it

4185
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:39,720
we're not worth how hard

4186
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:41,720
it was to make it happen is what I'm saying

4187
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:45,720
um so it was an experiment

4188
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:47,720
and it was a successful experiment

4189
02:23:47,720 --> 02:23:49,720
and that I successfully obtained the information

4190
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:51,720
that I needed and that information

4191
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:53,720
was that I should not do another

4192
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:55,720
one

4193
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:57,720
yeah an experiment where

4194
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:59,720
like is this a stupid idea

4195
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:01,720
oh conclusive

4196
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:03,720
yes

4197
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:05,720
yes it was

4198
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:07,720
if anyone could have told you

4199
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:09,720
so beforehand but now we have proven it

4200
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:11,720
with science

4201
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:13,720
uh and that's it

4202
02:24:13,720 --> 02:24:15,720
that's the end

4203
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:17,720
of the voice of well

4204
02:24:17,720 --> 02:24:19,720
end of the ask

4205
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:21,720
things

4206
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,720
I will

4207
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:25,720
yeah after I move

4208
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:27,720
I will try and set about

4209
02:24:29,720 --> 02:24:31,720
fixing fixing the voicemail

4210
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:33,720
box among other things

4211
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:35,720
I would also hope

4212
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:37,720
to maybe have better internet in my new place

4213
02:24:37,720 --> 02:24:39,720
so maybe we could stream a little more successfully

4214
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:41,720
after that

4215
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:43,720
so that's sure yeah

4216
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:45,720
so that's I like to try that again

4217
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:47,720
when I'm in my new place with more rely

4218
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:49,720
hopefully with more reliable internet

4219
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:55,720
yeah I'm gonna be

4220
02:24:55,720 --> 02:24:57,720
slowly working

4221
02:24:57,720 --> 02:24:59,720
on the Clarissa and I'll get those

4222
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:01,720
commissions done

4223
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:03,720
um

4224
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:05,720
potentially we'll go back

4225
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:07,720
to streaming Elden Ring

4226
02:25:07,720 --> 02:25:09,720
I was reminded obviously

4227
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:11,720
last time Never Paint wants to see it

4228
02:25:11,720 --> 02:25:13,720
I'm like yeah people did like it

4229
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:15,720
I was just maybe streaming

4230
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:17,720
too much

4231
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:19,720
or like at

4232
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:21,720
irregular times

4233
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:23,720
but I feel like if I made an announcement

4234
02:25:23,720 --> 02:25:25,720
I'd be like yeah

4235
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:27,720
a little stream

4236
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:29,720
people come back have a look

4237
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:31,720
I do want to

4238
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:33,720
beat the game on stream

4239
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:35,720
I feel like some amount of

4240
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:37,720
completion would be fun

4241
02:25:37,720 --> 02:25:39,720
how far through it are you

4242
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:41,720
I

4243
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:43,720
have got

4244
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:45,720
to

4245
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:47,720
the

4246
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:49,720
the capital city

4247
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:51,720
the capital city

4248
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:53,720
but there are places beyond

4249
02:25:53,720 --> 02:25:55,720
that I've not seen yet

4250
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:57,720
I think a snowy place

4251
02:25:57,720 --> 02:25:59,720
where you can eat whatever buses in the city

4252
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:01,720
and then move towards that

4253
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:03,720
and explore that

4254
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:05,720
how much

4255
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:07,720
of what you've played of it

4256
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:09,720
have you done on stream versus off

4257
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:11,720
from my

4258
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:13,720
character everything has been

4259
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:15,720
on stream

4260
02:26:15,720 --> 02:26:17,720
the only things I've done off stream

4261
02:26:17,720 --> 02:26:19,720
were like

4262
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:21,720
doing buses that I've already done before

4263
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:23,720
but like with

4264
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:25,720
like being summoned by my brothers

4265
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:27,720
so just be like

4266
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:29,720
helping them with their character

4267
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:31,720
which has been nice

4268
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:37,720
should

4269
02:26:37,720 --> 02:26:39,720
part of me wants to play Elden Ring

4270
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:41,720
and part of me

4271
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,720
is a dozen I don't know

4272
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:45,720
I was interested for a while and I said

4273
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:47,720
I'll get around to playing it

4274
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:49,720
now I'm a little more like should I

4275
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:53,720
I don't know

4276
02:26:53,720 --> 02:26:55,720
it's gonna be there you just save it for when you're like

4277
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:57,720
you know what I have a hankering for

4278
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:59,720
of souls

4279
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:01,720
like gameplay

4280
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:05,720
and this one has

4281
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:07,720
so much of it I'll get it

4282
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:09,720
I'll play this one

4283
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:11,720
just do it on a hunch

4284
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:13,720
do it on a whim

4285
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:15,720
okay

4286
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:17,720
I guess that's a good advice

4287
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:21,720
alright

4288
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:23,720
any I mean

4289
02:27:23,720 --> 02:27:25,720
trying to think if there's

4290
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:27,720
anything else I want to say

4291
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:29,720
before we wrap up

4292
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:33,720
what are we going for

4293
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:35,720
2 hours and 30 minutes actually

4294
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:37,720
feel good about that

4295
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:39,720
I was afraid this might be a really short one

4296
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:41,720
because no voicemails and so on

4297
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:45,720
we can talk about

4298
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:47,720
usually a voicemail

4299
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:49,720
prompts a discussion so if a question

4300
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:51,720
does the same thing it's about

4301
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:53,720
it's gonna be about the same time spent

4302
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:55,720
that's true

4303
02:27:55,720 --> 02:27:57,720
but we get more voicemails than we get

4304
02:27:57,720 --> 02:27:59,720
askpcp responses

4305
02:27:59,720 --> 02:28:01,720
I guess that's the truth

4306
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:03,720
people should follow us on twitter

4307
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:05,720
people should follow us on twitter

4308
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:07,720
also I should remove the old

4309
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:09,720
pinned post and

4310
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:11,720
I'll make the

4311
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:13,720
oh no I can't make the ben commentary

4312
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:15,720
the pinned post because

4313
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:17,720
I tweeted it from my account

4314
02:28:17,720 --> 02:28:19,720
you fool

4315
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:21,720
I need to just make an identical tweet

4316
02:28:21,720 --> 02:28:23,720
yeah that's true

4317
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:29,720
alright well I guess

4318
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:31,720
if we're done I'm gonna

4319
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:33,720
go open my curtains and see what sort of

4320
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:37,720
seems like the light outside is a little dim

4321
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:39,720
I'm wondering if it's a little cloudy at the moment

4322
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:41,720
so

4323
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:43,720
I'll just have to

4324
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:45,720
try and set up, I think I'm just gonna try and

4325
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:47,720
take what I've got and set up the best

4326
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:49,720
shot I can manage to make

4327
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:51,720
and then

4328
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:53,720
if I get that

4329
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:55,720
figured out and I feel like then I'm just

4330
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:57,720
gonna go I'm just gonna start filming

4331
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:59,720
that's my plan for the day

4332
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:01,720
hell yeah

4333
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:03,720
and I don't know how long it's gonna take me

4334
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:05,720
you filmed that

4335
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:07,720
content

4336
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:09,720
content baby are you ready for

4337
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:11,720
content oh my god what if it's

4338
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:13,720
bad what if I film it and I'm like this was terrible

4339
02:29:13,720 --> 02:29:15,720
this was awful nobody wants to see this

4340
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:17,720
no

4341
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:19,720
what if I film it

4342
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:21,720
then you

4343
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:23,720
look at it and if you hate it you film it again

4344
02:29:23,720 --> 02:29:25,720
do a different

4345
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:27,720
what if I film it

4346
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:29,720
and then I

4347
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:31,720
delete it and then I don't show

4348
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:33,720
anyone and then I get pink pill

4349
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:35,720
Biden pink pills me and I go trans

4350
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:37,720
and then I'm like I'm rebranding my channel

4351
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:39,720
and I'm gonna delete

4352
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:41,720
this video instead of post it

4353
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:43,720
what do we think

4354
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:45,720
what do we think about that

4355
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:47,720
I would support your every move

4356
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:49,720
thank you

4357
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:51,720
I was it that was a test

4358
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:53,720
and you pass

4359
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:55,720
um

4360
02:29:55,720 --> 02:29:57,720
I guess I yeah I guess

4361
02:29:57,720 --> 02:29:59,720
then I could I could I could

4362
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:01,720
I could just record it I could just record it then there

4363
02:30:01,720 --> 02:30:03,720
would be no reason why I do that's why

4364
02:30:03,720 --> 02:30:05,720
it was yeah that's true that's actually true

4365
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:07,720
because it's just you I feel

4366
02:30:07,720 --> 02:30:09,720
like I don't know part of me thinks

4367
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:11,720
that like

4368
02:30:11,720 --> 02:30:13,720
if I re-recorded it

4369
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:15,720
a second time

4370
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:17,720
like it like if for some reason

4371
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:19,720
I was not happy with how it came out the first time

4372
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:21,720
and I recorded it again I wonder

4373
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:23,720
if

4374
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,720
like the sort of like

4375
02:30:25,720 --> 02:30:27,720
improvisational I haven't done

4376
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:29,720
this before

4377
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:31,720
quality would be lost and that

4378
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:33,720
would be bad like it would be like more

4379
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:35,720
flat and boring

4380
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:37,720
in its delivery or

4381
02:30:37,720 --> 02:30:39,720
would it be better

4382
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:41,720
because I'd be more practiced at it and I'd be more

4383
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:43,720
confident in what I was saying

4384
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:45,720
I think it would be better

4385
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:47,720
I mean even if like you come up with

4386
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:49,720
something off the cuff

4387
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:51,720
that's pretty good

4388
02:30:51,720 --> 02:30:53,720
you can just say it again

4389
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:55,720
you can deliver it

4390
02:30:55,720 --> 02:30:57,720
try to deliver the same way if that's

4391
02:30:57,720 --> 02:30:59,720
if that's easy to do

4392
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:01,720
I think when it comes to like

4393
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:03,720
off the cuff conversations

4394
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:05,720
that's impossible to like properly recreate

4395
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:07,720
because the reaction timing

4396
02:31:07,720 --> 02:31:09,720
with the other person

4397
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:11,720
is hard to like pull off the same way

4398
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:13,720
yeah

4399
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:15,720
so you just have to do a different version of it

4400
02:31:15,720 --> 02:31:17,720
where everyone knows that it's been done before

4401
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:19,720
but they're just saying it

4402
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:21,720
damn well I mean

4403
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:23,720
that raises a

4404
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:25,720
I'll call it a paradox

4405
02:31:25,720 --> 02:31:27,720
that's like a Zeno's paradox

4406
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:29,720
because then in theory

4407
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:31,720
if I were to

4408
02:31:31,720 --> 02:31:33,720
record it once

4409
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:35,720
it's not good enough

4410
02:31:35,720 --> 02:31:37,720
and then I re-recorded it again

4411
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:39,720
and that improved it

4412
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:41,720
like if that made it better

4413
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:43,720
what if I then was like okay

4414
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:45,720
but if I record it again

4415
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,720
it'll be even better

4416
02:31:47,720 --> 02:31:49,720
I'll be even more confident

4417
02:31:49,720 --> 02:31:51,720
even more practiced

4418
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:53,720
and then it's like okay

4419
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:55,720
every time I record it

4420
02:31:55,720 --> 02:31:57,720
every time I redo it

4421
02:31:57,720 --> 02:31:59,720
it would get better and better and better

4422
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:01,720
I don't think it necessarily gets better

4423
02:32:01,720 --> 02:32:03,720
next

4424
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:05,720
yeah

4425
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:07,720
they dissolve away

4426
02:32:07,720 --> 02:32:09,720
and you're left with

4427
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:11,720
the refined metal

4428
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:13,720
in theory I can just edit them out

4429
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:15,720
my hope is that

4430
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:17,720
in editing those things will be removed anyway

4431
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:19,720
sure

4432
02:32:19,720 --> 02:32:21,720
um

4433
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:23,720
I mean

4434
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:25,720
it depends on if you have something

4435
02:32:25,720 --> 02:32:27,720
to cut to or if you're gonna do like a jump cut

4436
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:29,720
or just go closer

4437
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:31,720
what's the thing people do?

4438
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:33,720
they cut

4439
02:32:33,720 --> 02:32:35,720
out like a pause

4440
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:37,720
or a flub

4441
02:32:37,720 --> 02:32:39,720
move the camera closer

4442
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:41,720
but like zoom in

4443
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:43,720
it's the same shot

4444
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:45,720
it's different enough visually

4445
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:47,720
that you don't notice that there was a cut in time

4446
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:49,720
hmm

4447
02:32:49,720 --> 02:32:51,720
yeah I see

4448
02:32:51,720 --> 02:32:53,720
I'm not a

4449
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:55,720
particular practice editor

4450
02:32:55,720 --> 02:32:57,720
but I'm gonna do my best

4451
02:32:57,720 --> 02:32:59,720
my damn best

4452
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:01,720
alright

4453
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:03,720
but I guess we're done with the episode

4454
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:05,720
yeah

4455
02:33:05,720 --> 02:33:07,720
and it's only

4456
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:09,720
it's only 1.30pm for me

4457
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:11,720
it is 8.30am

4458
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:13,720
for me and the sun

4459
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:15,720
the sun is out so

4460
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:17,720
this is good

4461
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:19,720
dammit I could have started even earlier

4462
02:33:19,720 --> 02:33:21,720
well I wouldn't have been awake

4463
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:23,720
I wouldn't I only just

4464
02:33:23,720 --> 02:33:25,720
managed to get everything ready

4465
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:27,720
I just kept the episode short

4466
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:29,720
should have insisted on a 2 hour episode

4467
02:33:29,720 --> 02:33:31,720
oh well

4468
02:33:31,720 --> 02:33:33,720

4489
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:15,720
that's the end of the episode

4490
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:17,720
see you next week

4491
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:19,720
goodbye

4492
02:34:19,720 --> 02:34:21,720
goodbye

4493
02:34:23,720 --> 02:34:25,720
okay

4494
02:34:25,720 --> 02:34:27,720
we'll have to edit this back in

4495
02:34:27,720 --> 02:34:29,720
to the end but we got a last

4496
02:34:29,720 --> 02:34:31,720
minute question just now

4497
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:33,720
so the question was from white poop

4498
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:35,720
misogynered

4499
02:34:35,720 --> 02:34:37,720
and I'm still recording

4500
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:39,720
he said

4501
02:34:53,720 --> 02:34:55,720
after he detects them

4502
02:34:57,720 --> 02:34:59,720
I

4503
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:01,720
I don't know

4504
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:03,720
if

4505
02:35:03,720 --> 02:35:05,720
I mean it's a pretty simple answer

4506
02:35:07,720 --> 02:35:09,720
pretty simple answer to that maybe it wasn't clear

4507
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:11,720
in reading it but

4508
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:13,720
those buffs are

4509
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:15,720
too strong

4510
02:35:15,720 --> 02:35:17,720
even though

4511
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:19,720
disrupt can cancel more powerful

4512
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:21,720
higher level magic than itself

4513
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:23,720
like it's easier to disrupt magic

4514
02:35:23,720 --> 02:35:25,720
than it is to

4515
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:27,720
do it

4516
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:29,720
but this is like too much

4517
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:31,720
Damian's like a pretty good wizard

4518
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:33,720
but

4519
02:35:33,720 --> 02:35:35,720
and even though disrupt is a pretty simple spell

4520
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:37,720
but even so

4521
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:39,720
it's too far beyond

4522
02:35:39,720 --> 02:35:41,720
his ability

4523
02:35:41,720 --> 02:35:43,720
even to disrupt it

4524
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:45,720
let alone to cast it

4525
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:47,720
and that's it

4526
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:49,720
thanks

4527
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:51,720
thanks for the question

4528
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:53,720
okay I didn't really have anything to say about it

4529
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:55,720
okay

4530
02:35:55,720 --> 02:35:57,720
sorry I could have just done that myself
