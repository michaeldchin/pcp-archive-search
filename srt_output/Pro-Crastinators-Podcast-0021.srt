00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast PCP, and we're here

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,680
once again to entertain you with wildly new stories about our lives and the things that we

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,360
like to talk about. I'm the host of this thing, I'm the best guy ever, besty boy, Nate Cool Guy,

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:24,560
we also got Digibro, we got Ben Saint, H-R.com, Endless Jess, Lightning Bolt, Lightning Bolt,

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:33,920
Sleep, Sleep, Sleep, and The Davoo. Bunch of Z's. Yeah, because our topic for today is indeed

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,800
snooze factor. Sleep, the restful thing you gotta do every night. Sleep is a boring topic,

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
a lot of people say sleep is a boring topic, and I'm one of them. Sleep is a fascinating topic.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,080
No, sleep is the most interesting topic in the world, and it's because I've got a great anecdote

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,920
about my life and how it's been ruined by sleep. Here's the thing, this podcast, conceptually,

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,000
if you're doing a podcast about sleep, it's all just gonna be people talking about how little

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,840
sleep they get, what hours they sleep, what weird ass sleep schedules they've gotten onto,

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,680
and possibly, if we're particularly unlucky, dreams. Oh no, we're not getting into dreams.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,920
Let's avoid the topic of dreams. Except for mine, because I had a really interesting one last night.

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,480
You won't believe this, it was trippy. I must have been high, I must have been on drugs or

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,400
something, I must have been taking PCP. Shut up, I had a dream this morning, when I woke up this

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,120
morning, and my dream was that I had slept for like 14 hours straight, and that dream came true.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,840
It was real, my life was ruined today because I slept so long, it doesn't even make sense.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,520
I hate it, it's the worst. Every day I wake up, and I don't get out of bed, and I feel like I

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
have slept the entire day, I feel like it's like eight in the afternoon, I feel like I just

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,880
keep putting off. Eight is nighttime, it's not afternoon. I know, I feel like I've slept until

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,640
eight in the afternoon, but then I... No, it's night. But then, shut up, then I get up, and it's still

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,960
early, and I don't know, I'm confused, I'm confused about my life. I do hate that, I do hate that.

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,480
My schedule. And Digi famously has a retardedly gay sleep schedule, as he describes it, right?

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,320
Yeah, I sleep at random times, it's pretty much been that way my whole life, I've never been able

25
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,160
to like... Was school a challenge for that purpose? Yeah, like, for me it was like, you know, because

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,280
we had a bedtime of like 10 o'clock, and me and Victor both had this problem, we just lay in bed

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
for hours, and just stare at the fucking ceiling. You know what I would do? You know what, I did

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
that exact same thing, I would stay up and I would play my Game Boy SP, such fond memories of playing,

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,760
no, not my, yeah, my SP, with the fucking backlight, the backlight ruined my sleep schedule. If it

30
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,920
wasn't for that backlight, I would have gotten a thousand more hours of sleep. Yo, the reason why

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:06,160
handheld consoles are totally worthless. You gotta download Flux onto your Game Boy SP. Yeah,

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,600
that's right, I'm going to hurt my eyes when I'm blasting fucking Super Mario, Mario Luigi

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,160
Superstar Saga playing thousands of hours into the night. Exactly, that exact game with the

34
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:23,200
exact situation. Yeah, dude, best game of all time. So anyone want to, anyone, anyone here

35
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,160
likes sleep? Does anyone have a positive view of sleep? Well, I guess there is a whole lot less

36
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,720
of it you have to do. I love getting into bed at an appropriate time. I enjoy that. Here's what I

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,520
feel about sleep is I hate getting, I hate starting it, and I hate stopping it. I hate

38
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,080
everything about it. That's fair. Like when I, resigning myself to go to bed for the evening is,

39
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,920
I'm just giving up, I feel like I'm just saying just it's over, I've failed, I've failed at whatever

40
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,960
it is I'm trying to do right now, time to just embrace it, embrace oblivion. That might be more

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,960
true than you know, because theoretically, if you subscribe to the, well I forgot the term for it,

42
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,080
but the term that every time you go to sleep, you die and woke as a new person with new memories,

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,040
you very well, might have failed. That's actually what I'm counting on when I go to bed.

44
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,520
To be reborn like a magnificent phoenix. I don't have a sleep schedule, like I don't go to bed when

45
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,040
I'm physically tired, I go to bed when I'm emotionally exhausted and drained, and I don't want to live

46
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,720
in this world anymore, and I just want this version of me to die, so that tomorrow some new man can

47
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,000
take my place, and maybe make some more leeway than I did, maybe chip away at the world a little bit

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,640
more than I accomplished. Which really, if you think about it, is what humanity does on a whole

49
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,960
as well. We're just sending out new foot soldiers to try to pave ways for the rest of us. I completely

50
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,400
relate to what Jesse was saying, though, and I brought that up at the end of Insomnia Analysis

51
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:58,400
too, where I was saying that whenever I have these days where it's like being awake is only

52
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,360
going to make me more miserable, and the only thing I can do is try to sleep. Oh yeah, right,

53
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,480
I remember that. It's like a reset button, it's like, okay, fuck yeah, this is all a failure,

54
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,440
it all has to burn, we'll try again. It doesn't work, it doesn't work, because the longer you

55
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,000
sleep, at least this is for me, the longer I sleep, the guiltier I feel when I wake up.

56
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,160
It only makes everything worse. Well, Ben, I have some luck in this regard. You can restart,

57
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,320
you can reset the SEGA as many times as you want, you're still playing the same shitty game. It's

58
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,600
still fucking Disney's Roar of the Beast. You're still playing fucking Sonic and Knuckles, and you

59
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:45,680
don't have the expansion. Oh, it's like... I have some luck in that situation, Ben, because I don't

60
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,400
have any way of keeping track how long of how long, like, I kind of think... What do you mean,

61
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,080
you don't have a clock? Well, I fall asleep, and I'm like, well, because you know, I usually have

62
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,680
to lay in bed for like an hour before I'll actually pass out, so I don't really know when I fell asleep,

63
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,000
I have like a kind of vague idea, and then I wake up and it's like, well, I guess I slept for eight

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,680
hours, maybe it was 10, I really am not entirely sure. I'm such a fuck, I need to, I can't allow

65
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,240
my, because it'll happen to me like it happened today, I'll sleep for fucking 12 hours straight

66
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,360
if I don't set my alarms for eight hours. I don't even know why, I'm a deformed individual,

67
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,400
I'm not a real human being, I've got some shit fucked up inside me, I have to, I have to set this,

68
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,640
like, I set literally like eight alarms to go off in five minute intervals every morning, that I,

69
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,400
it's a real fucking annoyance every night when I go to sleep, I have to calculate, okay, eight

70
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,200
hours from now, I'm gonna need like 10 billion alarms to go off, so I don't fucking waste the

71
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,480
entire day. You want me to talk about how I get myself awake and all that stuff, okay, so I'll

72
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,480
start with at the beginning of life when sleeping is miserable, because you're a kid, you can't

73
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,760
decide anything, and your parents are old people who don't understand, no white noise, white noise

74
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,360
wasn't invented yet, when they were people, and freaking ASMR wasn't invented at all yet, right?

75
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,720
White noise existed, just wasn't something you could load up on your computer. Well, it was all

76
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,680
black and white noise. If you couldn't load it on your computer, it effectively didn't exist,

77
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,920
you had to create your own white noise farm, like a wind farm. Yeah, like in the old days,

78
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,720
they had out, they would hibernate. Quite individual. You had to grow TVs out of the soil

79
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
with little rabbit ear antennae, that's how you pluck them out of the ground, like turn them.

80
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,760
Brief tangent. I discovered white noise, like, incidentally, because like there was an attic

81
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,000
fan, like right next to, right outside my bedroom door, and whenever there was something to happen

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,840
in the house that we had the attic fan out, you know, like some corpses that we had to burn,

83
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,280
something like that, I don't know, I don't know. We turned on the attic fan, you know,

84
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,760
to whisper away all of the sin, and I would just be laying there in other tranquility,

85
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,840
and I was like, what is this that's going on? How is all this noise making me sleep better?

86
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,160
Oh my gosh, too bad I'm a kid with no agency over my life and can't just turn on this attic

87
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,480
fan every night, all night. You know, so then when I get my room, have my own computer, I

88
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,680
discover like white noise, and immediately get into rain sounds, shout out to rainymood.com,

89
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,200
it's rain all the time. On that subject, I gotta say that the onset of summer has been the best

90
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,960
thing for my sleep life, because now I have an air conditioner unit in my window, it's super loud

91
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,680
and rattly, but it's perfect white noise, it's like the, it's like the thumb of a mother's heartbeat

92
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,120
as I rest in the womb. Yeah, man. Yeah, it's like a heartbeat. I keep it, I keep it at max,

93
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,520
my room is like an icy tomb, so I'm just like sitting there in a cold embrace. You gotta love

94
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,000
that, that healthy rhythmic sound of a heartbeat that sounds like, that's the sound of a healthy

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,560
heart right there, for sure. I gotta say, Duvou, relevant to the rainy mood, I do owe quite a bit

96
00:08:50,560 --> 00:09:00,160
of sleep in my life to the website, or rather type rain fire jazz onto Google, and you'll get this,

97
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,760
it's like a mute this play, or a play these together thing, where it'll play a video of rainfall,

98
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:14,720
a video of like a burning fire in a fireplace, and then a video of the song, the smell of black coffee

99
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,480
from Phoenix Wright, like the jazz version. Oh yeah. I actually found a three hour video,

100
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,040
which was most relaxing jazz music, and it was just that on loop for three hours. Yeah,

101
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,240
that's lazy. And if you're on this, on this website, it just keeps looping those things forever,

102
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:40,000
so I've had like times where I've listened to like 48 hours of just that song over rain and fire

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,160
all day. The only time a YouTuber is allowed to cry is when it's all over, so one time,

104
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,920
so I found out about white noise, and maybe some of you guys, maybe some of you guys have

105
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,640
back we have, I don't know if DeVoo would, but from the oblongs, anybody remember the oblongs?

106
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,440
I remember, not that well. What was this? I don't know. It was an adult swim show.

107
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,880
No, I know the show, I don't know what you're talking about specifically. It's not one of the

108
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,520
adult swim shows that anyone cares about or remembers. It only had like, it only had 10 episodes,

109
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,560
but they would replay them like. Bob Oblong was an inspirational character, he was the coolest

110
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,640
dude with no limbs. But there's an episode where basically the concept of the episode is that

111
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,760
the Milo doesn't realize this, but the only way he's able to get to sleep is because of the sound

112
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,800
of his parents fucking in the room next to him. Oh, I remember that. Yeah. And so the two of them

113
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,800
start fighting and Milo can't get to sleep. So someone tells him that he needs to start using

114
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,920
white noise, so he just starts turning on like every appliance in the house, like running water

115
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,120
and turning on all this other shit. And then it ends up flooding the house. And then that ends up

116
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,360
being how they tie the plots together, because once he floods the house, then the parents,

117
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,560
you know, like have to work together to save their kids. And it makes them rekindles their

118
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,120
marriage and they start fucking again. I remember that I actually kind of, I didn't really, it was

119
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
one of those messages that was like supposed to be heartfelt, but rub me the wrong way because

120
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,200
the message was like, okay, we're married, we'll stay together, not because we really like each

121
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,240
other, but because we've got our kids. All right, all right. So well, fuck that. I don't care.

122
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,200
So like with rain, interestingly enough, one time I was like in a hotel with my brother and my dad,

123
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,360
and I put on some rain. I thought, yeah, I'm all into this rain stuff now. And my dad was like,

124
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,160
I can't sleep with this because it makes me want to get up and shut a window. I can't live with

125
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,560
this rain. But if you're not getting wet and you hear the rain, it's just okay. But sounds like

126
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,200
outside rain. Yeah. And like, I remember getting a whole app from my phone that has a huge collection

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,400
of white noise things, including the sound of a dripping faucet. Like who the heck is that gonna

128
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,640
keep us sleep? There's also typing, the sounds of typing. You know, until until recently, I never

129
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,200
got into any of this white noise shit, except in college, me and my buddies did love just

130
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,640
vegging out to Bob Ross for like hours on it. We would watch him. We would literally sit there

131
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,320
and do nothing, say nothing, just watch Bob Ross paint shit. We watched like seasons after season

132
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,400
after season of this game. It was awesome. Guys, were you were you were you fucking high bro?

133
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,880
You know it my dude. Who do you mean dog? Yo, Bob, go green dog. Go man. You know what,

134
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,280
since we're never I'm never gonna find another time to do this. An anecdote about when I was

135
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,520
watching Bob Ross when he was being streamed on Twitch, and there were dozens of people who were

136
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,520
acting like he was doing it live. And I don't know if they were joking or not. The people were

137
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,760
like, oh, you should paint this differently. And then someone said paint rainbow dash please.

138
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,440
And that's always stuck in my mind is the funniest thing ever. So hilarious. Let's see. I want to

139
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,040
Bob Ross, you Bob Ross, this landscape is real nice, but we're going to need some rainbow dash in

140
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,040
there. We're just gonna need to complete this this work. So I don't know if we want to bring up

141
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,400
ASM markers, but that's like a whole separate podcast we've been planning for a while. We can

142
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:10,480
touch on it a little bit. I would say that I find it really weird and bizarre. And when I see

143
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,160
everyone says that until they actually understand. Most people don't like it. Well, that's because

144
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,600
they're idiots. Why do these people have billions of views and I don't know whatever. The some of

145
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,600
us like ASMR, some of us don't. I like putting on something to listen to. Sometimes I like having

146
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,640
someone talking when I go to sleep. But like, I don't know this. I've maybe I just haven't been

147
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,560
in the right mindset. But when I've put on the ASMR and like listen to like a guy talking real

148
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,760
close to my ear about, I don't know, whatever object he's holding or whatever it is that they do,

149
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,160
it's, it's, I don't know. It's like, okay, you know, I'm not going to do too much. I'm not going

150
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,000
to go into too much, but I just want to say that it's a whole world of stuff out there. And not

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,840
everybody even likes to hear human voices. That's why there's a whole bunch of stuff that's just

152
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,440
like tapping or like, I will it's because because Ben clear is being ignorant and he thinks that

153
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,080
ASMR is just a bad voice. You literally are ignorant. And that's okay. Yeah, I'm just

154
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,600
clarifying about it. I mean, I don't know. I'm just saying there's there's stuff for everybody

155
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,640
theoretically. I mean, maybe people don't like any of it. But I know for a fact,

156
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,840
you haven't seen all that there is. So you guys say, oh yeah, I'm going to go watch every ASMR

157
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,800
video ever made and fucking browse back to talking about yeah, whatever. To be continued. I'll kill

158
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,440
you guys. Do you actually though, listen to ASMR to get to sleep? Has it helped you? Absolutely.

159
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,480
Absolutely. Yeah, I mostly listen to music and there's like, oh, I can't do that. That like,

160
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,600
like flood by Boris. And like these days, death consciousness by have a nice life. And I always

161
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,440
end up putting on death consciousness because of the fact that I've never stayed awake through

162
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,920
the whole thing if I listen to it when going to bed. So like, I think clearly it's it's

163
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,160
Victor. It's having victory over me. Now it is an 85 minute album. So that's probably part of it.

164
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,680
I was going to talk. I was going to explain like how I get myself up. So like nowadays,

165
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,280
what I do is I have two tracks going at once. I have an ASMR video just like one or maybe two

166
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,000
that are shorter. Two tracks at once. So they get like, so they get like 30 minutes of ASMR.

167
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,520
Then I have like music going on. And then after like an hour of relaxing music,

168
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,680
it's like six hours of rain. So I like put the song on a playlist. I could take like an hour

169
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,400
and a half rain in stuff like that before. Yeah, rain from inside a car for 90 minutes,

170
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,880
which is awesome. That's a great. I love that sound. Like put down like four of those. And then

171
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,960
the tent is the best. That's a good one. That's a good. I like that sound. Now it's raining in

172
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,240
the car is my favorite to sleep. I can't get to sleep when camping because of the sea. I don't

173
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,920
I don't actually like that either. I just don't. It doesn't work as well like on YouTube because

174
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,880
like you can tell it's coming from a speaker because it's coming from one direction. Right.

175
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,800
Well, did you ever be saying that like rain is not relaxing for you? It gives you a headache?

176
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,960
What? No, literal rain, like not the sound of it. So I just imagine that that artificial rain

177
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,680
makes you think of headaches, right? This was only a recent thing. Like in the last couple years,

178
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,600
I started getting low pressure headaches where anytime there's like a strong low pressure front

179
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,720
coming through, then I'll start getting headaches. Oh, man. Sometimes when I detect a small change

180
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,280
in air pressure, I imagine that like the media has hit and like just to smash the earth's atmosphere

181
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,080
off and that like this is it. Like the earth is over. And I look out the window expecting to see

182
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,000
like a huge mushroom cloud. Oh, man, how do you wait? More and the sky torn open by like some

183
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,200
cosmic catastrophe. And I'm like, okay, I'm with you. I'm with you. But how do you detect a change

184
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,200
in pressure? Exactly. Like you can feel it in your ears. You feel that? Oh, okay. All right. In regards

185
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,080
to dreams and like destruction of the world, I remember one time like I woke up. Oh, Jesus,

186
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:02,240
into the dreams we go. All right. No, just short one. I had a dream. I had a dream that I woke up

187
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,400
and my brother was with me and I looked up into the sky because for some reason there was a giant

188
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,200
window on my ceiling and I saw that the moon had just exploded and like a whole bunch of

189
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,000
fragments of it. You realize you were playing Sonic Adventure 2 and Shadow showed up and you

190
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,760
went on a Rolla Keeg adventure through Edgeland. No, like the whole moon. The whole moon just

191
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,720
got exploded and I pulled out my camera, my phone, which is right next to me and I recorded it and

192
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,400
I'm like, oh man. Like an assassination classroom. Yeah. And then I woke up and I was like, oh my

193
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,880
gosh, I'm so glad that was just a dream. But I got it on tape. Oh wait, no. That's my favorite part.

194
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,600
But I recorded my dream. That's my favorite part when you're still 50% dreaming afterwards. Like

195
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
one time I woke up but had a dream that my dad was yelling at me. But then that turned out to be fake.

196
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,640
No more dream descriptions. This is going to start a chain reaction. Yeah, I agree. I'm already thinking

197
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,640
of one. I just want to talk about what an idiot I am. That was it. All right. On a weirdly related

198
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,200
subject about recording dreams, I watched the movie Paprika the other day, which is all about this

199
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,240
machine that like lets you see people's dreams. And it really annoyed me that like, you know,

200
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,760
in the movie you watch someone's dream and like it's an anime. But then like the people that see

201
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,640
into the dreams with this machine, they see it on their screen and what they see is the exact same

202
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,600
anime footage that you, the viewer just watched. And it really annoyed me because like a dream

203
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,120
is not a fucking, a dream does not have like camera cuts and angles and like a dream is not,

204
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,880
is not composed in the way that an anime is. I understand that. I've been editing videos too long.

205
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:41,200
It just seems a reasonable, a reasonable way to handle portraying what you seem. Is it lazy maybe?

206
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,040
Is it like all stuff like that? Anytime that someone tries to represent something that would

207
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,480
not be experienced like a show as a dream. Dreams and fiction never seem like actual dreams except

208
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,720
for the one time that a dream in fiction was portrayed like an actual dream, like the dreams

209
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,080
that I have every night was when Chuckie says to Tommy, hey Tommy, what's going on here? And

210
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:16,320
Tommy turns around and he's got a clown face and he goes, I'm not Tommy! And then later in the episode,

211
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,760
Drew has the same dream. Or no, it's Chaz. Chaz has dream. Chaz is Drew. Drew is Angelica's dad.

212
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,880
What's he doing in the kitchen? And Stu turns around and he's a clown and he's like, I'm not Stu!

213
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,280
The theme here is that there's a lot of surprise clown faces in Jesse's dreams.

214
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,080
I have a lot of surprise clown face dreams and it all goes back to that fucking Rugrats episode.

215
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,480
That in ICP is responsible. Maybe the Rugrats grew up to be ICP because of that fucking dream.

216
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,400
That was a dark carnival visiting violent day in his dreams as an infant telling him to spread

217
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,840
the gospel of the Six Jokers cards and bring forth a new era of enlightenment. I'm not Stu!

218
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,080
So hey, let's just go back to freaking uh the playlists for to go to sleep to and how I like

219
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,360
to end them with a wake-up song. It's all about you, isn't it, DeVoo? It's all about DeVoo's plan.

220
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:17,360
He's got to get his shit out of his stupid playlist. I'm not DeVoo! Jesse, your interpretation of that

221
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:26,800
episode of the Rugrats is the plot of Homestuck, by the way. What? Is that true? Making me hate it more?

222
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,880
Only a little bit. Of course. Of course. Well, I like to go for, like, getting back to wake-up songs.

223
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,040
What the fuck, just wake it? DeVoo, you just gave me whiplash. You changed subjects so quickly.

224
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:45,360
DeVoo's good at that. All right, go on, DeVoo. Go. Wake, wake, wake, wake, wake-up song. Wake me up!

225
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:55,760
Wake me up! I can't wake up! Wake me up! Save me! Save me from the nothing I've become.

226
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,960
That should be our opening song. So yeah, like, you know, like ones that are just kind of chilled

227
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,200
out and start off, you know, just kind of kind of smoothly, you know, a lot of steely dance songs

228
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,200
are like that. I was going to say, like, immediately I thought of the what's, uh, do it again, just

229
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,640
Yeah.

230
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,040
Dude, there's too much happening in those songs to, I don't know, sleep to.

231
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,400
Although I like My Old School. That's a great song for that. I like ones that do get a little bit

232
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,280
more energetic, especially toward the end. There's also, there's also what's, oh, I don't understand this at all.

233
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,080
What does that do with sleep? This is totally unrelated. To our podcast, to our lives, to our friendship.

234
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,960
What happened? You know, it's a great, you know, it's a great video game about sleeping.

235
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,920
Roar of the Beast.

236
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,720
You mean, yeah, let's talk about Yume Nikki. That is a great video about sleeping.

237
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,400
Yume Nikki is this, is this RPG maker game. It's 2D Spray Graphic. It's about this girl,

238
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,120
this, this Hikikomori, this Japanese girl who won't leave a room under any circumstances and

239
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,640
all she does, all you can do as her is you go to your bed and go to sleep and like record

240
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,160
things in your dream diary. That's what the title means. Yume Nikki means dream diary.

241
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,520
What? Who's trying to interrupt me?

242
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,000
Sorry, I just got cut out for like 20 seconds there.

243
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,240
Oh, okay. Well, you're missing some gold here. Anyway, you go to sleep as this girl and you

244
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,520
wander around these crazy dream scapes and you find all these objects and these like

245
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,240
abilities and you can do stuff and you find a knife and you can stab things.

246
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,920
I remember that. That's right, because you know, actually won the competition the first time and

247
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,520
went back in time to make Yuki win the competition. I remember that.

248
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,040
That's Mirai Nikki and Yume Nikki is way better.

249
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,640
You know, you know, I really love Yume Nikki. I love the way that everything is super fucked up

250
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
and it's not at all like, like you were saying before, like the portrayal of like

251
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,480
dreams is just like a flat anime. That's really boring and I don't give a shit,

252
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,360
but Yume Nikki is like this big crazy world where shit, you don't know what the fuck is

253
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
going to happen and you can like interact with things in weird ways and you like collect items

254
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,640
and fuck with things. It's just, it's really out there and it's the best. Everyone's watching

255
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,760
this has probably already seen or played Yume Nikki. If you haven't do it, yeah, I would hope

256
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,240
so. It's one of those, it's one of those few like RPG maker games that has kind of reached

257
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,800
not mainstream success, but is like known by audience. It's definitely a cult, a very cult.

258
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,840
Yeah, yeah. I guess so. I mean the places I hang out, everybody knows about it. It's up there with

259
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,800
off and space funeral. I think it's not quite up to snuff with my RPG maker game, the classic

260
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,960
which is unreleased, which is one screen of me walking up to a tree and going, fuck that tree.

261
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,200
Alright, slow down. Please, please. Another great RPG maker game, Master of the Wind, if

262
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,520
anyone wants to play Master of the Wind. Why the fuck are we talking about video games? This is

263
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,960
a sleep cut game. Yume Nikki is a game about sleeping and it's fucking cool. The only real

264
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,280
point I wanted to make here has been ruined. No one's going to take it seriously anymore because

265
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,120
it's like, I was about to finish it and then I got cut out of the freaking chat.

266
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,320
Well, give it a try. Okay, so wake up songs. Here's the thing. Ever since I started using those,

267
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:08,000
waking up has been finally a good experience for the first time in my life because what I realized

268
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,720
is that no matter what you set to your phone to wake you up, it's coming out of your phone. It's

269
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,680
unpleasant. It has to be like all the way up on the volume in order to register and it sucks. But

270
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,200
you get a nice wake-up song and it's like, man, waking up. I can wake up inside, finally.

271
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,200
They really called my name and saved me from the dark. It was awesome.

272
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,720
Hot dog. I don't typically wake up to anything. I don't set alarms for myself. I just kind of

273
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,480
wake up when I do. I'm curious for you guys because I know everybody's a different kind of

274
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:52,880
quote unquote morning person or non-morning person. For me personally, I have, I struggle to actually

275
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,000
wake up, like I'll lay there and just be like in and out of awakeness until I finally make up my

276
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,440
mind and I'm like, okay, I'm getting out of bed. But then once I'm out of bed, it's just like zero

277
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,160
to a hundred. There's no like groggy, I need coffee. I have an extremely groggy morning

278
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,160
thing. I'm not a morning person at all. I can't say for sure, like recently whether or not I'm

279
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,560
a morning person because I'm not used to like having to be up anyway. So whenever I wake up,

280
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,760
even if it's the morning, I've probably slept enough because I just wake up naturally. Yeah,

281
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,280
same here. But back when I did have to fucking get up for stuff years ago, I remember that like my

282
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,480
girlfriend would try to get me out of bed. And according to her, because I have very blurry

283
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:41,200
recollection of these moments, I would turn into a fucking savage animal, the likes of which humanity

284
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,440
was not prepared for. And I would just turn into like Wolverine Berserker rage. The things that I

285
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:55,360
would do in my mind to just putting holes in her face, knocking her teeth out, slapping her around

286
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,160
a bit, slapping her tits around, throwing the bed upside down, throwing the bed on her, trapping

287
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,640
her under it, setting the house on fire. The willingness as I run into the night in my tidy

288
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,520
whitey. Yeah, the sheer ferocity with which my sleeping, my sleepy self attempts to defend not

289
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:23,040
getting up is covered in scat. That's that's how Victor is when I try to wake him up. Victor gets

290
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,520
really violent and angry with me if I wake him up for anything. I'm the same. Unless it's lunch,

291
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,000
in which case I can coax him into like, because this is when I walk into Victor's room in the

292
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,720
morning, he's usually like just in the process of waking up. And he looks at me with this scowl,

293
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,280
and he goes, what? And I'm like, I'm like, want to go to lunch. And he sits there and like processes

294
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,560
it for a bit, like trying to figure out if he has money. Well, I can sympathize with that because

295
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,720
from the way you describe your life and from some of the videos I've seen on your after dark channel,

296
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,120
it seems like your life is just you walking into your sibling's rooms randomly. Yeah, that's

297
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,160
pretty fucking their girlfriends. Like it seems like if you're not editing videos, all you do is

298
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,560
wander around your house in a fucking Applejack shirt and pajama pants cut off at the knee and go

299
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:21,280
someone take me to fucking take me to cook out. I can promise you Victor's listening to this right

300
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,080
now clapping his hands and standing up like giving you a standing ovation for the exact

301
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,960
miss of that. You know, it's been a bit like that historically when I've had to wake him up for

302
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,000
things. Oh, you know you have been you know you have you've been a kill you Nate. I mean,

303
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,160
it's just because your sleep schedule you always go to bed later than later than everybody else

304
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,520
when we were you know, picturing like this slimy amorphous, like fucking,

305
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:53,520
like, I was gonna say like Aldrich rising in the coffin, amorphous fat like losing

306
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,880
under Victor's door. You can't close the door. You can't keep him out. He's coming under the cracks.

307
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:06,640
This is exactly how Victor imagines Victor Victor is the Gwendolyn to Digi's Aldrich just

308
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,760
fucking seeping into the orifices, possessing him and using him for his pleasure. There's a reason

309
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,960
that whatever Victor does like an impression of me. It's always like

310
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,960
you know, my brother, I think is more of a morning person than me. But what's cool about

311
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,880
waking him up is that he lives in the basement, right? It's very dark.

312
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,600
Wake me up. Wake me up inside. Wake me up. Wake me up. I want to hear what I want my brother's

313
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,080
story to do. I don't care. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Every time I hear those words, I have to. Okay,

314
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,200
go on. Go on. So he's in the basement on the far end. And like, like if you go down to the steps,

315
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,600
he's on the other end of the basement, right? Don't go in the basement, man. Arl Stein, he told

316
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,720
you. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Yeah, the base under the directly under the light. And he

317
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,760
he lays on his back. And so he's just it's so dramatic because the basement's so dark with

318
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,560
the light descending upon him. And it just makes me want to like slowly walk up to him and like

319
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,440
grab a key or something. It's like, it's just so epic. Like one time I woke, I tried to get him up.

320
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,200
And I didn't even want to wake him up because he was so glorious, just like, like just laying

321
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
there with a very, very stoic face. I brought my whole family down like, Hey, guys, look at

322
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,680
I invited the neighbors over to check this shit out. It was awesome. We got the community involved.

323
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,720
Isn't that the plot of Totoro? Didn't she get us like, find him sleeping there in this meadow

324
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,360
and like go get her friends to go check out Totoro? Look at this majestic animal.

325
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,680
Fuck. Hey, let me tell you guys, here's something that I can't decide how I feel about

326
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,560
people who can just fall asleep by accident. I don't think I don't think I've yeah, like, like

327
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,880
just fall asleep watching a movie. I have, I don't think I've ever in my life fallen asleep

328
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,960
without meaning to. I've never like sat down and like fallen asleep in the middle of a movie.

329
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,520
You never like decide like, I'll try to watch a movie and then you just like

330
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,440
never. Never. I've only done that all the time. And I would make me jealous sometimes. We would

331
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,440
be up watching adult swim as youngins and you would like pass out. And I'd be like, Nate,

332
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,440
you're missing the anime. I remember that. I remember. I hated doing, I wanted to watch those

333
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,600
goddamn animes. I was robbed. I would have to be like exceedingly exhausted to pass out during a

334
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,560
show or like with adult swim, though, I would always pass out during the one show I didn't

335
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,320
really care about. And that's the one, like I couldn't make it to my favorite shows because

336
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,720
I'd pass out during the one that like I that was boring, like fucking pilot candy. You know,

337
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,720
I've always been a really heavy sleeper and it's always been pretty easy for me to fall asleep.

338
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,560
But yeah, I don't know. I'd fall asleep during anything when I got fucking late.

339
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:02,880
Fucking shade. I mean, shade. I once saw shade fall asleep on the top stair of the stairs.

340
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,560
He was like going up on his way down. He's like five or six years old. No, on the top. Like he

341
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,600
he walked up to the top of the stairs and then just passed out on the top of the stairs.

342
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,000
I could. I might have done. He also cannot stay awake in a car. Like if you're in the car for

343
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,080
more than five minutes, he will absolutely pass out to this day. 18 years old and still

344
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,800
passes out from like when you guys have that thing. Falling asleep is difficult for me. It

345
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,800
requires it requires focus and effort. It's weird. It's tough for me to do. Speaking of sleeping

346
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,200
in a car because it's like if I'm in like a long car ride and I'm getting really tired, but I can't

347
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,800
quite get comfortable enough to fall asleep. I have these times where I like go into sleep for

348
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,520
like five seconds and I realized there was this lapse of audio and I'm like, whoa, it's like

349
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:56,640
that's cool. In fact, there's only one time where I actually fell asleep at a very specific moment

350
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,680
that I could remember and it was like instant. Like I went to some sort of camp thing for like a

351
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:08,560
whole day and I don't remember being ultra tired, but I literally just lay down face first on my

352
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,520
own bed with my mom right behind me with all my clothes on. And then my mom started taking off

353
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,440
my pants and then I fell asleep halfway through getting my pants. I wasn't listening to any of

354
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,920
that, but now I'm listening to all of it. Very incredible. Yeah. So like I'm like, I'm probably

355
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,120
like six or seven years old. You know, I was going to say one of the best ways to stop yourself from

356
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,280
falling asleep is to get a boner and boner achieved to continue with this mom taking off your pants

357
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,600
story. Yeah, I fell asleep halfway through getting my pants taken off, you know, and like my mom was

358
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,880
like, I didn't even like quite think about it until my mom was like, you fell asleep like

359
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,200
immediately. I'm like, oh my gosh. Yeah. I literally remember the feeling of my pants getting taken

360
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,960
off and then it cuts to black. And I'll bet the judge went easy on it because she was a woman.

361
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,280
Shameful. Fucking classic double standard. There's only one way I can regularly remember

362
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,000
exactly like or approximately when I fall asleep. And it's a great way for me to figure out how long

363
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,480
it took me to fall asleep. Flood by Boris as Digi mentioned before, which he got me into. It's

364
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,280
this one hour thing, this one like this one song that's also an album and it's just over an hour

365
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:28,400
long and it's awesome for sleep. Uh, is it wake me up? Wake me up. Come on. I guarantee they're loving

366
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,240
this. Yeah. So I am. And so like it has all these different sections. And so what happens is it,

367
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,080
you know, it varies at which section I fall asleep. And so all I mean, all I have to do is just

368
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,680
remember which segment I last heard, you know, and then I'm like, oh, that's exactly how long it

369
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,480
took me to fall asleep. That's really cool. Although I can't, you know, I want to bring up Flood again.

370
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,960
Like what happened to me? The other tool for Mario Sunshine. I, yeah. No, you, Eddie, Eddie is

371
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,480
talking about the album from They Might Be Giants. Stay with it. Oh, shit. I don't know. God.

372
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,360
All right. So like, uh, but like, yeah, like albums like Flood that did you got me into, like, I

373
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,880
think that really helped me get more into music for sleep. Wait, is that really what you were

374
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,840
talking about? Because I was just making a joke. It's a different Flood. It's a Flood by the band

375
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,880
Boris. You know that if you listen to any fucking time that we've been Boris, that Hawaiian shirt,

376
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,080
that Hawaiian shirt wearing fuck from GoldenEye, I told you, I hate that guy. Yeah, man. What

377
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,400
where does he get off ripping off album titles from a, from an American institution like They

378
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,280
Might Be Giants? Yeah, good question. But like there was this other album that did you got me into

379
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,200
called Ocean Songs by Dirty Three. And I listened to that one for sleeping a lot too. But then what

380
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,880
happened at some point is that suddenly I developed this aversion to any music that makes me emotional

381
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:51,120
and I can't do it. I can't handle it anymore. Like when I play Flood or Ocean Songs, I just get too

382
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,880
like afraid of the world. So now like the reason I like those albums for sleep is because I find

383
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,240
them completely unemotional. Like any song that's going to make me feel anything is going to be an

384
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,800
obstacle to fall into sleep. I would assume what they have like, okay, what they have though is

385
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,360
this sort of, they have this really like, really full emotion. It's like if emotions are colors

386
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,840
and you combine them all to make white, that's what Flood is like, you know, it just feels like

387
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,960
all the emotions. And it's just too much for me. That if you like, if you listen to it loud, then

388
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,600
yes, that's what I would say I feel. But if you listen to it like at one, which is how I listen

389
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,960
to music, you know, like the minimum volume, then I mean for bed, then I don't think it really conveys

390
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,000
all that much. I guess. But yes, now all I can listen to is like stuff that just feels like

391
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,600
elevator lobby music type stuff. That kind of thing is just like, that's truly unemotional.

392
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,760
And that makes you feel, all right, that's all I have to say about that.

393
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,880
I want to move into what I wanted to talk about this podcast. I decided I'd save this

394
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,280
for later, because I want to talk about it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're going to save it?

395
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,920
God damn it!

396
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,720
I think he thinks he's funny. He's laughing. He's laughing as though he's funny.

397
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,360
I'm laughing. He's pretty funny. Come on, guys. That's a good joke.

398
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,160
It's a really good joke, guys. I want to talk about getting rid of sleep.

399
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:26,240
Yeah. Sleep needs to stop. Sleep. No, not even transhumanism, because, all right, first of all,

400
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,480
I'm going to tell some stories and anecdotes and some weird science facts, all right?

401
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,680
First of all, weird science fact. Nobody knows why we sleep. The only scientific reason that's

402
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,840
been discovered is because we get tired. Well, there's one very good reason. You've got to eat

403
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,360
big and you've got to sleep big if you want to get big. That's important for that. I mean,

404
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:54,720
if you don't sleep, you die. Right. Well, we know that getting too tired will make you die.

405
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,800
But we don't know how sleep fixes that. It's the weight of all your sins, weighing down your

406
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,480
eyelids. Yeah, you need Jesus to take the wheel every once in a while, so you've got to sleep,

407
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,080
so that can happen. I think it's basically just a stress reliever. It's like we take

408
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,320
in too much information. We can't handle it anymore and we need to just fucking lay down.

409
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,360
But nobody really knows why. I think when I was growing up, I had this impression that sleep was

410
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,240
like a healing process. It's kind of like in RPGs, right? I still think of it that way. You lose

411
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,960
all your health and then you go sleep and your health is restored. But it doesn't, it's not.

412
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,480
It doesn't do anything. It's just you not thinking for eight hours. It's got to be really useful,

413
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,560
though. I mean, from an evolutionary standpoint, having to sleep is a huge

414
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,720
weakness to predators. So it's got to be useful or something. Well, here's the thing. We've also

415
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:46,320
figured out there already are. They have already, like for years now, had pills that will make you

416
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,480
not sleep. Oh, bullshit. I don't believe this. They have had them. That was, they exist. Okay,

417
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,120
there's got to be an asterisk on that. And there's also, there are people out there who just don't

418
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,800
sleep. Yeah, if you take enough boner pills, you won't sleep as a side effect, but that's not the

419
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,640
main purpose of the drug. No, the main purpose is to make your winner 10 feet long to let you

420
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,520
get fucking elephant in the face all the way up fucking drunk. I'm going to tell you about the most

421
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,360
jealous I've ever been of any story I've ever read. It was a Roger Ebert article where he was

422
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,120
talking about how he met, he was like hanging out at like some like party or something in like

423
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,800
Italy or some shit. And he meets this guy and this guy is like showing him around his place.

424
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,360
And he's got like just this insane amount of projects he's done. He has like all these old

425
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,560
cars he built and shit and like all this other like artwork he'd made and stuff. And Ebert was

426
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,600
like, how the fuck do you have time for all this? And the guy said, well, I don't sleep. And he was

427
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,760
like, I didn't believe him. But then he didn't seem to be lying. And there was no reason not to believe

428
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,880
him. And everyone around him corroborated it. The guy just didn't sleep. And he got so much stuff

429
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,080
done by way he was just a fucking anomaly. I mean, it doesn't seem that weird, right? Like,

430
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,240
I believe that there's a human out there who's like, why we sleep, then how hard would it be

431
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,040
to believe that some biological anomaly of a person just doesn't do it? It's possible. It's

432
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,440
possible. There's a thing called the sleep diet that a lot of people do. And they say that it's

433
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,520
what Leonardo da Vinci and a bunch of weird people they were. And you don't take like an extended

434
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,320
sleep, but like you sleep in like six 20 minute naps. Yeah, there's a lot of there's the uberman

435
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,600
sleep schedule. The uberman is where you it's yeah, it's six 20 minute naps. There's you it takes

436
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,960
about 10 days to train yourself onto it. And it's gruelingly hard. I tried it. And I couldn't do

437
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,080
it. Look, I've been trying to fight sleep for years. I hate sleep. I want it gone. Biggest

438
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,280
problem in the universe. Every random idea that some internet fucking blogger has for how to sleep

439
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:53,040
less. I've tried it. And the problem is that there's nothing in my life that I can do to can

440
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,920
like to force myself to not sleep. Because like I have too much time to get everything done. So

441
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,160
like if I get tired, I'm just like fucking I'm just going to sleep. Like there's not like there's

442
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,120
nothing to I can say, oh, I'm going to get so productive. The only way to defeat sleep is to

443
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,360
just always be having the most fun you've ever had in your life. Because if I'm like really

444
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,720
having fun, I will not sleep for fucking ever. But the second I get bored, or even like a little

445
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,560
bit frustrated. I basically I sleep for an eternity. That's almost every like like you said earlier,

446
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,560
where it's like you only sleep when you feel defeated. Like that's yeah, that's my like,

447
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,200
I sleep. That's why it's so hard for me to reset my sleep schedule, because it'll happen naturally

448
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,200
if I find something to do all night. If I'm like, I'm going to make a list of my top 100 favorite

449
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,200
fucking asses in in Pokemon, then like is number one is number one. The Pokemon white

450
00:40:49,200 --> 00:41:10,400
female trainer. He's got some thick ass thighs. But I if I get onto that, I can do that all night.

451
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,920
And like, it won't be until I can do the voodoo voice all night. Yeah, no, I can I can sit there

452
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,960
I can sit there and crack open a comic book and read all the character's voices in Guja voice

453
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,280
all night long. And and then I won't stop until I'm done. And then you won't stop out until you

454
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:47,440
are Guja. And that's when you start secreting underneath Victor's door. Oh, no, Conrad's

455
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:56,160
Guja again. He wants to hang out with me. What a fuck. I really hope that Guja becomes a meme,

456
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,960
Jesse. I've been doing that fucking voice all the time. It seems like everything that any of us

457
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,720
have said in the last 10 podcasts has become a meme. Yeah, we're kind of on a roll with the

458
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,960
self perpetuating memes. That's the best. We're a mean machine. We've always wanted to be.

459
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,560
Let me take the time to fucking complain and and bitch at all of our fans because they can't

460
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,560
read my mind sufficiently. And they're not they're not cool enough to understand what I say without

461
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,040
me explaining it or just or telling them honestly and forthrightly. I asked people to give me quotes.

462
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,920
Oh, yeah. Everyone gave me everyone gave me quotes that weren't the exact kind I was looking for.

463
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,720
Yes, I went on Twitter the other day and I was like, everyone tell me fucking memorable quotes

464
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,000
from all of the people. And like one, I only got quotes from like half of the PCP members. And

465
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,400
two, most of them were terrible because I had a specific thing in mind. Specifically, I was trying

466
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,680
to make an alignment chart and like chart everyone being chaotic evil. But you didn't tell anybody

467
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,280
that part. You just didn't tell anyone that. I thought it was obvious. I mean, what else would

468
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,880
I be looking for quotes for? What other possible reason could I have? I thought you were going to

469
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,120
make some kind of compilation. And then I was like, what the fuck is how can he possibly be

470
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:19,040
willing to go through all the episodes to find all these? Everyone was like, remember when when

471
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:25,760
Davoo is goo? And I'm like, you fucking idiot. That quote does not speak to any kind of moral

472
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,760
attitude whatsoever. I think Davoo Collective can be put on an alignment chart pretty easily.

473
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,280
He's got to be somewhere in the neutral. Yeah, something like that.

474
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,320
It didn't fit my artistic vision. I don't know. Are the Borg really neutral?

475
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,000
You know what? I want to actually go on a rant about alignments because I was thinking about this

476
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,680
last night. Okay. I was laying in bed and I was thinking about how nobody understands any superhero

477
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,840
but me. I'm the only one who gets these characters and everyone else should just not be allowed to

478
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:05,760
enjoy them. Okay. And I was thinking about how everybody always puts like Superman as lawful good

479
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,760
and Batman as chaotic good when really it should be reversed. Now Batman's like lawful. Batman is

480
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,360
lawful good because Batman has a code. Superman doesn't need a code. He's just a nice guy. They've

481
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,240
all got it backwards. Everybody, nobody understands. Superman is neutral good. Superman is neutral

482
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:30,400
good probably. Here's the thing. The alignments are way too simple and like I hate it when people

483
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,320
think that like you can actually box like a well-realized character into them. Like they're

484
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:42,240
meant as a simplification. Man, this sure is a great podcast about sleep. Get out of here.

485
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,840
So my favorite episode of American dad is the one where he gets the pills that make it so he

486
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,480
doesn't sleep anymore. Yeah. And he just becomes like his life becomes awesome and then his wife

487
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,160
starts doing all this shit and then the one guy at the end he smokes the cigarette and he goes

488
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,600
life. It's really funny. You know, that's not a real thing though. That was a work of fiction.

489
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:11,280
That was a science thing. I have read things that have said that there are actually anti-sleep

490
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,640
pills are not on the market yet, but they are. I have often heard that Vince McMahon is one of

491
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,000
these individuals that does not sleep. I've heard and it's been corroborated by numerous sources

492
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,240
that Vince McMahon sleeps like at most one hour a night for like the last 40 years and he's 70

493
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,200
years old and he's gonna live forever. He's doing fine. Yeah. And he's still chacked. And he's got,

494
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:40,480
well, okay, but he definitely did Roy's. I do enjoy the act of sleeping. Roy's come from Vince

495
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,480
McMahon. We just shaved them off of his skin. You know how the curse mark in Naruto came from

496
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,760
that one guy who was the origin of all the curse marks? He's that for Roy. Vince McMahon takes off

497
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,320
his skin mask and it's just a big giant steroid pill underneath. It was me, Austin. It was me,

498
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:06,000
Gudra. I was Gudra all along. I do like the act of sleeping, but not that much. I don't like

499
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,080
having to sleep that much. So like, I would like two to three hours every second to third day.

500
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,080
That would be perfect. Hey, you know what? You know what? I want to break this on a totally

501
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:22,880
different area of sleep. I hate sleeping with another human being in the bed. Typically a woman.

502
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,000
I find it disgusting. I can't sleep at all. It is in fear every time that I've done it,

503
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
which has been a lot. Let's keep it on level. We talked about this on Digibro. It's horrendous.

504
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,560
I was saying that I'm envious of the fact that Victor and his girlfriend will hang out late into

505
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,000
the night and then Victor would just go home to go to bed. That's what it's all about. There is

506
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,600
nothing wrong with, I just hate sleeping with other people. If they touch me, it's weird. I don't

507
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,800
like it. When you're married, it's an art form of figuring out how to never come in contact while

508
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,400
you're actually trying to sleep. 90% of the relationship is figuring out how you're actually

509
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,080
going to sleep in a bed with this person. It's horrible. People make fun of the Brady Bunch because

510
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,000
the parents had separate beds. I think they had to figure it out. They push those beds together

511
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,360
on the reg, my nigga. You know they do it, but then they go to sleep separately. Here's the

512
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:17,280
thing. I definitely, when I get married, want to have separate bedrooms because it's like,

513
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,120
when you think about it, the whole tradition is a social construct of having to share the same bed.

514
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,680
Social construct because they like this way. The Chinese don't do that shit. Back in the 1800s

515
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,200
or whenever, you know, didn't have any room. It was like one room for both the parents and then

516
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,720
another room for all seven of the kids. Then as houses got bigger, every single kid is going

517
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:45,040
to campaign for as much space as possible, but no married couples are going to want to be in

518
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,640
separate rooms because they'll look like they don't have as good of a bond as their friends do.

519
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,720
Yeah, I hear you on that too. It creates this artificial scarcity of rooms.

520
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,160
Expectation or something going on. You're really into that artificial scarcity phrase.

521
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,200
It's good phrase. It is a good phrase. I just can't get to sleep without jacking off at least once.

522
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,640
That doesn't help me at all. I'm just back where I started after I jacked off.

523
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,560
Well, it doesn't help me to get to sleep. It's more like I can't not jack off while on the

524
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:25,840
bed. And so even if I have firsthand experience that it doesn't matter if I have sex immediately

525
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:33,680
before bed, I will jack off 20 minutes later and trying to explain that to your girlfriend who's

526
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,320
sleeping next to you on the same bed. Why you're half of the, now mind you, I'm really good at

527
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:44,160
jacking off quietly and without moving too much. I know how to do it without having to shake the

528
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,880
bed and wake her up. You know, I'm pretty sure she was not even aware of half the times I was

529
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,720
jacking off sometimes in broad daylight right next to her. But you know, there's sometimes right

530
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,320
behind her face as she was cooking. Sometimes in the supermarket. How am I going to get behind

531
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,120
her face while she's cooking? You mean just like behind her? You gotta stand on a footsteller.

532
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,480
I mean, she said she was a giant anyway. But anyway, yeah, it's like,

533
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,120
like she would go to sleep and I'd be like, I can't, like I don't want to wake her up,

534
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,840
but I'm not, I can't get to sleep. And then like for me, I have this, like if I lay in bed for

535
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,720
like 40 minutes and it's not working, I get up and go do other stuff, you know. So I'd be like

536
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,360
laying in bed, like fucking awkwardly trying to be quiet. And of course she's not listening to music

537
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,440
or anything. She just fucking passed out. So I'm sitting there in silence, like, oh, fuck,

538
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,560
this is so weird. And then I get up, get on my computer, like a laptop, you know, watch anime

539
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,440
and shit, then jack off again, because I laid down again. So now I have to do that whole process

540
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,120
again stand over her and jack off on her and let you know, that's, you know, that's her responsibility

541
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:57,520
to accept that burden. Right. But yeah, it's just, you've got to jack off. She needs that

542
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,800
pitter-patter of raindrops to fall asleep. So you've got to jack off over her.

543
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,800
Actually, I do wonder if having a bunch of sound going on would fix a lot of that, because I feel

544
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,560
like if I had like, if I had to sleep with someone, I might just like, I might just like super

545
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,160
multi-layer it, like put on like the sound of rain, the sound of fire, like two ASMR videos,

546
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,440
a whole bunch of stuff, just to the point of-

547
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,720
One thing that relaxes me to sleep, like the sound of my boyfriend jacking it is like the

548
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,520
rhythmic thrumming of a mother's heartbeat in the womb.

549
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,520
That one's close. Hey, but you know, you know, I can't relate to needing to jack off before I go

550
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:37,440
to sleep, but I can relate in that I feel extreme anger at myself if I haven't jacked off during

551
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,440
the day when I go to sleep. It's like, I wasted my day. What was I doing this whole day if I

552
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,320
didn't jack off? So it's a wash, you know? Yeah. Nothing, nothing fills me with regret like that.

553
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,840
I actually, I surprisingly know what you mean, because like, I'll be going to bed and jacked

554
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,280
off. I lost, I lost a little bit of joy out of my life. Well, it's just because there's,

555
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:02,160
I feel like there's so much porn in the world that every day I don't jack off, it's like,

556
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,600
I've pushed back that like the tide has gotten away from me more. That's true. Like, you know,

557
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,640
like if I, if I jack off three times in the same day, and then it gets to a point where like,

558
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,040
I've seen everything on the couple, like everything new on the few sites I use, and I'm like, wow,

559
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:23,440
I'm like ahead of the curve for Jack. Like, I feel like this, to this current week of porn,

560
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,080
I've seen all of it, and I can check that off as like, in the historical context of porn,

561
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,680
there's a whole week where I know everything that came out that week. It's, it's such an

562
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,200
interesting, you know, it's such a telling insight into you, did you, that you think about porn in

563
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,600
the same way you think about like anime or like any of the media you're trying to consume. It's

564
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:45,920
just another art form to be consumed. Yeah. You're a beast. I have strong, I have strong regrets

565
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,600
that I can't do like porn analysis where I stand to date.

566
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,040
That you can't do porn analysis. You know, Cece's been talking about maybe doing some of that shit.

567
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,080
We need the, we need the, the pornographers do that.

568
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,080
Well, the problem with doing porn analysis is that it's all going to be the same. It's always

569
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,280
going to be like, and this, this picture is attractive because the line art curves in this

570
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,480
way. And that's what makes it odd, you know. Well, I mean, if you're, no, that's, that's dumb,

571
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,520
because I mean, if you look at just, just the one example is that, that Bane porn that, that

572
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:19,040
fucking like Pornhub did, that was like, I don't know. You don't know what I'm talking about?

573
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,000
God, it was this, it was this, like clearly the TV board on 4chan was responsible for making this

574
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,320
happen. It was like, there was just some porn where like this guy brings a chick home to his house.

575
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,120
His whole family is Bane, like his mom and dad.

576
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,160
How have they told you about this before? Wait, is the guy Bane too?

577
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,240
Yeah, they're all Bane. Everyone's Bane. Mom's Bane, dad's Bane, the kid's Bane.

578
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,880
Wait, is the girl Bane? The girl's Bane too. She puts on the mask and she becomes Bane.

579
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,320
Every line, every, every line of the script, like was a meme, was a TV meme. It was,

580
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,120
it was insane. And like, that's fucking fascinating. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen in my

581
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:02,480
life. So, uh, you know, go Google that. I don't, I don't know. Why is nobody doing episodic, uh,

582
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,840
vlogging of the sex factor? That's a great question. That's a really great question.

583
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,680
Literally all of my friends are watching it at this point. Yeah, that's, you know,

584
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:19,360
it's the new X-Hamster original series, which is literally a reality show about porn. It's,

585
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,440
it's like America's next top model, but for porn stars. Oh my, yeah. Do you have to make,

586
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,960
do you have to make porn? Yeah, they're all like upcoming, they're all like new people who are

587
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,040
trying to become porn stars. And there's like the male team and the women's team. And they're

588
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,120
trying to like, what's like the, what's like the challenge they have every week? It'll be like,

589
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:43,440
who can give the best advice or something. Yeah. No, they're trying to be actors. There's one,

590
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:49,120
in episode two, there was a part where they, it was just like a minor competition for the guy's

591
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:55,520
side where they all had to stand around this bathtub and they all had their dicks out. And

592
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:01,760
there's two women in the bathtub making out and whoever got an erection fastest would, uh, then

593
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,760
they would make his dick into a mold, like for a dildo. And it might do to a hero d protagonist

594
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:14,160
one, that shit. Clearly a one piece fan. Um, oh yeah, you're right. Hero d protagonist. I looked

595
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,680
into it. I looked into it. The d stands for danger. He's not actually one piece. You know,

596
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,840
you know, that's kind of thought in the way that it dehumanizes them. Oh yeah, it's great.

597
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,880
Something about dehumanization is very, is very attractive to me. I don't want to think about

598
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:36,080
the humans really like low budget, badly edited, uh, like reality show, but it feels just like

599
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,920
any other reality show aside from the fact that it's particularly badly edited. But, uh, like,

600
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,680
yeah, it's, uh, it is what it is. And we played a drinking game with it, me and my friends, just

601
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,640
like, uh, every time, like certain, like every time they show the logo or like show certain

602
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,920
characters, you have to drink or, uh, whatever. But yeah, it's, uh, by the way, Blair Williams,

603
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,280
Blair Williams is going the distance. Blair's going to win it. I'm calling her right now.

604
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,440
She's the champion. She's got the hunger. She's got the fire. She's got what it takes to win

605
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:12,480
this competition. So Blair sleep. Um, yeah, right. How many hours a day do you think Blair Williams

606
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:19,600
sleeps? Uh, man, I, uh, in eternity after each one of these sessions, she needs to recharge

607
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,080
because she brings such intensity to the competition. It's going to take months to recover. Yep.

608
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:30,240
Yep. I think we've all officially got our brains on porn now. Nobody's thinking about sleep anymore.

609
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,000
That's true. So I don't know. Should we wrap this up? Anybody got any more thoughts on sleep?

610
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,280
Let's want it to go away. They don't have sleep in Star Trek. I'm, uh, what? Of course they do.

611
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,880
No, they don't. They have those like, they have those pod things where they just like sit in it

612
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,600
and it'll like give them however much sleep they want. And then they have those in, um,

613
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,560
it's not true. They have those in, um, that, what's that anime with the, the Star Kingdom

614
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,880
and the Empire? Uh, Legend of the Galactic Heroes. They do have it in there. Yeah, don't they? Yeah.

615
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,600
Yeah. Good. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? I've never, I've watched The Tone of Star. I've

616
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,000
never seen these fucking pods. Everyone has quarters that they sleep in. Yeah, but they can also use

617
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,720
uh, the, the strings. Isn't there like a rest? I have never seen this shit. I remember there was

618
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,640
a part where like, like in between battles, right? Yeah, like when they're about to do something

619
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,800
that's going to take a long time, they'll like go into the pod and just like get the quick rest

620
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,560
or whatever. I'm pretty sure. Yeah, like they don't, they don't use them all the time. Yeah. But

621
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:32,480
they have them on, on the ships that crew members can jump into. What the fuck? Why did I not see

622
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:38,640
this shit? Star Trek about that. No, that's just some, that's a good thing. Uh, well, I'll have to

623
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,360
look into it, I guess. Here's the upside. I mean, I hate, I hate sleep. I wish I could stay awake

624
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,560
and work all the time. However, me too. I made a graph the other day about my motivation to work

625
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,200
and how it's, when I wake up, it's usually, it's like dirt at the bottom, but then like as the,

626
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,000
but the day gets closer and closer to being done, it like ramps up because I become desperate. I'm

627
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,280
like, oh my God, I haven't done anything today. That's fair. Uh, and so I guess, I do schedule

628
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,560
my whole day around, like I do like structure how I'm going to start the day very specifically,

629
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,920
like oftentimes if I'm working on a video, uh, I'll have my bed scooted right up next to my desk

630
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,400
and my, I don't have like a bed frame, so it goes underneath my desk nicely. Wake up, um,

631
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:25,040
I, I wake up and then I was just waiting for an interruption there. Um, and feel just fine

632
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:32,800
your face. Oh, and so then the first thing I do is like I make one edit, like, like the first thing

633
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:40,320
I do is I'll like, you know, there, I just did one edit, you know, and that way when I go to the

634
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:46,640
bathroom and get breakfast or talk to people, I am taking a break from editing rather than waiting

635
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,560
for the moment at which I start working on editing. So I do a lot of work. In fact, actually,

636
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:56,080
what I did yesterday or this morning was I was trying to finish this anime and so I put the next

637
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:02,880
episode of it as, um, my wake up song because it was Gonkotsuo, the Count of Monte Cristo in OP for

638
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,480
that is a really nice song to wake up to. I can't imagine waking up and immediately trying to process

639
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,880
it. Subtitle. Well, you were watching dubbed, but you're really onto something there though with

640
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,440
like the doing a little bit of work right away. I mean, like more artists than I can even count

641
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,000
say that like, you know, you just got to do like a war like when you wake up, you got to do like a

642
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,640
warm up sketch to get in the fucking zone. You got to like bang out like one or two real quick ones.

643
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,560
So you're in like a drawing mindset and like I'm sure that applies to others. You know, I've been

644
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:35,680
doing that a little bit too, Davoo, but you've reinvigorated my desire to do that to sort of

645
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,160
force yourself into it. Good advice. I just kind of wake up and immediately watch like all the YouTube

646
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:46,000
videos. That's like the first thing I do. I mean, I'm, I've been in the habit of like getting up

647
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,720
and then I go on Twitter and I checked to Pastic for any messages and I check my email and I

648
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,840
look at my Tumblr and I just, and like sometimes it really fucks me up because like before I'd know

649
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:01,600
it like six hours of gunfire. Yeah, fucking around on social media. Definitely always like the first

650
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:08,320
hour or two after I wake up are usually like just reading and responding to comments and like

651
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,120
watching every YouTube video that's come out. And sometimes if a lot of long ones have come out

652
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,400
and I just don't think about it, I will end up sitting there for like hours. And the only upside

653
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:26,240
to that kind of is that I won't eat like I won't think to eat for that time. So like I'm convinced

654
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,440
that the only way that I keep my weight in check is that I sleep so much and I forget to eat any

655
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,320
time I get into something like, you know, sleep for eight hours, wake up, sit on the internet for

656
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,880
two hours and then realize you're hungry and like, I don't know, seems like a good weight loss.

657
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,120
Whoa, hey, Ben's, I just happened to open Twitter because Ben suggested, I just saw that

658
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:50,320
Idol Yo-Kai did the draw cast, the first Pokemon draw cast, you just drew all the Pokemon.

659
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:57,200
Way to go, dude. Nice work. They look beautiful. Shout out to you, Idol Yo-Kai. Anyway, yeah,

660
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,840
they're awesome. Let's wrap this bad boy up, shall we? Anyone else got anything to say?

661
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:07,680
Yes, I got to say, go to the Procrastinator subreddit, r slash the Procrastinators,

662
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,480
because I don't know if everyone knows about it, because we were talking about-

663
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,560
Oh, I don't think we've ever mentioned it on-

664
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,640
Yeah, I think we got to get people on there, because you know, I'm sure some people have some

665
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,720
degree in which they're thinking, man, if only there was a place where I could follow everything

666
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,960
that the TPC people do. Well, you're-

667
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:29,600
No, I use it myself, like I log on there and I check the fucking r slash the Procrastinators.

668
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,160
Yeah, hello, Reddit. Did you know that Harry's Razors, they loved these Razors so much,

669
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:41,760
they bought the factory that makes the Razors. No, I'm serious. Like, I log on to the subreddit

670
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,440
to see if any of you guys have released any videos. Oh, yeah, that's cool.

671
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,960
Because I don't want to ask in the chat, because you guys aren't always online and like-

672
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,160
And this subreddit is not only for a way to exhaust it.

673
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,520
And let rival Steven take care of it for me.

674
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:01,200
All songs that these people make are posted on here. Because that's one thing, is that not

675
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:06,960
everyone is able to follow all of the sound clouds of Jesse and Digi and so on. But all of the songs

676
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,240
that are made are also posted here. And best of all, all of the fan art that people draw is posted

677
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,640
immediately to the subreddit. So you can- Not all of it? Do you not-

678
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,640
Well, hopefully all of mine. I mean, I get like two or three a day.

679
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,760
Hmm, I see. Just whatever rival Steven has to catch.

680
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,840
Well, we encourage anyone who follows him on Twitter, just feel free to post it there anyway.

681
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,800
All right, that's enough. And he also not nearly all of our videos,

682
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,360
because not all my after dark stuff gets posted there, I don't think.

683
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,840
Oh, man. Guys, you gotta help out. Because like, rival Steven is this guy who stood up to the

684
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,960
challenge and has been posting almost everything. But you guys can do it, too. Do our bitch work

685
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,760

686
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,600
we're done. Wrap it up for the day. Thank you for watching this week of the faux-po-cast,

687
