1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Come on, you fuckers think that just cause a guy reads comics, he can't start some shit?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Aw, fuck it, take all you want!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're violent, we're heavy.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Home again, home again.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Gibbontake a lot!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Class is paying 101.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I guess one person can make a difference.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome to the panel cast.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I am the Wolfman, baby.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Woooo!

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Does anybody get what I'm doing?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's Wolfman Jack.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He was a radio DJ a million years ago.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's what I am now, cause it's Halloween.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm a Wolfman, I'm just like Wolfman Jack.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Only I'm not quite as powerful as Wolfman Jack.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm a Wolfboy, I'm a Wolfman in training.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Though I do share his lupinous condition.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's a lupinous condition, not a lupus condition.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's not lupus, it's never lupus.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It is in fact lupinous in origin.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The curse of the lichen flows through my blood.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Every Wednesday when the comics are released,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I transform into a comic devouring Wolfboy.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Ready to run out into the streets

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and read comics and scare people.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm not quite as good at howling as the original Wolfman.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Though I do suffer from Lycanecticus.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I also suffer from a rare and debilitating form of Schifilophagus

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that makes me unable to howl with the same level of strength

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and force and power and gusto as the Wolfman

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
so I can only manage to croak out a barely audible...

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What am I talking about?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Welcome to Panelcast, true believers.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I am your host, Endlit G.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm just stealing that true believers catchphrase from Stan Lee completely.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm 100% ripping that off.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can do that.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's within my rights as the most important person who ever lived.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I have sold a minion over the legal right to rip off, steal, and appropriate

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
any catchphrases or turns of phrase spoken or uttered by anyone who has ever lived.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Ah, like an absorbal off, absorbing the most powerful traits of all great men.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Because I am them.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I am everyone and everything.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's why I am the endless boy.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Bitch.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't think Stan Lee will mind.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If I drop an Excelsior every now and then or if I open my podcast

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
with a true believer, if I so choose, he doesn't mind.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Me and him are tight.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We go way back.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In fact, me and him had a running contest in the 80s to see who would get the most girls.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Last I checked, I was way ahead.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Besides, that dude's like 500 years old.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He'll probably turn to dust or go back to his home planet at some point pretty soon.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then, where will his essence go, if not to me?

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm like Shang Tsung.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
As long as someone is dead,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I have the power to harness and appropriate their essence, their visage,

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
their form to disorient my opponents in combat.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
In the combat of the mortals.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What the fuck is happening?

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is already week two of the panel cast,

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and it's already just a complete train wreck spiraling down the drain.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Eat your debris.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's already turning into a...

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh boy.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ah.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
God damn it, I'm the motherfucking wolf man.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, let's talk about comics, people.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's what this podcast is about.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's what life is about.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's the only thing that truly matters.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The only thing that brings me any real sense of peace and tranquility

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
in this rotten, miserable hellhole of a planet.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's the only thing I trust anymore,

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
because comics are the only safe activity left

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
for a psychotic man like myself, okay?

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I've been eagerly anticipating sitting down here

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and recording another panel cast for everybody this week,

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
because comics, reading comics is the only time I feel safe anymore.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's the only safe activity left.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Going outside is not safe.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not safe out there for a man like me.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Chaos follows me.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Conflict follows me.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Everywhere I go, I just want to live in peace,

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
but nobody wants to let me.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Everybody wants to fuck with me.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Everybody wants to take shots at the champ.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So everywhere I go, I end up in some fight,

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
or some huge brawl,

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
or someone fucks with me,

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
or I become the center of some swirling tornado

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
of chaos and violence.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Happens to me every single time I go out.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Just the other day, in fact, I went to a party,

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and of course I ended up at the center of a huge fucking brawl,

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
because everyone has to fuck with me.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Everybody has to start shit,

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and nobody expects that the guy they're fucking with

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is gonna fuck with them right back.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Nobody expects that somebody in this world

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
still has the balls to stand up for themselves.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So of course I end up in the middle of a huge fucking catastrophic brawl.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm fighting people off me from all sides.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm throwing bitches left and right.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I got guys hanging off me.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm punching, I'm kicking, I'm scratching, I'm killing.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh god, it was chaos.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I was just like Brody in my intro.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Come on, you fuckers think that just because the guy reads comics,

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
he can't start some shit?

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll fucking take all you on!

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You know, it's the same old song and dance with me.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Everywhere I go, this happens.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm used to it,

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
but I'm also getting pretty sick and tired of it,

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and it's all because some people just can't take a joke.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Some people just can't comprehend

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
or wrap their minds around the intricate concept of humor.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's like rocket surgery to some people.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You know, it seems like you can't even show up in a Trump hat

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and start slapping bitches anymore

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
without everybody losing their sense of humor all of a sudden.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, I apologize if my satire was too high-brow

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
for you Neanderthals to understand,

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
but I thought this was America.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Anyways, I'm sure I'll get into the gory,

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
hilarious, awesome details of that story

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
at some other point on some other podcast,

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
but this is not the place for it.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is the place for comics people.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm talking about all the wonderful, wacky, wild,

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and exciting comics that I read this week.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And also, I am the Wolfman.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't forget that.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm gonna quiz you on all of this after the podcast is done.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Who is the Wolfman?

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What are comics for?

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Who likes them?

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What country is this and where's my America?

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
All important questions that you will be graded on.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Harshly.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
One other piece of news that I forgot to mention

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in the pilot episode of this podcast,

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and last week's episode, I didn't mention this.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Wasn't sure if I wanted to mention it,

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but as I go through and talk about all of these comics,

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
if any of them peak your curiosity

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and you want to check them out and you want to read them,

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
there are comic reader websites where people just post them

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and you can read them for free all over the internet.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I guess I'll put one in the description box.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Obviously, it's not legal, but you know, who gives a fuck?

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I use it and I still buy comics.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You know, usually what happens is if I read a comic on there

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that I like, then I go out and buy it.

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So I think that sites like these actually drive sales.

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think that piracy often has just as much of a beneficial effect

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
to sales as any negative effect that anyone says it has.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So if I talk about comics and they sound cool to you by all means,

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
check them out and then go fucking buy them

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
if you feel like it or if you don't feel like I don't fucking give a shit, man.

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't give a shit. I'm an easygoing guy.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Until someone fucks with me and then I become the motherfucking wolf man, baby.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm just gonna make sounds.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Noises.

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I read Wonder Woman this week.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, how's that for a smooth segue?

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So this Wonder Woman series is part of DC's whole company-wide

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
rebirth branding thing.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And what the rebirth thing is, is a couple years ago,

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
DC did this big retcon.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They called it the New 52.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
They were sort of, they were trying to simplify their continuity

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
by saying that like, okay, the whole DC universe now started five years ago

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and that's the new status quo.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But in trying to simplify their continuity for new readers and such,

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
all they actually managed to accomplish was

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
they made it a million times more confusing and complicated

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and accidentally totally screwed the pooch and ruined everything

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
because when you take, you know, 80 years of continuity

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and try to squish it all into five years,

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
suddenly nothing makes any fucking sense.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Like everywhere you would look, there was all this weird shit that you couldn't,

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
like saying that like Batman, for example, has only been around for five years,

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
that does not work in any way with all the different Batman stories.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You know, the fact alone that there's been like six different Robins, you know,

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
like Dick Grayson has gone from a 12-year-old boy to like a 25-year-old man

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and then you had Jason Todd and Tim Drake also growing up into grown ass men

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and then he has this son, Damien, who's like 12 years old,

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
whom he's sired with Talia Al Ghul when he was still Batman 12 years ago.

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The very idea of squishing all this continuity into like a five-year span

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
inherently ruins everything and makes nothing sensical or coherent in any way.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And there were so many weird plot holes that arose from this decision,

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
from this rebranding, you know, like the Teen Titans were totally fucked,

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
the Teen Titans are still fucked, nothing, nothing can save the Teen Titans now

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
because of the continuity and how badly it's been fucked.

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The Teen Titans make no fucking sense and I don't think they ever will again.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Nightwing is in his 20s, but Starfire and Raven are still somehow on the Teen Titans

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and still I'm supposed to believe they're still teenagers,

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
even though Damien's now also in the Teen Titans and he's like 12

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and Cyborg now was never a Teen Titan, he was just a Justice League guy

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
like what's going on, I don't understand any of this shit anymore,

206
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
none of it makes any sense anymore.

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So they just totally ruined everything and it made it really hard to get invested

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
in DC's stories for a long time, but the great thing about DC is that at a certain point

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
they finally looked at all the fan response and they said, you know what,

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
yeah we did kind of fucking ruin everything for a couple years though,

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
let's go back and try to fix it, let's try to smooth things out a bit.

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So they went back and basically this rebirth branding thing that they're doing now

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
is kind of like DC's apology to fans, it's their way of saying,

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
alright we admit it, we fucked up and they're kind of like slowly reintegrating

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
all of the old continuity that was lost in the New 52 relaunch.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So they're, you know, trying to get everything back to basics and get back to the way it was

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and getting rid of all the weird, hokey, New 52 bullshit that nobody liked,

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
like for example Wonder Woman and Superman being like romantically involved,

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
which is like a weird like leftover idea from Frank Miller in the 80s

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that he had a boner for but doesn't really make sense to anyone else,

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
but they did it anyways, like what the, like it kind of ruins both characters

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
to say that, you know, they're this like Brangelina power couple

223
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
lording over the world in their fucking watch tower.

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I mean like the main thing that makes Superman or Wonder Woman relatable and special

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
is that they both date regular people, like Superman's girlfriend is Lois Lane,

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
she's just a regular chick because Superman is a regular guy.

227
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you take Superman and you have him fucking Wonder Woman,

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
suddenly neither of them are like regular people anymore,

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
they're just larger than life gods who are sitting up on Olympus licking each other's assholes

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and lording it over the rest of humanity.

231
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's dumb.

232
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So anyways, this issue of Wonder Woman starts out with Steve Trevor,

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Wonder Woman's old boyfriend.

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Steve Trevor, if you don't know the character, he was the guy who first,

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
he was like a fighter pilot who first crash landed on the island of Themyscira

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and discovered the Amazons and discovered Princess Diana,

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
not Princess Diana the one that you're thinking of.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Not the young woman who died in the car crash and her beanie baby is worth like $50 million.

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm talking about Wonder Woman's name as Diana, she's...

240
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So yeah, Steve Trevor is the guy who discovered Wonder Woman

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and he's pretty much always been her boyfriend or her romantic interest

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
or her best buddy or her human compadre.

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He's always been sort of integral to Wonder Woman.

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So this comic starts out with Steve Trevor

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and then a bunch of stuff happens in the middle that I don't understand

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
because I haven't been reading this series, I haven't been keeping up with it.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There's some stuff about like Diana can't find Themyscira anymore,

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
like it's hidden from her for some reason.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
She's trying to find her way back to Themyscira and it's like off the map.

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I have no idea what's going on.

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I have not been reading this series, I just jumped into issue number nine.

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But near the end of the book there's a scene where Steve Trevor is hanging out on the beach

253
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and Wonder Woman goes and joins him and they have like a conversation on the beach

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and they have this come to Jesus meeting, this sort of

255
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
we used to be boyfriend and girlfriend kind of talk.

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
They have some real talk and they're talking about Superman

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and he's like, you know, I can't blame you for going out with Superman.

258
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I mean, he's fucking Superman, man.

259
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
She's like, yeah, maybe it was wrong, maybe it was more convenient than it was.

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And Wonder Woman kind of goes into the speech about her motivations for having been with Superman.

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Kind of like retconning some purpose into that weird fucking

262
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
corporately mandated romance, right?

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Trying to retcon some, I guess, character motivation into it that makes some semblance of sense.

264
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And Wonder Woman is going on this speech and it's a good speech.

265
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And I feel like for once Wonder Woman actually came off like a person with a personality.

266
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
She usually doesn't for me. She usually doesn't do it for me.

267
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But I think it was pretty well written and they're having this conversation

268
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and yada yada and blue bitty blue and long story short, they kiss and so they're back together.

269
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So that's what I'm talking about with the rebirth line and why it's been so great and so satisfying

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
is because the entire rebirth line that DC has been doing all year has basically

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
just been them kind of getting back to basics and saying, yeah, we fucked up

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and slowly putting all the puzzle pieces back together the way they belong together

273
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and putting everything as it should be in its right place.

274
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You know what it feels like to read these rebirth stories

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and see them fixing all these mistakes and rectifying all these weird directions

276
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
that they went on over the last couple of years because it's been hard to read DC comics

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
for the last couple of years ever since the New 52 began.

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Even good comics, it's been hard to read just because the continuity got so fucked

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and there were so many weird things going on.

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So in order to understand what it feels like to now read these rebirth comics

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and see them one by one fixing everything and putting the puzzle pieces back where they belong

282
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
or at least back into a shape where they make sense again,

283
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
it feels so satisfying to see these things like Wonder Woman kissing Steve Trevor

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
or Green Arrow being back together with Black Canary and they're on an island or some shit

285
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
or Superman and Lois Lane having a house and a kid together

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and his kids got superpowers and he's teaching his kid how to be superpowers guy.

287
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's so fucking satisfying. It feels like all's right with the world.

288
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Like God's in his heaven, Superman is fucking Lois Lane and all's right with the world.

289
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I read it and I feel warm inside. I feel like I can feel electricity in my blood

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and I can feel endorphins shooting off into my brain and making me feel safe and secure again

291
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
in a way that I haven't felt since I was a child.

292
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I can feel the pages of the comic growing larger and enveloping me

293
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
like a warm blanket of security and it's like I'm just melting into it.

294
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
My body is breaking down and I'm melting into the pages.

295
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm becoming part of the comic.

296
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm seeing my world in ink and color and separated into panels.

297
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm being drawn into a realm of pure imagination,

298
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
a realm of comics just like the Sega Genesis game, Comic Zone.

299
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm becoming one with the comics and I'm soaring through a vast and beautiful universe

300
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
like the Silver Surfer.

301
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm seeing colorful nebulas and a technique color of different galaxies and star systems

302
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
becoming one with the hopes and dreams of all good little comic boys and comic girls out there.

303
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I've obtained the Power Cosmic like the Silver Surfer,

304
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
only it's even more powerful than the Power Cosmic because it's the Power Comic.

305
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm surfing through the galaxy on a board of the Power Comic.

306
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
A storyboard, if you will.

307
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ha ha ha ha!

308
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's me sucking my stogie because I just told I made a brilliant play on words.

309
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You know what it's like? It's like the video game Res for PS2 where you're like a wireframe guy

310
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and you're flying through this like crazy techno cyberspace scape and it's like a shmup.

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's like Res. I've become Res.

312
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And I'm seeing all of these beautiful heartwarming images flashing before my eyes

313
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
as I soar through a beautiful brilliant galaxy of colors and shapes and memories and feelings.

314
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Witnessing all of these pieces fall back into place the way they belong.

315
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
All of these puzzle pieces coming back together to form a cohesive picture once again in my mind.

316
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And I'm hearing Tom York from Radiohead crooning like an angel.

317
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Everything in its right place.

318
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That song is playing.

319
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Look up everything in its right place by Radiohead because that's the soundtrack of this journey into mystery

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that my soul, my essence is undertaking through the universe.

321
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

322
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

323
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

324
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's what it's like. Feels good man.

325
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Anyways it was pretty good and I don't even like Wonder Woman that much so you know that's good.

326
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The next comic I read was fucking um fuck.

327
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Suddenly it's really fucking hot in here. Oh my god. Oh god get the sweater off me. Oh god!

328
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm done. I'm taking a nap. Going to bed. Finish this one. Finish it later.

329
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The next comic I read which is probably the most high profile comic that came out this week

330
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
was Civil War II number six.

331
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And let me tell you this comic can go fuck itself. This is a piece of shit.

332
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's a fucking, it's a pile of fuck. I don't respect it.

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't respect it. The fact that it exists.

334
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And it's not even a bad comic. It's fun.

335
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I get it. I get why comics like these sell because it's all the superheroes in one book.

336
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And I guess to normies who have not seen that every year who are not sick of it

337
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
because normies do not have this event fatigue that comic book fans get.

338
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's why these event comics continue to sell.

339
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Because if you don't read comics regularly then of course you want to see all of the superheroes fighting each other in a comic.

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But when it's every single year you're reading comics and every fucking year Marvel has some new goofy gimmick event comic

341
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
and it's always some new ridiculous conflict of characters acting out of character

342
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and you know personalities being stretched so far in order to meet this corporately mandated battle

343
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
where we have to have side A beat up side B and vice versa

344
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
to the point where the characters aren't even acting rationally like themselves anymore

345
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and the stories don't make any sense and they just bleed into all of the other comics

346
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and stick their dicks into every other story currently going on.

347
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And nothing can make sense anymore.

348
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
No storyline gets a chance to breathe on its own.

349
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No comic gets a chance to breathe or stretch its wings

350
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and see what it can do with its own universe and its own storylines and its own characters.

351
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Character development is thrown out the window all across the board.

352
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's all swept away once a year to make way for some huge goofy clusterfuck event comic

353
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that's usually bloated and takes what fucking half the year to come out

354
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
with 50 fucking tie-in issues.

355
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
God damn it! I hate these fucking event comics!

356
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I cursed them! I'm sick of them!

357
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Oh god.

358
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You know you've got DC over here with its rebirth shit

359
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and like yeah you could make the argument that it's kind of taking things back to the status quo

360
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
but not really. It's not getting rid of character development or anything like that.

361
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's not putting things back exactly how they were.

362
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's just putting things back in a way that fucking makes sense.

363
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's putting the characters, it's making them like themselves again,

364
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
making them recognizable again.

365
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's not getting rid of any character development

366
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
but these fucking Marvel events every year.

367
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Holy shit!

368
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Marvel is all about the illusion of change.

369
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You know every year we're gonna shake up the Marvel Universe with some crazy new gimmick.

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The fallout from this event is gonna be so catastrophic

371
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and universe changing.

372
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Nothing will ever be the same again.

373
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
They say that every fucking year and it's always bullshit.

374
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's like they think they're shaking up the status quo

375
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
but there's no status quo to shake up anymore.

376
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The events are the status quo

377
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
because every fucking year there's an entire year of like weird fallout

378
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and goofy gimmicks that don't make any sense.

379
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And then by the time anything starts to make sense again

380
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
by the time the stories start getting back on their feet

381
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
then by that time it's time for the next year's stupid event

382
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
that's going to shake things up in some other recocculus way.

383
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh this year fucking the X-Men are outlaws

384
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and mutants are endangered

385
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and then the next year mutants are not endangered

386
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
but then the next year they are again

387
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and then this year there's a registration act

388
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and then the next year Norman Osborn is in charge of the government

389
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
so the maniacs are running the asylum

390
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and then the next year there's Skrulls.

391
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Some people are Skrulls in disguise

392
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and it's a hole you gotta figure out who the bad guys are.

393
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You can't trust anybody.

394
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And then the next year Peter Parker is now a fucking billionaire

395
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
on the level of Tony Stark, a genius inventor for some fucking reason

396
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and then the next year you've got fucking, you know...

397
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Fuck! Fuck!

398
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Enough! Enough already!

399
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Nobody can keep up with this shit.

400
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's all goofy. It's fucking retarded.

401
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Civil War II? Are you fucking kidding me?

402
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Who asked for that? Who wanted it?

403
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh because they made a Civil War movie

404
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
they've gotta fucking have a comic that says Civil War on the shelves

405
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
so Normies will buy it.

406
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
They had to concoct this recocular Civil War II story

407
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
which is even more nonsensical and retarded

408
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
than the first one was ten years ago.

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Somehow it's even more ridiculous.

410
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You know by the grace of God

411
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
the Captain America movie Civil War

412
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
fixed the Civil War comic story

413
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
which was a fucking retarded comic book story

414
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
that everybody hated because it didn't make any fucking sense.

415
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh god I hate it!

416
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh god!

417
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So the story of Civil War II

418
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
is that there's this inhuman.

419
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The inhumans are a group of fucking assholes

420
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
who live on the moon.

421
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't even want to fucking get into them

422
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
because I fucking hate the inhumans.

423
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
They're the worst thing ever created

424
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
but they fucking unleash a poisonous gas cloud on Earth

425
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and it's making more people into inhumans.

426
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So more people are getting inhuman powers

427
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and there's this fucking kid named Ulysses

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and he gets these pre-cog powers

429
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
where he can tell the future

430
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and so since he can tell the future

431
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
he has visions of these horrible catastrophes, right?

432
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So all the superheroes get in a room

433
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and they go,

434
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
what are we gonna do about this kid's visions

435
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
of the horrible catastrophes?

436
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And fucking half the people

437
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
are led by Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers,

438
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
who says, oh, we should use the kid

439
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
to stop crimes before they happen.

440
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And then half the guys are led by Tony Stark, Iron Man.

441
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And he says, no, that's crazy.

442
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Haven't you idiots ever seen Minority Report?

443
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And Carol says, no, I haven't seen Minority Report.

444
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I've never seen this trope before

445
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and therefore I'm a fucking moron

446
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and I think it's a good idea.

447
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Sorry, I'm sorry, not Miss Marvel.

448
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
She's not Miss Marvel anymore.

449
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
She's Captain Marvel now.

450
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You can't call her Miss Marvel.

451
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's regressive.

452
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The little brown girl is Miss Marvel.

453
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
She can be called Miss because at least she's brown.

454
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
At least in some way she's inclusive and diverse.

455
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You can't have a white girl.

456
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You can't call women Miss.

457
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So Miss Marvel is not Captain Marvel.

458
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh God.

459
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So Captain Marvel takes a bunch of guys.

460
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
She takes War Machine and She-Hulk.

461
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
She assembles a team and she goes to fight Thanos.

462
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Thanos.

463
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Thanos or Thanos?

464
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I feel like Thanos sounds better.

465
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
She goes to fight Thanos because the fucking Ulysses kid

466
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
had a vision that Thanos was going to beat everyone up.

467
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Really bad.

468
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So she goes to Thanos.

469
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
She finds him in his fucking house and starts a fight.

470
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And what do you know?

471
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Thanos beats everyone up.

472
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Really bad.

473
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
She just barges into his fucking place.

474
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
He's mining his own business.

475
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And he's sitting in his best chair.

476
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And she busts through the wall like the fucking Kool-Aid man

477
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
with War Machine and She-Hulk

478
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and starts a fucking fight.

479
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So yeah, the kid's vision came true.

480
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But only because she fucking, you know.

481
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And that's how the trope works, right?

482
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That's how this trope always ends up.

483
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Seeing the future is what locks the future

484
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
because they see it and by trying to avoid it

485
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
they cause it to happen.

486
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That's like the plot of every That's So Raven episode.

487
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
How has nobody in the Marvel Universe

488
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
ever seen an episode of That's So Raven?

489
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So that's basically what the Civil War II divide is about.

490
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's about the superheroes who have seen That's So Raven

491
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
versus the superheroes who haven't seen That's So Raven.

492
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And don't know how this fucking trope works.

493
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So Thanos kicks everyone's ass.

494
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
War Machine is fucking dead.

495
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
She-Hulk is in like critical condition.

496
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So Tony Stark is so fucking pissed off

497
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
that his best buddy, Rody, died

498
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
in this ill-conceived cock-a-manie pre-cog battle idea

499
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
that he basically says, fuck you Carol, we're fighting now.

500
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Everyone's fighting.

501
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Meanwhile, Carol also has to go and find Bruce Banner

502
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and tell him that his cousin She-Hulk

503
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
is in critical condition because of her.

504
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And nobody wants that job

505
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
because if Bruce Banner gets mad,

506
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
if he finds out that we fucked up so bad

507
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and got his cousin hurt,

508
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
he's gonna hulk out, he's gonna throw a big fit, right?

509
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Even though Bruce Banner has actually been cured

510
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
by the Hulk in continuity for like a year,

511
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
they're still paranoid about it

512
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
because they're a bunch of fucking idiots.

513
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So they're going to confront the Hulk

514
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and tell him, you know, what's going on.

515
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But then also, the Ulysses kid has another fucking premonition

516
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and he has a premonition that the Hulk

517
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
is going to kill everyone.

518
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So here's what Carol does

519
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
because the only way that this story can even happen

520
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
is by making one of the characters a complete retard.

521
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So they made Captain Marvel a complete fucking retard.

522
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Everything that she does in this series

523
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
defies all logic and rationale.

524
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's all completely insane.

525
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Her actions are the actions of a fucking madman

526
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and it's baffling that anyone would even take her side at all.

527
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So the situation is that they have to go tell Bruce Banner

528
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
that they got She-Hulk nearly killed

529
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and they have a vision that says the Hulk

530
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
is going to fucking kill everyone.

531
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And they already know from the first vision

532
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
that trying to prevent the visions

533
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
is exactly what makes the visions happen.

534
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So you'd think the answer is pretty fucking clear.

535
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Leave Bruce Banner the fuck alone.

536
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Instead, Captain Marvel shows up on his doorstep

537
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
with like an entire army of pissed off superheroes behind her

538
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
ready to like intimidate Bruce Banner

539
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
into coming with him quietly.

540
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What the fuck?

541
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You don't intimidate Bruce fucking Banner.

542
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You don't even try that.

543
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That's a goofy idea.

544
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So they're basically antagonizing Bruce Banner

545
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
into becoming the Hulk.

546
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And he's saying,

547
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
what are you fucking people talking about?

548
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I haven't been the Hulk in like a year, okay?

549
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I haven't had, you know, a Hulk episode in a while.

550
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm totally okay.

551
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You're telling me that you got She-Hulk all fucked up

552
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
for no reason.

553
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Clearly I'm pissed off,

554
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
but as you can see, I'm not hulking out.

555
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So why do you have a bunch of people here

556
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
trying to intimidate me?

557
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So they have this fucking, you know, conflict.

558
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And long story short,

559
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
they're so worried.

560
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
They're so paranoid that Bruce is going to hulk out

561
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and kill everyone.

562
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That Hawkeye, who is sitting over in a tree,

563
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
lets loose an arrow,

564
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
flip, and you know,

565
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
shoots Bruce in the head,

566
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and Bruce Banner's dead.

567
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
They killed Bruce Banner.

568
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So then there's a whole big thing.

569
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's like the trial of Hawkeye,

570
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
you know, trying to, you know,

571
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
and Hawkeye reveals that Bruce requested him

572
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
to kill him if he ever was going to hulk out again.

573
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And Hawkeye says that, hey, in good faith,

574
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm Hawkeye.

575
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I have better eyes than you.

576
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I saw a little flick of green in his eyes.

577
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I thought he was going to become the Hulk, you know?

578
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I had no choice.

579
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
He told me if he ever became the Hulk again

580
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
to fucking kill him, so I did what he asked.

581
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So, you know, it's a whole big trial.

582
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And Hawkeye is found innocent,

583
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I think.

584
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm a little hate.

585
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm pretty sure he's found innocent,

586
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
but you know, there's another point.

587
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Fuck, what else fucking happened

588
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
in this Godforsaken story?

589
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Anyways, because of everything that's fucking happened,

590
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Tony Stark and Captain Marvel fucking hate each other.

591
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And yeah, and it's Civil War II.

592
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
All the superheroes are going to fucking fight each other

593
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
again over stupid bullshit.

594
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And the conflict is so stupid,

595
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
because, like,

596
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
in the first issue,

597
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Captain Marvel's side is proven

598
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
to be objectively wrong.

599
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Right?

600
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Like, she gets the pre-cog,

601
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
she gets the vision of, like, Thanos

602
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
beating everyone up,

603
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
so she goes to attack Thanos

604
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
and gets beat up by Thanos.

605
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
In the first issue,

606
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
the dilemma is fucking solved.

607
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Well, okay, now we know that this is that

608
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Surraven rules.

609
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
We know that if we fucking try to prevent these visions,

610
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
they're just gonna be forced into fruition.

611
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
We're going to make them come to pass

612
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
by trying to prevent them.

613
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That's how time travel stories always work.

614
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Have you never seen a fucking time travel story in your life?

615
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Holy shit.

616
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It literally happens in the first issue.

617
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like, the dilemma is over.

618
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The problem is solved.

619
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The issue is complete.

620
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Nobody would be insane enough

621
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
to still be on her side

622
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
after the very first vision that they saw

623
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
proved that her side was fucking retarded.

624
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Beyond a shadow of a doubt.

625
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Like, it's one thing where it's like

626
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
in the first Civil War,

627
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
where people can argue both sides.

628
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like, you know, some people have been...

629
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Some people read Civil War I

630
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
or they watch the Civil War movie

631
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and they're legitimately on Tony Stark's side

632
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
with the Registration Act.

633
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Some people watch it and they're legitimately on Cap's side.

634
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I can't imagine anyone being on Carol's side

635
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
in Civil War II

636
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
because the story itself

637
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
goes out of its way to expressly show

638
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
that her side is objectively fucking wrong.

639
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Holy shit.

640
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
This is fucking terrible.

641
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So anyways, it's Civil War II

642
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and all the superheroes are fighting each other

643
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and eventually the kid gets another fucking vision

644
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and this time his vision is of Miles Morales

645
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
who is the little black Mexican Spider-Man.

646
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
There's two Spider-Men now.

647
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I don't know why he couldn't have just had it like his own name.

648
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But he has a vision of a little baby Spider-Man

649
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
killing Captain America

650
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and that fucking sends everyone into panic mode

651
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
and so that's where this issue starts off

652
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
with them dealing from the fallout

653
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
of this new vision that they've had

654
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
of Miles Morales killing Captain America

655
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and it's really stupid

656
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and it's really fucking shit.

657
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's shit.

658
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
God damn it.

659
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
God fucking damn it.

660
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I hate event comics.

661
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm so sick of this shit.

662
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm so sick of Marvel's bullshit

663
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
every year with this shit.

664
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh my god.

665
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I need tea.

666
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So they get this vision that Spider-Man's going to kill Captain America

667
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and so everyone's freaking out

668
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and Carol is doing her fucking minority report bullshit.

669
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
She's like,

670
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
okay Spider-Man you're going to come quietly

671
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
we're going to arrest you.

672
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
This is like a 15 year old kid.

673
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
She's basically gone full supervillain at this point.

674
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
She's arresting children

675
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
on account of some fuckboy in humans

676
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
goofy nightmares.

677
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So she's about to beat up Spider-Man

678
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and arrest him and all that

679
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
but then Captain America's like Carol shut the fuck up

680
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
sit the fuck down you crazy ass bitch

681
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and Miss Marvel

682
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
remember Captain Marvel used to be Miss Marvel

683
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
but she bestowed the name Miss Marvel

684
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
onto Kamala Khan

685
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
who is a teenager

686
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and so she is Miss Marvel

687
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and she was like Captain Marvel's protege, right?

688
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Captain Marvel gave her the name Miss Marvel

689
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Captain Marvel is about to, you know,

690
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
arrest Little Spidey

691
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
but then Little Marvel, Miss Marvel

692
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
she grabs her with her giant hand

693
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
she can stretch her body

694
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
so she's got a giant hand sometimes

695
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
she grabs her with a giant hand she says fuck you

696
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
this is crazy

697
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
you've gone bad man

698
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
so you know Miss Marvel

699
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
so they all jump ship

700
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
all the little teeny bopper Avengers

701
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
jump ship

702
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
the Iron Man side

703
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and Captain America

704
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
has a talk with Spider-Man

705
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
he says okay son don't

706
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
don't freak out

707
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and then Thor

708
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
not the real Thor, the fucking woman Thor

709
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Jane Foster, she flies

710
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Little Spider-Man out there

711
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
God none of these fucking superheroes

712
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
are even the actual superheroes anymore

713
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
every fucking character's name

714
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
that you talk about when you talk about Marvel

715
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
you have to put an asterisk

716
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
next to every fucking thing that you say

717
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
it makes everything you're saying

718
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
take ten times longer

719
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
because you have to add the caveat of

720
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and then Spider-Man, not Peter Parker

721
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the little Spider-Man, the black Mexican Spider-Man

722
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
does this and then Thor takes him

723
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and flies away, not the real Thor that you know

724
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm talking about the girl Thor

725
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Jane Foster, she used to be Thor's girlfriend

726
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
she had cancer and now she is Thor

727
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
because Nick Fury whispered a secret into his ear

728
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that made him unworthy of Mjolnir

729
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
so now fucking blah blah blah blah

730
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and then Ms. Marvel grabbed Captain Marvel

731
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
because Ms. Marvel is the Ms. Marvel

732
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
because Captain Marvel used to be Ms. Marvel

733
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
and god damn it Marvel I fucking hate you

734
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
fuck

735
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
just give these characters their own fucking names

736
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
if you want to be diverse

737
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
then create new superheroes

738
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
don't fucking co-opt

739
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
names of superheroes that already

740
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
fucking exist

741
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
these two Spider-Man swinging around

742
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
it's fucking confusing

743
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
you piece of shit

744
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I hate you Marvel

745
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I fucking hate them

746
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
so Captain Marvel is off on some

747
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
shield, helicarrier

748
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
sulking like a little whiny baby

749
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
because her crazy weird

750
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
evil supervillain plans are falling

751
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
through and everyone on her side is

752
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
abandoning her cause

753
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Black Panther

754
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
abandons her side and he goes and joins

755
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Captain America's side

756
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Black Panther has one of the goofiest

757
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
lines I've ever seen in this comic

758
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
where he's saying

759
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm sorry Carol I can't be on your side

760
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
of this conflict anymore

761
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
because you know

762
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
when you're on the

763
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
opposite side of Steve Rogers

764
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
you're usually

765
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
in the wrong

766
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Captain America is usually a pretty moral guy

767
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
so when it comes to moral issues

768
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I want

769
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
to be on the side of Captain America

770
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
well mother fucker

771
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
if that's how you feel

772
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
then why weren't you on his

773
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
side from the beginning

774
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
what the fuck kind of a

775
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
what the fuck

776
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
kind of a revelation is that

777
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
it's not like he saw the carnage

778
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
or saw what was going on

779
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and said you know what

780
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm starting to think that maybe Carol's ideas

781
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
about this whole pre-cog

782
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
you know

783
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
kind of justice thing

784
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I think maybe she's going off the deep end

785
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
it wasn't like he slowly saw what was

786
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
happening and came to acknowledge

787
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
this he just suddenly

788
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
remembered oh yeah

789
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Captain America's on the other team

790
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
well he's usually right

791
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
how could I forget

792
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
what the fuck

793
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and then at the end fucking little spider-man

794
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
goes to the fucking

795
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
capital steps of

796
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Washington and he stands there

797
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
some shit

798
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I don't fucking know

799
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
oh fuck this is

800
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
terrible this is so fucking

801
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
bad

802
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
why do they do this

803
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I'm looking at this fuck I'm looking at these pages

804
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
right now and every time

805
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I keep remembering other things

806
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
about this comic that are so fucking weird

807
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
like at this point the only

808
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
people still

809
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
on Captain Marvel's side

810
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
are

811
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Storm for some fucking reason

812
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Jean Grey

813
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
not the real Jean Grey

814
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
not the original Jean Grey

815
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
the new Jean Grey who is actually

816
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
the younger Jean Grey from the past

817
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
transplanted into the present

818
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
from Beast because he made a time machine

819
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to bring the original young baby

820
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
X-Men to the present

821
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
that teach Scott Summers a lesson

822
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
because the X-Men were fugitives for a while

823
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
because of all the fallout from one of their big stupid

824
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
events Avengers vs X-Men

825
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
in 2011 so Beast

826
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
hated Cyclops and he wanted

827
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
he had some weird goofy plan

828
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that somehow bringing Jean

829
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Grey as a teenager back into

830
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
the present with oh Jesus

831
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
so she's got fucking teenage

832
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Jean Grey there on her side

833
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
she's got Storm there who

834
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Storm has a fucking Mohawk because she had

835
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
a Mohawk in the 80s and some

836
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Jackass at Marvel decided to

837
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
retro and bring the Mohawk back

838
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
for some reason even though it looks

839
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
fucking goofy as hell so she's

840
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
got fucking she's got fucking

841
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
phony teenage teeny

842
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
bopper Jean Grey from the 60s

843
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
she's got stupid looking

844
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Mohawk Storm and she's

845
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
got the Guardians of the Galaxy on her team

846
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
but the Guardians

847
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
of the Galaxy are so fucked up

848
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
the rock that's like like okay

849
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Groot's there Peter Quills there

850
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
and Rocket Raccoon's there

851
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Dora and Drax so everybody that you know from

852
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
the movie but also I don't know

853
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
what the fuck is going on in Marvel

854
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Ben Grimm the thing is now

855
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
part of the Guardians of the Galaxy

856
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Shadowcat is there Kitty Pride

857
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
from the X-Men what's going on

858
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't know what's

859
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
happening with the Guardians of the Galaxy

860
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I don't know why fucking Kitty Pride

861
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and Ben Grimm are currently on that team

862
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
but they are and so

863
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
that's basically all the people

864
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
who are left on

865
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Captain Marvel's insane

866
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
supervillain team

867
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
the Guardians of the Galaxy

868
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
featuring Ben Grimm and Kitty Pride

869
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
stupid looking idiot Mohawk

870
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Storm from the 80s and

871
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000

874
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Jean Grey from the 1960s

875
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Jean Gay should be her name

876
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
because that's all she does

877
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
she's a bad she's an evil little girl

878
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
she turns people gay

879
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
as the great philosopher

880
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
me once said

881
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
you so gay

882
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
you're making me gay

883
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
why is Kitty Pride

884
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
in the Guardians

885
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
why is she one of the Guardians of the Galaxy

886
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
what is happening

887
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
you know there's this weird panel here

888
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
where Carol is sulking

889
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
because nobody wants to be on her fucking

890
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
supervillain crew anymore

891
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and fucking Peter Quill

892
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
comes up behind her

893
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and he says you know what

894
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
fuck them you're right

895
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
you're absolutely right

896
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
about this whole thing

897
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
if you can prevent anything bad

898
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
from happening then you have to try to do it

899
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
you have to do everything you can

900
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
to prevent disasters and tragedies

901
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
from happening

902
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
well you know

903
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
that's a great speech there Star-Lord

904
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
except for the fact that she's

905
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
causing the things to happen

906
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
she trying to change the bad

907
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
things is causing the bad things to happen

908
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
this was established in the first issue

909
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
so why the fuck

910
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
did this conflict even make it

911
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
to six issues

912
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
it should have been over at the first issue

913
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
you're all crazy you're all idiots

914
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
you're all out of character

915
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
fucking badly written fanfic

916
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
idiots

917
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
oh god

918
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
you know these are beloved characters

919
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
everybody loves Star-Lord

920
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
why is he suddenly a fucking idiot

921
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
why is he on this team of supervillains

922
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
why are any of these

923
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
beloved characters on this team

924
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
of supervillains why is Carol

925
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
a fucking supervillain

926
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
okay they're gonna have a fucking

927
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Captain Marvel movie in a couple years

928
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
they're gonna be wanting

929
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
they're gonna want a push Captain Marvel

930
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
as a hero they're gonna want everyone to

931
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
fucking love her right

932
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
so why are they making her a fucking crazy

933
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
tyrant who arrest people

934
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
for future crimes

935
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
you know Marvel's all about fucking diversity

936
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
everyone's all about

937
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
we need female superheroes

938
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
there's not enough female superheroes

939
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
for little girls to look up to

940
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
so we gotta make a Captain Marvel movie

941
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
hey little girls

942
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
do you want to

943
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
be like Captain Marvel when you grow up

944
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
remember that she's a fucking

945
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
tyrant who arrests

946
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
children for future

947
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
crimes that they haven't committed yet

948
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
wow what an inspiring superhero

949
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
for little girls to emulate

950
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
thank god we have all this

951
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
diversity now

952
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
so that we can have

953
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
female superheroes and then

954
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
ruin them with terrible comic

955
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
book stories that make no sense

956
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and make them seem like irredeemable

957
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
monsters and idiots

958
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
holy shit

959
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and I could almost understand

960
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
why Captain Marvel would feel this way

961
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
about it and want to be

962
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
you know misgovernment

963
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
arrest people for future crimes

964
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
because she does come from like a militaristic

965
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
background

966
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
she was like an air force military lady

967
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
but fucking star lord

968
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I mean you know

969
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
star lord he's basically Han Solo

970
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
he's a

971
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
galactic scamp a space pirate

972
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
a scoundrel a scruffy nerf herder

973
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
a fucking rogue

974
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
he's a guy in a goofy red jacket

975
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and a weird looking bug mask

976
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
who flies around the galaxy

977
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
fucking green alien girls

978
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and who defeats super villains

979
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
by dancing like an idiot

980
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
to 70s funk pop

981
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
it makes no sense

982
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
for him to be on Captain Marvel's side here

983
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and maybe I'm wrong

984
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
maybe there's some aspect of his

985
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
personality that I don't know about

986
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
because I haven't read enough guardians of the galaxy comics

987
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I've only seen the movie

988
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
something that sets some kind of precedence

989
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
for why he would be down to clown

990
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
with this insane fascist

991
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
ideology of arresting people

992
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
for future crimes which seems to go

993
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
against like the very basis

994
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
of the character I don't know

995
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
but personally I don't fucking buy it

996
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
imagine the movies

997
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
trying to get away with this shit

998
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
like turning all of these beloved characters

999
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and superheroes

1000
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
into a bunch of bumbling fascists

1001
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
as though the audience

1002
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
is still somehow supposed to find

1003
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
these characters likeable

1004
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
like imagine that this is guardians of the galaxy

1005
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
2 star lord is going around

1006
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
with Captain Marvel busting into people's

1007
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
houses and arresting them

1008
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
for future crimes

1009
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
try and put a Jackson 5 soundtrack to that shit

1010
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
see how fucking heartwarming it is

1011
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
a fucking montage

1012
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
of star lord breaking into people's

1013
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
houses and swatting people

1014
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
A B C

1015
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
it's as easy as 1 2 3

1016
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
as Batista's power bombing

1017
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
your fucking grandma through a coffee table

1018
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
because she might

1019
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
shoplift at some point in the future

1020
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
she might be at the

1021
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
she might be at the self checkout

1022
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and forget to pay for an apple

1023
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
so we

1024
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
gotta fucking Groot Stomp that bitch

1025
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
in the spine

1026
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
grandma can't get away with it again

1027
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
this is a job for the guardians

1028
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
of the galaxy

1029
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
candy girl

1030
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
you are my world

1031
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
god every fucking Jackson 5 song

1032
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
is the same

1033
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I'm just picturing this movie now

1034
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
of just nonstop

1035
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
horrible brutal

1036
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
fascist violence

1037
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
it's all in black and white like Schindler's

1038
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
list but still set to the

1039
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
soundtrack of the first movie

1040
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I

1041
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
hooked on a feeling

1042
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
it's just like a slow motion

1043
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
nightmare of the guardians

1044
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
of the galaxy busting into a

1045
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
kindergarten class and shooting up

1046
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
the place because they got a vision

1047
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
that one of the kids might push

1048
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
another one of the kids off a swing set

1049
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
at the playground so the guardians of the galaxy

1050
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
are bursting into a kindergarten classroom

1051
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and just shooting up the place

1052
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you know the hot kindly teacher

1053
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
in her early 20s rocket raccoon

1054
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
puts a fucking bullet in her head

1055
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Drax is Batista bombing

1056
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
kids all these kids are getting

1057
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
mangled and crippled and killed

1058
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
massive bloodshed

1059
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
and once again

1060
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
the day is saved

1061
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
thanks to the guardians of the galaxy

1062
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
fuck this comic

1063
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
okay

1064
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
god damn

1065
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I think that's enough Civil War 2

1066
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
talk

1067
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Christ this podcast is going long

1068
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I definitely do not

1069
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
intend for every panel cast

1070
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
to go this long

1071
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
because Jesus it's been fucking two days

1072
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I've been recording this now

1073
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
what's next

1074
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I still have a couple more comics I want to get to

1075
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
that were cool this week

1076
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
fucking uh okay

1077
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
so the next

1078
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
comic that I read this week

1079
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm fucking sliding all over the place in this fucking chair

1080
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
why do they make chairs

1081
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
with wheels on them what is the point of this

1082
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
fuck

1083
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Jesus

1084
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
oh lord help me Jesus I'm

1085
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
tipping over I'm tipping

1086
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
come on

1087
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
fuck it

1088
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
okay

1089
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
ugh

1090
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
and I wonder why these things go long

1091
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
okay the next comic that I read

1092
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
was Miss Marvel

1093
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Miss Marvel

1094
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
number 12

1095
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and um this was actually

1096
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
this was a good comic

1097
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
this was a nice little

1098
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
heartwarming a good

1099
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
decent little kind of one shot

1100
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
in the midst of this

1101
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
you know epic retardation

1102
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
of Civil War 2

1103
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
that is sort of fucking up

1104
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
every other comic on the stands

1105
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
in the midst of all that there is

1106
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
still room for

1107
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
little character stories having to do with it

1108
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
uh you know branching out

1109
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
from this conflict that

1110
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
in and of themselves

1111
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
are decent

1112
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
so uh Miss Marvel

1113
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
this character is another

1114
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
relatively new character

1115
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
she's only been around for a couple of years

1116
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
um Kamala Khan

1117
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
was a little

1118
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Pakistani teenager living in New Jersey

1119
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and she got superpowers

1120
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
and her hero was Miss Marvel

1121
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
and she idolized all the superheroes

1122
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
but particularly

1123
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Captain Marvel

1124
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
so Captain Marvel said you can call yourself

1125
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Miss Marvel I can I'll give you the name

1126
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
she she earned the name

1127
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Miss Marvel and so

1128
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
her role in the Marvel Universe

1129
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
is sort of like the forefront

1130
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
of the next generation of superheroes

1131
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
even though the problem with that

1132
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
is that the next generation of superheroes

1133
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
will never be

1134
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
the current generation of superheroes

1135
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
so they're kind of an eternally

1136
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
unfulfilled promise because of the way

1137
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
the comics are you know

1138
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Spider-Man and Iron Man and Captain America

1139
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and the main guard they're always going to be around

1140
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
so when you have characters like this whose

1141
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
purpose is that they're the younger generation

1142
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
of superheroes

1143
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
it's kind of an inherently

1144
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
unfulfilling idea because

1145
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
it's never really going to come to fruition

1146
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
no matter how much time passes

1147
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
they're always going to be

1148
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
the younger generation of superheroes

1149
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
you know that's how you end up with a teen titan

1150
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
situation where

1151
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
nobody knows what to do with like Beast Boy

1152
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and Raven and Starfire so now it's

1153
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
they've been around for like fuckin 80 years

1154
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
but somehow they're still teenagers

1155
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
because you know they get

1156
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
stuck in that next generation

1157
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
teenager hole

1158
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and not the kind of teenager hole I like

1159
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:34,000
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA

1160
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,340
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA

1161
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,840
Ben, one of the more successful ones, she's one of the few of that type of character that has

1162
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:15,520
succeeded in being her own character and feeling like she has an actual personality and a reason

1163
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:23,360
for being, and she's popular. People like her. Um, her and X-23, who's currently Wolverine,

1164
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:30,720
those are the only two, I think, of the diversity Avengers that have been well-received, that seem

1165
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,880
like they are actual characters with their own stories and their own, you get what I'm saying.

1166
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,960
So the story of Ms. Marvel, number 12, is that this whole Civil War 2 event thing has been going

1167
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,680
on and all of its ramifications are ruining everything. Um, Ms. Marvel has lost faith in

1168
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:57,440
her idol, Captain Marvel, because she sees that Carol is turning into a fascist lunatic with this

1169
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,640
pre-cog shit. So she says, fuck you to Captain Marvel, she strikes out on her own, and also she's

1170
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:08,000
feeling bad and down in the dumps, because her best buddy, whose name I forget, best buddy,

1171
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,680
Buddy Buddieson, is his name, is um, in the hospital, he got hurt in some superhero battle,

1172
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,000
he goes, I don't want to hang out with you, we can't be friends anymore, because I'm sick of

1173
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,200
getting sucked up into your superhero bullshit, or something like that, I don't know, but basically

1174
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:29,200
she's feeling real down in the dumps right now, she's taking her lumps right now, she's

1175
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,520
turned her back on her idol, Captain Marvel, her best friend don't want her no more, she's got nowhere

1176
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,040
to go, she's feeling lost, she's feeling vulnerable, so this issue is sort of like a little one-shot

1177
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:49,840
finding herself issue, she's traveling abroad, she's trying to find the real America in Pakistan,

1178
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:57,360
she's getting on a little plane, and uh, she's going to her ancestral home of Pakistan, all by

1179
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,640
herself, she's going to spend a few weeks hanging out with her grandma, and her extended family,

1180
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,080
and just try to find herself, gotta find the real America man, you know that's the problem with all

1181
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:13,840
of these event comics, all of these superheroes, you know, the civil wars, the Avengers versus X-Men,

1182
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:20,080
all of these goofy manufactured conflicts, it just comes off like all of these superheroes and

1183
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:26,560
beloved characters have forgotten the face of their fathers and lost sight of the real America,

1184
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:32,560
and I want it back, we gotta bring the real America back to comics, that's my platform, that's what

1185
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:38,400
I'm running on when I run for president in a decade or so, or a couple decades, when I'm old enough,

1186
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:45,200
when I'm fucking 89 years old, that seems to be the minimum age for a presidential candidate in

1187
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:52,080
this country, make comics great again, find the real America, put it back in my comics, so Kamala's

1188
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,880
going through the airport, she's having a shitty time, you know, she's getting hassled by airport

1189
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,800
security, she's looking all glum, she's looking all sad, she gets to Pakistan, she meets her family,

1190
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:08,800
and it's so, it's so heartwarming, you know, seeing this reunion with all of her extended

1191
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,960
relatives and stuff, I mean, we the reader, we've never seen these characters before, we don't know

1192
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:20,000
these characters, we're being introduced to them, but it effectively feels like a sort of homecoming,

1193
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,800
like, oh I haven't been in Pakistan since I was a little girl and I'm back and I'm with my grandma,

1194
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:30,560
my abuela, that's a Pakistani word right, abuela, and it's a really great little character story,

1195
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,160
because as she's hanging out here in Pakistan and she's trying to get her head straight and

1196
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,920
ruminating on all of this, you know, tragic stuff that's been happening around her with all the

1197
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,720
superheroes in America fighting each other, it's really going into, like, her character and her

1198
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,840
personality and her unique little struggles, and she talks a little bit about, like, when she's

1199
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:55,760
conviting with her abuela and she says, in New Jersey, I always feel like I'm a foreigner,

1200
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,960
but here in Pakistan, I feel like I'm too American, so she's got that whole, you know,

1201
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:07,360
ethnic American, caught between two worlds thing, you know, I can sympathize because I myself have

1202
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:14,080
always felt caught between two worlds because of my ethnicity, I'm half Irish and half French

1203
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:19,920
Canadian, so part of me just wants to feel white, but the other part of me just wants to feel really

1204
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,880
white, and I feel like I don't belong anywhere, if only I had some of that minority privilege,

1205
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:34,480
that the blacks are always lording over me, oh, look at me, I'm black, I feel like I belong to

1206
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:40,640
a community, you don't know how good you have it, we whites are alone, damn it, we're cast into the

1207
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:48,400
world, derelict, and without a place to truly call our own, there's no white superheroes anymore,

1208
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:55,280
there's no representation for my people, there's nowhere for us in today's America,

1209
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,680
and that's why we gotta find the real America, that's why we gotta make a great

1210
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,600
again, that's why I'm voting for Trump, okay, the next comic I read, oh Jesus,

1211
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:12,160
I just ate, I took another break and I ate a shitload of ramen, I ate so much fucking ramen,

1212
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,720
the most ramen that's ever been put into a growing boy in the history of the world,

1213
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,920
oh god, let me lay down, I need to lay down on the couch, oh Jesus,

1214
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:40,000
oh, I just, I recently discovered that my microphone, the cord on my microphone is long

1215
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:49,280
enough that it can reach to my couch and also my mattress, so this is gonna change my fucking life,

1216
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,800
people, this, I can already tell, this is a revolution in podcasting technology right here,

1217
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,720
you know, I'm sorry, I can't bring the pop filter over here, so there might be a little bit of,

1218
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:08,160
you know, that going on, but aside from that, this feels, this feels good, I could definitely

1219
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:19,200
get used to this, oh god, oh there's so much fucking ramen in me, oh, okay,

1220
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,280
just a second, let me fucking get my brain back,

1221
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:34,240
it is recording right, that's the one bad part, I can't see if it's actually recording or not,

1222
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,640
so everything that I'm saying, I mean, I can't see the computer from here, so for all I know,

1223
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,520
for all I know that I could just be talking to a microphone that's not even,

1224
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,800
that's not even on right now,

1225
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,360
what is going on outside, I hear thunder and lightning and motorcycles or some shit,

1226
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:01,040
god damn, the wind is howling out there like fucking sleepy hollow, it sounds like the,

1227
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:06,960
the sounds of the planet screaming in Final Fantasy VII, I swear to god, I can hear that exact sound

1228
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:27,600
effect outside my window, okay, so next up is my comic of the week, the best comic of all the

1229
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:36,400
comics that came out this week, it is, none other than, I'm gonna make a drum roll with my feet on

1230
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:44,560
the coffee table over here, this is my drum roll, the comic of the week, this is a bad drum roll,

1231
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:59,120
the vision number 12, yes, the final issue of what has been a momentous run, a story for the ages,

1232
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:09,120
a tour de force, a legend, a saga on par with some of the greats, this has been like consistently the

1233
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:15,280
most impressive comic coming out recently and it just finally had its last issue, the story has

1234
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:22,400
been wrapped up and what a story it has been, so if you don't know who the vision is, the vision is

1235
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:29,920
the data of the Marvel universe, he's a robot man who wishes that he could be more like a man man,

1236
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:40,000
he is the Avengers resident robot dude, he was created by Ultron, oh my god, I'm gonna shit my

1237
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:49,360
pants, oh my god, I'm gonna have a baby, a shit baby, oh, so the villain of the second Avengers

1238
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:56,080
movie, Ultron, the big scary robot guy, in the movie he was created by Tony Stark, but in the comics,

1239
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:03,040
Ultron was created by Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, one of the founding members of the Avengers,

1240
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:10,000
Hank Pym was in the Ant-Man movie, but he was not Ant-Man, Scott Lang was the Ant-Man in the

1241
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,480
Ant-Man movie because he's the current Ant-Man, the Paul Rudd character was like an apprentice of

1242
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,680
Hank Pym in the movies, there's little tiny differences in the movies in the comics, but you

1243
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:22,160
know you can wrap your head around them if you really make an effort to, if you read the shit,

1244
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:28,720
I don't know if I can, but so Ultron was created by Hank Pym, he was like the first like real

1245
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:37,760
artificial intelligence, but Ultron turned out to be a fucking asshole, he was he was a petulant

1246
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:44,800
entitled bastard, he wanted to destroy the Avengers, destroy the world, he was a villain,

1247
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:52,240
he fought the Avengers a million times, eventually Ultron made a robot of his own,

1248
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:59,440
this robot would go on to become the vision, and so in an ironic twist of fate, Hank Pym creates

1249
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,200
Ultron who turns out to be evil, then Ultron creates the vision to further his evil agenda,

1250
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:11,680
but the vision turns out to be good, and the vision joins the Avengers and becomes a superhero,

1251
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:16,800
one of the most beloved members of the Avengers and saved the world 37 times over his career as a

1252
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:22,240
superhero, as he often reiterates throughout this series, I am the vision of the Avengers, I have

1253
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:32,560
saved the world 37 times, 37 in a row, the vision is not totally a robot, he's not technically an

1254
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:40,640
android, he is what's called a synthesoid in the Marvel universe, so I think he's a you know

1255
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,320
kind of an android, but he does have some human characteristics, you know his skin is that sort

1256
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:54,640
of metallic pink color, but it is skin, um he does presumably have a penis, I'm guessing, I mean he

1257
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:00,160
was married, he was married to the Scarlet Witch for a number of years, and they did have children,

1258
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:09,040
so I'm assuming he's got a dick, fucking robot dick, fucking android dong, give Wanda some of that

1259
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:23,360
swinging android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android

1260
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:33,520
dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android

1261
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:45,680
dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android

1262
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:55,680
dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android

1263
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:15,840
dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android

1264
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:22,640
dong. Synthesoid winner, he's more like a sexazoid is what he is, he he goes all night, he makes the

1265
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:28,100
He makes the ladies scream!

1266
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,000
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh

1267
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,720
So that's who the vision is and what he's about, basically.

1268
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:40,560
He's a peace-loving, philosophical, you know, compassionate, stoic robot guy with an Android

1269
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,060
DONG!

1270
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:47,640
Personally, the character has never connected with me that well, because, you know, it's

1271
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,160
hard as a reader not to just see him as a robot.

1272
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:57,240
I think the movie did a good job of stressing how human he is, but up until that point, you

1273
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:03,440
know, it's very easy to play the old Avengers game on Sega Genesis or to see him in a comic

1274
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,640
and just go, well, yeah, I know Captain America and Iron Man, but who's this, uh, he's just

1275
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
a robot guy, right?

1276
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
I don't get it.

1277
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,780
Like, well, it's very easy to not understand the character vision, and I didn't really

1278
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,440
understand the character of the vision for a long time.

1279
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:21,240
I mean, like I said, he's basically just the Marvel Universe's version of data, but

1280
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,160
there's already a data in my mind, so there wasn't really enough room to love another

1281
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,800
android character, I guess.

1282
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,800
It's already full.

1283
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,800
I've got data up there.

1284
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,200
I've got Android 18.

1285
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,200
She's a babe.

1286
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,800
And I think what it really comes down to, the reason why the vision never impressed

1287
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:44,560
me in the past, is because he just never had his own series that was good or interesting.

1288
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,560
He never had any.

1289
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:50,840
There never seemed to be any interesting stories about the vision.

1290
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,840
He was always just kind of there.

1291
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,640
He always, he's always just the robot guy in the Avengers.

1292
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,760
He never came off like a flawed character before.

1293
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,280
He never came off that three-dimensional.

1294
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,160
He always just came off to me as, you know, he's stoic and he's calm and he is super

1295
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,040
powerful and he's just there.

1296
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,840
My point is I was a fool.

1297
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,400
Like so many before me, I was caught up in my own humanity.

1298
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:25,280
I was so arrogant about humanity, I could not see the pathos of a robot man, blinded

1299
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:32,800
by the outside, judging a book by the cover, judging a synthesoid, not by the content of

1300
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:40,720
his character, but by the, the robots, the parts of him that are robots.

1301
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,720
You, you, whatever.

1302
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,720
Fuck this.

1303
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,840
Abandon this whole joke.

1304
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,120
You get what I'm saying.

1305
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,960
I'm abandoning this bit.

1306
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,080
Get to the fucking point already.

1307
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,920
You're yelling at your fucking computer screen.

1308
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,920
I hear you.

1309
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,920
I hear you.

1310
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:58,000
So, so what this story has been about.

1311
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It's over now.

1312
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
You can read the whole thing.

1313
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,960
It's a self-contained, it's 12 issues.

1314
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,240
It's a, it's an, it's a complete story and it's so goddamn good.

1315
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:13,280
It really feels like this character, if you didn't appreciate or understand the character

1316
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,760
before, read this and you'll have a totally new appreciation for the vision because he

1317
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:26,160
finally has like a defining quintessential story, you know, like it's so easy to point

1318
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:31,720
to Batman and go, if you want to understand Batman, here's the Dark Knight Returns or

1319
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:37,200
here's the killing joke or here's year one or RIP or whatever happened at the Cape Crusader

1320
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:42,800
or if you want to understand Spider-Man, there's Craven's Last Hunt or the death of the Stacey's

1321
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:48,080
or, you know, all these characters as iconic as they are are only iconic because of the

1322
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,520
strength of their stories.

1323
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,160
They've all had those definitive runs.

1324
01:09:52,160 --> 01:10:00,240
Ven is never had one before now and this story feels like a definitive run for the character.

1325
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:05,960
It starts out, the vision has created a family for himself.

1326
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:12,680
Hank Pym created Ultron, Ultron created the vision and now the vision is creating a wife

1327
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,840
and kids in his own image.

1328
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,140
He creates a beautiful vision wife for himself named Virginia.

1329
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,000
He creates a beautiful vision son, Vin.

1330
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,800
He creates a beautiful vision teenage daughter, Viv.

1331
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:32,480
So the vision has created a family for himself in his quest to become more human and live

1332
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:38,480
as a human and understand what it is to live on this planet like the rest of us.

1333
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:44,600
So he creates his cool, synthesoid family and he moves into a house in the suburbs and the

1334
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,260
first issues are just, you know, him and his family, you know, this family of robot people

1335
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:52,860
hanging out in the suburbs, getting into their neighbors and stuff.

1336
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:57,020
So the vision is trying to live with this family in the suburbs and trying to be like

1337
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:05,420
a regular person and of course it doesn't take long for all of it to go tragically awry.

1338
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:10,300
An old supervillain of the Avengers called Grim Reaper attacks the house when vision

1339
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:16,280
is away and so in self-defense his wife Virginia kills the Grim Reaper.

1340
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,280
She murders him.

1341
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,400
He's dead and she doesn't know what to do.

1342
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,440
She's worried that there'll be repercussions or she won't be tried fairly because she's

1343
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,120
a synthesoid or whatever.

1344
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,880
So she hides the body and she's trying to keep the secret and unbeknownst to her, you

1345
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,600
know, a neighbor saw her do it and filmed her doing it.

1346
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,080
So now she's got to confront him and she's got and so anyways long story short, all kinds

1347
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,080
of shit goes wrong.

1348
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:43,980
Just to confront him, another, the neighbor dies, the neighbor's son dies.

1349
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:49,580
Just every worst possible way that this wonderful little life the vision is trying to carve

1350
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:54,920
out for himself could horribly fall apart in the span of like a couple months.

1351
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:01,180
You know, this one unfortunate act of Virginia in self-defense killing the Grim Reaper spirals

1352
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:05,780
out of control and next thing you know there's a dead kid and a dead neighbor and it's like

1353
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:10,960
what the fuck is going on and like the Avengers become suspicious of him.

1354
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:18,120
So they send this guy, Victor Mancha, who is sort of like another like vision, synthesoid

1355
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,840
robot themed hero.

1356
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,440
I think he's like also an Ultron creation.

1357
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,080
So maybe he's like the vision's brother.

1358
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,600
I don't really know much about that character, but he's like a guy with robot parts.

1359
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:33,040
Anyways, they send him to spy on the vision and that goes wrong too.

1360
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,900
So next thing you know, Victor, the Avengers spy who's sent to see what's going on at the

1361
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,020
vision, he accidentally kills the vision's son.

1362
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:45,980
So now we've got a fucking dead supervillain, we've got a dead neighbor, we've got a dead

1363
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:48,980
kid and we've got a dead son.

1364
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:55,700
The vision's beautiful, synthesoid son, Vin, is dead and now Vision is so pissed off.

1365
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,340
He's on a rampage.

1366
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:01,700
He's going to fucking, you know, he's going to beat up the Avengers, he's going to find

1367
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,080
Victor Mancha and his little cell and kill him.

1368
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,680
He's going to commit a murder because he's grieving and he's angry.

1369
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:13,200
The, you know, it says right there, right in the background of this panel cast, even

1370
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,200
an android can cry right in the upper right corner.

1371
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:23,200
Nobody knows the grief and rage of an android and his dog.

1372
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,240
So the vision is just kicking everyone's ass.

1373
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:32,940
He beats up all the Avengers at once and he goes to kill this guy in the fucking cell

1374
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:38,540
to seek vengeance for the death of his son and that's where issue 12 begins.

1375
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:45,460
With the question of will the vision commit this vengeful murder from which there can

1376
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,540
be no going back.

1377
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,060
And you know what?

1378
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:53,900
I'm not even going to spoil it because you got to read it for yourself.

1379
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,280
You need to read it for yourself.

1380
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,280
You need to understand.

1381
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,240
You need to witness this story and all its glory.

1382
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,240
It's so good.

1383
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,400
There's so much pathos.

1384
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,400
It's so fucking well written.

1385
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:11,480
It makes you feel for this character in a way that you never would have thought before

1386
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,440
that you could feel for the vision.

1387
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:18,400
It makes you, it really fucking grabs you and you're like, yes, I understand now vision.

1388
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:23,360
How could I have been so blind to not see how great the vision is?

1389
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,900
This is a story that asks the big questions, folks.

1390
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,980
What is it that really connects us?

1391
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:31,580
What is it that truly makes us human?

1392
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:35,740
What does it mean to be human really?

1393
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:42,780
And it really drives home the point that the vision is more human than he realized for

1394
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:46,060
better or for worse.

1395
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,780
And that's all I'll say about it.

1396
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:50,020
Ain't going to spoil this one.

1397
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,100
You should all read it.

1398
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,620
It's your duty to read it.

1399
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,200
It's your sworn duty, all of you.

1400
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,320
I'm giving you a fucking homework assignment.

1401
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,240
Everyone has to read the vision.

1402
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,560
All 12 issues.

1403
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,800
It's the best fucking comic.

1404
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:08,480
It's the best story that I've seen come out in comics in quite a fucking while, a good

1405
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,360
number of years at least.

1406
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,080
I can definitely say that for sure.

1407
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,400
And it's written so well.

1408
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:22,240
Like the fucking, the narration and the dialogue is so rich and heavy.

1409
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,060
It's not written like a comic book.

1410
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:27,300
It's written like literature.

1411
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:34,300
It really takes itself seriously and it handles the telling of this story with all the gravitas

1412
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,660
that it needs to.

1413
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:37,580
And it's really effective.

1414
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,140
It feels like a hugely important story.

1415
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:43,580
It's so non-comicbook-y.

1416
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:47,100
It doesn't feel like the other Marvel comic books.

1417
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:51,020
It doesn't feel like a typical superhero bullshit.

1418
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:54,480
It's not bogged down by the stupid event comic.

1419
01:15:54,480 --> 01:16:00,000
It has nothing to do with Civil War II or any of that bullshit, you know, that corporately

1420
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:07,360
mandated cross-company horseshit that infects every fucking comic with these retarded continuity

1421
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,960
politics.

1422
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,400
It's self-contained.

1423
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,440
It's not out of continuity.

1424
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,720
But it's also not bogged down by the current stuff that's going on.

1425
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:21,340
But it definitely is nothing like any of the other superhero comics that you're going

1426
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,020
to read right now.

1427
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:28,780
It's not a fucking story about, oh there's a bad guy and we're going to go fight him

1428
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:33,420
and punch him in the nose and that's how we'll defeat the bad guy.

1429
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,860
It's a totally different kind of story.

1430
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:41,820
It's just like this character-driven, suspenseful thriller.

1431
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:48,560
And it's so down to earth and human for a story about a fucking Synthesoid with a robot

1432
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,560
dick.

1433
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,060
Oh god, it's so good.

1434
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,200
Oh, it's the best thing I've ever read in my fucking life.

1435
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,320
Oh god.

1436
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,440
I think laying on this couch is messing my head up.

1437
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,160
I need to get back to the fucking computer.

1438
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,160
Ah, shit.

1439
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,480
Oh fuck.

1440
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:14,340
Anyways, I hope that I've sufficiently sold you all on that without spoiling the last

1441
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,340
issue.

1442
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:20,580
You know, it's a 10 out of 10 baby, it's the kind of thing you read it and once you're

1443
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,980
done reading it you're like, yeah, that's why I like comics right there baby.

1444
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,380
That's what it's all about.

1445
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:32,540
You know, you take a character like the Vision who is like this weird sea-list Avenger in

1446
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,840
a lot of people's eyes.

1447
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:40,200
You know, this unrelatable sort of robot guy who's always just there as part of the team

1448
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,200
but nobody really cares about him.

1449
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:48,360
You take a character like that and you take your time telling a story about him that like

1450
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:55,760
delves into what really makes him tick and sort of touches on these very human things

1451
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,040
that everyone can relate to.

1452
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:03,900
You know, stuff like family and loss and grief and rage and you take this character that

1453
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:11,880
nobody suspected could have this kind of pathos and you imbue it, you imbue this captivating

1454
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:17,900
complex characterization into this character that maybe he had all along it just took the

1455
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:24,300
right writer to show us what a great character the Vision could truly be.

1456
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:27,280
Vision number 12 people, comic of the week.

1457
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,880
Everybody go out and find Vision number one, go to the fucking comic readers, I'll link

1458
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,920
them in the description box.

1459
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,320
Star with Vision number one, read the whole damn series.

1460
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,080
That's your fucking homework for this week.

1461
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:44,240
Everybody go enrich your lives with this piece of fucking literature that ought to be studied

1462
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,640
in schools for the rest of time.

1463
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,240
This modern masterpiece.

1464
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:59,820
Okay, so, I've talked about a lot of comics this week, some good, some bad, some fantastic,

1465
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:06,860
but there's one more comic that I wanted to talk about this week, one more comic that

1466
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:16,260
came out that I think is worth a mention and that comic is...

1467
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:25,920
Your fucking wolf cop number one, baby, I told you on the motherfucking wolf man, baby.

1468
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:38,960
Everybody forgot about the wolf man, but the wolf man is here to stay, yeah, let me tell

1469
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,480
you people about the wolf cop.

1470
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:46,460
If you've been following the Ramelama Ding Dong on my Patreon feed, then you've probably

1471
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:50,100
seen the wolf man talking about the wolf cop.

1472
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:54,380
You've seen me praising the movie, you've seen me doing a review of the movie on my

1473
01:19:54,380 --> 01:20:00,020
Patreon and what a fantastical little piece of happenstance right here, that the week

1474
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:06,100
I happen to see the wolf cop movie, there just happens to be a wolf cop comic coming

1475
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:10,460
out to continue to franchise on this very eve.

1476
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:16,120
That's what I call serendipity, baby, that's what I call a Ramelama Ding Dong.

1477
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:20,200
Now in case you don't know, in case you ain't seen the movie, in case you ain't seen the

1478
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:27,080
light yet, in case you ain't one of the chosen few enlightened individuals who know the saga

1479
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:31,080
of the wolf cop, in case you do not know, I will inform you.

1480
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:36,120
The wolf cop is the wolf man alter ego of Officer Lou Garoo.

1481
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:42,180
He is a small town cop in a spooky town, he gotta fight shapeshifting witches and warlocks

1482
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:48,420
all day every day, but luckily he happens to have the power of the wolf man on his side

1483
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:53,500
and when that full moon rises high into the sky, you know it's about to get hairy up in

1484
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,820
here, awoo!

1485
01:20:55,820 --> 01:21:01,700
The man turns into the wolf man and the wolf man turns, I said the wolf man turns into

1486
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,580
the wolf cop daddy.

1487
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:09,520
The wolf cop he kills people, he cuts their faces off with claws, he rips them into shreds,

1488
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:14,520
he rips the entrails on, he feasts on the corpses, he takes his police cruiser and it

1489
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,960
modifies it into a bad ass spooky wolf cop mobile.

1490
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:23,640
And he goes out into the city and he solves crimes and he brutally viciously murders

1491
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:30,280
criminals left and right, and he drinks like a fish, and he smokes cigarettes, and he fucks

1492
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,880
beautiful women.

1493
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:38,260
The wolf cop is a Trump supporter, he grabs the girl is by the pussy, cuz he's the motherfucking

1494
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:44,660
wolf cop, and the wolf cop don't take no for an answer daddy, oh no, woo!

1495
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:50,260
The wolf cop is a rapist, aw hell yeah, ah!

1496
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:56,620
So wolf cop the comic issue number one, it opens up presumably after the movie, wolf cop

1497
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:02,880
is driving around the road in his police cruiser wolf cop mobile with his best buddy.

1498
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,400
Now right off the bat this part confused me a little bit because I gotta spoil the movie

1499
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:12,960
for you right here, I gotta give a little spoiler right here, and I'm giving you a fair warning

1500
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,440
because wolf cop is a masterpiece of film that everybody should see ten times and commit

1501
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,600
to memory.

1502
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:25,120
Every single frame of that masterpiece should be burned in your memory for all time baby,

1503
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,780
but in case you haven't seen it I'm warning you right now, I gotta spoil the end of the

1504
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:33,860
movie just a little bit to tell you what confused me about issue one of this comic, okay, so

1505
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:41,260
at the end of the movie it is revealed that wolf cop's best buddy is actually a shape

1506
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:46,220
shifting lizard man, and he was one of the bad guys, and wolf cop had to kill him.

1507
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:50,940
That was a twist in the movie, a movie takes twists and turns that you don't always know

1508
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,740
about going into it baby.

1509
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:57,880
But I gotta admit if there was one flaw with the wolf cop feature film it was that I was

1510
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:03,240
a little disappointed that his buddy turned out to be a lizard man who had to be killed

1511
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:07,800
because the buddy and the wolf cop they had a wonderful chemistry together that really

1512
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:13,040
made the film something special, their scenes together were funny and charming and wonderful

1513
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,040
to watch.

1514
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:19,000
So I was a little bit disappointed that it turned out to be a bad guy in the end, but

1515
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,740
anyways wolf cop the comic issue number one it opens up and wolf cop is driving around

1516
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:28,500
in his wolf cop mobile and there's his man right there.

1517
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:33,140
So I gotta wonder man cause this don't make no sense something here don't add up.

1518
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:38,380
How can he be there, how can there still be buddies, how can he still be alive when he

1519
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:42,940
was a lizard man at the end of the movie wolf cop had to kill him last time.

1520
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:47,980
They did not explain how he is somehow back from the dead and somehow they are unspeaking

1521
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,320
terms again.

1522
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:54,560
Don't get me wrong I am glad that he is back from the dead and they are buddies again.

1523
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,440
It warms my heart to see because they have a good chemistry.

1524
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,200
They got a buddy chemistry.

1525
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,760
I like a buddy movie.

1526
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,120
I like a road trip buddy movie.

1527
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,200
I like a road trip buddy wolf cop movie.

1528
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:13,200
I am not complaining but I do hope that at some point over the course of this comic book

1529
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:20,140
series they do explain how this boy came back from the dead and why wolf cop in his

1530
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:24,740
infinite wisdom chose to forgive him for his vile betrayal.

1531
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:29,740
The wolf man is turning into the Babadook spook a little bit.

1532
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:35,780
Sometimes the characters bleed into the other characters and I turn into Captain Barbosa

1533
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:36,780
now.

1534
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:41,820
All the characters they all start from the same voice and they branch out Miss Turner

1535
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:45,000
and sometimes it gets a little confusing.

1536
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,320
You best start believing in stupid podcasts Miss Turner.

1537
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,560
You're in one.

1538
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,520
But anyways back to the wolf man baby.

1539
01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:00,120
Now this is just issue one so I can forgive him for a lack of exposition.

1540
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:04,400
Clearly they wanted to get right into the nitty gritty and right into the meat of the story

1541
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,840
with an action packed first issue.

1542
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,900
No time to sit around a diner table and talk about what led to these events.

1543
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:18,820
I understand that but I do hope at some point they explain this glaring plot hole baby.

1544
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,900
I'm the fucking wolf man.

1545
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:27,620
Anyways the issue starts and he with his buddy going on a road trip into wolf cop cruiser

1546
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:32,140
and he going down a road and suddenly a gang of bikers they come up and they're looking

1547
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,380
for a scramble.

1548
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:34,900
They're looking for a tussle.

1549
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,540
They're looking for a rumble.

1550
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,520
They're looking for a fight.

1551
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:43,640
But of course they picked the wrong time daddy because once that moon gets up in the sky

1552
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,480
you turn into a motherfucking wolf man.

1553
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,720
And that wolf man ain't just a wolf man.

1554
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:54,400
I've been telling you this whole time he is a wolf cop daddy.

1555
01:25:54,400 --> 01:26:03,760
He got a gun, he got a police car, he got boots and a shirt, he got a badge, he got

1556
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:10,140
a bad attitude and he got a lot, a lot of whiskey to drink, he gonna drink all the booze

1557
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:13,580
you got and he gonna do it with all the ladies too.

1558
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:16,940
He drinking beer and his smoking cigarettes.

1559
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:18,420
Do he like to party?

1560
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:20,660
The answer is a yes.

1561
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:23,860
Now I'm the crazy taxi guy.

1562
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:27,100
It's time to pick a car and driver.

1563
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,460
Wolf cop are you ready?

1564
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,060
Here we go.

1565
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,180
It's time to check out how you did the day.

1566
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:37,480
Now let's take a look at class D lessons.

1567
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,640
I can't believe it.

1568
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,120
Is that your best come back and try again?

1569
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:45,280
But anyway let me tell you what I was telling you before I was interrupted by the crazy

1570
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,280
taxi man.

1571
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,120
I was trying to tell you about the adventures of wolf cop baby.

1572
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:55,000
Wolf cop he come and he fights him and then he takes those bikers back to where they came

1573
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,320
from and it turns out they're working for a scary cannibal man and the cannibal man is

1574
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:05,420
eating people so wolf cop got to fight the cannibal man now but it turns out he ain't

1575
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:09,340
just no normal man he got a secret of his own.

1576
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:13,180
The cannibal man turn into a giant were pig.

1577
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:20,300
I said a were pig man and let me tell you this were pig is even bigger and scarier than

1578
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,300
the wolf cop.

1579
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:29,740
How can wolf cop defeat an enemy as big and vicious and large and in charge as the cannibal

1580
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,760
were pig.

1581
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:37,200
Quite easily it turns out wolf cop kicks the crap out of the were pig it kills him dead

1582
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:41,360
real easy it only takes like one or two pages man.

1583
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:47,360
So then after wolf cop killed a were pig that unsaved all the damsels in distress they open

1584
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:52,360
the door and they save all the pretty girls and they run off to be somewhere better and

1585
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:57,600
wolf cop he's a little bit banged up but he gonna be okay ain't nobody tougher or

1586
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:02,060
meaner than the wolf cop and his buddy come up and he say we did it now let's get the

1587
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:08,820
fuck out of here what we gonna do now wolf cop and wolf cop says drink and the buddy

1588
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:16,020
give him a thumbs up he said god damn right buddy and that's the end of issue number one

1589
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:22,000
of the motherfucking wolf cop and I am the wolf man daddy

1590
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:22,120
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
