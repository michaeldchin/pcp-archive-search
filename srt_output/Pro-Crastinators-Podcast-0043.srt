00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This one goes out to my mortal deity, Sans the Skeleton, my favorite ghetto spiritualist and sewer priest, Endless Jess, and my dad. Please forgive me, sensei.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Just sitting here on my bed, cleaning out my botflies, and making them dead. It doesn't matter though, they'll be back on the attack in like three fucking seconds.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Cause I have botflies over my house, and in my bed, and in my head, and in my brain, and my pants are fiddle with them. I really like Ulysses as Grant.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Killed the blacks and the gays, not cause they're bad, and they're okay. I just want to make everyone skeletons like my god Sans. That's my mission, you see.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Haha, alright, bitch. Gonna spread over to my Mexicans house, friend's house, and stuff burritos down my lemon pipe. Real spicy too. Gonna torture my dick daily and nightly. Whoops, oh fuck.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Disneyland police guard people are here, and they found my bathroom rap studio. Oh god, when I get nervous, I shit them on soon. Relicosa tattoo is my favorite video game.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I have a tattoo of Sans the Skeleton on my actual literal butthole. Like, directly on it, bruh.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She's like, oh fuck, they're trying to forcibly rape me, am I rape me? I mean, I mean, we're dude, they're sorry, man.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000

24
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:29,780

25
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,020
the PCP how did you get them how did how did this come to pass I've been

26
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,780
watching for a while it's quite my favorite podcast actually

27
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:50,980
oh why that was my first question too well he doesn't have to answer that if

28
00:02:50,980 --> 00:03:00,100
he doesn't want to actually yes it's which one of us did you find first and

29
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:07,420
that's probably did you bro actually cuz I watch the sword art sucks and then I

30
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,260
watched some more but then I forgot about did she and then later I discovered

31
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:19,420
chess and I I watched all of that and it was brilliant yes your secrets are not

32
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:29,380
safe they're all exposed and I found all of the rest and and so I was I was it's

33
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,620
it's well I think I was surprised just because I mean you know I I'm familiar

34
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,980
with your work and you've you've been involved in like you know the fucking

35
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,860
highly successful binding of Isaac so to me I mean you're like a you're like a

36
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,180
you're like a seasoned industry industry fucking professional guy and so like for

37
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,540
you to be watching our our our rinky-dink little shit you know us all like us all

38
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,980
struggling barely barely known artists over here you know we're fine the thought

39
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,460
of anyone watching my channel of anyone being a fan of me is this the

40
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,900
it's my worst nightmare really one of the one day I'm gonna go back in time and

41
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,620
I'm gonna erase my channel from the picture like Marty McFly that's my goal

42
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,220
as a youtuber that we all look forward to that day but so our topic in general is

43
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,860
gonna be indie games but really it's just an excuse to talk about Florian and

44
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,860
his work and I'm really curious about his experience in the industry because

45
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,220
he's very much an indie guy and he's made a bunch of cool shit over the years I

46
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,420
don't know about you guys but as soon as I heard he was gonna be on I I move

47
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,620
my ass straight on over to comics games dot com and checked out all the shit he's

48
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,500
made over the years and I was pretty great embedded right on the website is

49
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,420
Binding of Isaac and you can just fucking play for free fuck paying for it right

50
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,420
but the demo version right yeah that's probably one of the reasons I got so

51
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,540
successful is because there's a free demo that everyone can play on the

52
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,740
internet on the new grounds I didn't play the demo on new grounds before I

53
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,420
ever yeah I played the demo on new grounds I honestly didn't like the demo

54
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,020
because it was pretty limited but then like when I saw the real game and I saw

55
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:17,860
all the shit that's like in it I all the literal shit that's it you know I was

56
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,780
I was really big into into roguelikes at the time and like I was playing I was

57
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,780
deep deep in the well of dungeon crawl stone soup at that time of my life was

58
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,540
that before you played Isaac I thought it was afterward oh no I definitely was I

59
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,380
was I was playing stone before I found Isaac but yeah and I saw Isaac and so I

60
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,700
had to fucking jump on it yes and well let's just go and by the way I should

61
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,600
I should just say that I have definitely played probably hundreds of hours of

62
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,900
Isaac I feel safe and saying that about myself too were you saying give I was

63
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,100
just gonna say like I think everyone here has played Binding of Isaac at least

64
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,540
the first one I never really got into it so I won't really have like you know

65
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,260
questions about it but I do understand it's pretty great like I've seen people

66
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,700
have a lot of fun with it and I do like roguelikes in general it's just like one

67
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,220
of the biggest things about it is that I like watching people play it wanted

68
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,380
playing it myself almost because I can see them get trolled by my game and it's

69
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:23,460
glorious yeah dude I was watching on I was watching on your channel which

70
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,940
game squid on YouTube and I was watching a game you were doing with some guy I

71
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,600
don't know a friend of yours who was in a couple of the videos and he did this

72
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,300
this amazing run as it wasn't like it was a new character I had never seen

73
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,540
before because I haven't kept up with every single update but it's like the

74
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,620
last one you unlock it's like this weird devil angel baby thing and like just get

75
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,940
all the fucking power-ups he got I mean it was such an unbelievable beast just

76
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,700
demolishing that game completely it's so satisfying I had played a bunch of

77
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,620
rounds just to get myself back into it so I'd remember what playing the fucking

78
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,220
game was like and I fucked up real bad but it's so glorious to watch people get

79
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,300
those like runaway successful runs and he got all the way to like this new area

80
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,540
called the void that I'd never seen before and beat this guy I don't know

81
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,500
some big white motherfucker who was like the new final double triple boss

82
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,700
oh it's so great I love that kind of shit that's funny why is it such a great

83
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,620
game yeah I I'd never heard of the void either I was playing it back in back in

84
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,860
back in the rat like the early wrath of the lamb yeah that's the very newest DLC

85
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,500
they made for after birth rebirth after birth plus it is called and it has that

86
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,020
stuff in it so that's right yeah so I let me let me let me complain let me

87
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,660
complain about the new about the remakes about about rebirth oh and this was a

88
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,500
big reason we wanted Ben here so we could complain about the new one that

89
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,060
flooring is not involved with just talk about how much he loves the original well

90
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,220
too well I do I want to hear about it I do fucking love the original I mean I

91
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,300
mean game I have played a little bit of rebirth and like gameplay wise it seems

92
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,500
pretty much the same which is fine you know there's a lot more shit in there

93
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,860
which is always cool but like all right there's a bunch of things that really

94
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,980
pissed me off which is the the pixel aesthetic I don't get I don't get why

95
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,980
it was done I really liked you know Edmunds original like hand-drawn wobbly

96
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,620
thing I thought it fit the game the tone of the game way better and the the

97
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,420
fucking cutscenes look like ass in the new look like ass they look like they

98
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,660
look like ass and not even in a way they make sense like not only do they look

99
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,460
worse than the original cutscenes in the original version they also they look

100
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:42,660
worse in a way that fits the new visual style even less yeah it's it's it's

101
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:49,260
really dumb they feel a very outsourced to me like they feel separate from the

102
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,140
rest of the game almost because they're that I don't know they're just

103
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,100
unpleasant in their difference in aesthetics from every other thing about

104
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,700
Isaac I mean I got I got really close to getting Platinum God once and then my

105
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,700
save got erased or I sweet I got a new computer yeah yeah and so then I got the

106
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,500
game again in wrath of the lamb and got really close to getting Platinum God

107
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,540
again but then my save got erased again and so by that time I was like you know

108
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:21,260
what I think I think I'm done with Isaac and so no don't be done with Isaac

109
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,860
rebirth rebirth was out right after that and I didn't I didn't pick up rebirth

110
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,940
because at the time I was like yeah I tried to get back into rebirth as well

111
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,380
when it came out just because you know all the new content but I also just felt

112
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,740
I had I had reached the depths of what I was getting out of Isaac in terms of

113
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,180
you know I was so frustrated getting screwed out of Platinum God twice but

114
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,780
again I want to reiterate though I love this game and played it for literally

115
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,780
hundreds if not thousands of hours for an entire year to a very important

116
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:57,900
question for Florian do you still make money off of rebirth somehow did you get

117
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:04,860
did I cut off a little bit did get off sorry oh yeah we talk about money too

118
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,820
much that would just just wouldn't be good I think so oh that's half of my

119
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:17,780
questions I what about just in general okay do you have any is that what you

120
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,220
wanted to ask oh no no I mean I'm not curious about that at all I'm just

121
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,740
wondering if you saw like penny one from after birth at all since you were such a

122
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,340
major component of making the damn thing is that is that something you're

123
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,580
okay to talk about just a little bit I get a little money don't worry about me

124
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,460
great okay that was another one thing I wanted to know I mean I mean it just

125
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,980
stands to reason because like you fucking don't built the original thing it

126
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,580
would be pretty fucked up if you were just like well I don't that's that's why

127
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,900
I wanted to know that's exactly why I wanted to know because it would be fucked

128
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,100
up if he was cut off so I had to know if he was you know I don't be possible to

129
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,780
just cut me off right there but yeah well I'm imagining I'm imagining like

130
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,180
some like you know fucking Gabe Newell comes in and like you know big in a big

131
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,340
yeah in a big like shoulder padded suit smoking a cigar and says we're buying you

132
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:18,340
out Florian we brought a dump truck of money to the front of your house and

133
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,500
we're gonna fucking cave your house and it's gonna be a night it's gonna be a

134
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,660
truly ironic death it's just like when my friend sold for a million for a

135
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,980
billion dollars to two billion dollars I was a billion yeah Jesus because it's

136
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,860
like it's like a minecraft is like a platform in itself that people use for

137
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,660
all kinds of bullshit I've just heard enough industry horror stories that I

138
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,420
wanted to be sure that we're not a you know like that that talk well I guess

139
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,420
the fact that you're so willing to talk about Isaac would would suggest that you

140
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,380
have an amicable relationship with the game still yeah oh yes my greatest

141
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,140
pride or maybe that's great that's I'm so glad that that's that that's the case

142
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,900
the only thing that bothers me is that they made the pics lodges like Ben said

143
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,700
but I still don't I don't get it I don't get why that decision was was it to make

144
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,940
it look like I'm shitting myself was it to make it look more like a video game

145
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:24,420
Isaac character in real life yeah he really is he lives in the basement it's

146
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,820
a nightmare down there it's full of piss and molded mildew and it's a nightmare

147
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,380
for everyone he's he's he's like Isaac is in many ways the true story of my

148
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,740
actual life have you been inspired by Isaac in such a way I like to think Isaac

149
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:47,460
was inspired by Jesse's real life oh no what if we had like a PCP version of Isaac

150
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,140
like a mod with all the guys of us oh you know I played I played an

151
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,180
undertale mod of Isaac once yeah I played a homestuck mod once and it was

152
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,700
neat oh it's totally doable it's totally doable anyways somebody get on that

153
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,020
somebody out there who knows shit Florian you get on it

154
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,340
my precious time

155
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:16,340
we're taking it all we're taking it all baby so anyways Edmund just wanted that

156
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,540
rebirth look different and he didn't want them to trace his art in any way and

157
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,020
he wanted it to be his own art style so he passed them into making this this

158
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,660
pixel art style so he had to actually convince them to do it this way well

159
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:40,580
they gave him a bunch of what I call it like different choices it's like when

160
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,140
someone when you pick out colors for your home it's like it was like that I

161
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,820
suppose so man that okay but he but he just wanted it to look different yes very

162
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,020
different I can sort of understand that I suppose yeah I guess it makes but

163
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,580
reverse is still pretty good it plays well enough unless you record it in

164
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,220
which case it lacks for me it was great I don't know that it's it's really good

165
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,660
for it felt it felt it felt like the old game but expanded which is pretty good

166
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,260
yeah can't it's hard to argue about the the cool new content and that's that's

167
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,100
all very enjoyable I want to ask about like the the initial development of

168
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Isaac because I heard it took like two months like you just hashed that thing

169
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,580
out real quick yeah but about three months it was insane there was so much

170
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,140
development and creativity going on and then we released a completely broken

171
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:37,500
game and then only years later it's it's it's only only only very broken still

172
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,940
but not not unplayably broken so at last perfect that's man that's awesome I

173
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,340
was wondering I really wanted to talk about since I'm a programmer myself

174
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:54,420
definitely not on the level of complexity and stuff you do but all I was

175
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,380
just wondering what a nightmare it was to program all the little things in there

176
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,620
like one thing that I was thinking about was must have been tricky to get the you

177
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,820
know those how bombs when they explode next to a rock they make a little

178
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,180
platform appear you know in that hole yeah was with things like that a

179
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,460
nightmare to make or are you just able to do this kind of stuff easily well back

180
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,100
then it was certainly very hard for me I think I've learned a lot over the the

181
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,100
time now but still haven't released any game were you were you a rookie

182
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,380
developer at the time well not not exactly I started hobby programming when

183
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:39,380
I was 12 because because I was a nerd and and such so get out of here we don't

184
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:45,540
abide those kind of folks around here oh god I made like 20 different small

185
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,260
flash games over the years before Isaac and then I've hardly made any sins

186
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,500
because I finally fulfilled my dream of being able to do nothing all day and not

187
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,740
that's the dream by the way we all speak everyone in this everyone in the

188
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,020
PCP we all need to figure out like how to find something we could do with

189
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,260
residual pay that's what we're that's the golden goose we're all missing out on

190
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,980
clearly is residuals hey I was since we were bringing up your your old games I

191
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,340
wanted to mention a few that I enjoyed from your from your page I played I

192
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,340
don't know if this was the C word but on your page is just cunt which you also

193
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:32,140
made with Edmond that exists loved that game it was art was beautiful and it was

194
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:38,220
simple and fun I have not played it go to comics games calm it's great hang on

195
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,180
hang on did you make oh god I'm gonna be so embarrassed if this is wrong but did

196
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:50,260
you make triachnid I did actually yes I fucking loved triachnid like at least

197
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:57,260
at least five times back there's a game called cunt how can I play it go to

198
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,580
comics magical games comics with a K dash games dot com it's you know what I

199
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,980
heard is when you play the game of cunts you win or you die this is very

200
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,860
correct yes there was another game that I really this is the one I played the

201
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,820
most out of all the ones on your page now that I play every single one but but

202
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,060
seed where you play as a dude wearing a cowboy hat riding a sperm through like

203
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,380
downtown Manhattan as like the army comes out and tries to kill you and

204
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,980
there's this awesome mechanic in there where when you you control yourself with

205
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,180
your I think with oh no you just continually move forward and then use

206
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,660
the arrow keys to like rotate yourself but there's this great thing you can do

207
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,460
with you the tail of the sperm which is when they're shooting missiles at you

208
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,220
which happens constantly if you whip the tail around really fast you can

209
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,420
deflect the missiles away I just thought that was the tightest fucking shit and

210
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,860
that guy that seemed like it was to be really hard to do there must have been

211
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,420
like some state you enter when you move like at a certain speed or you rotate at

212
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,540
a certain speed that like it triggers that effect to happen on missiles when

213
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,300
they hit man that was awesome it was super cool oh man I like that game I

214
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,700
love doing that game there was an animation called sperm rider where it

215
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:19,060
was this very sperm and was that in like like a pencil yes it was just like

216
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:24,780
the game because then I went and contact the artist and I did I convinced him to

217
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,420
make a game or did he convince me but I defy message him first it was so cool

218
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,100
because he made all this pencil drawn art for it and then he could just ride

219
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,620
around on your sperm you know why you're a hero to me for you sweet you're a

220
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,820
hero to me Florian because you've done what I'm increasingly getting into doing

221
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,820
and it's that you you have like a vision for a project and you make it and you

222
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,140
outsource whatever you need to outsource that you don't personally have the

223
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,220
skills to do and it's specifically art for this stuff and you just you don't

224
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,140
let those things get in your way right like a lot of people might give up like

225
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,460
when I made games back in the day it was always a big fucking headache to to

226
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,020
worry about art and I had my sister do it for some she was garbage at the time

227
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:16,700
so it's terrible and a bell bell bell really has an unbelievable fucking

228
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:23,580
background I don't know what I tried to play the cut I tried to play the game of

229
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:32,020
cunts I didn't die he died did a bug crawl up your dick and made you explode I

230
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,460
didn't I don't know what was happening I was it's a beautiful game though everyone

231
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,980
go check it out it looks it looks I highly I highly fucking recommend

232
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,060
triac that I didn't play that one I'm going to it's so it's so great I take it

233
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:53,340
that that because you know Edmund McMillan is rather well known for the

234
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,780
sort of scatological humor of games like Isaac and in all his other games but I

235
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,500
take it that you also have a similar sense of humor even without him around

236
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,780
I made about three games that are that have sperm as a main character

237
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,500
that's more than your average person I'd say yeah

238
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,860
most people round out around one yeah you're ahead of the bell curve there and I

239
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,700
think only one of them I did with Edmund but it might be two I might I might not

240
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,340
remember that right that's great that's awesome it's just it helps me to

241
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,900
understand why you're a fan of the PCP because this is exactly the kind of thing

242
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,820
I'd expect our fans to be making yeah this is a podcast primarily about me

243
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,660
shitting myself hey but I was curious about one while my court of clowns talks

244
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,820
amongst themselves if I'm not totally fucked up in my timeline you're getting

245
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,660
together with Edmund would have been oh wait you know you know I was gonna I was

246
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,620
going to say getting together for Binding of Isaac would have happened

247
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,980
after the runaway success of Super Meat Boy which I mean he was already getting

248
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,940
fairly well known but that was like his big breakout success and I was going to

249
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,060
ask like how did you guys meet but then I realized you had already done games

250
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,060
before that point so my whole question is retarded so never mind yeah that's right

251
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,300
little known fact I've actually been doing stuff with Edmund for a long time

252
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,780
in fact he got me into game development at one point because oh my god I mean not

253
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,100
precisely to game development but he was a mentor for me because I never knew

254
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,620
that you could make money off games I was just a little boy playing around with

255
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,940
little yeah little yeah he was the best kind of mentor that's that teaches you

256
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,220
how to make money oh yeah right such a good man dude he was your column he was

257
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,820
the commoner to your Simone what a beautiful thing he told me I could go

258
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,100
and get a sponsorship for my game and then I I think I got 500 bucks for for

259
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,540
making a little game that was basically a remake of Pac-Man and it was amazing I

260
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,260
assume that's that's Pac over here that's the one I think that's the first

261
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:07,500
one I properly released it plays horribly but I did the art in it at least so

262
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,500
it's all me oh that's beautiful what a wonderful story so I'm so happy to hear

263
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,940
that your relationship with Edmund is still positive I just I didn't know and

264
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:23,100
that's great we started doing podcasts on my channel as well oh really I had no

265
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,300
idea I have to go listen to those he keeps telling me he'll be around but then

266
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,580
he keeps getting busy the last excuse he was he was that he got sick from his

267
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,380
baby so

268
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,540
he's a little baby man speaking speaking of your of your YouTube channel

269
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,660
well I guess I watched I watched it and I saw it and I was just just like I was

270
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,220
surprised to hear that you were listening to the PCP being being a

271
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,300
successful dude as you are I was surprised that you had fucking ventured into

272
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:02,620
the cesspool of humanity that is fucking YouTube YouTube video content oh yeah

273
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:08,820
what brought that about what what urged that that move yes that's right not only

274
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,740
am I an inspiration to you but also the other way around because I really want

275
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:20,380
to make video games no videos YouTube videos yes and first I started out I

276
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,980
just wanted to do lazy let's plays like not online or whoever they just upload

277
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,580
daily and it's just them playing but now I now that I've seen what you guys do

278
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,220
it's more interesting to to attempt to do it that way though I obviously don't

279
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,340
have as much time so well I mean I do have time I just have to work on games

280
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:45,740
beautiful that's beautiful to hear my friend sweet so very gratified are you

281
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:51,860
we could do that also terrifying yes but I want to let's just jump into the

282
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,460
other major thing here so you've got a new game that's percolating that's

283
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,100
work that's that's being cooked as as we speak and it's called poor mouse and

284
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,620
everyone should go check out the trailer for it on on his GameSquid YouTube

285
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,220
channel so I think I had everybody here watch the trailer but would you

286
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,060
describe to us what the the main thrust of that game is gonna be oh yes so you

287
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,140
are a mouse and it's very dangerous even though you can fly with your ears

288
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,860
because a magical mouse you still have to do that's the tagline right there very

289
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:32,820
dangerous even though you can fly so I wanted to make it so it's basically like

290
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,900
Super Mario meets Dark Souls but I'm sure I'll completely fail and it'll just

291
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:44,940
turn out to be the next no man's guy I mean Super Mario meets Dark Souls is

292
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,860
about as marketable a premise as you can fucking even even think of so it sounds

293
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,380
like a strong start there it's true especially with a cute animal in the

294
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:00,900
mix it's perfect never hurts this debatable because the mainstream games

295
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,620
they're not really about Dark Souls or platforming so it's not mainstream

296
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,020
marketability but I suppose indie marketability should be pretty good you

297
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,100
know you know what your problem is with that game you need a couple more white

298
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,940
guys that's what you need that couple couple of white guys that's what's

299
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,300
missing from that you just need it I don't see a white beefcake space marine

300
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:29,300
anyway yeah I can't relate it to be Dark Souls like enough for a body

301
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,540
video to make a Dark Souls like video on it and then you'll have an instant I

302
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:46,580
wish that guy still exists huh yeah god got tired of that guy a year or ten ago

303
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,820
I still make content it's fairly entertaining he only existed on like on

304
00:25:52,820 --> 00:26:01,020
Dark Souls Eve night is about to be made that's that's when the blood moon is

305
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,100
full that is true but it's because they've been making Dark Souls 3 DLC so he so

306
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,700
it is still dark I guess I forgot because I haven't played anything since

307
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:21,220
Dark Souls 2 anyway wasn't it wasn't it though I got this is my this is my

308
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,460
Dark Souls 2 this is my Dark Souls 2 story when I got to the Queen and I tried

309
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,060
to shoot her with an arrow and there was an invisible wall and I was like this is

310
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:36,980
this is no Dark Souls Dark Souls 1 Dark Souls 1 let me shoot Gwen Gwendolyn fuck

311
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,540
this game when I hear you fool Gwendolyn yes yes yeah well it also let me shoot

312
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,540
Gwendolyn but whatever that's true you know about this bug where you could shoot

313
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,420
minus from the DLC from I do I did that I fucking did that shit I killed him what

314
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,740
what the fuck what you can shoot manners from outside the boss arena if

315
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,940
you aim it right no shit yeah it's a very it's a very pussy way to win

316
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:04,420
sucks thanks to I know thanks to Matthew Matosis that you can shoot the

317
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,980
man-eaters in in or one of the man-eaters in Demon's Souls but I never

318
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,940
played Demon's Souls so what a ton of arrows stand where he can't reach you

319
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,220
shoot at him for hours and hours now he's dead

320
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,660
who was that sexy boy who said that I just watched that recently just just

321
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,700
earlier today I walked into the living room and Davoo was playing Demon's Souls

322
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,460
and I started saying Demon's Souls yeah and he joined in and it was a fun

323
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:42,220
family time from from soft boys everything good I did I did seven years

324
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:55,400
ago just like Florian with binding of Isaac brothers has been brothers

325
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:02,780
I'll be I'll be someone again I'll show you please please do I mean hey I was

326
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:08,980
curious so you're working on multiplayer for for poor mouse that seems like a god

327
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:15,380
damn nightmare it is it is pretty much terrible before I started making poor

328
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,780
mouse I was going to make a multiplayer game but then it was completely fucked

329
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,780
up because I couldn't get a single thing right so and then I worked on poor

330
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:32,460
mouse but now after many years of learning about unity and multiplayer I

331
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,420
think I finally have a chance of making it work this time hey a quick question

332
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:43,100
what was that cancelled game about oh yes for the secret it's about gladiators

333
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:49,740
firm and that's all I'll tell you sperm gladiators I assume oh no not dig

334
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,580
fighting how how long how long has poor mouse been in development now I think

335
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,380
more than two years already and I was supposed to make it come out on early

336
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,940
anxious but then I delayed because I was going to make multiplayer instead which

337
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,060
would take me forever and it means I can't release the game until it's at

338
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,660
least a lot better than it needs to have a really good multiplayer mode so that

339
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,260
people can instantly get into the multiplayer mode and not just be in the

340
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,140
early axis and then lose interest because multiplayer requires a fan base to

341
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:27,260
to be active around the clock oh and you were telling me just the other day how

342
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,060
much you love the arena in Dark Souls 3 and the kind of instant multiplayer you

343
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:36,380
can do is that what you're looking for to get if possible for poor mouse yeah I

344
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:43,180
really do play Dark Souls a lot now this DLC with the the arena it's amazing and

345
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,540
I want to make it so that there's a bandit's mode in poor mouse where you can

346
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,540
kill other mice and then they drop their seeds and you can use the seeds as a

347
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:59,180
weapon but but also you need to you need to collect seeds and whoever gets 50

348
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:08,260
seeds first wins it would be awesome yes so like okay so so gameplay in poor

349
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,580
mouse it's like so it's like platforming but with like gliding and

350
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:18,860
there's combat and and what's like okay so it's a competitive multiplayer scene

351
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,700
where you where you like compete for seeds like you run around you get you

352
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,700
steal each other's seeds what have you I'm trying I'm trying to I'm trying to pay

353
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,900
myself you know can you can you relate in terms that we understand say it's the

354
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,980
Dark Souls of X and then we'll understand what that means oh boy I already did

355
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:42,060
that he did in fact the Dark Souls of Mario oh shit you're right so how much

356
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,420
of that two-year development time is just because you moved to 3d because it

357
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,660
looks like this is a fully 3d game well it was always going to be 3d

358
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:57,300
but I hack now I mean I mean moving 3d I didn't I didn't mean I got it that game

359
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:02,220
I bet you in general actually it took me forever to learn that oh my god it is

360
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,620
so hard but then again I I'm probably just really bad because I was just a

361
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:13,060
young boy of 21 years when I made Isaac and I only knew how to program in flash

362
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,780
and nothing else and so that's why the performance of Isaac is so poor because

363
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,780
it's made in flash so moving away from that alone was hard but then yeah moving

364
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:29,380
into 3d is difficult all the more because you would not believe how hard it

365
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,340
is to make this 3d rotate rotations work they have a whole new type of rotation

366
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:41,580
called quaternions and they all they're pretty much not even understandable

367
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,940
hang on what's what's the name of the rotations quaternions quaternions yes

368
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,620
there's also I'm a math I'm a math guy I thought I thought I might be able to

369
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,940
flex my math nuts a little bit but I guess not you might have heard of rotate

370
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,420
you along the fourth dimensional axis or something that's what it sounds like

371
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,940
yes I think somewhat there's a different one is called Euler angles and that's

372
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,380
just three axis and it it's just three different numbers and that's

373
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,260
understandable but then it gets translated into quaternions and that's

374
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,740
how the computer understands it oh my god so it's a lot more complex that way you

375
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,660
know I've actually done a little bit of developing in unity myself before I

376
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:29,220
started YouTube with Ben I was working on a 2d platformer in yeah with my

377
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,100
buddy in in unity and I we we definitely stopped short of anything and it wasn't

378
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:47,860
3d but I'm a real I'm a real boy too it's got some levels it's got some

379
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:54,100
levels yeah what what what do you what do you hello did someone just leave the

380
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,940
call monkey joint but he's muted monkey oh right he's free gonna start

381
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,380
recording himself you can jump in if you want monkey I don't give a fuck about

382
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:08,860
anything I made a game once I made a video game on RPG maker for steam oh boy

383
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:16,260
you go you're you play as a guy me and I go there's a tree and you go up to the

384
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,900
tree and you click on the tree and the tree says it's a tree or some shit I

385
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,100
don't know that's as far as I got what I did it I made it what does it say I did

386
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,620
have trees say just something I don't remember but you could read a tree you

387
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,540
could read signs oh I know what it says it says it says I wish I was a flutter

388
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:40,580
shy oh I got him the ponies in bring in that's bring a pony game of course I

389
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,340
should have known yeah that's why it was never completed because I didn't know

390
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,500
make it a pony game yeah you would have gotten all the fan funding do you miss

391
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:55,020
that how how big of a brony are you Florian we're all fucking deep oh no

392
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:01,340
that's the most important question of all how many stocky markers of the main six

393
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:15,300
do you own none but I don't believe in such childish material goods but oh yeah

394
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:23,100
I mean either me neither that's that's what I was gonna say to it's much more

395
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,980
mature to play games to make games where you're a penis trying to fuck a giant

396
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:34,260
cunt floating in space you know but it is the finest higher level of maturity here

397
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,620
but anyways it's good that you brought up the ponies because I was wondering did

398
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,500
you notice all the the pony references in Isaac of course I know that there's

399
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,380
the spacebar item right the unicorn horn it turns you invincible I'm sorry it's

400
00:34:49,380 --> 00:35:00,460
been a while since I played yes and oh me I did that you absolute bastard that

401
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:07,020
unicorn horn has saved me many a run oh it's pretty bad though it's like a

402
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,020
good starting item I like I like it cuz it lets you get it lets you get over like

403
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,660
you know spike doors and stuff the problem yeah that's it's got some

404
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,340
utilities but the problem with that thing is anytime you're using it a boss

405
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,100
like you can deal damage by running into things with it but you never can I

406
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,100
could never properly time when it ends so I'd usually just be mashing up against

407
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,620
a boss when my invincibility ran out and that would take damage and I blame you

408
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:37,500
for all of those thank you for try hunt that boss get hit dude wouldn't like a

409
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:43,060
pony ducky marker or be like sideways dude well sure how would you hug a

410
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:51,220
sideways the body the body pillow you know it you don't be appropriate you

411
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,660
know how ponies have legs if you had legs off the side oh you know what they

412
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,180
should do you know those big pillows that kind of have the parts that extend

413
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,820
around that you can kind of put your arms on when you're leaning back on it

414
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,740
there should be a pony one like that with the legs you know with the legs you

415
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:17,900
know that's an add-on that's an add-on for the pillow you got to buy that

416
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,620
separately

417
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:26,580
naive boy you didn't think of where to put the pussy hey Florian what do you

418
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,660
think about the best game ever undertale oh boy I was gonna say your

419
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,740
very first podcast was about the best game ever now we're talking about it

420
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:41,420
again the binding of Isaac perfect oh yeah you know wait wait yeah didn't I'm

421
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,900
didn't I bring up binding of Isaac you said it was your favorite game of all

422
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:51,140
time and then your mind in the very same podcast it's amazing what an arc

423
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,900
you have gone through and then you just went and went to suck underdale's cock

424
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,220
again just like everyone I remember in the best game ever podcast I brought up

425
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,420
Isaac as one of the games I've gotten the most fucking enjoyment out of just

426
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:10,580
the amount of fucking you know time I spent on it and you know loved a lot

427
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,220
and stuff I can think of at least five or six games which Ben has referred to

428
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,380
as his favorite game of all time there's many different ways it's like it's the

429
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,500
the best game ever conundrum is is is like a jewel that you should you twist

430
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,900
hither and thither and and the light and the light reflects into your eyes from

431
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:35,500
all of the different ways and angles what anyway how do you like undertale

432
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:42,700
for Intel with the greatest game us with the tail of undertail I'm just here to

433
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:48,260
talk about under oh boy undertail have I got a tail for you yeah a very short

434
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,540
tail in fact because I watched video game donkeys video about underdale and I

435
00:37:53,540 --> 00:38:00,300
decided I'd never have to play it that's a shame because it's a good game

436
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,780
and it's pretty short but whatever do whatever the fuck you want I mean we

437
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,220
on undertale I haven't I haven't seen donkeys video on it but like undertale

438
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,820
is the worst fucking game to let's play of all time except for that one time the

439
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,500
flow he calls you out that's great everything else about undertale is just

440
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,060
makes for a miserable let's playing experience oh my god so emotionally

441
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,900
incidentally speaking of let's plays I think I think we owe it to Florian to at

442
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:32,020
some point do a better binding of Isaac let's play I was not happy with my

443
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:38,420
performance I spent I spent like 20 minutes in the fucking game room trying

444
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,980
to fucker trying to fuck around with you just trying to optimize that's how you

445
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:48,300
win everyone yeah I'm fucking love that shit I love I love nitpicking and

446
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,740
fucking you just just fucking around with the odds and just spending spending

447
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,900
five spending an hour to save five minutes and trying to eat out every

448
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,940
every possible advantage I can it's it's actually fun for me to do things like

449
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,140
fuck around with the game room in the heart now's an appropriate time to tell

450
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:08,340
you did you that you are as big sack as shit for not appreciating the the the

451
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,420
hard work that the optimization that you have to put in if you want return on

452
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,980
your investment of your runs and Isaac you have to do the grinding you're a

453
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:22,420
hack fraud how about how about I mean like sometimes you can get a run where

454
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,020
yeah you just get lucky and you get good stuff so you don't have to grind you

455
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,820
make your own you find yourself in a run you find yourself in a run where you

456
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,820
need that level of luck in order every time you just grab that run and go to a

457
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,220
good run what are you talking about you grinding since you can find an Isaac you

458
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:46,300
just fucking go around and found a way you can play the arcade that's all yeah

459
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,660
you you if you know how to play smart and like conserve your resources and like

460
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,180
you know when when is it best to use your keys and bombs and stuff and like you

461
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,460
know how what do you have to do like it are you looking for a really well what

462
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,980
are you what are you yeah what do you got to do to make a devil room happen you

463
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,420
know like these are the kind of things that you got to keep in mind you can't

464
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,540
anything but you can maximize your odds of getting a good run it's not it's not

465
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,220
all luck because to a certain extent you can control the odds if you know you're

466
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,660
doing well I'm just I'm just I'm not saying it's all luck I'm saying that if

467
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:23,340
you can have runs where you just get lucky from the outset and then you do

468
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,740
better throughout the game then when you have a run that's like shit at the

469
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,260
outset and then you have to grind for 15 minutes scrap that run and go keep keep

470
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,220
killing yourself you find a good grinding can make the difference and in any

471
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,900
case as I said fucking eating eating out a barely eating out of victory from the

472
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,180
jaws of defeat is just fucking way more fun than yeah that's right yeah you if

473
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,460
you give up on a run that doesn't look great and that's perfectly acceptable

474
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,460
but it is always a good idea to put in the extra time and effort to you know

475
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,460
whatever ways appropriate if you get fucked of course you can abandon a run

476
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,220
like I probably should have abandoned that run early on when I got and I think

477
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,260
I got P and I got some other thing that was ranged down and it was just just a

478
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,500
fucking bullshit set up from the get yeah yeah polyphemus one of the best

479
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,420
items but I think I actually know that in my my latest well yeah that's right

480
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:21,140
I got P and polyphemus and it was just a terrible combination yeah polyphemus

481
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,100
didn't get didn't used to give you a short speed but down but now it does but

482
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,740
have you played to the eternal edition I don't think any of us have how

483
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:36,180
recent was that one or two years I never remember but you definitely had it on in

484
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:41,860
in that video but you'd have to enable the hard mode for it to work because then

485
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,700
you open yourself up for a whole new world of bullshit there's all kinds of

486
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,340
champions that just do in same things they wouldn't imagine and that was the

487
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:56,100
best part about it you gotta try it yeah I was that eternal mode cuz like I

488
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,980
booted up steam cuz I wanted cuz I was I was like let's make it let's make a

489
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,460
binding of Isaac play let's do this podcast to binding of Isaac and I

490
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,460
signed into my steam on digits computer only to find oh shit I don't even have

491
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,060
it on fucking steam I don't wear the piracy I guess I must

492
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,260
are you a goddamn pirate you know what but you know what I made up for it because

493
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,940
I bought the game just to record that fucking podcast I paid my dues that's a

494
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:28,260
good pirate yeah private here I redeemed I redeemed myself hey I was

495
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,860
curious about something so one of the coolest things about Isaac is the

496
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:37,420
ridiculous complexity of the different item variations that stack and cause all

497
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,740
kinds of crazy effects and I always imagined getting those to work

498
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:46,580
properly and never completely fuck the game was one of the most challenging

499
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:53,700
things to do is that accurate yes it is because I completely failed at that for

500
00:42:53,700 --> 00:43:00,780
example you get Ipacac and you get my reflection then oh yeah it kills if you

501
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,100
would expect that it would home back in on you and it would be annoying but you

502
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,620
would not believe the level of how annoying it is because for some reason

503
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,540
the bullets glitched up really high so you couldn't see them and then it would

504
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:20,580
hit you out of nowhere how much how much okay here's a question I just thought

505
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,420
up but I'm kind of interested in the answer to how much of like item

506
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,820
interaction is like is is just emergent versus how much like code like how much

507
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,340
it has to be specifically coded about item interactions like like like how much

508
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,500
of that code is like is there like just for the interaction part versus how much

509
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,300
is just like the item has its own behavior and the two just kind of the

510
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,580
two just kind of modify the the tier the tiers or the game separately you know

511
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:53,540
what I'm saying well ideally would have it so that most of the things would only

512
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,420
be their own self-contained thing and then they would automatically stack with

513
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,900
everything but of course I did it completely wrong because I had no idea

514
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,620
how big this game was going to turn out so when when I had when Edmund told me

515
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,980
there's an item that gives you double damage I just just said if item then

516
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,540
double damage but then they're never more more items so it got more more

517
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,540
confusing and I never really had it set up so it would work so I had to redo all

518
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,220
of that so it could have multiple items that give you more damage without it

519
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,700
being weird you need some sort of complex formula for calculating damage now

520
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,700
probably or something's indeed well well there was I know there's like the

521
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:38,300
in-game menu that kind of shows your stats it's like like like there's like a

522
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:43,020
bar that fills up on the pause menu but like I don't know on most of my good

523
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,660
runs I would find that like I maxed out the bar I would max out like at the

524
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,700
damage bar and then you know the bar would the bar continued infinitely but

525
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,180
like you couldn't really see it or you know like like like the bar itself would

526
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,340
only show you so much and then there would be tons of shit going on behind

527
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:02,060
the scenes that was not like you know visibly tracking on that stats screen

528
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,900
or that's how it always felt to me yeah the bar isn't very accurate and it was

529
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:13,620
added after the fact so it's more of a I guess it it kind of determines how much

530
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:18,460
damage one single tier does but it's still there's still things that that

531
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,140
that make it more complex like when you get the lump of coal that makes the

532
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,780
tears grow steadily larger yeah that for example doesn't even show up in that

533
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:34,100
stat I always had there was something I was always clear on do your tears

534
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,220
automatically turned red when you got past a certain damage threshold or was

535
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,980
that like an item visual an item specific visual thing I always felt like

536
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,140
when my tears got strong enough even if there was no item that was specifically

537
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,340
made the tears red they would turn red anyway was I just fucking crazy I had it

538
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,540
that way but they removed it in in reburse because apparently that wasn't

539
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:00,500
the intended way of Edmund so I guess I just made that randomly and Edmund that

540
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,180
son of a fucking bitch you know let's just talk some shit about that guy that

541
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,340
piece of that shit don't you just hate him tell us how you want him to die tell

542
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:16,500
us all the dirt tell us the deeds hey Edmund I'm sure you're listening right

543
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:24,980
now the worst man who ever lived your words not mine he said the worst man of

544
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:30,140
all time do you think you listen to this actually well he said I should send it

545
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:36,020
to him so probably more like more like Deadmond because you're gonna kill him

546
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:42,140
is what you said now hey Edmund hey Edmund leave us a comment patreon.com

547
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:49,220
slash patreon.com slash Ben St yeah I did it yes please I don't even have a

548
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:54,020
patron you could just buy Isaac can I get money from that yeah yeah do that and

549
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,660
you'll get a cool you can confirm that that you make money every time we buy

550
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:09,140
Isaac yeah but I don't say how much so I was gonna ask you know obviously your

551
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:14,100
your friends Edmund who's a sort of a superstar of the of the indie gaming

552
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:18,940
world do you have any indie gaming friends or anything who you you want to

553
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,020
promote like who you think deserve more attention that's a great question there's

554
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,100
this there's this kid Phil Fish have been hearing a lot about recently you know

555
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:37,660
really was in the news again I probably I don't know oh god well I guess there's

556
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,820
that one guy who made Orbox C which he could buy on Steam he's a really good

557
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,740
friend and it's a good game and no one has bought it and it's a tragedy what's

558
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,100
the game I never heard of it Orbox C it used to be a flash game but then he made

559
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,620
a lot of levels and put it on steam and it's pretty good it's possibly some

560
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:01,740
links in the description to or or boxy yes ORBO X space C right let's all buy

566
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:36,300
things oh I'm I've been a procrastinator far beyond for you guys all day all of

567
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:43,020
yesterday's sick bro it is sick bro don't fucking patronize me but do be a

568
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,740
much do you and I is me at patreon.com

569
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:53,940
god damn this guy is savage so good so good at what I'm just turning it back

570
00:48:53,940 --> 00:49:00,820
every time rubs hands so what are what are some of your favorite games as of

571
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:06,060
late any recommendations you have for us oh yes there's certainly one that I've

572
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,780
been playing and hating and I just can't stop myself from playing and

573
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:17,420
hating it it's called enter the gungeon it's the worst game and definitely the

574
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:22,500
worst game and you can't stop playing it it's it's I saw you had a video called

575
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,900
like how to improve into the gungeon that sounds fascinating oh I got a lot

576
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:33,820
of hate for that one now gun guns kind of similar to Isaac isn't it's like another

577
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:40,060
oh it's very similar only that it's not bugged but also it's too hard I cannot

578
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,620
believe that there would be a game that's too hard but it is I always assumed

579
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:50,500
that the harder the better but enter the gun to improve me wrong it's too hard so

580
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,900
like how does it feel knowing that you basically caused this this huge boom in

581
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,460
roguelite games because I want to say Isaac seems like the flashpoint of this

582
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:08,500
for sure literally flash oh yeah well my question my follow-up question to that

583
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:14,180
would be do you agree with that like I mean yes I have created roguelike it

584
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:20,860
is true yes I mean I I know it was I know it was a thing before like roguelike

585
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:24,540
elements were already creeping into like other genres and like genre mixing

586
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:30,060
before Isaac but it has only grown it has only grown since that's why that's

587
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,460
why I said roguelite like this genre of things that take roguelike elements and

588
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,940
then you know apply some other game style to it like in the in the wake of Isaac

589
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:44,220
there's definitely been like an explosion of these you know we've got like risk of

590
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:53,540
rain and FTL and dance dance Crypt of the Necro dancer and all that how do you

591
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,860
how do you feel about all those games you fan of the the roguelite genre well

592
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,260
I do love roguelike very much but the problem is that they're all filthy

593
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:07,860
pixel art I just wait for the day when someone will make a beautiful 3d roguelike

594
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:12,220
game that doesn't play like ass because I've only played once that that play like

595
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:17,860
ass or they pixel art but it's not been one that didn't apply to these did you

596
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:22,780
ever play dungeon crawlstone suit I did not but I'm sure that looks and plays

597
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:31,340
like ass it's not it's too basic it's basically like ass it is far it's not

598
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:38,620
asking me but it basically might as well yeah great yeah um what was that one

599
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:44,140

606
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:45,780
secrets do you know but chugger too I couldn't actually I I got like one

607
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:55,420
minute into that and I couldn't give it all try you really should you gotta

608
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,140
follow and you've got to follow through to the end on but sugar yeah it's all

609
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:03,380
about and please leave a comment because I want to coming of age tail much like

610
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:09,140
the binding of Isaac it is but chugger has probably the most the most

611
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:15,020
shockingly deep narrative of any retarded ass song you'll ever hear oh sweet

612
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:19,940
it's great it's by it by the way let's let's plug your channel your YouTube

613
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,140
channel is game squid right oh yeah you gotta check it out it's just like these

614
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:29,180
guys but with developer content oh man freeing which is far more valuable and

615
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:34,300
good so go check that out it's like it's like it's like what we do but from

616
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:39,500
someone who knows what the fuck they're talking about yeah yeah yep that's right

617
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,340
it's actually I'm curious have you done anything to promote your channel because

618
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:48,980
it is shockingly low view counts considering well actually it turned out

619
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:53,940
but when I started it was just bullshit it was just let's place and they weren't

620
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,940
even good and then my partner left and I got someone else it didn't start out

621
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,660
very well and whenever I made when I made Isaac a first day I never made I

622
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:09,180
never promoted myself in fact I didn't even do interviews because I was so shy

623
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:15,500
in basement dwelling so now that I want to be famous I I have all these hurdles

624
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:21,500
and then they can only get my my fame drip thread from me by Edmund I am

625
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,780
delighted to be a part of that process whatever whatever small amount yeah

626
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:32,660
thanks oh yeah does Edmund help promote you oh yeah occasionally he definitely

627
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:38,460
promoted the eternal update for a little bit and people played it and then

628
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:44,460
they decided it was bullshit and then they discovered that it was meant to be

629
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:55,060
bullshit oh good so you're basically still like that came out after after birth

630
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,900
right like you're still developing elements of the original Isaac even

631
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:04,820
while the new versions out yeah I I think I how when did I start on that was

632
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:09,660
that before we burst came out before after birth came out anyways I I did I

633
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,780
decided to delay it's a three births could have its day or after birth but

634
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:18,060
it no one really cared about eternal addition but that was fine because it

635
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:24,060
was just a minor thing I just yeah I mean I guess it's a little bit confusing

636
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,940
some things I mean I didn't even know I played after birth but I wasn't really

637
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,660
aware of what was going on with the parallel development despite being a

638
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,060
pretty big fan at the time it came out so I guess it just got lost in the shuffle

639
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:40,740
a little bit unfortunately oh yes all the bad reviews even though it was all

640
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:46,980
free so it was a lot of free content at least yeah what like what what changes

641
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:51,980
were there in eternal addition because like apparently I bought eternal

642
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,380
addition without even noticing I was just I just want original Isaac and

643
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,820
that's why you get it for free if you have wrath of the lamb because yeah that

644
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:05,700
way you can uninstall it if you want but you can also just play it for free and

645
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:10,660
it's great so basically it has these new eternal champions which are just white

646
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:14,900
champions and they have in the same patterns and they do bullet hell things

647
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:19,780
and there was a bunch of little fixes and they really troll you hard at times

648
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:26,980
like that you know that boss that splits into little pieces the fistula no

649
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:32,900
that the mini boss actually so he he has a power where he recombines if two pieces

650
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:37,120
of the same size hit each other so you could you could get that on an early

651
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,660
level and you'd have to fight him for for half an hour before he stops doing

652
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,060
that does he regain a little bit of health when a when that happens or

653
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:48,260
something oh yes but it gets less the longer you fight him so it's not completely

654
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:52,760
insane it's almost like you thought about how to implement this pretty cool

655
00:56:52,760 --> 00:57:01,500
pretty cool yeah maybe we'll have to I I definitely want to see Ben try to play

656
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,620
this so we should definitely play all the time kind of let's play a great oh

657
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,000
okay yeah so to do that you have to do it on hard mode to get these bullshit

658
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,660
champions oh yeah all right that's what we'll do then you should do an Isaac

659
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:23,300
race I you know I think it's just too hard for most of us I think we can get

660
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,300
well we can we can just fucking play Isaac in parallel and it'd be like you

661
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,620
know who who wins yeah basically like that and you just edit it together I

662
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:36,820
mean Ben Ben Jesse and Nate are all pretty hardcore Isaac players so that's

663
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:42,300
that's three right there and I am good at being shit at video games using

664
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:47,940
playing Isaac right now you guys didn't even know it that's how good I am I'm

665
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:52,980
the sneakiest at video games well Jesse your IRL life doesn't count get out of

666
00:57:52,980 --> 00:58:00,060
that basement go live your life go be a real boy mom's coming for you I'm just

667
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:04,460
thinking about the fact that Jesse is literally in a shit filled basement like

668
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:11,020
it destroyed well I don't know I guess it's all cleaned up now right or how how

669
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:17,780
wrecked is the basement currently Jesse well I'm in it so pretty bad so it's

670
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:29,020
more filthy than it was before I came home yes oh the antagonist is mom just

671
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:38,260
like in real life that's yeah yeah HIPPO are you also firing up Isaac is this

672
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:42,340
way everybody's going quiet is everyone just playing Isaac playing or boxy

673
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:47,980
because it's on a mini clip I tried to play Isaac I turned on Isaac just now

674
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:52,340
but then I realized I still have the undertale mod installed so it was like

675
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:59,980
I was playing the wrong game no give me out of here

676
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:08,260
game sense could actually get bought flies in his lemon pipe oh my god

677
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:14,820
fantastic gotta get munchy on this let's play was it monthly was it munchy that

678
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:18,260
tweeted about that didn't someone tweet about that recently that that that

679
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:25,820
binding of Isaac is bought flies in your lemon pipe yeah yeah you okay sick well

680
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:35,020
classic I sure do take a crap how about you so why don't you tell us your

681
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:40,780
future plans I'm very interested to know what your you know five ten year plan is

682
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:44,380
as a game developer where do you see yourself going or maybe as a youtuber

683
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,060
maybe you I mean maybe long-term you'd like to get away from game dev I mean I

684
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:54,900
hope not but perhaps it feels that if I had access to YouTube and if I had been

685
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,980
shy I probably could have had a pretty good YouTube career but now I'll just

686
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,020
have to start now it's not too late I think it's still big I think it's still

687
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:07,700
big in your that's why I was astounded that you would you know condescend to

688
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:12,260
speak to us lowly plebs from your pedestal of a real game dev who's made

689
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:18,740
one of my favorite games of my life and you know just yeah all that shit it's

690
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:24,340
the first time we've had someone who's a fan of the show who like does work that

691
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,340
we respect I got to say I like I like where this is going I like where this is

692
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:36,020
going good mom kiss not listening anyway well like you know I mean the PCP is

693
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:43,580
just a bunch of youtubers and we've had other youtuber well yeah I'm special

694
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:52,760
go yeah sure yeah I always forget that with the furtive the furtive Ben

695
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,340
Saint so easily forgotten I guess I guess what I'm trying to say is that like I

696
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:03,980
hate that guy we have on youtubers who we like but I think that everyone in the

697
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:08,620
PCP thinks that we're better youtubers than everybody anyways so it's like you

698
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,100
know we have on people who we like their work but you know I it's not like I

699
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:17,220
think any of them are better than me at this job but then you are someone who's

700
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:21,980
made something that none of us even could make and all of us are fans of and

701
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:25,700
think is great and so it's it was that I think that's why it was so shocking to

702
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:31,940
us to find out that you were not just watching the video of binding of Isaac

703
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:35,060
but actually a huge fan of the channel and we were just like how could it be

704
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:39,940
possible that someone who's done it a real thing it's very it's very

705
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:44,580
gratifying that someone who's not some kind of fucked up wasteoid dwee

706
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:50,020
bazoid waste of space asshole like the rest of our fans like the rest of our

707
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:55,740
fans like the rest of you fans listening at home would be watching our shit

708
01:01:55,740 --> 01:02:01,740
thank you with you little pissant YouTube channels oh we inspired you oh

709
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:07,060
it didn't inspire you enough obviously cuz you stink you all stink we didn't

710
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,300
inspire you enough because you still haven't put that bullet in that chamber

711
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:15,700
yet we're waiting for it I'll get to that already buddy incidentally if if

712
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,580
there are any people who have who have made real things that any of us have

713
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:26,300
heard of that watch the show let us know it really boosts our egos strongly yeah

714
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:31,620
yeah oh but I'm not that great I'm just one of those annoying commenters you

715
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:36,460
don't like um baby you know what guys have we learned something here have we

716
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:44,340
learned that commenters actually can be decent people all right fair enough this

717
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:49,660
has flown in the face of everything I've ever known yeah it was it was it well

718
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:53,820
the funny thing about it is that like that that Isaac let's play because the

719
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:59,260
audio recording was so bad and it was like we recorded it at it was it was like

720
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:03,620
six in the morning after we just done like eight hours of other let's plays

721
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:08,020
that are all for Jesse's channel and we were like we didn't want to go to bed we

722
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:11,300
still wanted to record and Ben's like let's do Isaac I can play that you know

723
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:15,420
I've played a million hours of it I can play it sort of on autopilot Ben wasn't

724
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:20,780
as tired as me and Jesse were but we're like like you know that there's not a

725
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,700
whole lot of conversation it's sort of bad audio and so I considered like not

726
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,420
even releasing it it was like you know will anyone actually be entertained by

727
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:33,460
this but I'm now I'm glad I did because now we found out that the guy who

728
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:38,180
programmed the damn game is a fan of the show and I was like you know this just

729
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:44,860
goes to show everyone put out every stupid shit video that you make don't

730
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,900
don't throw anything away release it all you never know when you'll meet the guy

731
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:57,060
who made binding of Isaac by way of your your crappy shit videos there's no

732
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:06,500
escape for me relatable relatable that's why you said I'm sticking to it from now

733
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:12,900
on no one can stop me release it I've started a terrible downgrade of PCP

734
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:17,820
content everything will be terrible thing possible I don't know don't worry

735
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:22,260
we fit on a downward spiral quite sometimes ready for more content than

736
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:28,020
there are even hours in the goddamn day and all sweet we'll just turn on we'll

737
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:32,380
just turn on a camera in the corner somewhere and just leave it going it'll

738
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:36,860
just be going and going I've already made my declaration that I don't make good

739
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:42,180
videos anymore and I'm sticking to it it's bad videos from here on out it's the

740
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:46,700
only kind you're gonna see for me it's the only kind I want to make the only

741
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:52,740
kind videos are the worst ones what about horse shoe finale part 3 where's

742
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:59,380
that coming out it'll come in the fucking toilet and I'll wash it down into the

743
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:06,580
sewer and no I'll make it I'll make it but no one'll ever see it I'll spend a

744
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:12,540
year making it just so that I can upload a video of me deleting the file that'll

745
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:17,380
be my ultimate that'll be like my gg Allen committing suicide on stage but he

746
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,900
never got to do it cuz he died in his own shit first but if he did that would

747
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:26,620
be my analogy for that had he like promised he was gonna do that and then

748
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:30,700
did yeah he didn't make it he said he didn't make it to the promise day cuz he

777
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:42,860
adults no one needs it and it shouldn't exist hey one I've got a real question

778
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:48,860
that I was wondering about Florian what would you say were your game like

779
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:52,820
inspirations when you were making you know all the stuff you did what are some

780
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:57,980
classics that you loved as a young lad yeah yeah your art what what the classics

781
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:05,300
that inspire your your your dev shit yeah yeah oh man I I don't even remember

782
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:10,140
if I had any kind of inspirations at the time of making Isaac we just kind of

783
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,420
trolling around on new grounds and just seeing what people were making and you

784
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:18,820
know well I was but I never really got into flash games even though I made them

785
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:23,180
myself I never really I can't point out one good flash game that I really like

786
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:31,500
except I can't point out one good flash game that is hilarious um well like what

787
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,940
I mean what would you say are some of your favorite games well I actually made

788
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:43,660
a top 10 list that you should watch about my favorite games but I am a PC

789
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:51,740
master master race master and so my my my original games not like they're not

790
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:55,940
Mario or anything like that's their mind sweeper I play mind sweeper and I'm

791
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:00,740
really good at it yeah yeah I love fucking mind sweeper yeah man so it's

792
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:08,220
soft that like like my current computer I guess I have a pirate in windows so it

793
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:13,100
didn't come with mind sweeper oh no makes me mad but I but luckily it's it's a

794
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,460
browser game now you can easily just type mind sweeper into Google and it's

795
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:21,540
fucking there but I've spent spent many an hour I think I've won maybe two or

796
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:26,620
three times those were the most glorious moments of my life I have never

797
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:31,660
won a sweeper and I just don't see it ever happen in for me it really boils

798
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:36,060
down to luck at the end because like I have difficulties where you play yeah

799
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:40,700
yeah I have only on like super like I set the difficulty like so if you can't

800
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:45,260
even lose no you got to set it to you gotta you know you play hard mode with

801
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:51,540
99 mines and you fucking flag them all and if you but when you get down to the

802
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:56,340
very end there's always gonna be a point where like there's just no way to know

803
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:59,980
like there's always one moment where you just can't know and you have to guess

804
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:06,140
are you casual mind sweepers I got a 25% win rate on expert it's very doable

805
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:10,100
even though sometimes it's fucked and you have to guess but it's very doable

806
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:16,940
25% of the time I love your inspiration is fucking mind sweeper how do you feel

807
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:21,260
about how do you feel about space pinball you big fan of space

808
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:28,980
can I get any love for jazz ball I fucking love jazz ball how about that

809
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:33,300
how about that a screensaver mice amaze that you'd like the mouse just goes

810
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:37,820
through and finds the cheese was that a big gaming inspiration I see monkeys

817
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:14,260

836
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:59,180

837
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:09,040

just gonna say the what is it the fuck what's that what's that roast beef

841
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,200
covered beast from Bloodborne that's just got the floppy vagina on its back

01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,240
oh yeah I'm talking about the blood starved beast the blood starved beast is hot

843
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:43,280

844
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:48,320
born for not coming out on PC yeah yeah they really fucked you over with that

845
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,080
one it's awful just like the biggest meme in the world Ben yeah it's cuz Sony

846
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:58,080
published or help them make it or something? I don't know.

847
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:04,040
Okay, let's transition. We got some questions here that we can take a look at over on the

848
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:12,680
Twitter. Here's an important one from at Cygriz after the D. They want to know, why does Digi

849
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:17,840
shit naked? First of all, I didn't even know that was true. And second of all, please explain

850
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,680
Digi. Why you shit naked?

851
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:26,400
Well, I can think of a few good reasons. One, it feels good. Two, it feels good.

852
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:31,280
I mean, really, there's only the one reason.

853
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:37,680
The full aesthetic package is delivered. Make sense to me. Here's one that's stupid, but

854
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:43,800
I'm going to ask it anyway by at Yath and Cool. What do you think Western animation can learn

855
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:49,240
from anime and vice versa? Nothing. Run. Flee. Do not take anything from anime. It's

856
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:58,280
trash, my dude. Tentacle porn. Shouldn't these questions be for our guests? Oh, yes. Yes,

857
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:03,160
they should. Maybe you should have specified. We have a guest this week. Oh, God, it's true.

858
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:08,240
Nobody knows. Actually, I heard that Monkey leaked the secret info in the discord, in the

859
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:15,600
fan discord. Yeah. So if you were in the PCP fan discord, someone on Snapchat told me that

860
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:20,760
Monkey leaked it in the fan discord. So if you want to be on the ball with hot gauze.

861
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,080
That fan discord is going to be the death of us. The idea that there's some fucking

862
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:31,720
hive of filth and villainy where fans of us talk about us amongst themselves. Who knows

863
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,720
what they're saying? Who knows what sick things they're saying? I don't know what the fuck

864
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:39,920
they're saying, but I'm glad that they're saying it, whatever it is. Well, actually,

865
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,200
some people did actually ask specific questions. Well, I mean, Monkey was one, but here's a

866
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:50,000
real one actually for Florian by at steel viper 77 asks, Florian, what was your favorite

867
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,480
project to work on with Ed other than the binding of Isaac? I like coil. It's the sea

868
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:03,640
world, of course. Rainbow fills. Amazing. And everything just stays in the back. It turns

869
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:08,560
black and it's all just filthy fluids everywhere. What is what is coil? I'm not familiar with

870
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,960
that one. I don't know if I can go look it up. Are you gonna make him fucking explain the

871
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,760
whole game? Just fucking go to his website. Fine. Fine. Never mind. Part two in the sperm

872
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:27,000
trilogy. Can I just say that the that I think just as much just as much as Isaac, I think

873
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,880
your contribution to gaming history of having made the game called cunt is absolutely invaluable.

874
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:41,000
It's the it's it's something that I cherish the game called cunt. So I was curious. So

875
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,600
I mean, it's also known as the seaward. So was that so that could be released on various

876
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,480
platforms or just so we could be advertised? Or, you know, what was the thought process

877
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:54,440
there? Well, I suppose that was just the name that it would have on the on the platforms.

878
01:17:54,440 --> 01:18:00,920
But then when you click on it, it would say cunt. So make sense. I guess it's mild censorship.

879
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:07,560
Sure. Time to fuck or whatever that Ed did, which is just called time fuck in the actual

880
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:16,200
game. It's just to get around the loopholes there. You know, hard to run advertising,

881
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:23,560
I imagine on a game called cunt. Well, that's right. Free flash games need all the advertisement.

882
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:29,320
Break in taboos is well, I know. I mean, maybe the advertising that would have been on like

883
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:34,800
new grounds or whatever, they might might might not be able to run ads next to a game called

884
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:39,320
cunt. Oh, yes. And meanwhile, they have that game where where you're the big daddy and you

885
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:45,560
chainsaw children. Yes. Yeah, I know, right? It's very amusing to me constantly the exceptions

886
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,720
of violence and the rejection of anything sexual or that other game that they have very other

887
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:56,320
animation, which is a clown who plays propeller with his dick and it plays some goofy music to it.

888
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:03,000
Yeah, meat spent. Excellent. Oh, no. I don't make it worse than of it.

889
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:11,360
Um, these questions are all garbage. And nobody's asking anything good. Do you guys watch Always

890
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,560
Sonia Philadelphia? Yes. T vice writer. Now shut the hell up and never comment again.

891
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:26,040
Yeah. Yeah. This is what I want to hear. This is what I want out of this guy says this guy says

892
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:36,600
Hey, what did you guys think about Final Fantasy 15? Fuck you. That's what I think about it.

893
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:44,520
You ass hole. I can't shit on my buddy at rabbits foot 99 with their incredibly cute duck icon asking

894
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:49,480
does dieting matter too much or is it all about exercising? Dieting super important. It's more

895
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,760
important than exercising. Do that if you want to be healthy. So there you go. There's a real question

896
01:19:52,760 --> 01:20:00,600
for you. Great. Thanks. Oh, okay. Let's just do one more because these are all garbage. I got a

897
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:07,720
question. I got a question. Oh, okay. What is your favorite videos from all of us? Oh, put them on

898
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:13,720
the spot. Put them on the spot. It's definitely gonna be horseshoe finale. I've just watched that

899
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:19,800
again recently and it's just always so weird. So it's amazing. I have to fucking ask, does that

900
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:26,200
mean that you have watched the horseshoe saga that led up to it? No, not all of it, but I have

901
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:30,840
a red track. Well, I suppose actually, I guess so, but I've watched the finale first. And now

902
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:37,240
it's also tragic in its beauty because now it means that all of you guys have stopped making

903
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:43,080
pony reviews. And now who will explain my little pony to me? Who will do it? There's no one left.

904
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:48,680
There's a lot of costs now. There's none. There's only a pale limitation. You know, after horseshoe

905
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:56,680
finale, they stopped trying. That's when the show went downhill because they knew. The inspired

906
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:03,240
art had surpassed the original creation. So it was time to shut down shop. That was always the case.

907
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:09,880
There was that one cartoon Max Gilardi did and that was amazing. The Dotmove series, yeah.

908
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:16,280
That's the one. There was the friendship is Witchcraft, which was better than the original

909
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:22,920
show by Miles. There was this one channel called I love Kim Possible a lot and you'd think that it

910
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:28,440
was a Kim Possible channel, but it was actually a my little pony channel and it was the most

911
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:35,880
hard hitting in-depth fucking out of control underground. No holds barred. No fucking mainstream

912
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:42,520
bullshit. It was real analysis for real fucking bronies. Let me tell you. If you wanted to know

913
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:48,200
what the fuck was up. That was your hub. That was your hub, not the hub. One of the, you know,

914
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:55,160
probably the chief influence on drowning in horseshoes was the legendary I love Kim Possible

915
01:21:55,160 --> 01:22:03,960
a lot. Any fucking ways. I think Hippo was asking for your favorite video by each of us.

916
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:11,880
And don't be afraid to hurt our feelings if you don't know any of us.

917
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:16,440
Yeah, I'm not gonna be upset if you don't know which one of mine you like.

918
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,200
I know about you. I'm just curious.

919
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,120
I've seen-

920
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:24,120
Just what Hippo wants to know is what's your favorite video of his? Just answer that question.

921
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:28,920
There's a fish at the door. There's a fish at the door. It's amazing.

922
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,680
Oh, fantastic. I'm glad you know about fish.

923
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:41,560
That water. I've seen that a while ago before I even saw the rest of his channel. So yeah,

924
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:47,080
that was cool. Great. By the way, is that on the Gibbentech channel or is that on Hippocrates?

925
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:53,800
A quick question about that, about the lore of fish at the door. Did that man go on? Was that a

926
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,800
business that he started selling water to these fish? Do they pay? Is this a, you know, like a-

927
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:05,480
Yeah, he's started a bar. He made, you know, he made the best of a bad situation. All these

928
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:11,720
immigrants coming over. Immigrants. From the ocean. Right. He got like all this tap water. He's like,

929
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:16,360
I can supply these fish what they want. I know. I agree with you and it'd be if Hippo was like,

930
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:21,560
yeah, it's all a metaphor for immigration. I have a very right-wing policy about these things.

931
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:26,520
Well, actually, that's a very left-wing policy about accepting them. This is actually a pro-Trump

932
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:34,840
propaganda piece. Finally, I was waiting for an excuse to talk about Donald Trump, the best guy

933
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:42,200
who's also I hate him, but I can't decide today. Every day is different. Every day. I've trolled

934
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:47,240
so much about Donald Trump. I don't even know where I stand anymore. I've trolled myself into a

935
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,640
quarter with Donald Trump. Help!

936
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,720
Nate, what was the last question you wanted to read?

937
01:23:53,720 --> 01:24:01,240
Okay. Yeah, here's one. Oh, fuck, I lost it. What's your favorite bird? What's your favorite bird?

938
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:09,240
My, uh, my, at Simon. At Simon asked, what's your favorite type of bird?

939
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,120
Oh, that is hard. It's both of such majestic creatures. And they're also beautiful.

940
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:19,800
Ravens and crows are cool as shit. They're cool as shit. And they could be your friends.

941
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:25,960
Yes. Every possible topic has a Jesse meme. It's true. I got an actual answer.

942
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:34,040
The wood duck. The wood duck. Why, man? Why? If you get made of wood. Google, Google wood duck,

943
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:39,480
and you will see the majesty that is the wood duck. And it's beautiful plumage.

944
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:43,160
Oh, it's got nice stripes all over it. It's all colorful and iridescent and shit.

945
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,920
I love it. Pretty good. That's a good ass duck. That's pretty good, right? Yeah, for sure.

946
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:53,720
Loving that wood duck. Living a wood duck life. My favorite kind of bird is a Pidgeotto.

947
01:24:55,560 --> 01:25:01,560
Oh, no, no. My favorite bird type Pokemon is missing. No, because it's the only bird type Pokemon.

948
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:08,200
Yeah, that's true. Oh, I see. It's glitch type bird type. You got outclassed, motherfucker. God damn.

949
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:13,320
Well, well, you know, Pidgeotto's been a, you know, even though I'm sick of seeing his ass,

950
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:18,360
he's been a very helpful companion in many a Pokemon game over the years. I can't say there's

951
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:24,760
any other bird I've spent more time with. My favorite bird is Big Bird. Yeah.

952
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:34,520
Because he's the fucking biggest. Nobody's as big as Big Bird. God damn it. I'll fight a nigger.

953
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:40,760
I'll fight anyone who says he's bigger than Big Bird. I like Dynablade from Kirby Superstar.

954
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:49,320
He's strong. He's a good mom. He loves his family. You know, got strong Christian values. You know,

955
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:56,920
there's a lot to love about the man woman. No, the best bird from Kirby is definitely Heavy Lobster.

956
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:02,040
I do like Heavy Lobster. Heavy Lobster is a good bird. What I'm trying to say is I love

957
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:07,240
Meta Knight's Revenge. It's the greatest Kirby game of all time and Dynablade helps you and that's

958
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:13,880
nice and Kirby is an evil man. But I love that game. 10 out of 10. Meta Knight's Revenge. There

959
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:19,240
you go. Best Kirby game. Dynablade just is fucking Songbird from Infinite before it was cool.

960
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:27,480
Yeah. Only you never fight Songbird. So whatever. I think my favorite bird will be a Cassivore

961
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:32,840
because it's so deadly and beautiful. Ooh, I'm gonna Google that. It's pretty much an emo with a

962
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:38,600
spike at its foot, I think. Unless I misremember the name. Oh, it's all blue. I think so, yeah.

963
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,600
That's a good bird. How do you spell that? I can't do it. That bird is like half Buffalo.

964
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:51,480
Link me your search result, dude. I'm too lazy to Google it myself. I couldn't find it. I am

965
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:58,440
leaned back in my chair and I cannot be asked to lean forward. Ben, please. If you'll, if you'll

966
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:05,560
please post the link. God's sake. I don't know how to spell this thing. Yes, right away. Right away, sir.

967
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:14,440
Okay, there we go. All right. Now, that looks like that's a dinosaur is what that is. That's just

968
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:22,280
a straight dinosaur. Yep. Dinosaur bird. Goddamn. I'd like to fuck that board. It is beefy.

969
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:27,640
It looks delicious. It's glorious. It does look delicious. Got a lot of meat on them,

970
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:35,720
non bones or hollow bones. Oh, oh. Oh, no. What's that other super delicious bird? Chicken.

971
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:44,120
They're also delicious. Yeah, yeah. No, no, there's another bird. The most delicious bird.

972
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:53,640
No, it's green and it's weird. I like green food. Green eggs and ham. Everyone type in green bird

973
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:59,960
on Google. We'll find it. Green. Oh, we'll find Kawabiba. Oh, it's Polly. You know what? My favorite

974
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,760
green bird. Cacopos. The cacopo is the most delicious bird. Is that a cacophony in its

975
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:12,680
unevolved form? It's a caca. I just think it's Pokemons. It's all Pokemons. I'm sorry. I totally

976
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:18,280
cut you off, Hippo. But I was just talking about the penguin being my favorite because he's got

977
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:27,000
green, green screen skin. He does. Oh, the penguin. Your penguin, right? The Hippo penguin.

978
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:32,280
How could I forget? The soon to be a real character penguin boy. When are we seeing more of that

979
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:38,520
young man? The reference literally no one will get penguin boy. I get this. When's he coming back,

980
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:47,800
Gib? When's he coming back? Well, I mean, there's a club penguin news. Oh, yes. Oh, that's exciting.

981
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:51,880
Oh, my God. He needs to avenge his people who are all being fucking executed at the end of

982
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:57,880
March. Oh, my God. That's very exciting. That's very exciting. Okay, we're done. We're out of

983
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:03,720
steam, right? We're done here. Oh, no. Wait, I'm trying to take a picture of the game that I'm

984
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:12,680
developing right now. I'm trying to take a screenshot. It's better be the best damn game I

985
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:17,320
ever seen or I swear to God, I want my money back. Yeah, print screen, print screen. Well,

986
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:24,360
I'll do it after the podcast. I'll show you. No, I do it now. I want to see it. All right.

987
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:32,280
Oh, shit. I got to open up Photoshop. Just fucking screencap. Why? Just the screen cap

988
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:36,280
software doesn't do it. I'm going to teach you something incredibly valuable right now.

989
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:40,280
Press the print screen button on your keyboard. Let me teach everyone the most important thing

990
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:45,560
you'll ever learn about your computer if you use Windows. Go into your start menu and in the search

991
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:52,040
bar type snip and snipping tool will pop up, which instantly is a thing that lets you capture an

992
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:57,160
area of your screen. It automatically converts it into an image that you can just control v-paste

993
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:02,040
anywhere and use that for the rest of your life because it's the most valuable thing in the world.

994
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:08,040
Okay, so use that. Yeah, print screen will do. Yeah, do it or do it. I have it already.

995
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:17,400
It's Super Mario Hippo. Number one hippo in gaming. You made all this art during this podcast

996
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:22,760
and made a fully functional game with nothing in it. I love it. I love it. That's an incredible

997
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:26,760
amount that you've done in this short span of time since announcing that you were going to do it.

998
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,640
Oh my God, Gippo. You know, you need to get later in this game. You need to upgrade your

999
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:36,680
propeller hat so you can just fly all the time. That's exactly what I was thinking. Yeah, he's

1000
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:44,040
basically Rayman. I can't wait for that. Okay, so good that everyone was cutting off Hippo so he

1001
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:51,320
could have had time to make all this perfect. That is great. He's utilized his disability for

1002
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:57,640
good at long last. It's wonderful. My crippling disability. Oh no. Okay, well that's it. By the

1003
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:03,400
way, I just wanted to let you know that right before we did this podcast, my heads had broken

1004
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:07,800
the most ridiculous way and I'm not sure if you've been able to hear it, but something on the inside

1005
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:14,120
of my head that's broken off and now it sounds like a rattle whenever I shake my head. Listen to this.

1006
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:21,240
I hear a little bit. It's driving me insane. A little crunchy sound. I hope it wasn't too noisy.

1007
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:27,800
I can hear it until now. But now I'm going to go back and listen for it. It's like an Easter egg.

1008
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:35,400
Now you can listen to this podcast at home, viewers, and the second viewing will be more

1009
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:41,800
rich for the experience. Replay value. That's what it's all about. Yeah, replay value. Well, you

1010
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:49,960
know, like, what's it called? Fucking Discord has really good, like, it only picks up audio if it's

1011
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:54,520
above a certain level, but Audacity doesn't have that. So there's a good chance our audience will

1012
01:31:54,520 --> 01:32:01,240
hear a lot more than we did. Quite possible. But I can't be that bad. Well, I tried to hold

1013
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:09,560
still for you. We appreciate it. We appreciate it. Well, that was another episode of the Pro

1014
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:16,920
Crastinators. We sure are a good bunch of friends or something. We sure are a bunch of guys. We

1015
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:28,600
did talk to another guy. We, um, yeah. Oh, boy. Yeah. Cute a song. Now. Yeah. Everybody say goodbye.

1016
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:34,680
Yeah.

1017
01:32:47,800 --> 01:33:00,680
I'm not working. I'm doing nothing. My dick. I'm jerking myself. I'm sucking. I am an asshole.

1018
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:08,120
I am stupid. I've got a deadline. Don't want to do it.

1019
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:19,320
What the hell is wrong with me?

1020
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:47,640
What they came for instead, I'm tweeting. That's why there's no

1021
01:33:47,640 --> 01:34:01,320
heat and holes in the ceiling. Yeah, it's quite the burden. It's a hard knock life being a genius.
