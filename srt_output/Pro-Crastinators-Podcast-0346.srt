1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That son of a bitch.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That son of a bitch.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Alright.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So you want to hear some weird, funny stuff that will make you go,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Wow!

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm recording, I'm just starting to get some...

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, alright, hello everybody.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Sorry, okay.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Alright, we'll start off with some goss.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Do you hear what happened with...

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Remember May, aka Digibro?

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, no.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're not ready for this.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm probably not ready for it, but sure, go ahead.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's about as bad.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's as bad as you can get without incarceration.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Without, like, people are in jail over this.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I mean, the word on that is that

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ethan has been tweeting that May,

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
aka Amanda Lynn Morris,

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
has only about one week after they got married at Ralphamania.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is true.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Every word is true.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You know, there was a whole situation where her dad

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
didn't want them to get married, didn't like Ralph,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and, like, stole the championship belt

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that was going to be the prize.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You don't know any of this?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Of course not.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why would I keep tabs on something so stupid?

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I thought I might have mentioned.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I thought I might have mentioned it on the show.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
First of all, I hadn't heard that she got married.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You hadn't heard about Ralphamania.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, start with that briefly, because that sounds funny.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Is that, like, a wrestling match and a wedding combined?

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Is that what I think it sounds like?

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I think so. I think so.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Honestly, I don't know exactly what it entails.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You may now pile driver the bride.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I mean, given Ralph's proclivities, yeah, probably.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I mean, I don't know exactly what Ralphamania entails,

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but I know that there was...

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, they had planned to get married a couple months ago,

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I think, at a bowling alley.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Like, bowling alley event.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And they were going to get married,

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and then Ralph got, like, punched, or he got beat up.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And he's, like... Like he does.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Like he does, and he was, like, bruised enough

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
that they canceled the wedding, and they were like,

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
we'll do this later.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What a life.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I know.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So that happened, and then...

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't exactly know the details,

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
but some shit went down, and Ethan or Amanda's family

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
did not like Ralph, and they were, like,

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
don't marry him, and she was, like,

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
fuck you, I'm gonna marry him.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And Ralph was, like, fuck you,

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
your daughters are gonna marry me.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And Amanda's dad...

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't think... Okay, I think they left some stuff

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
in Amanda's dad's house,

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and Amanda's dad, like, got rid of it,

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
or did something with it, and this included

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
the championship belt that was to be awarded

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
at Ralph Amania.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And so Amanda's dad stole this belt,

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and this was a big point of contention.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He's the champion now.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He's the champion, bitch!

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's what he's gonna do about it.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So that's the backstory.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But they did get married, literally, like, a week ago.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And now, as of yesterday,

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Ethan is tweeting,

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
they were in New York or something,

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and Amanda has taken their kid

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and fled, and has disappeared,

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
has kidnapped their child,

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and has disappeared into New York City, or something.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, and is missing.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What?

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know.

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What information is there on this?

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is it just the tweets?

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Just what Ethan said is, like,

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
she's taken our kid, she's gone,

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have no wife, only a whore.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Stuff like that.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Insults to her family.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Suggestions that he fucked her sister,

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
which I would say is probably not true.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's probably just saying stuff,

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
because he does that.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So they got married.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Amanda and Mae was all about it.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then ran away.

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Did she need the marriage for something?

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What?

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You think it was a preenup,

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
a marriage scheme?

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Like, haha, now we're going to get divorced and take him?

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't think she's smart enough for that.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's why I'm confused.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What on earth could be the reason?

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How could you go so far with Ethan Ralph,

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and then run away?

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You would run away immediately.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I mean,

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I was thinking it's like,

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the fact that this is immediately after they get married

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
makes it so much more of a hassle.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Like, now you have to get, if you leave,

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
now you have to go through the whole legal process

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
of getting the marriage in old.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Divorced, as they call it these days.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I feel like that's bad,

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
but I don't know, maybe,

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
maybe she did it to get a freaking child support.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Maybe the whole thing was just a big child support scheme.

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Or maybe at some point it became,

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you know what?

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Maybe I'm giving her too much credit,

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
but maybe she thought

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
that if she went through with the marriage,

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
she could get a better,

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
whatever you call it, alimony settlement,

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
if they divorce,

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
because they have their kid.

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Which would honestly be pretty smart.

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sort of.

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How do we know if she ran away?

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What if she was kidnapped?

143
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What if this is like a movie?

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ethan said they had an argument or something.

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

146
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That makes it sound like,

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
like,

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
all right, now I'm thinking

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ethan was waiting for the marriage.

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that's where he truly spews his bile.

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Showed his true colors.

153
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He showed his true colors.

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Like, now that you're married to me,

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
perhaps, perhaps.

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But then he's like so

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
bare-facedly awful.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, right.

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't even know what they could argue about.

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Maybe Ethan Ralph was going

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
two left wing.

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's like,

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
he like sees on like a magazine cover.

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He sees like

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Alexander Ocasio-Cortez

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and he's just like,

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
hmm, were you looking at her again?

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Keep your eyes off her

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
buster.

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Ugh.

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh.

172
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, that's pretty funny.

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It is pretty funny.

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's the

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
honestly first smart thing

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Amanda's done

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
possibly ever.

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, I guess.

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Aside from leaving Trixie,

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
but I mean that kind of goes hand in hand

181
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
with getting with Ethan Ralph.

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Not sure if I would say it was a net

183
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
positive. Probably not, honestly.

184
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But

185
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
alimony though.

186
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's sweet alimony.

187
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Maybe.

188
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's just so, like, outrageous.

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It is outrageous. I know. I saw this.

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It was Michelle.

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Michelle DM'd me to be like,

192
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
look at these screenshots.

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like, oh my god.

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well,

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I guess I'm glad for the update.

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Michelle's my man on the inside.

197
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Whenever there's hot goss,

198
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Michelle is like, yo, check it out.

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, fuck.

200
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ah, shit.

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I guess that's all I could say about that.

202
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm only seven minutes in.

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Welcome everyone to the pro-crastinators podcast.

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Pro-crastinators podcast.

205
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That was the intro.

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay.

207
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I have a couple things to say.

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
One,

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
the

210
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the project that we

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
discussed last week,

212
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you know, other than

213
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the cover art mockups that I

214
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
showed you, I did a little

215
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
speculative

216
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
cover design. Other than that, I have

217
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
not done anything on it.

218
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's okay.

219
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I have reasons, but my reasons for that

220
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
partially include

221
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that I spent a considerable amount of this

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
week trying to get the RSSS feed

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
updated.

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It was a bitch.

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Man, yeah, did you see what I

226
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
said?

227
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't really understand

228
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
what it requires

229
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
or what's broken, but it sounded

230
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
like it was hell and

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
way more complicated than it needed to be.

232
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It was hard for me the

233
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
first time, like when Tom explained how

234
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
it worked, it was tough for me to get to grips

235
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
with it just because there's a lot of steps involved.

236
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I had to log into a bunch of websites

237
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'd never logged into before,

238
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and I had to, you know,

239
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
do all this stuff.

240
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But I figured it out, and that was a couple months ago.

241
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And then

242
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I try to get in there today, and I do

243
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and I'm doing exactly the same thing, and it's not working

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and I'm like, what's wrong, what's wrong?

245
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So I spent like two days trying to

246
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
figure it out and talking to customer service

247
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and what eventually comes out

248
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the second time I talk to customer service

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
is it seems like there are new data limits

250
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
that were not there before.

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So I have imposed a new restriction

252
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
of only, the website can only store

253
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the hosting will only host 50

254
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
gigabytes of data.

255
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And we're already up to 66 gigabytes

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
which means, and that's why

257
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
it wasn't letting me upload anymore stuff.

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How, what's

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
making up those gigabytes? Is it like

260
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
just the MP3s?

261
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah, it's the MP3, it's the 345,

262
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
well 315 MP3s

263
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
of the podcast. Yeah, okay, that's a lot of MP3s.

264
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah.

265
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So, and this is really bad because

266
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I mean, one, it means I can't

267
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I mean, I can't add anymore, I can't add

268
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
any more data

269
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
with this host.

270
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There's no more room.

271
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Is it not like an upgrade

272
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
to a bigger plan thing?

273
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't,

274
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
there probably is.

275
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Honestly, I clicked around their website

276
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and I couldn't really find

277
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
like a clear statement

278
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
of like, what are the plans?

279
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Like what would it cost to upgrade?

280
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm kind of just pissed

281
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
because like

282
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
there was room before

283
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
like we didn't change what we were doing

284
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
but they've changed what they're giving us

285
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
for the money we were paying them.

286
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That pisses me off.

287
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But yeah,

288
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I couldn't really figure out exactly

289
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
how much it would cost

290
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
to increase our storage size.

291
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Theoretically, maybe

292
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
there's a way that we could just pay them more

293
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and get more storage.

294
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Or we could

295
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
switching hosts with Theoretically also

296
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
work.

297
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Although we'd have to go and update all the

298
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
previous links

299
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
if the stuff was hosted on the new server.

300
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And yeah,

301
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
just

302
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
very discouraging.

303
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Very discouraging.

304
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What good is the website?

305
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Because we had it

306
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
specifically to make the

307
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
thing link to iTunes or whatever.

308
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, the website

309
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
posting on the website

310
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and again,

311
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't really understand how RSS works.

312
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I just know that when I make the post on the website

313
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
it auto posts to

314
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Spotify, iTunes,

315
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
whatever.

316
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So it does that

317
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
which is

318
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
good.

319
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But also

320
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know if like anybody

321
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know if anybody even uses those

322
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
apps. I mean, not that regularly.

323
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And uh...

324
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There's always a couple people.

325
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There's a couple people. There is a couple.

326
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I know. Yeah.

327
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think it's literally just because

328
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
if you're on your phone

329
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
you need to pay for YouTube

330
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
red

331
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
or like it's a hassle

332
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
to listen on YouTube. Yeah, it's easier

333
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to listen on your phone

334
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
in mp3 format or whatever.

335
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's fine.

336
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I guess I get it.

337
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But you know, most people

338
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
don't do it that way.

339
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And

340
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
other than that the website,

341
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I mean, it's a convenient

342
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
archive like you said

343
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and

344
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I guess the plan was we were going to be releasing

345
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the perfect

346
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
comic party through the website

347
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
which makes

348
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
sense.

349
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Um...

350
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I mean this storage limit is a

351
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
pretty fucking like we can't do that

352
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
until that's resolved.

353
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So...

354
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, I guess I like having the

355
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
website. It's just like

356
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
a lot of trouble associated

357
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
with it and now there's a bit of

358
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
new hurdle

359
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that is

360
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
a new challenge

361
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
for us to rise to

362
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and overcome.

363
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I think we will have to either upgrade

364
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
our choices are we upgrade

365
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
or we get a new host and figure out

366
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
how to make the website work with the new host

367
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
or we just can't, we delete the website.

368
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah.

369
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Those are the three paths forward.

370
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Well, what was the thing

371
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
like the thing

372
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
that was like

373
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
make podcasts

374
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
easy. You just put a thing and it does everything.

375
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What was that?

376
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Somebody said that, Chip said that.

377
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Chip said something called, was it called

378
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Autumn?

379
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It was called like Autumn.fm,

380
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Anchor.fm

381
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The best hassle free option for

382
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
podcast hosting. You just upload the audio

383
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
file in one place and it gets published to all the

384
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
apps. Yeah, I mean

385
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I vaguely heard of that before.

386
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I guess if we delete the website

387
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
then we could try that

388
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
see if it's easier.

389
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's what the RSS feed

390
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
does for us now.

391
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So

392
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I guess RSS feed

393
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
is like the

394
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
tech person

395
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
the tech

396
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
what's the word legitimate

397
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
tech literate person's

398
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
version of Anchor.

399
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If you know what you're doing

400
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
you can avoid using

401
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
a software that's owned by somebody.

402
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I mean I guess

403
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
if we got rid of the website

404
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that would allow us

405
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to continue

406
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
updating all the apps simultaneously

407
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
which could be useful.

408
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Honestly

409
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
now that I've cooled down a little bit

410
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
if it's

411
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
not

412
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
particularly expensive

413
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
upgrading our

414
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
fucking stupid Bluehost subscription

415
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is probably the easiest and most pain

416
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
free way to do it

417
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
depending on how much

418
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
but again I clicked around and tried to

419
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
look for

420
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
plans and like the website was very cagey

421
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
about it and I couldn't just find a clear

422
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
like

423
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
10 more dollars a month and we'll upgrade

424
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you from 50 to 500

425
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
gigabytes or something like that

426
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
websites

427
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
websites so anyway

428
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
that's I didn't do a lot of stuff this week

429
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I didn't stream I didn't stream again

430
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I dropped the ball I meant

431
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
to start streaming battle network

432
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and then I didn't do anymore that

433
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
this week because I was

434
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
what the fuck I feel like a lot

435
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
happened this week and yet I didn't get anything

436
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
done that's what it feels like

437
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
yeah same

438
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
probably for

439
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
completely different reasons

440
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
maybe I had stuff going on on Friday

441
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
yesterday

442
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000

I can be the second guitar

453
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
again whenever they would be

454
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
would be at the same venue

455
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
it might be that was a good venue

456
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
hmm

457
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
uh

458
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
yeah probably

459
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
yeah what things are being talked about

460
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
about like watch

461
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
like how to set it all up and

462
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
we're still just

463
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
playing that they're playing songs they

464
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
because they've been playing together for like

465
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't know 20 years

466
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
um 15 years

467
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
probably so they've done

468
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
a lot of songs they know a lot of songs

469
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and they can be like oh what about man on the moon

470
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
oh yeah if you believe

471
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
they put a man on the moon and they just play

472
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
it I'm like oh okay and I look

473
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
it up on my phone I do the causes play along

474
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
but when we get an actual set list together

475
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I can practice properly

476
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
sick sick so that's

477
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
gonna be fun

478
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
mm-hmm

479
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
um yeah

480
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
so these are just plans you haven't

481
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
really started practicing

482
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
putting this out list together okay now

483
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000

484
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and Saturday nights all right for fighting

485
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
we're probably gonna do you know those

486
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I

487
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I can't place

488
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the tune of either of those

489
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
uh

490
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000

he's a flash

495
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I mean it's hard to

496
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
like I don't know if I know that one

497
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
the riff cause it's very simple

498
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Saturday nights all right for fighting is Elton John

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000

502
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000

503
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
better better better

504
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000

good old boomer classics

507
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
um

508
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
you should play uh

509
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
how can you can you add

510
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
uh

511
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
battle against a true hero

512
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
uh what's that

513
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
uh from on the tail

514
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
oh yeah

515
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
um I don't know

516
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
wait wait is it

517
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
is it the

518
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
oh god I can't now I can't think of a tune

519
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
um is it

520
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000

521
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
is that

522
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
is that

523
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,560
that's that's asgore

524
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
fuck

525
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,640
now I'm blanking battle against a true hero is my favorite underkill

526
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
it's the undying grim dark version

527
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
what's the

528
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
the genocide root

529
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
um

530
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I feel so dumb

531
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
now I'm like disturbed that I can't

532
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
think of it but it's but you whatever

533
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
one. I also am blanking on it. I think you had it for half a second, but then you switched

534
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,960
the Asgore thing and now it's blanked my memory. No! You had it. You did have it. Battle against

535
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,000
a true... Wait, wait. I know it starts with a little piano. Kind of like Asgore. It starts

536
00:19:44,000 --> 00:20:00,000
with a little piano progression. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you.

537
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Okay, well, that's... Okay, here's my proposed set list. Battle against a true hero. Asgore.

538
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What do we think? What do we think? They like to, because they got a singer, they like to sing songs

539
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
that you have lyrics to. Sorry, buddy. Okay, we can work around that. They're going to do

540
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
comfortably now. We practiced that last night. It sounded amazing. Sick. I know that one. I do

541
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
know that one. Yes. Yes. I have not played any more Disco Elysium this week. I'm still on

542
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
day three, cringe. Did I play anything since last week? I think I played a little bit, but I didn't do

543
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:59,000
all that much. I think I went around. I talked to the big fat man in the container again. He gave me

544
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
a new task. Oh yeah, I went into the little doors, like break into this door and send him a message. I

545
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
didn't do that. I broke into the door. I used the key. I got from Mannyana and then I looked inside. I was

546
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
like, oh, it's a little place. I guess I want to spoil. Everard gave me the key. Even though I'm a

547
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
communist, I didn't do it because I didn't like embossing me around. I have not done it yet, but I'm

548
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
leaning towards I probably will do it. Not because Everard told me to, but because everyone else in the

549
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Union seems good and they all like Everard and work for him. For their sake, I'll probably do it.

550
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I think I talked to Mannyana and he's like, yeah, of course Everard's corrupt, but who wouldn't be? We put up

551
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
with a little bit of that, oh, he's got a fancy chair just because he does care about the Union and

552
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,000
getting the people what they need. It's hard to imagine because he's so ugly and so annoying voice

553
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and he's busting me around, but maybe it's true.

554
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Honestly, I admire a little bit that he's just unapologetically corrupt. He's just like, yeah, I'm a

555
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
fucking smug. Yeah, I'm an oily businessman. You know, what of it? Okay, all right, that's fair.

556
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Doesn't it say in his dialogue somewhere that he's so oily that you can't even tell, even when he's

557
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,000
telling the truth, it sounds like a lie. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, somewhere. Rules. So, I mean, I don't

558
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
like embossed me around, but Mannyana says he's good and frickin' the little Irish man says he's good

559
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and all the Union people seem to are with him. So like, okay, whatever. But I mean, but Measurehead

560
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
works for him and Measurehead is a real scumbag. So that's bad.

561
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh, right. Measurement man.

562
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Measurement, measurement man.

563
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I realize who that is now because I never went to, like, they talked about this guy who's like blocking

564
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the way and I'm like, okay, well, I'm going to bother because like, it's probably going to beat me up.

565
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I didn't go talk to him. I didn't interact with him at all. I found the other way. I already found the other

566
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
way round. Yeah, I went back that way and I talked to everyone that way. And I had no reason, I think just to go talk

567
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
to that guy. So I just haven't yet. I am by now I realize that's who that is. I should talk to him. I can get some

568
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
XP's and get some XP's for my human brain.

569
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I would recommend it. I think I had a very unlikely, I had a very unlikely success against him on some skill

570
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
checks that let me get through him. I think I was not really supposed to get by him with my build, but he's got lucky.

571
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Which, you know, whatever, I'll take it.

572
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
He's pretty funny. Have you met the crypto zoologist?

573
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Oh, I haven't. I've met his wife in the wheelchair. She says, oh, I need to find him. I don't know where he is.

574
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And I was like, okay, I'll do that side quest. Side quest accepted.

575
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
What about the race? Have you met the racist Laurie driver? I'm sure you've met the racist Laurie driver.

576
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Well, the guy standing in the middle of the street.

577
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, yeah, I talked to him. I think I mentioned that last time.

578
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah, probably.

579
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The new guy I talked to, I guess I talked, I went into the apartment complex. There was the lady sweeping.

580
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, lady sweeping and the artist girl.

581
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:13,000
The artist girl and the guy overlooking the crime scene, who I finally realized I could go back around that way.

582
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The boy with the open shirt and the cigarette.

583
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah, I didn't realize the area where the girl was was somewhere I could go.

584
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, did you just talk to her from down below previously?

585
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah, but even when I talk now that I've ruined my relationship with Kuno, I talk to her from the back and she doesn't even turn around. She ignores me.

586
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Really?

587
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah.

588
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, wait, you mean the forest girl?

589
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Oh, the forest girl, yeah.

590
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Not the artist girl.

591
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No, no, no. I did talk to the artist girl from below. I haven't talked to her again. But the guy with the cigarette, I couldn't get him to say anything, so I had to go and talk to the old lady, get his room number.

592
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah.

593
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And then I have to come back at a specific time the next day and I'm like, shit, I'm going to forget. I'm going to be walking around being like, oh, shit, it's time and I'm not there.

594
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I was, I remember, I think, what did he say, like come back at like 21 hours or something? And I was like, I remember I went to go see Everard and like I was in Everard's office and I was keeping my eye on the clock the whole time.

595
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because I'm like, I got to meet that guy on the balcony in like 15 minutes.

596
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Are we going to wrap, are we done here? Are we done here, Mr. Clare? Yeah.

597
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay, but you haven't gone to meet him yet.

598
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
No.

599
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Okay.

600
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah, well, how long nothing in particular going on?

601
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm just sort of, there's a lots of things that I'm failing at and I'm like, okay, well, couldn't, I couldn't, oh, I did the worst thing when I talked to the Hardy boys again after Everard said, tell the Hardy boys to cooperate with me, I go back to them.

602
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I do some dialogue but I can't really do anything. But there's this one, try to intimidate them, try to show them who's boss and it failed and then I couldn't help but put my gun in my mouth.

603
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Are you fucking serious?

604
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I was like, I asked Kim for the gun because that was the only option I had. It's like, oh fuck, I fucked up, this is the path I shouldn't have gone down.

605
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You asked Hardy for his gun.

606
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I asked Kim for his gun because I didn't have one. It's like Kim, that's the only way and I couldn't back out of it. I was on the path.

607
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
That's really fucked up.

608
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So Kim was like, okay. And then I had his gun and I could only, because I had failed it earlier, the only thing I could do was think about what I was doing and how stupid it was.

609
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And then once those were done, the only thing was I could put the gun in my mouth and say, if you don't respect me, I'll kill myself.

610
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'll fucking do it.

611
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And there was an option to put the finger on the trigger to increase the tension. I don't know whether that would have made it more likely it would have worked or whether I would have just died so I didn't do that.

612
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I backed out. I was like, no, this is bad. So all I did was lose morale and the respect of everyone there, including Kim, who thinks I'm insane.

613
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Oh no, that sucks.

614
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's so embarrassing.

615
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Things went pretty well with the Hardy boys for me. Although, okay, you know, I had-

616
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It was a 58% chance to succeed, so I thought it was fine, but no. No. I did the worst possible thing, the most embarrassing. I'm such a fuck up with everyone.

617
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah, you're a real sorry cop. You're a real sorry cop, I gotta say.

618
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I haven't been saved scumming though. I was told not to do that and I was like, this is fun, even though I'm so embarrassing, the game doesn't end, so it's fine.

619
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think it's okay to let yourself fuck up a little bit.

620
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I had a couple deaths and so this was on, I guess you could call it an alternate timeline, because this got reversed with one of my deaths.

621
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But before I met the Hardy boys, on the first day, when I met, well, you know, I forget her name, but the lawyer girl who was pretending to be the gardener,

622
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:45,000
When I talked to her the first time, I had, I think I had like a critical failure of like a role, and my whatever personality trait of me was like,

623
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
you literally cannot think of anything other than the fact that her skin is a different color than yours.

624
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh yeah, I got the same thing.

625
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And I said, it's like, you're black. What?

626
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, she brought that up later.

627
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Fortunately, that got reversed with one of my losses, so I actually have to deal with that.

628
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah, well, I did that, because it was the only option, because I failed it, and it's just like, okay, and I'm like, yeah.

629
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What kind of music do you listen to?

630
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm just observing here, like there was no option that was good.

631
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
What kind of music do you listen to? Whatever's on the radio? Okay, bye.

632
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And so when she was revealed to be a lawyer, she saw me and it's like, ah, it's the guy who like, I forget exactly how she put it.

633
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It was like, oh, it's the cop who knows I'm black. Hello.

634
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Like she just brings it up again. God damn it.

635
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
True. Very, very observant. Do you know your name yet?

636
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I do. Do you know it?

637
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah.

638
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's Harry Dubois.

639
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

640
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You have not found the cryptozoologist, so you have probably not been down to like the fishing village or the church, right?

641
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yes, I haven't really, like I feel like I've walked around there, but just haven't found.

642
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I saw the statue, the big exploded statue, and it's like, that's cool.

643
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But I didn't think you could go further south.

644
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
There's a, yeah, I was pretty surprised.

645
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
There's quite a lot of territory to cover down there that I kind of didn't even realize at first.

646
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, when I went to the bookstore, there was like the maps on the wall and I bought the postcard and I looked at it and I was like, oh, there's a whole other like southern area.

647
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Yeah, there is a whole other area.

648
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I think it's like across the bay or something like that.

649
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, it's like the bit where the restaurant is, it's like the end point of the harbor kind of.

650
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah.

651
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Well, I guess where the harbor is, is where the harbor is.

652
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You gotta cross over, I think it's called a waterlock.

653
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's sort of like a drawbridge, and that's how you get to sort of a whole kind of second section beside from like the city area.

654
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
There's going to be so many bottles I can pick up and put in my bag.

655
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Hell yeah.

656
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I kind of like ran through that area like almost without talking to anyone.

657
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So like that, I've like walked all around there down there, but I have not really explored it.

658
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I haven't like done most of the stuff to do down there.

659
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm kind of, I gotta do that.

660
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I gotta do that and I gotta, I gotta go back into.

661
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay, you, did you do the like bookstore, like did you go into like the back rooms?

662
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yes, I explored all that.

663
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You find the dice?

664
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The dice lady, yes.

665
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Okay, I think we talked about this.

666
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I missed that and I have to go back and do that.

667
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah.

668
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Did you do the thing, the like the intercom thing and you found like the spooky lady who kept repeating herself?

669
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
No, I did not find the spooky lady.

670
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah, I think it's discovered.

671
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I thought of it, but like my character didn't think of it for a while, that it's like a recording of somebody on the phone.

672
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:25,000
She keeps repeating a bunch of stuff when you press the button and it's like from a company that no longer exists, which has been renamed and it's like the wrong number and stuff.

673
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I don't know where that is physically in the building, so I don't know if I could find that.

674
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah, I haven't done that yet and I, you have not been down south to the church.

675
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I know that the kids, well, you don't know, but there's some kids down there and they mentioned that there was a lady, a mysterious lady in the church.

676
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And just because there's like a mysterious lady in the back of the bookstore and a mysterious lady in the church, I thought, are these the same mysterious lady?

677
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Are these perhaps both of the same mysterious lady who was there at the crime scene with the Hardy Boys, who's left the lights at the footprints?

678
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Hmm, but probably not actually, it probably just started multiple mysterious ladies.

679
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I got the sense that the mysterious lady on the phone, she was responding to somebody, which could be a clue, but it seemed like it was a very old recording.

680
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Because it was for a company that didn't exist anymore, but I guess, I don't know when the company stopped existing.

681
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I think I talked to the dice girl about that. She has info about all of the failed enterprises. You can ask about all of them.

682
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I must have missed a big path back there, because I didn't find any of that.

683
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Did you bring the torch?

684
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, I did. Maybe I just was in a hurry to do something else and I was like, I'll come back later.

685
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah.

686
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I found the gun back there.

687
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
What?

688
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I haven't found the gun yet.

689
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Oh, not like a gun gun. There's like an old gun.

690
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh, yeah, no, I found the stashed in the walls.

691
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah.

692
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Like the rifle. Yeah, I picked that up.

693
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah, I found that and I found the polar bear freezer and, oh wait, I think I found a second freaking, did I find like a second computer cube?

694
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Oh, I didn't find a second one of those.

695
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I feel like I found...

696
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Hang on, I need to go pee, sorry.

697
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Or maybe I just found the first one.

698
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Wait, you need, what?

699
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I need to go pee, sorry.

700
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Okay.

701
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Hello?

702
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

703
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So where were we? Disco Elysium.

704
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, although I haven't been playing it, so I don't have much new to report on my end.

705
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah, good game though.

706
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Pretty good game.

707
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Pretty good game.

708
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I was listening to some Grimbeard reviews and I re-listened to his video about planescape torment and he pretty much...

709
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:21,000
He pretty much says directly that he considers Disco Elysium to be like the truest and most successful successor to planescape torment.

710
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Seems like a pretty nice thing to say about a video game.

711
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I've heard of planescape torment a lot, but I've never gone to play it.

712
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I started it once and I didn't get very far before I found something that frustrated me and I put it down and I didn't pick it up again.

713
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Although, it's kind of...

714
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I mean, you can die in that game as many times as you want and it's fine.

715
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The thing that frustrated me was there was like an item that I found that I used and that I felt like I should not have used.

716
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And I was like, should I reset my save so I get the item back?

717
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah, and I was like, I'll worry about it later.

718
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh, I had such a great idea for a meme for Disco Elysium.

719
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I might still make this, but it's just a little involved.

720
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
There's a Snoopy comic.

721
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
This depends on whether I can find the Snoopy comic.

722
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
There's a Snoopy comic where Snoopy is talking about how he hid his foot or something.

723
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And his head blames his eyes for getting hurt and the leg blames his brain.

724
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
He's talking about different aspects of his body that are arguing with each other.

725
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And then at the end, he's like, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to get involved.

726
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And I was like, what if you could replace those words with rhetoric and drama and a physical instrument?

727
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Because it's just like how the little Disco Elysium facets of your brain can sometimes disagree.

728
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What a funny meme, guys.

729
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I mean, yeah, good meme.

730
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Just make him Snoopy.

731
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
When I'm down, just make him Snoopy.

732
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Give him the old make him Snoopy.

733
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Do you do that now where you're having thoughts and you're like, oh, this is the rhetoric part of my brain.

734
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
This is the, what are the names of them?

735
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Inland Empire.

736
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
This is the conceptualization.

737
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
No.

738
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
This is the empathy part coming through.

739
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Like if I was in a discord call, I could talk to different aspects of myself.

740
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That part never comes through.

741
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
No, not really.

742
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Dang, maybe I'm fucked up.

743
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Maybe I'm all free.

744
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I mean, just like in real life, you know, in the game, I'm maxed out on encyclopedia,

745
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
which is the only part I ever hear from.

746
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It is funny how you see something and encyclopedia will give you a lengthy explanation of what it is,

747
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
even though it's very simple what that is.

748
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Sometimes.

749
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Sometimes, yeah.

750
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And it's just sort of like, I wonder if people's brains work like that where they see something and they can't help but think,

751
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
oh, yes, that is what this is.

752
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I guess it's not like that.

753
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, definitely.

754
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But like not in a spoken word, like sentence structure sort of way.

755
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
They just sort of know what something is.

756
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah, like in real time, that encyclopedia popping up to give you a text dump would take like a nanosecond.

757
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah.

758
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah.

759
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The brain's funny.

760
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I think it's serious.

761
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Serious business.

762
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Don't you forget it.

763
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay.

764
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:08,000
My favorite one is electrochemistry because it wants me to take drugs.

765
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
That is a pretty funny one.

766
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm like, it's odd because like in real life, taking drugs is bad.

767
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You never take drugs.

768
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Exactly.

769
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But in a video game.

770
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Nobody would actually take drugs in real life.

771
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
In a video game, you're not actually getting the high of a drug.

772
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You're thinking about the benefits to your character in game.

773
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And a lot of the time, I mean, maybe there are literal benefits like stats and stuff.

774
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I feel like a lot of the game is telling you that being extremely high and extremely drunk just makes you like an idiot and you do stupid things and you forget what you did.

775
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Because that's what your character has done.

776
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
They're super alcoholics.

777
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Like why would you indulge in that knowing how shitty everything is?

778
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay.

779
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I kind of want to do like a drug play through at some point.

780
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I saw someone on Twitter talking about it and they said that their experience was that like they started the game thinking they shouldn't do drugs.

781
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Because they were like, there's got to be some hidden negative to do in drugs.

782
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And then they took drugs and they were like, oh wow, actually taking drugs is like a huge mechanical benefit and your stats like benefit immensely from taking drugs.

783
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And then it turned out at the end, no, there actually was a hidden cost to it.

784
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Like, oh no.

785
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yeah.

786
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That's how it feels.

787
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I don't know what that is exactly, but that's just what they said there.

788
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Well, it's at the end.

789
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It's like at the end of Undertale, but with the genocide route.

790
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Like you're doing that.

791
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You did the genocide route once and then you look at the photos of all the Disco Elysium characters and then, oh, there's Kyra there.

792
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You fucked up.

793
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's the drug version of Kyra.

794
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Maybe.

795
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
With the red eyes.

796
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I mean, it reminds me of Lisa a little bit.

797
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Like.

798
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Simpson?

799
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
No, the game.

800
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah.

801
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,000
There's no, like, you don't get like the bad ending from using joy in Lisa, right?

802
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I can't, I never use joy because of how obviously bad it was and it turned people into beasts.

803
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And I didn't really want to risk having a moment where it's like you've taken too much joy over the course of your adventure.

804
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You just turn into a blob and that's it.

805
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah.

806
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Well, that doesn't happen.

807
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Yeah, I don't know that it happens.

808
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't think so.

809
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It would be cool if it did.

810
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If you take like a little bit too much, like maybe there'll be a tell in the game.

811
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's like you feel like this is a little too much, you know, a little moment of reflection to let you know that if you take one more, you'll turn into a blob.

812
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I think, I don't think it really, I don't think there really is like a big like story change to the game, whether you use joy or not.

813
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
There's like one, there's like one party member you can't get if you use joy, but like, who cares?

814
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yeah, that's kind of annoying, I feel like.

815
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That there's not more of a consequence?

816
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah, because it's like, I mean.

817
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Honestly, I kind of think it's fine because like narratively.

818
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah, I mean, what that what that tells me about the world and about the character is that like it was already too late.

819
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I suppose.

820
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
But you only know that once you've played the game and you know how it ends.

821
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And it's like, oh, so now I can play it because I know that there's not like a potential happy ending.

822
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Where you can live long and prosper and all that.

823
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
If you're gonna go out like you do.

824
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You may as well drug yourself up the whole way through because you know how it ends because it's.

825
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yeah, it's like it's like in a in a video game, like an RPG or it's like you don't actually know how many health potions you'll need.

826
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So you keep hold of so many of them.

827
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And by the time you finish the game, you're like, oh, I have 700 of these.

828
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I should have used them.

829
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I should have used them.

830
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah, the whole time.

831
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah, but you're right.

832
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I mean, I think that's probably why in the painful.

833
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's like, it's they make it as clear as they can that like, no, you're supposed to use the joy.

834
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You pretty much have to use the joy.

835
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
No, I resisted.

836
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I thought it would be so good.

837
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Did you did you actually get through it without using it?

838
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah, it's so fucking hard.

839
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Like you can't fucking beat Lobo.

840
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You can.

841
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's just that you need to do a lot of healing and make sure that every attack is as powerful as you possibly can.

842
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It's it's you're definitely supposed to use it.

843
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
The game is balanced on the assumption that you will use it.

844
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And yet and yet and the game tells you the game literally just writes like graffiti on the wall.

845
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It's like use joy like use it.

846
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But I know sinister.

847
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It feels like you're not supposed to listen.

848
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
That's what I thought.

849
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yeah, I thought that they're like that.

850
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Oh, no, you're not going to fuck me up.

851
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I know.

852
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I know what joy does.

853
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You're not.

854
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's like it's I thought it I felt like it was saying like, um, you know, these are the voices.

855
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
This game's this game's super hard.

856
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
This game's like super fucking hard, bro.

857
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And you're a little pansy pussy.

858
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So you better use joy and I'm like, fuck you.

859
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
No, I'm not.

860
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm the coolest.

861
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I'm going to be the hardest motherfucker ever.

862
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm going to slice everyone and I did.

863
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
God damn.

864
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah, I would recommend trying it because it's not.

865
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
As impossible as it seems.

866
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It's not luck based.

867
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You can.

868
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You can do it.

869
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Well, if I mean.

870
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah.

871
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Impressive.

872
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
But there's no like reward for it.

873
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
No.

874
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yeah.

875
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Just the reward of being able to say, haha, I did that in regular conversation and people go, what?

876
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yeah, I can't say that.

877
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I beat I beat Super Mario Brothers and I've did Lisa the joyful without using joy.

878
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Super Mario Brothers.

879
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Super Mario Brothers.

880
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It's hard.

881
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I mean, to be fair, I've never beaten Super Mario Brothers.

882
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Like all the way.

883
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't think so.

884
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah.

885
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Hmm.

886
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Hmm.

887
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Can I really even call myself a gamer?

888
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
If I didn't beat the first game ever made.

889
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
No, you can't be the first game ever made.

890
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I am the first game ever made.

891
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And why is he speak like that?

892
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Because that's how you said it about Rayman.

893
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Oh, video.

894
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The hardest game ever made.

895
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I do so many likes like pointless silly voices in those videos.

896
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah.

897
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I think it's literally just because I was reading the script and I realized I sounded like a

898
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
YouTuber.

899
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Like, I gotta sound weird.

900
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You gotta sound weird because I don't like.

901
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I should just say this next line weird so it doesn't get boring.

902
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah.

903
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's it's it's literally just I think I sound like a real loser real tool when I'm just

904
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
doing my script reading voice.

905
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Sure.

906
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm casually talking about stuff.

907
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I sound okay.

908
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:36,000
But like Rayman was it like I don't know how to like read a script in a non lame way.

909
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:45,000
No, I think if I was like, I mean, if you if you're someone like, if it's like a long

910
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
video, then I think you pretty much just have to accept I'm just going to sound boring to

911
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
myself because I'm going to be reading the script for like an hour.

912
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
If it's not, though, I totally am like, I get I get it.

913
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Like, I've been talking for five minutes now and like, is the audience really want me to

914
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
like, sit here and talk for five minutes?

915
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Like, it's boring.

916
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It gets boring after five minutes.

917
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I gotta do something.

918
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I gotta put a joke or an edit or I gotta zoom in my face so it's a little bit bigger and

919
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
then zoom it back out.

920
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Otherwise, they'll go back to playing Fortnite.

921
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Otherwise, they'll go back.

922
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Goodness knows that's worse than my video.

923
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Otherwise, they'll go back to doing what the zoomers do, which I gather is watching like

924
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
place together three videos in one like one is like a leftist political speech.

925
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
The other is like someone like running in Fortnite and the other is someone like, you

926
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
know, doing like slime like squishing slime in their hands.

927
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah, most satisfying compilations.

928
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I've seen I've seen those triple videos and I got to say they really work for me.

929
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I like it.

930
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
That's I watched one that was like a family guy clips.

931
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And then there was the train, the guy running on the train tracks and getting the coins

932
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and then there was like somebody using like a knife to like cut some weird soap thing.

933
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yes, the blue like soap.

934
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah.

935
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah.

936
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I was like, this is good.

937
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Actually, like people are like saying, oh my God, the children are so fucked.

938
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm like, no, they're not.

939
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
They're just they just like this is good.

940
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
This is a good like evolution.

941
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I gotta be honest.

942
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I didn't really get it.

943
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I was just like, why am I why are there three videos in one?

944
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
If I wanted to watch one of these videos, why wouldn't I just watch one of them?

945
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Because attention span.

946
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I mean, I know, I know so many people.

947
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It's such a normal thing now to like, when you listen to a podcast or a long video or

948
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
even just a video that you've seen before, you play a game at the same time, you have

949
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
two different stimulus.

950
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I mean, definitely.

951
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But I don't want them to put them together for me.

952
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I want to I want to customize my experience.

953
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I want to match the like the the podcast I want to listen to with the game I want to

954
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
play.

955
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
True.

956
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't I don't want them to do it for me.

957
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I don't mind it, though, because like this particular game they're showing is like that

958
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
guy running down.

959
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It's an endless runner.

960
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Yeah.

961
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
The the game that is the inputs that they put are like so simple like duck, jump, turn

962
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
to the left, turn to the right, get those coins.

963
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's not a very interesting game to watch, in my opinion.

964
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But like it wouldn't be an interesting game for me to play either.

965
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It's just sort of like, oh, look at him go while I listen to something.

966
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And then I switch my eyes over to the soap and I go back to the little guy.

967
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I do like the soap.

968
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I do like the cutting soap.

969
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah.

970
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
But I would just I would just I would just watch that.

971
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I watched someone cut soap on my own damn time.

972
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
How many times have you googled soap cutting?

973
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Rarely.

974
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Since you saw it.

975
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Very rarely.

976
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Oh, since none.

977
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Exactly.

978
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So that you need that curation.

979
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
You need them to do it for you.

980
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
You ain't going to look at it.

981
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I guess.

982
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I guess.

983
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I mean, I guess you're right.

984
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
All right.

985
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So lesson learned.

986
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I should be googling soap more.

987
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That'll that'll do that'll do a lot for me.

988
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Well, all all that is to say that I didn't do any work aside from a little bit on the

989
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
cover of the project.

990
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Yes, the perfect comic party comic party.

991
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I will at some point I will have to actually make that damn content.

992
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Yeah, I've worked a little bit to make some Clarissa had a bit of a little mental moment

993
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
or breakdown because, you know, that's that's just how I roll.

994
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Breakdown a moment minute.

995
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah.

996
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
But like I feel like I can.

997
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah, I can.

998
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I can do it.

999
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I can.

1000
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I can get that chapter ready.

1001
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The perfect comic party.

1002
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I think we've got a pretty good logo mockup.

1003
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I really liked your logo mockup.

1004
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Thank you.

1005
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I was thinking about like because it's I was looking at shown and jump and they've got

1006
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
the letters, the blocks text.

1007
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
You can write it vertical.

1008
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You can write it like horizontal, but each letter kanji, whatever fits in a square.

1009
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So it's quite easy to make it fit nicely on a rectangular sheet of paper.

1010
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Yeah.

1011
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But with PCP, you got so much wasted space underneath the P and it's hard to like put

1012
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
it in a way that it reads nicely.

1013
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I think I figured it out.

1014
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Do you want to wait?

1015
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Did you I'm not looking at the discord.

1016
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Do you want to post a shot of it or something?

1017
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
No, I want to draw a secret.

1018
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Okay.

1019
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Okay.

1020
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I want to draw it cleaner first.

1021
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Okay.

1022
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I have a I want to be nice and shiny and cool and bold and stuff.

1023
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And then yeah, once we once we have a little title, we have to have a logo we can use over

1024
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and over again.

1025
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah, it looked really good.

1026
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And I mentioned, I mean, because the frickin PCP, the Radcon dojin is supposed to be done

1027
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
really soon.

1028
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Like literally the only thing left for it is I think Kaiju has to draw the cover and

1029
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
like that's it.

1030
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And I don't know, we could put that in there or something.

1031
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We could include that in the first issue if it's done by then.

1032
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
We could include like parts of it per weekly publication.

1033
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And be like, oh, yeah, so one of the dojin because they're right.

1034
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It's in chapters because it's like chapter one.

1035
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That's one chapter per episode or per per issue.

1036
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But yeah, I need to get my head down nose to the grindstone get the Clarissa because

1037
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
it's like it's 20 something pages.

1038
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And I've got like three inked, not even like finished.

1039
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I got to do a bunch of inking and then I got to put the speech bubbles in there and then

1040
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
the shading is like, I want it to be nice.

1041
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So I'm not going to rush it out the door just so they can be part of this thing.

1042
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
That's why I didn't put like a deadline because I don't think I need to warm up to all this

1043
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,000
because I've been so like anti doing anything for like a month.

1044
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
To get get get the momentum going again.

1045
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Yeah, sure.

1046
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Ganbatte!

1047
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Kibucha!

1048
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Thank you.

1049
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Arigato.

1050
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Thank you.

1051
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
What else?

1052
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I guess I got I guess I don't have that much more to say about that.

1053
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's going to be fun.

1054
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It is going to be fun.

1055
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
You know, despite it being like, oh, we talked about it and it's not instantly a real thing.

1056
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It was really a, I don't mind that too much.

1057
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I think it's still like, it's a fun thing to think about getting done.

1058
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It was never going to be done in one week.

1059
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
No.

1060
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yeah.

1061
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I did think I could get more done.

1062
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Like I could get the title, the logo finished.

1063
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
But sometimes a week is fucked.

1064
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And then you and then you relapse and your therapist says, you know, you got to just fucking do it.

1065
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You idiot.

1066
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
They don't, they didn't say that.

1067
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
But like that was that was the essential thing.

1068
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Like you're, you're, you're, you're looking inwards and you're making yourself feel worse.

1069
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And so you have to, I can't remember exactly what they said.

1070
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I can read it later.

1071
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But like, it's essentially that they're not offering consulance, condolences or like pats on the back ruffles of the hair.

1072
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
They're saying, you know that you have to do this stuff.

1073
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So you'll feel better if you do it.

1074
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So do it.

1075
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And it's like, God, I wish you would just say, no, you can wallow in misery forever and it would be great.

1076
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But they won't say that.

1077
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I'll tell you that.

1078
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I say you can wallow in misery forever.

1079
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It's fine.

1080
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Do I really want to listen to Ben Saint?

1081
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I don't know.

1082
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
That devil's bargain.

1083
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah.

1084
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So I'll draw.

1085
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I'll draw.

1086
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And I'm going to do it.

1087
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:44,000
There's also, there's also the question because I had this last year, February drawing like booby images all over February last year.

1088
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
That was a daily draw thing.

1089
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I still want to do that.

1090
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I don't want it to be too serious though.

1091
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So I'd be a little, just a little doodle every day, something, something to get the blood pumping in my art hand.

1092
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Honestly, warming up is good.

1093
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Warming up every day is like a good thing to do that like real artists do that I have never done.

1094
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And that's probably why I'm a hack fraud and have to come up with stupid schemes like the perfect comic party to motivate me to do that.

1095
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It's all baked in.

1096
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Warming up is hard because you're drawing and you're like, this isn't a good drawing.

1097
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Right.

1098
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Because you're fucked in the head and you think every drawing has to be good.

1099
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
That's not how professionals do it.

1100
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
They draw billions of drawings.

1101
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And then they just, they get the work done.

1102
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I mean, I know, I already know that it's more important to put the hours in than it is to make progress during those hours.

1103
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Because putting the hours in makes you feel like productive, which helps you like mentally to stay on track.

1104
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
If you say like, I'm going to take a break today and you don't put those hours in.

1105
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Even if those hours are spent just looking at a sheet of blank paper, the fact that you did it means that it's easier to do it later.

1106
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And I know that, yet I know that.

1107
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And yet I'm just not sticking to my schedule.

1108
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm going to change that.

1109
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
This coming Monday, I'm going to change that.

1110
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:34,000
That's a different struggle you're describing than mine.

1111
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
What's your struggle?

1112
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
My struggle is not like, oh, I don't want to put the hours in.

1113
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I'm afraid my drawings will be bad, et cetera.

1114
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I don't know.

1115
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
My struggle is like, say it, you know, yeah, I could put the hours in.

1116
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And maybe the drawing will come out good.

1117
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So what?

1118
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yeah, that's the more fundamental like, why do anything thing I was struggling with.

1119
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1120
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Well, you got to do it for the perfect comic party, Ben.

1121
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
That's exactly right. That's exactly why. That's exactly right.

1122
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So there you go.

1123
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Nothing is real.

1124
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Everything is made of fake little lies we tell ourselves.

1125
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And our lie right now is the perfect comic party.

1126
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
That's good.

1127
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
We should make that the tagline, perfect comic party.

1128
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It's the lie we tell ourselves.

1129
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh, Ben, if you could translate that to Japanese, we could put that on the side.

1130
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Put that on the cover somewhere.

1131
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I could machine translate it.

1132
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I would probably want to ask an actual speaker how they would really translate.

1133
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
That's really funny, honestly.

1134
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
You can make a shirt.

1135
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
That would be a great shirt.

1136
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
The PCP logo, perfect comic party, and then the Japanese text underneath.

1137
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
It's the lie we tell ourselves.

1138
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I think we should rebrand everything.

1139
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Did I mention this last week?

1140
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I think you did, yeah.

1141
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
We've been needing a rebrand for a while,

1142
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
and I think this is the perfect opportunity to rebrand the Patreon,

1143
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
rebrand the YouTube channel, rebrand everything.

1144
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:43,000
In line with the new aesthetic of we do a comic compilation.

1145
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Submit your stuff if you want to be included in our ever so often regular comic publication

1146
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
where we publish our own comics instead of publications.

1147
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Hell yeah.

1148
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
It's the lie we tell ourselves, and it's the procrastinators podcast.

1149
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Yes.

1150
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You need to think of a way to squish perfect comic party into a square format for avatars and stuff.

1151
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,000
The fact that the website has this problem now is really frustrating though,

1152
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
because the plan was we were going to publish it on the website,

1153
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
so now I don't know what to do with that.

1154
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm sure we'll think of something.

1155
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Either way, we'd want the website to look nicer than it does currently.

1156
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You know, the website does look like shit now that you mentioned it.

1157
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Does it still have that default plant pot image?

1158
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yes.

1159
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
You know, it is crap.

1160
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
It's not a hip-happening joint that all the cool kids want to go to.

1161
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You know what?

1162
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
You make a good point, fuck WordPress.

1163
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Fuck everything.

1164
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Do you know how to make a website?

1165
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Because I really don't.

1166
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yeah.

1167
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I mean, I made mine.

1168
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Yeah, and it's nice and slick.

1169
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
It's a bit hard.

1170
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Mine is slick.

1171
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Honestly, I mean, if I were to be tasked with making a website,

1172
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
what I would probably do is just take my code for my website

1173
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
and take that as my baseline and just, you know,

1174
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
modify it, swap out assets, and re-theme it, basically.

1175
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah.

1176
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Because, I mean, my website is very pretty, you know,

1177
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
format-wise, it's pretty clean and straightforward and uncomplicated,

1178
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and it's just about, you know, presenting content front and center.

1179
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Yeah.

1180
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
So, yeah.

1181
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I feel like I've heard you say that it's a kind of,

1182
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
you built it in a kind of way where it's annoying to add new pages

1183
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
of things to comics.

1184
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I did.

1185
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Did you, like, improve that at some point?

1186
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Some, well, somewhat, yeah, somewhat.

1187
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I did make it, I did make it a bit more modular in that,

1188
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
like, I made it so that, like, more of it refers to, you know,

1189
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
a cascading style sheet, and therefore,

1190
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I don't have to change every individual page.

1191
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
If I want to make one little change, you know,

1192
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I made, like, one, I added an iframe that included a window

1193
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
into a sort of default template menu,

1194
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
so I can just change the menu file,

1195
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and that changes the menu on every page.

1196
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I did improve it somewhat with that, yeah.

1197
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I still have to, like, I still have to manually add, like,

1198
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
new pages, like, when there's a new, you know, page,

1199
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
when there's a new page of the comic, I have to add a new page of the website

1200
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
to accommodate it, but I mean, that's okay.

1201
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
How would we put Perfect Comic Party on a website like that?

1202
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Would it be page, one page per page,

1203
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
or would it be, like, a long scroll?

1204
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Honestly, I kind of think that if we did it like that,

1205
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
we wouldn't, like, even necessarily display it on the website.

1206
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It would just kind of be a home page with, like,

1207
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
a sort of dated index of, like, links to issues,

1208
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
and you would just download them.

1209
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Yeah, that was what I was initially thinking

1210
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
when it comes to PDF.

1211
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Okay.

1212
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
The website would basically, it would be a little bit of branding,

1213
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
you know, we got the title, we got some art, whatever,

1214
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
but it's mostly just a portal to,

1215
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
here's where you download the individual issues,

1216
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
and then, you know, here's where you can donate,

1217
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
here's where you can get rewards, whatever.

1218
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Yes.

1219
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Yeah.

1220
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
That would be sick, if we had a nice little website.

1221
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
It would be sick.

1222
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
We would need to figure out, and I mean, we could host,

1223
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
well, I mean, we'd need a new host,

1224
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
but I mean, we could just re-upload the, um...

1225
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
The MP3s.

1226
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
The podcasts, yeah.

1227
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
We could, you know, it would take a little doing,

1228
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
but it'd be fine.

1229
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Yeah, there's, um,

1230
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
the last, I think the dick show used to be, like,

1231
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
only on the website.

1232
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Well, I mean, you could listen to other apps.

1233
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I always went to the website to listen to it when I did,

1234
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
and they just had a player.

1235
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
You just have a page, and then the player, and you press play.

1236
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And it's like, that was pretty good.

1237
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
It meant that going to the website was, like,

1238
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
a thing you would do to see the new episode,

1239
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
and then it was like the spiel about what the hell

1240
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
it was about underneath, like a blog post.

1241
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I don't know if we, I don't think we have that

1242
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
on the current WordPress thing.

1243
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
We just have like a...

1244
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
The current WordPress just has the pretty much a very similar,

1245
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
like, to the YouTube description.

1246
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Yeah.

1247
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Underneath each post.

1248
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
How would you listen to it?

1249
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Would you have to download the MP3?

1250
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You can listen to it in line on the website.

1251
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
There is, like, just a play button,

1252
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
or you can download the MP3.

1253
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Okay, well, then that's fine.

1254
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
We could just have that again.

1255
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's doable.

1256
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I mean, the way it embeds

1257
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
is done through WordPress.

1258
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Whatever. I'm sure there's a simple way

1259
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
to just fucking add an MP3 player

1260
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
into your website.

1261
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I don't think that would be complicated.

1262
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I guess the only thing is the size of the files.

1263
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
That's, like, more than 50 gigabytes.

1264
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Yeah, no, it's the hosting that is the...

1265
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
That at this point is the sticking point.

1266
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You could host all of the images of your comics

1267
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
on your website.

1268
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Yeah, I mean, I have...

1269
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I mean, it's not 50 gigs worth, I don't think.

1270
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
But yeah, I just have, through a separate...

1271
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I think I use...

1272
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
What's the fucking hosting site that I use for that?

1273
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
SomethingMoon?

1274
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I don't remember.

1275
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
But yeah, I just have...

1276
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I bought the domain,

1277
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and I have the domain registered,

1278
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
like, $10 a month or something

1279
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
to just host...

1280
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Just to host all the data on the site.

1281
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And I'm not sure if there's a data limit on it or not.

1282
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Maybe we should use that service,

1283
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
because I've never had a problem with them.

1284
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Yeah. I use HostGator for the give-and-take.site.

1285
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
It's not... I don't think it's, like...

1286
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I don't know how much it is a month.

1287
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It gets as much as $10.

1288
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
We just need...

1289
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I should go and check and, like, see what are the data limits.

1290
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
We just need something that can host, you know,

1291
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
100 gigs, 200 gigs,

1292
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and I think we'd be good for the foreseeable future.

1293
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Yeah.

1294
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I guess I should ask fucking blue...

1295
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
We could ask Bluehost how much it would cost

1296
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
to up the data limit.

1297
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That's probably the move at this point.

1298
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Yeah, to upgrade, yeah.

1299
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Is it easy to change how it works?

1300
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Because if it's through WordPress,

1301
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
how would you change the code?

1302
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I'll be frank with you.

1303
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
If we wanted to, like, build a custom website,

1304
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I think we would just probably abandon WordPress

1305
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
because, I don't know,

1306
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
we would be stuck with all of its default shit.

1307
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:41,000
We would have to build a website from scratch.

1308
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Well, I guess we shouldn't worry about that too much right now.

1309
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
The MP3 thing is more important,

1310
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
and we can just...

1311
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Hosting is the most pressing issue.

1312
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Yeah, and then I guess making Perfect Comic Party exist

1313
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
comes before where we host it.

1314
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
True.

1315
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
True.

1316
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Like, we could have a Google Docs

1317
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
and put them on there in the meantime.

1318
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I mean, yeah, we can do that.

1319
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It's so low-rent.

1320
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Low-rent which?

1321
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Oh my god, I just...

1322
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Did I mention low-rent which is canceled?

1323
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I'll never get to see it.

1324
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You mentioned it on the stream we did.

1325
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Right.

1326
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Yeah, somebody asked...

1327
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Somebody asked Mint where's low-rent which

1328
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and Mint confirmed that it is canceled,

1329
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
so that's sad.

1330
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Tragic.

1331
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Terrible.

1332
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Terrible, terrible.

1333
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I was looking forward to it so much.

1334
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
She'd drawn thousands and thousands of frames, Gib.

1335
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I know, it's a big...

1336
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Mathematically, that's true.

1337
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
A waste of man hours on that.

1338
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
How dare you misgender those hours?

1339
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Oh, yeah, I guess that's a word now.

1340
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
What would you do?

1341
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Would you, like, ma'am hours?

1342
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Like, ma'am?

1343
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Yeah, ma'am hours is the opposite.

1344
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That's my go-to.

1345
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
It's like a ma'am word.

1346
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
You just say ma'am instead.

1347
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Sounds the same.

1348
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
That's pretty good.

1349
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
That's pretty good.

1350
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh, man, I saw...

1351
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Oh, man.

1352
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I saw a list.

1353
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Oh, ma'am.

1354
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I saw a list of gender neutral...

1355
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Suggestions for gender neutral words

1356
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
are like people in your family.

1357
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And they suck so much.

1358
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
That's like...

1359
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I wish...

1360
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I mean, maybe I could find them...

1361
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I mean, they're sibling and parent.

1362
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
What else is there?

1363
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Sure, sure.

1364
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Like, what words would you invent?

1365
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Well...

1366
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Like a gender neutral aunt, uncle?

1367
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Fucking notifications.

1368
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Fucking notifications for...

1369
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Fuck!

1370
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
All right, check in my likes.

1371
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Check in my likes.

1372
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Here we go, here we go.

1373
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Oh, God.

1374
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Look at this.

1375
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Here we go.

1376
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Here's the list I was talking about.

1377
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
ZZ.

1378
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
ZZ for aunts and uncles.

1379
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
You're not my aunt.

1380
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
You're not my uncle.

1381
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
You're my ZZ.

1382
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Hey, hey, my ZZs.

1383
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I kind of like...

1384
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I like nibbling.

1385
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
That's cute.

1386
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
But I guess nibbling's a little cute.

1387
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Sprong.

1388
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Horrible.

1389
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Yeah, sibling.

1390
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Sprong.

1391
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Ren.

1392
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Ren.

1393
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
What the fuck is that?

1394
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
God Ren, okay.

1395
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Enby Friend, fine.

1396
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Epox?

1397
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
What are you talking about?

1398
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Why are you in my house?

1399
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Wait.

1400
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Epo...

1401
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Cain or call?

1402
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Fiancé, fiancé.

1403
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Fiancé...

1404
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Wait, are those...

1405
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Do you have to say them different?

1406
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Where are you looking?

1407
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Epox.

1408
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Fiancé and fiancé.

1409
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Are they different words?

1410
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I didn't know they were gendered.

1411
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
You know, um...

1412
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Like one has an extra E.

1413
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I think...

1414
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Yeah, I guess they are,

1415
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
but I don't know if you say them differently.

1416
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Maybe in French you would.

1417
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Is it fiancé and fiancé?

1418
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Is that the difference?

1419
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
That's the same.

1420
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
It sounds the same.

1421
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
No, it's...

1422
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It's an emphasis on the wrong syllable.

1423
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Fiancé and fiancé.

1424
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Law?

1425
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Sure.

1426
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Well, it's kind of like...

1427
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
English.

1428
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Fiancé, fiancé.

1429
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You can say, you can say, you know,

1430
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
my résumé or my résumé,

1431
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
and both are acceptable.

1432
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Resumé, résumé.

1433
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Yeah, okay.

1434
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
That's so similar, but sure, I guess.

1435
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I mean, surely you...

1436
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I mean...

1437
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Yeah.

1438
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Tiz?

1439
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Tiz.

1440
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
For ma'am or service.

1441
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Some of these...

1442
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Some of these don't make any sense.

1443
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Like, I don't understand...

1444
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Yeah.

1445
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I don't understand what they're derived from,

1446
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and they don't...

1447
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Like, why would I say this?

1448
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Epos.

1449
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Goddex.

1450
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Goddex is kind of funny.

1451
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Goddex is funny.

1452
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Fenninbi.

1453
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I mean, okay.

1454
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I don't know about...

1455
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I don't mind, like, I don't...

1456
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I think I would refer to a gender-neutral god

1457
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
as just a god.

1458
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I'm sorry.

1459
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I'm sorry to default male, but...

1460
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I mean...

1461
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I'm sorry, but the word goddess

1462
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
is just the word for god

1463
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
with a female attachment.

1464
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
So just lose the attachments.

1465
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I think...

1466
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yeah, there's a few things like that.

1467
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Like, I don't like the term comedian,

1468
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
because comedian is...

1469
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I guess arguably male-centric,

1470
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
but it's also just what you would call

1471
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
somebody who does comedy.

1472
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Like, if they're neutral,

1473
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
gender-neutral, I feel like comedian works.

1474
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Yeah, why do you need another word?

1475
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Comedian works for all genders and no gender,

1476
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
and like...

1477
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
You don't need to make a gendered version

1478
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
for every possible permutation of a person.

1479
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
That's exactly what the...

1480
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Like, chef doesn't have a female equivalent.

1481
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
If you're a chef, you're a chef.

1482
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Well, we gotta make one.

1483
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
No, we don't.

1484
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
We gotta make one or else.

1485
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
That's exactly what the person that retweeted

1486
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
this list said.

1487
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
They said,

1488
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
why can't we just de-gender everything

1489
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
instead of making everything third-gender?

1490
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Yeah.

1491
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I think that's probably...

1492
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
That's probably right, yeah?

1493
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I mean, for some things,

1494
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
like Mr. and Mrs.,

1495
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
they are deliberately split-gender.

1496
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Yeah, we don't have to...

1497
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
We don't have to remove every gender

1498
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
under every circumstance.

1499
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
But for some things,

1500
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
like King Queen, we have monarch.

1501
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
We don't need another one.

1502
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Yeah.

1503
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
For God, I think we can just...

1504
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I think we can just dispense with the word goddess,

1505
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
unless you really want it.

1506
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And then, it's fine.

1507
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I don't think we need...

1508
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
We don't need God ex,

1509
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
even though it's really funny.

1510
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I guess you would use goddess

1511
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
when you're, like, looking at a beautiful woman

1512
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
online and you want to say something to her.

1513
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
You want to say,

1514
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
you want to say,

1515
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I always find myself in that situation.

1516
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And yes, it's true.

1517
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
It's a very useful word in that.

1518
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I mean,

1519
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I kind of get it.

1520
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's like...

1521
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I guess it's a little uneven that, like,

1522
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
you could call...

1523
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
You could call Aphrodite a god.

1524
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I mean, she is.

1525
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
You could also call her a goddess

1526
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
if you want to be specific about it.

1527
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
But there's no, like...

1528
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I don't... There's no masculine...

1529
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I feel like there's no masculine, like...

1530
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Oh, this is a god.

1531
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
What's the...

1532
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Oh, shit.

1533
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
What's the masculine suffix?

1534
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
There is none.

1535
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
We can make one of those.

1536
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Honestly, we should make one of those.

1537
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
If we want equality,

1538
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
let's just take God as the neutral one

1539
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and add a masculine suffix.

1540
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Goddick.

1541
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Godden.

1542
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Honestly, looking through these,

1543
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
they have, like,

1544
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
a consistency with Ren being a parent

1545
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
and then grandparent

1546
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
is a grandren.

1547
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Is it because it's a parent?

1548
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Oh, my goodness.

1549
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Probably.

1550
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I don't know if I like it.

1551
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Like, Ren!

1552
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It seems like you just picked something.

1553
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I don't want to go to school.

1554
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Ren!

1555
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Ren!

1556
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Like, instead of saying mom,

1557
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
you would say that.

1558
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I think it's supposed to be a shortening of parent.

1559
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And I mean, I don't know what...

1560
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I honestly don't hate Ren

1561
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
just because they've kept it

1562
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
with, like, grandparent,

1563
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
godparent.

1564
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I appreciate the consistency.

1565
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Like, if you wanted to invent a word

1566
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
that means neither male

1567
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
or female guardian parent

1568
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
and shorten it so that you could say easily,

1569
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
that's fine, I think.

1570
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I think that one's fine.

1571
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I don't understand Zeezy.

1572
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Zeezy, I don't know where that comes from.

1573
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Sprong is, like, Reddit.

1574
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
You would just say kiddo.

1575
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Kiddo is good.

1576
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Kiddo is good.

1577
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Child.

1578
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Child.

1579
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Offspring.

1580
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Offspring is a bit clinical.

1581
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Sprong is...

1582
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Don't you think it sounds Reddit, though?

1583
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Sprong?

1584
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Sprong sounds very much like

1585
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
someone who

1586
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
oils their mustache

1587
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
and wears...

1588
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
and goes to fucking Renfair

1589
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
LARP's

1590
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I guess I could say

1591
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
that Sprong

1592
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
is a funny thing.

1593
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It's a funny thing.

1594
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Sprong is wrong.

1595
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
It's like a dad joke

1596
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
or a Ren joke

1597
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
when, like...

1598
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Oh, Spring has Sprong and they have a Sprong.

1599
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And the Sprong is like

1600
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
fuck, shut up, Ren.

1601
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Shit.

1602
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
God.

1603
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
No, you shut up, Sprong.

1604
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Spring has Sprong.

1605
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
A police report.

1606
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
A police investigated

1607
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
reports of domestic violence

1608
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
between a Ren and their Sprong

1609
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
today,

1610
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
down on Main Street.

1611
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
You know, it's grown on me.

1612
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Some of these are grown on me.

1613
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Sorry, I can't say

1614
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
police because it's default mail.

1615
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I have to say a police ex.

1616
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I have to say police ex

1617
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
because I don't want to be overly specific.

1618
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
They have, like, police man, police woman,

1619
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
so police

1620
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
got a person, police ex.

1621
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Police Ren. Police Ren.

1622
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Police Ren.

1623
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Police ZZ.

1624
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Oh, wait, you say Jean Darme.

1625
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Or wait, that might be gendered, actually.

1626
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Man, sir, Tiz.

1627
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
What is that?

1628
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
What is that? I guess I just don't like the ones

1629
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
that I don't know where they come from.

1630
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
First of all,

1631
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
frankly, too many of these have Z's

1632
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and X's in them.

1633
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Cringe. They love...

1634
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Cringe letter. Cringe letter. Try hard.

1635
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
They love those letters. Don't like them.

1636
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Second of all,

1637
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I'm sorry, imagine.

1638
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Imagine you fucking go to a fancy

1639
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
ball

1640
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
and you go to the frickin'

1641
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
and you're going in and they're taking your coat

1642
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and they're like, mm, and the fucking

1643
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
butler is like, offers you

1644
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
an hors d'oeuvre and they say, mm,

1645
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
caviar, Tiz? Cause they don't know your gender.

1646
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I would kill myself.

1647
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Tiz? Tiz

1648
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Tiz sounds like coze, like it's too

1649
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
informal.

1650
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Like, man, sir, man, sir

1651
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
doesn't sound like them.

1652
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It sounds like it was completely made up out of

1653
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
whole cloth and the fact that I see no

1654
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
like, connection to the existing

1655
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
vocabulary at all

1656
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
is the most annoying thing about it.

1657
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Tiz this your order?

1658
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Yes, it is.

1659
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I think it's like,

1660
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
it's Tiz.

1661
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
It's not,

1662
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
it's too similar to different words.

1663
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yeah,

1664
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I also agree with that as well.

1665
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Lord and lady, lardy,

1666
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
lardy, lardy is

1667
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
not a good way to say it.

1668
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Lard, lard. Honestly, that one I

1669
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
understand, they're just kind of combining the words.

1670
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Like, okay, I get it.

1671
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
M'lard.

1672
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It's basically you're trying to sing both of them at the same time.

1673
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I see the logic.

1674
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I see the logic.

1675
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Feel free to spread this, it says,

1676
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
and I did, so.

1677
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Spread it on some toast.

1678
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Yo, it's time for my oatmeal

1679
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
update. I got new flavors

1680
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
of better stevia

1681
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
and none of them are as good

1682
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
as the old ones.

1683
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
So, that's it

1684
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
for this week's oatmeal update.

1685
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
The flavors I was somewhat disappointed by

1686
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
are lemon

1687
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
and hazelnut. They're fine.

1688
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Did I mention, I put raspberries in it.

1689
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I tried raspberries.

1690
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
In oatmeal?

1691
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Yeah, like I put them in the vessel

1692
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
and I mashed them

1693
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
and then I combined, I put the oatmeal in,

1694
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
mixed it as usual, added some

1695
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Greek yogurt, because it increases

1696
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
the protein.

1697
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I replaced a little bit of it. What would have

1698
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
an almond milk? I had some Greek yogurt.

1699
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And I added some stevia to the, oh my god.

1700
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Oh my god, the raspberries

1701
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
with the stevia in there.

1702
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
That's incredible, incredible.

1703
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
An incredible inclusion. I think I said

1704
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
on a previous episode, someone asked

1705
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
favorite fruit and I was a little bit mixed on raspberries.

1706
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

1707
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
They are very sharp though,

1708
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
so you do need that sugary.

1709
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I still wouldn't just eat them plain.

1710
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
No, you need them with something sweet.

1711
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Yeah.

1712
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I like that I

1713
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
mashed them up and their flavor was

1714
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
included.

1715
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
It really worked. It really was doing a lot for me.

1716
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Yeah, raspberries, like swirl ice cream is very nice.

1717
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I want to try,

1718
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I want to try getting strawberries. I'll try it

1719
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
with strawberries. I'll get some fresh ones

1720
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
and I'll mash them and mix them in and see

1721
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
how that works. It'll probably be pretty good.

1722
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Raspberry yogurt is good.

1723
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Well, like I said, I had some

1724
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I had some yogurt in there.

1725
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
It really worked.

1726
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It really did.

1727
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Okay,

1728
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
that's my yogurt update.

1729
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
The oat update turned into a yogurt update.

1730
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Dang it, I said yogurt.

1731
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Like a fucking weirdo, like a freak.

1732
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It's yogurt.

1733
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Yeah, colonize.

1734
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Get colonized.

1735
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I'm so embarrassed.

1736
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Uh,

1737
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
um,

1738
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
is it too early to talk about One Piece?

1739
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Um,

1740
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
do you have nothing else to talk about?

1741
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
What are your losers? Nothing else to talk about

1742
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
for a week?

1743
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Yes.

1744
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Yes, whatever.

1745
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Now I have to show that I'm cooler by having

1746
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
something to talk about, but I can't

1747
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
bring anything forward.

1748
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
No.

1749
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Uh, I'll say

1750
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
no.

1751
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
My exercise routine

1752
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
is going really well.

1753
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
My squat.

1754
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
If you must know, thanks for asking.

1755
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
220.

1756
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
220 on the squat. That's pretty good.

1757
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
220 squats?

1758
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Yeah.

1759
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
No pounds.

1760
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Oh, sorry. Kilograms.

1761
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Those are different denominations.

1762
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
He's keeping track.

1763
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Um,

1764
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
220 pounds, 220 pounds, which is

1765
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
uh, is good.

1766
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Uh, 225

1767
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
is the line for two plate.

1768
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
That's when I can officially say that I squat two plate,

1769
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
which is a good milestone.

1770
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Um,

1771
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
so I look,

1772
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I look good.

1773
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I look good, looking in the mirror.

1774
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I weighed myself and I was like, oh, damn,

1775
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I gained some weight.

1776
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
But then I would look in the mirror and I was like, oh, but I don't look like I gained some weight.

1777
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
He's got some muscle on you.

1778
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Actually, I look fucking ripped.

1779
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Actually, fucking ripped.

1780
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
And you know what it is? I think

1781
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I'm taking more care with my diet this time.

1782
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
This time I'm specifically

1783
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I'm like hitting, hitting

1784
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
like a certain amount of protein

1785
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
every day. I think I did not, in previous

1786
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
times that I've been lifting,

1787
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I think I did not take care to like

1788
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
make sure I was getting the protein I needed.

1789
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And I think that probably

1790
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
hamstrung me considerably

1791
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
in terms of gains.

1792
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's a very important aspect.

1793
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
This time I'm serious. I'm serious about

1794
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
gains.

1795
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
You can't increase your bulk

1796
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
unless you put some bulk in your gob.

1797
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
That's, put that on a shirt.

1798
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
We can put that on again.

1799
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Put that on the fucking cover of

1800
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
the perfect comic party.

1801
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
The perfect comic party.

1802
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It's bulk for your gob.

1803
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Hmm.

1804
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It's gonna be good. It's gonna be good.

1805
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I guess the only thing I can talk about

1806
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
is I'm

1807
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
still doing that RuneScape

1808
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
challenge. God still?

1809
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Yeah. I go on every so often

1810
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
like a couple hours

1811
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
listening to a video

1812
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and I'm like getting coal

1813
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and I'm mining

1814
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
and who boy? I've got 33,000

1815
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
pieces of coal right now.

1816
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I can't judge because I did play

1817
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Noida this week

1818
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
against my better judgment.

1819
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
See the thing with Noida is you play a game

1820
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
and then you finish it.

1821
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
But with RuneScape it never ends.

1822
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I'm constantly gaining more power.

1823
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
It's like if I was playing Noida

1824
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
but I was continually just like,

1825
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
alright now I'll get back in there

1826
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
and I'll go scavenge some more

1827
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
some more fluids. Some more rare fluids

1828
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
in my vessel.

1829
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
My bank is getting filled with coal

1830
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
and the bank tells like what the fuck

1831
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
but they have to do it.

1832
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
What's your aim? What's your next short term

1833
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
aim for RuneScape

1834
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
that you're collecting?

1835
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
The big thing is the coal

1836
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
because I need like

1837
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
235k

1838
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
235,000 coal

1839
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
for the challenge.

1840
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Remind me what the ultimate goal

1841
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
is again. It's to get all

1842
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
of the materials I would need

1843
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
to switch

1844
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
to members

1845
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and level fletching

1846
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
from level 1 to level 99

1847
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
in one big go

1848
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
by gathering materials

1849
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
in free to play

1850
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
which is a stupid very time consuming

1851
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
way to do leveling fletching

1852
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
but that's why it's fun.

1853
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
That's why it's silly.

1854
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I understand.

1855
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So I've got like

1856
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I've got a bunch of coal

1857
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
to get, some adamantine oil

1858
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
and a bunch of runite ore.

1859
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I think the next milestone

1860
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
might actually be hitting

1861
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
like max level mining because that

1862
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I've calculated that I will get that

1863
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
much.

1864
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Which is a lot because the levels

1865
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
of the experience you need increases

1866
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
exponentially

1867
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
for each level.

1868
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
So it's a lot of mining

1869
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
and I get like

1870
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
150 on average

1871
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
per hour

1872
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and so to get

1873
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
200,000

1874
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
it takes a little while.

1875
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
It takes a number of hours

1876
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and I'm probably gonna

1877
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
not be... A number?

1878
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I can't remember. I think if I get what...

1879
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
What number?

1880
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
If I get a thousand coal, that's like

1881
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
a little...

1882
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I think that's like three hours in a little bit.

1883
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So if I play three hours a day

1884
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
then I get

1885
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
a thousand coal

1886
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
then I would need to play three hours a day

1887
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
for 200 days

1888
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
which is

1889
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
you know

1890
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
a mental arithmetic

1891
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
you know?

1892
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I can't do mental arithmetic so I don't know

1893
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
what that means. 200 days is most of a year?

1894
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yeah.

1895
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
If I play three hours a day which I will not

1896
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
be able to do.

1897
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Right. Yeah.

1898
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And

1899
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I'm gonna have to... It's gonna take

1900
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
playing through the whole battle network series

1901
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
is gonna take

1902
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
several hundred hours

1903
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
of actively playing

1904
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
the games

1905
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
so that's gonna be...

1906
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Yeah.

1907
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
And I'm not gonna be able to do that

1908
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
every day. I might... I was hoping to do

1909
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
a couple hours a day, a couple times a week

1910
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
so that would end up being

1911
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I don't know if it's like 500 hours

1912
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
maybe it'll be three...

1913
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Let's see. If there's 11...

1914
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
If there's about 11 games in the series

1915
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
and they're all roughly around

1916
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
say 25...

1917
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
let's average it out to like 25 hours

1918
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
let's call that 300 hours

1919
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
and if I did

1920
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
6 hours a week

1921
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
2-3 hours sessions

1922
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
that would come to 6 hours a week

1923
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
so 50 weeks

1924
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
oh god it'll take a whole fucking year!

1925
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Yeah.

1926
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It's...

1927
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
It's over!

1928
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Maybe consider

1929
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
a lecture you can do in the meantime.

1930
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Oh, yeah.

1931
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Yeah.

1932
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Definitely. I was

1933
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
aware this would take a long time and I was gonna

1934
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
have to do something else in the meantime.

1935
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Speaking of which...

1936
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Oh, one last thing before I move on from

1937
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
RuneScape is

1938
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
that 350

1939
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
per hour is the average based on

1940
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
my current mining level.

1941
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
But as I increase in level

1942
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
the percentage chance

1943
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
to get coal per swing

1944
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
increases.

1945
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So as I get to level 99

1946
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
the average will get

1947
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
higher. So my calculations are gonna be

1948
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
it's actually gonna be a little less

1949
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
than my calculations would

1950
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
say.

1951
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So it might not be

1952
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
a whole year.

1953
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
It might be that in like

1954
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
9 months it'll be done.

1955
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Lemau.

1956
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
That's great.

1957
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
But that's only the coal. Then there's

1958
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
like the chickens. I need to kill like

1959
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
thousands upon thousands of chickens to get

1960
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
the feathers I need for the arrows.

1961
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Thank god.

1962
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I know. It's really silly.

1963
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I don't mind how long it takes.

1964
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Everybody needs a hobby I guess.

1965
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Yeah. People like

1966
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
they play a game

1967
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and they enjoy themselves.

1968
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I'm playing RuneScape.

1969
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Shut up.

1970
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I agree.

1971
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Shut up.

1972
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Speaking of

1973
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
a lecture to do in the

1974
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
meantime while I'm working on getting that

1975
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
ready.

1976
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I am so close.

1977
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I have only about 18 gigs

1978
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
left to download via

1979
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Torrent

1980
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
of the entire Digibro archive.

1981
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I will soon be one of the few

1982
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
cedars

1983
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
of all the content in the Digibro

1984
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
archive which is almost a terabyte

1985
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
of data. Actually I think it's more than

1986
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
a terabyte.

1987
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
You're going to have that

1988
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
on a hard drive.

1989
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Yeah.

1990
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I think I basically

1991
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
asked for

1992
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
an external hard drive for

1993
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Christmas for my parents

1994
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
specifically so I could store

1995
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
this stuff.

1996
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Well I started

1997
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Torrenting it and as I was Torrenting it

1998
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I realized

1999
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I already have

2000
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
a lot of the

2001
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
space on my

2002
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
extra hard drive was taken up with the Mega Man

2003
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
stuff. I'm actually going to need another one

2004
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
but I got another one and it's pretty much

2005
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
all just going to go on there.

2006
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I can't wait for the OVA to be...

2007
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
It has been downloading

2008
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
for literally like six weeks now

2009
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and it's finally about to be done

2010
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
like today.

2011
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I can't wait for the OVA to be finished

2012
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
so that I can take all of that footage

2013
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
off the hard drive that I have

2014
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
just because I kept it as backup

2015
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
you know. Didn't want to delete it

2016
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
in case it was a catastrophic failure

2017
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
and someone needed to get

2018
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
the footage back.

2019
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Yeah.

2020
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
We should release the behind

2021
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
the scenes footage though. We should make

2022
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
it like a bonus thing.

2023
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Yeah.

2024
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Of course.

2025
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Behind the scenes meaning like

2026
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
flubbed takes

2027
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
or is there more specific?

2028
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Well you have all the raw footage right?

2029
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I don't want to look at it.

2030
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
You know, I understand.

2031
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
But I do think

2032
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
patrons would appreciate it and

2033
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
find it funny.

2034
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I guess so.

2035
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I'll see how the OVA shakes

2036
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
out. I don't know what takes are being

2037
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
used and what's already been going to be seen.

2038
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
You know

2039
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I don't know how much

2040
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
unused footage there

2041
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
will be.

2042
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Some takes we just did

2043
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
like twice.

2044
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
And there wasn't like a lot of camera

2045
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
running in between.

2046
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Might not

2047
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
might not be that much. I'm not sure.

2048
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
We'll definitely do a commentary

2049
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
of it. There'll be something.

2050
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Yeah, I think that'll be good.

2051
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I think that'll be funny and good.

2052
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And I wish

2053
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Kaiju would

2054
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
finish drawing the cover. I might

2055
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
give him a bell.

2056
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Give him a ring. Give him a little buzz.

2057
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I did like weeks, like a couple weeks ago.

2058
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
And he was like, yep, I'll do it.

2059
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Okay.

2060
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I might just

2061
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
ask someone else.

2062
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I asked someone else before

2063
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
and they kind of never got back to me.

2064
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
And I sort of dropped it because it seemed like Kaiju

2065
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
was back on the case. I might ask them again

2066
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
like, hey, do you want to draw the cover?

2067
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Just for the cover.

2068
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
What have you got so far?

2069
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Maybe they've done a little sketch

2070
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
and they just haven't got around to it.

2071
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Ed did like a very rough sketch

2072
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
like almost like not even

2073
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
really worth

2074
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
using.

2075
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I had one

2076
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
person in mind who I thought would

2077
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
make a really good cover.

2078
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Maybe I'll ask them again.

2079
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Because they said that they were kind of busy the last time I asked.

2080
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
But it's been a while, so.

2081
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Yep.

2082
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I mean, whenever, if you decide

2083
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
to talk to someone else,

2084
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
you should mention to Kaiju

2085
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
that you don't need their services.

2086
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Yeah, yeah, of course. If someone else agreed to do it,

2087
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I'd be like, hey, dog, never mind.

2088
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Hey, don't worry about it. Hey, you're done. Hey, I can pay you now.

2089
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Kaiju told me that he didn't want to be paid

2090
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
until he finished everything.

2091
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
That was his decision.

2092
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
So I haven't paid him anything.

2093
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Wish he would do the cover

2094
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
so I could, one, so it would be done

2095
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
and also so I could pay him.

2096
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Again, that was his,

2097
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
he specifically said

2098
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I would, I don't,

2099
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
don't pay me until I've completed the tab.

2100
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Okay.

2101
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
You know, I,

2102
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I don't know about that.

2103
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I feel like you should pay someone.

2104
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
That's what he said.

2105
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
No, no, I mean like, because

2106
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
if there's no money

2107
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
until they finish it,

2108
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
there's no

2109
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Well, I don't know.

2110
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I don't know what to tell you.

2111
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I don't know how, like

2112
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
there's something in my brain that says

2113
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
it would be, they would

2114
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
do it more quicker

2115
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
if they were paid, not because

2116
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
they were

2117
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
like, I don't know.

2118
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I feel like a little bit, I feel like a little bit

2119
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
that saying don't pay me is an excuse

2120
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
for taking a really long time on it.

2121
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Maybe.

2122
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Maybe it's just insurance, like

2123
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I don't know whether I'll have the time, which is fair enough.

2124
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
But still.

2125
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Everyone takes so dang long.

2126
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
This whole dojin's been like

2127
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
a really long process.

2128
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Yeah, Nightmare.

2129
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
The, uh, the

2130
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I

2131
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I would, I would have been happy to

2132
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
just pay on a page by page

2133
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
basis.

2134
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
But he didn't want me to.

2135
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Take the money, you fool.

2136
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I mean, he will

2137
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
hopefully at some point

2138
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
if I, if I, if I get

2139
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
someone else to do the cover, I'll just tell him like

2140
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
hey, never mind, I'm going to pay you now.

2141
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I'm paying you, I insist

2142
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I will pay you now and not

2143
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
later, no matter what you have to

2144
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
say about it.

2145
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
It's so close. It's literally

2146
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
the cover is the only thing left.

2147
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I think.

2148
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Okay.

2149
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I'm out of stuff to talk about

2150
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
other than one piece.

2151
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Okay, I guess.

2152
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Okay, and I feel like, I feel like

2153
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
more happened this week.

2154
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Like I said, it felt like a lot

2155
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
happened, but I didn't do anything.

2156
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Well, I mean, what happened?

2157
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Was there like an event?

2158
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Did somebody vent? Was somebody sus?

2159
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Oh, I think we're, um, I think we're

2160
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
rent striking.

2161
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I think we're rent striking at my landlord.

2162
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Oh.

2163
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Because, um, there's still rats in the house

2164
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
and, uh,

2165
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
he hasn't, he has made like only the

2166
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
most cursory

2167
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
efforts to do anything about them.

2168
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Totally, totally inadequate.

2169
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Hmm.

2170
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
That's a pretty good reason.

2171
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Yeah. Um, so I think, uh,

2172
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
everyone is just not paying rent

2173
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
until he does something about it.

2174
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I think that's the, the plan.

2175
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
You gotta stop the scabs coming in

2176
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
and paying rent for you.

2177
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Well, one guy is

2178
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
going to do that for sure.

2179
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Well, pay for rent for everyone?

2180
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
No. Oh, oh, for everyone, no.

2181
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
There's one guy who's not here.

2182
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Like, he's not even around,

2183
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
but he's still, like, technically

2184
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
renting a room. So he'll probably

2185
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
pay rent because, like, none of us have spoken to him.

2186
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
But, like, the rest of us, I think we're all,

2187
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
we all spoke and we're in agreement.

2188
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Like, we gotta stop paying rent until

2189
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
he does something about this.

2190
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So I'll watch the...

2191
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Fortunately, I can see

2192
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
it's there, it's public information

2193
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
for all of us. We can log in and we can see

2194
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
who has paid already.

2195
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
So I'll be able to see, like,

2196
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
if anyone breaks strike.

2197
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Like, if any, like, if other people pay,

2198
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I won't be, like, the only one

2199
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
left. Cause I'm not willing to be

2200
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
the only guy to do it.

2201
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I need, I need solidarity.

2202
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Yeah, solidarity. Exactly, exactly.

2203
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
If somebody pays rent, you know who to lynch,

2204
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
you know who to get. Absolutely.

2205
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
So if everyone caves,

2206
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
then I will also cave.

2207
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
But I'm not, I'm not going to be the first one.

2208
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I'm going to wait until other...

2209
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Yeah, I'm not crossing the

2210
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
picket line.

2211
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
The first person who does will be

2212
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
hanging from the tree by a harbor

2213
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
a green forest cable

2214
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
with their boots on.

2215
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Yes. Good, good.

2216
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
They'll still...

2217
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
And then the landlord will be like, uh-huh,

2218
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I love the reference.

2219
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Cool. The landlord will be like,

2220
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I love the, I love the reference.

2221
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Uh, yeah, you know, I know I'm a landlord,

2222
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
but like, I'm still a little bit of like a base socialist,

2223
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
you know, like, yeah, I play Disco Elysium.

2224
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
They play Disco Elysium and they're on

2225
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
they're on the side of the

2226
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
strike breakers.

2227
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Yeah, they're... Union busters.

2228
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
They're an ultra liberal.

2229
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
They're a, they're a...

2230
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
What's the other one?

2231
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Omega liberal?

2232
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
No, you haven't met

2233
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
the...

2234
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
There's one guy in particular

2235
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
who, what's it called?

2236
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Moral intern. The moral intern.

2237
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
What's that mean?

2238
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Ultra liberal is like

2239
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
libertarian, like economics.

2240
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Moral intern is like

2241
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
a sort of

2242
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
interventionist

2243
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
sort of

2244
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
like, we have to control the economy.

2245
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
We have to like, regulate the economy

2246
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
to make sure that nothing...

2247
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I think you're, I think you're close to meeting

2248
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
someone who will explain moral intern

2249
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
probably better than I can. It's all about the price

2250
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
stability. You must maintain

2251
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
the price stability.

2252
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
You gotta keep inflation under two percent.

2253
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Just under. Never over. The stability.

2254
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
The price stability.

2255
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
If the price of bread goes up, that's it.

2256
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
That's over.

2257
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Did you see

2258
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
that fucking

2259
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
drawing of the girl from

2260
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
fucking

2261
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Spy Family

2262
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
at Auschwitz?

2263
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
What?

2264
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Dog shit. It's dog shit.

2265
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I don't know.

2266
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Artist is a hack.

2267
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Spy Family is that, that's the new,

2268
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
that's the relatively new anime with the

2269
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
girl. Okay.

2270
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
It's that one artist who likes to draw

2271
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
like, ha ha

2272
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
this is their stick.

2273
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
They'll draw, they'll paint

2274
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
a popular anime character, a cute

2275
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
anime girl, and when you look

2276
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
at it for a second, it's kind of just like

2277
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
a normal drawing of a cute anime girl,

2278
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
and then you'll notice some background

2279
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
details that suggest some dark

2280
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
shit going on, like they're being domestically

2281
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
abused, or they're getting a blow job

2282
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
under the table, or

2283
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
ha ha, she's going to Auschwitz.

2284
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
It's so random.

2285
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It's so random and dark and edgy and funny.

2286
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Yeah, I think I know what

2287
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
artist that is.

2288
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
It's just lame. I don't like it.

2289
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
And I think a lot of people, honestly

2290
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I read the replies, and a lot of people seem

2291
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
offended, and they're like,

2292
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
genuinely a lot of them were like, you can't

2293
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
post this on freaking

2294
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Holocaust Remembrance Day.

2295
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And like, okay,

2296
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I guess I get that.

2297
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
But that's not where I'm at

2298
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
with it.

2299
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Where I'm at with it is that I can't

2300
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
possibly feel anything about it, because

2301
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
it's so...

2302
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
It's so...

2303
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
It doesn't mean anything.

2304
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
It's just all noise and no signal.

2305
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
It's...

2306
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
A lot of their work, assuming we're talking

2307
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
about the same person, a lot of their work

2308
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
just sort of feels like

2309
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
oh, this is an edgy teenager.

2310
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
This is an edgy teenage boy

2311
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
exactly, and they want to

2312
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
say the end word so bad

2313
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
they love the idea of saying the end word,

2314
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
but they can't do it.

2315
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I drew a popular waifu

2316
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
with Vladimir Putin.

2317
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Isn't that so fucked up?

2318
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
It works, too.

2319
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
People get mad at it, and that's what

2320
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
they want. And I wish...

2321
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I don't know.

2322
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It's really dumb. It's a really dumb shtick.

2323
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Yeah.

2324
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Get better material.

2325
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Uh...

2326
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Whatever. I just want to complain.

2327
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Just want to complain about some shit

2328
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
that I don't like.

2329
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
And that's one of them.

2330
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
But I'm not triggered.

2331
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
But I'm not triggered, though.

2332
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I promise.

2333
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I don't know. Your voice is trembling.

2334
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Don't print in the news that I'm triggered.

2335
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I mean that I wasn't triggered.

2336
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I mean, shit.

2337
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
No, I like the holocaust, actually.

2338
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
It's good, actually.

2339
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Trust me, that's not the problem.

2340
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Trust me. Trust me.

2341
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
It's not the problem.

2342
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Who's that?

2343
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I don't know.

2344
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
That was me trying to emulate, like,

2345
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
hey, if I was a YouTuber and I was

2346
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
reading a script and I thought,

2347
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
the script is getting boring, maybe I should

2348
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
punch that by having a zoom in on my face

2349
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
and, like, I'd make my voice really deep

2350
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
for a second, and maybe I, like, reverse

2351
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
the colors or something.

2352
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
That's what that was.

2353
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
In case you couldn't tell.

2354
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Sure.

2355
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
In case it wasn't blindingly obvious.

2356
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I guess they're continuing

2357
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Rick and Morty without Justin Roiland's

2358
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
lull.

2359
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Yeah, I don't...

2360
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
I saw, like, people's reactions to the news

2361
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
and never looked up the news.

2362
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Justin Roiland did a sexual

2363
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
harassment or something.

2364
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I thought he beat his wife.

2365
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
How do you do

2366
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Rick and Morty without Justin Roiland?

2367
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Isn't that, like...

2368
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I kind of think...

2369
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
The voices. I guess you could...

2370
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
You're right. That kind of is the show.

2371
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
That's kind of, like, the heart and soul of the show is

2372
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
the voices of Rick and Morty.

2373
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
The voices and the

2374
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
delivery is...

2375
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I mean, I know you can emulate it.

2376
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
You could get a guy who does the voice, but, like,

2377
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
the sense of humor as well.

2378
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I feel like it's going to be...

2379
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
The new season's going to come out

2380
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
and, uh, you're going to be...

2381
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Everyone's going to be able to tell.

2382
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Everyone's going to be able to tell. It's not the same.

2383
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Oh, hey, Morty.

2384
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
And it's going to be really embarrassing.

2385
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Hey, Morty, burp. It's me, Rick.

2386
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Rick?

2387
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
It just tunes the names.

2388
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I'm German. I'm German.

2389
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Morty, it's me.

2390
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I'm not Rick. I'm German, Rick.

2391
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I'm Rick, Morty.

2392
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I'm Rick.

2393
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Rick and Morty comes back, but it's just, like,

2394
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
super right-wing now.

2395
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Justin Rowland's gone,

2396
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
and it's worse.

2397
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
You thought Justin Rowland was bad.

2398
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
He was gatekeeping out the worst

2399
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
and the most toxic elements.

2400
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
You don't know how bad it could have been

2401
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
without him.

2402
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
You'll wish we had Justin back.

2403
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Um...

2404
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I haven't been keeping up with the show.

2405
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
No, I didn't watch the last season.

2406
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I watched was the one where

2407
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
the

2408
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
finite curve

2409
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
and, like, the Morty

2410
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
guy,

2411
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
he went through to the different dimension

2412
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
where there's no Rick

2413
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
or something.

2414
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
The central finite curve was, like,

2415
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
a lore thing where, like,

2416
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Rick Sanchez has the portal gun

2417
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
that only goes to other universes

2418
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
where Rick is the coolest guy,

2419
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
and it blocks out all the universes

2420
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
without that.

2421
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And so the Morty is Morty.

2422
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Not the Morty is Morty, but, like, the Evil Morty

2423
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
does the thing where he turns

2424
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
the

2425
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Sanctuary of Rick's or whatever

2426
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
into, like, a

2427
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
way to zap himself into

2428
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
a universe

2429
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
that doesn't have Rick as the coolest guy,

2430
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
and then Morty could be the coolest guy

2431
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
or something. He escaped.

2432
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
He escaped the curse of Rick.

2433
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
And I was like, oh, cool.

2434
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Follow up. I wonder if they did something.

2435
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I wonder if it was good.

2436
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I don't know if it is.

2437
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I think I heard, uh, I kind of saw

2438
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
people being mostly, like, positive

2439
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
about the latest season, like, not that

2440
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
long ago, I think.

2441
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Yeah. Not sure.

2442
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
I'll go back and watch it, but, like,

2443
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
that's funny. That's funny that Justin

2444
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Royland fucked everything up by being

2445
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
terrible.

2446
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I think he did, like,

2447
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
felony domestic abuse.

2448
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I think that's what it was.

2449
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I mean, I think he also

2450
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
was, like, sexting

2451
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
minors, but I don't think that's

2452
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
what, like, the legal charges

2453
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
are about.

2454
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Hmm.

2455
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I think?

2456
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Yeah.

2457
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Yeah, I don't know anything

2458
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
about it, so I'm not going to talk.

2459
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Talk out my AS.

2460
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Um,

2461
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
whatever. You know what? I don't

2462
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
care. I don't care if frickin' Morty gets

2463
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
canceled. I don't care if Justin Royland gets

2464
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
fired. They peaked with Pickle Rick. It's okay.

2465
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
They peaked with Pickle Rick!

2466
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Um, it's fine.

2467
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
You know what? Um, I don't even, like,

2468
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
shows anyway, so when they get canceled,

2469
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I think it's good. Um,

2470
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
it makes me happy.

2471
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
People keep on trying to show me

2472
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
stuff. I'm, like, nothing, please.

2473
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
No. More content.

2474
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Unironically, yes, only

2475
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
people have stopped trying to show me.

2476
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Hahaha.

2477
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Just what I always...

2478
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I like oblivion. I like the

2479
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
abyss. I like oblivion, too.

2480
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
That guy always makes good voicemails.

2481
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
That guy's always making a good funny voicemail.

2482
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Hey, remember? Oh, I was thinking of a video game.

2483
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Uh, hey, remember,

2484
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
uh, like, last week in the voicemails

2485
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
when

2486
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
TinCannMan revealed himself to have

2487
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
been oblivionfall all along?

2488
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
No, it's not true. It was a

2489
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
it was a trick.

2490
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Well, I,

2491
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I was taught, you know, I went on the,

2492
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I was on the drawcast. We did the edgy

2493
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
character's drawcast, which I'm not sure

2494
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
if that's out yet or when it will be out.

2495
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Actually, I have, I forgot to follow up

2496
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
on that. Um, but

2497
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I was on that and we recorded

2498
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
it, and during the course of it, I

2499
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
asked oblivionfall about it, or I mentioned

2500
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
it, and oblivionfall was like, what the hell?

2501
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Some guy asked me

2502
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
to say that like months ago

2503
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
and I forgot about it. Oh,

2504
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
he got played.

2505
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
So like, like, he

2506
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
he mentioned something and I, and I mentioned, oh

2507
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
yeah, that voicemail you did. And he was like, what

2508
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
voicemail? I didn't do a voicemail. And I was like, yeah

2509
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
you did. You, you, you said

2510
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
you were, had been TinCannMan all

2511
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
along and he was like, what? Yeah.

2512
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I can't believe TinCannMan was

2513
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
the mastermind behind that one.

2514
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Played, played, outplayed,

2515
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
outmatched, outgunned.

2516
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
So powerful. We, we, we, we

2517
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
we were so, we, we didn't

2518
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
uh, expect so uh, that much

2519
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
of TinCannMan, but we, we

2520
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
we saw it coming. We were shown, we were shown up.

2521
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
He's a genius.

2522
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
You know, he is a genius.

2523
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
He put it like that.

2524
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I'm watching my, I'm watching

2525
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
my uh, Digi

2526
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Archive.

2527
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
It is five parts.

2528
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Four of them are complete.

2529
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
The biggest one, part four

2530
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
which is called

2531
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
collaboration is still downloading.

2532
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
It has been downloading for six weeks and six

2533
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
days. Five. It is

2534
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
it is six hundred and sixty-eight gigabytes.

2535
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Uh, the connect,

2536
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I'm not sure, I don't think it's on my end, but

2537
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
like the connection keeps like popping in.

2538
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
The download keeps stopping and starting and stopping

2539
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
and starting. Uh,

2540
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
but uh, it is at six hundred and

2541
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
fifty gigabytes of

2542
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
six hundred and sixty-eight gigabytes have been

2543
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
downloaded at ninety-seven point two percent.

2544
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
It is so close.

2545
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
I could taste it.

2546
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
What does collaborations mean? Is that like

2547
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
videos in which

2548
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
she appears in other people's videos

2549
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
or with other people in them?

2550
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I guess so. Like with the PCP?

2551
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Uh,

2552
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
I don't, I don't know.

2553
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Maybe. Maybe includes

2554
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
all the pub crawl.

2555
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
This, this is like by far the biggest.

2556
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I think that one of the other parts is four

2557
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
hundred gigs and then all the other ones are

2558
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
like a hundred.

2559
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
The other ones are like much smaller.

2560
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
There's like the pub crawl and the

2561
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
appearances on the dick show and

2562
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
like I'm trying to think of

2563
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
like how is it so much bigger?

2564
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Well no, there was another, one of the other parts

2565
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
um,

2566
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
is called, okay well the parts are

2567
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
one, the digi collective,

2568
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
which I'm pretty sure means the main channel.

2569
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
And then part two is

2570
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
other digi channels, which I think means

2571
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
you know, like other.

2572
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Digi after dark.

2573
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Digi does that.

2574
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2575
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
And then part three is called featuring digi,

2576
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
which I would assume means

2577
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
like appearances

2578
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
on other people, in other people's videos

2579
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
on other people's channels.

2580
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
And then part four is called collaboration,

2581
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
which

2582
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I would kind of think that

2583
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
featuring digi would be

2584
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
a part of that, but I guess not.

2585
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Maybe it's the other way around, like

2586
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
digi featuring others.

2587
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Well, why wouldn't that go on digi collective?

2588
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Don't have that fucking know.

2589
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Yeah, I don't, I don't really get it.

2590
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
And then part five is called mis, miscellaneous

2591
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
content, which, you know, I don't know what

2592
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
them.

2593
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Maybe collaborations is like

2594
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
uh, digi bros, and

2595
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
not Vic and Hope.

2596
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I guess digi bros, and then digi and may.

2597
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Other, other digi channels

2598
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
is by far, that can't

2599
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
be after dark, because it's by far the smallest.

2600
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
It's only 40 gigs.

2601
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Uh, featuring digi is one

2602
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
118, miscellaneous is

2603
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
179, digi collective 476,

2604
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
collaboration

2605
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
668.

2606
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Uh...

2607
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Well, have fun looking at them.

2608
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
In case you wondered, in case you wondered, but hey,

2609
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
if anyone wants, if anyone is

2610
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
thinking about getting

2611
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
the digi archive for their very own,

2612
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
if you torrent it,

2613
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I will be seeding it, because I will

2614
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
have it as a very soon.

2615
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
So you're welcome.

2616
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Um...

2617
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Before we get to one piece, I need to

2618
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
pee again. Ah! Okay.

2619
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Let's do that.

2620
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Okay.

2621
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Okay, so

2622
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
a couple people are

2623
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
uh,

2624
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
replying to my tweet about May with

2625
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
some choice screenshots

2626
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
of her tweets.

2627
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Now I gotta go and look.

2628
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Just a couple of

2629
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
um, she recently

2630
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
retweeted Sneeko.

2631
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Do you know who Sneeko is?

2632
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Sounds like a sneaky gay.

2633
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I think he's a streamer.

2634
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I guess he's popular now.

2635
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Seems like a little bit of a

2636
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
fashion, honestly.

2637
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Seems like kind of a scumbag

2638
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
fashion. Wait, Amanda Marce

2639
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
has absconded.

2640
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Yes. It's a funny

2641
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
word to use.

2642
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
That is a funny word.

2643
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
He also called May's sister

2644
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
when I hear it, when I see it.

2645
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
He also called May's sister a

2646
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
slatternly, which is an interesting...

2647
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
You get the fucking

2648
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
thesaurus out for this?

2649
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

2650
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Radcon 5 soon.

2651
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
It's just unrelated.

2652
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Yeah,

2653
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
the address.

2654
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Uh...

2655
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
This guy says,

2656
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
why aren't they married?

2657
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
So why is it not my wife absconded?

2658
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Amanda Ralph absconded.

2659
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Yeah, why does he say...

2660
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Oh, I guess he probably says Amanda Morris.

2661
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I mean, he probably says that because

2662
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
in other tweets he says like, you know,

2663
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
not my wife, she's just a whore.

2664
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Goddamn, that's probably why he's using

2665
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
her maiden name.

2666
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Since you mentioned it, it's gotta be

2667
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
that like, she just wanted to get married

2668
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
for some sort of legal or financial reason

2669
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
and then take the first opportunity

2670
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
to abscond.

2671
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I'm using his word, but whatever.

2672
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
It's gotta be that. It makes the most sense.

2673
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
The timing is like...

2674
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
The timing's perfect.

2675
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I guess I just don't know what

2676
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
you can gain.

2677
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I think it's gotta be alimony.

2678
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
It's gotta be alimony.

2679
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Yeah, I think so. I think probably being

2680
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
legally married makes a better case.

2681
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
How would you go about getting alimony?

2682
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Well, I don't exactly know.

2683
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
You don't run away. You just get a divorce.

2684
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Right?

2685
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Well, she...

2686
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Yes, but I mean, she...

2687
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Okay, she probably wanted to run...

2688
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
I mean, this is total speculation,

2689
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
but what I'm thinking is maybe she had

2690
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
wanted to run away for a while,

2691
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
but was like, well, if I run away before

2692
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
we get married, it'll be harder to get alimony.

2693
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
So I just need to put up with it

2694
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
until we get married.

2695
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
And then once we're legally married,

2696
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
I can abscond.

2697
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
And then we can...

2698
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Because absconding is what I want.

2699
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Then I can do it.

2700
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
And only then, once I've absconded,

2701
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
we can start the legal

2702
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
proceedings for divorce, I think.

2703
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I have a strong feeling that this was

2704
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
not planned.

2705
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I mentioned it just because...

2706
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Like, how?

2707
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
My version

2708
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
makes more sense, but

2709
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
maybe that's not

2710
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
what I should be looking for

2711
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
in this situation.

2712
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Maybe that's not the most

2713
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
sensible way to try and interpret

2714
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
these people's actions.

2715
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Well, now

2716
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
let's actually talk about One Piece.

2717
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Let's actually talk about One Piece. I did actually read it

2718
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
ahead of time. Same.

2719
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
We've done it.

2720
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Yeah, at last.

2721
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
I mean, I guess the big...

2722
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
So, the One Piece corner...

2723
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
One Piece corner begins

2724
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
at whatever time stamp this is,

2725
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
and will end at another time...

2726
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
In the future.

2727
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Down in the description you can see

2728
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
ahead of time, if you want,

2729
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
to skip it.

2730
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Spoilers, all right, here we go.

2731
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So, chapter 1073

2732
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Miss Buckingham Stussy.

2733
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Is it just a coincidence

2734
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
that you mentioned

2735
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Weevil? Like, you mentioned Weevil a couple

2736
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
weeks ago, and I was like

2737
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
who the heck is that?

2738
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I keep things like that

2739
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
in my brain, just because it's like

2740
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
there's so much going on in One Piece

2741
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
and Weevil is like such a big

2742
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
like, wow, what a thing

2743
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
and then you don't hear about him for

2744
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
arcs and arcs, months and months,

2745
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
years and years, it's like, wow,

2746
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
when is he gonna come back in? Because he has to.

2747
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Well, he's freaking back.

2748
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
He's freaking back.

2749
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
He's freaking back.

2750
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Let's talk about the cover page for us, though.

2751
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
We got

2752
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
the Mads scientists

2753
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
and we got

2754
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Oh, wait a minute.

2755
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Mads scientists.

2756
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Oh my god.

2757
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Even though I didn't get that, as I said it.

2758
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Just as you said that, I'm like, wait a minute.

2759
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I think that's probably the joke.

2760
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Mads scientists.

2761
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
So

2762
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
last week

2763
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
they were like, ha ha, look at all our

2764
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
evil plans, evil inventions

2765
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
and then Vegapunk comes

2766
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
with a peaceful invention

2767
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
that stops tanks from being able to shoot,

2768
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
turns gunpowder into

2769
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
flowers.

2770
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Aw, that's sweet. You know what, I didn't even think about it.

2771
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I kind of just kind of glossed over this one.

2772
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
And he, I think,

2773
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
his wing, I think he wins the prize.

2774
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Yeah,

2775
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Vegapunk receives the bell prize.

2776
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
The Ibell Prize.

2777
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
The Ibell Prize.

2778
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Instead of the Nobel?

2779
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
I guess so, yeah.

2780
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
For the GP, the gunpowder flower.

2781
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Aw.

2782
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
What a precious man.

2783
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
What a sweet precious man

2784
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
who I hope will not

2785
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
betray our heroes.

2786
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Yeah.

2787
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I guess this is like a hint that he's

2788
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
you know, he's been a good guy generally.

2789
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
This seems like he's a pretty good guy.

2790
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
I mean, I guess he's friends with like

2791
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
the giants of Elbaf and

2792
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
freaking Porcus D. Sol.

2793
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Not Porcus D. Sol.

2794
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
What was his name?

2795
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Sol D.

2796
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Oh, Jaguar D. Sol.

2797
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Jaguar D. Sol, yeah.

2798
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Um, so I mean,

2799
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I guess he's probably a good guy.

2800
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Okay, so.

2801
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
He's friends with cool dudes.

2802
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Okay, so

2803
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Kaku got bit

2804
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
by the clone of

2805
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Ms. Buckingham Stussy.

2806
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
We have discovered she's a vampire.

2807
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Luchi stands no chance.

2808
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
She gets him with a lipstick, a

2809
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Kyro Seiki seastone lipstick.

2810
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Bites him as well.

2811
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Oh, I get it.

2812
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
She bit him

2813
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
and her seastone lipstick.

2814
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Allowed her to bite him, to get through the hacky

2815
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
and because it weakens

2816
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
devil fruit users.

2817
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
So.

2818
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I think that's the

2819
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
implication. Okay, okay.

2820
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Well, I mean,

2821
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
would she need

2822
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
that just to bite him?

2823
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I think.

2824
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I thought it was that the seastone lipstick

2825
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
is what like put him out.

2826
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Because she had

2827
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
seastone on her lips

2828
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
for the bite.

2829
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
No, I think it's

2830
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
pretty universally used as

2831
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
like a way to stop

2832
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
a devil fruit user

2833
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
to hurt them more is to use

2834
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
seastone.

2835
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Like some of the

2836
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
guys, the Marines have like

2837
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
seastone bullets very occasionally.

2838
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Yeah. And you can't,

2839
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Luchi can't touch those, they'll hurt him.

2840
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
So he has to dodge them instead.

2841
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
He can't like, he can't balloon

2842
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
them away like regular bullets.

2843
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Yeah.

2844
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
It hasn't been used that much.

2845
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I think it was used a little bit

2846
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
in like

2847
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
a whole cake

2848
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
vaguely remember that.

2849
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
So is the

2850
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
so she's clearly, she's clearly

2851
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
not a devil fruit user then

2852
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
because she can wear

2853
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
seastone lipstick.

2854
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
No, she doesn't

2855
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
wear it. She picks it up and

2856
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
steps into his neck

2857
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
to, you know, so she's not

2858
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
touching it. He's touching it. And then she can

2859
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
use him in his weakened state.

2860
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
She can bite into his skin

2861
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
and do, do stuff.

2862
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Get him. I don't know what

2863
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
her bite does, but seems to knock them

2864
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
out at least.

2865
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Well, hang on.

2866
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
She

2867
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I mean, she says

2868
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
seastone. Oh, wait.

2869
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
She pops the lipstick.

2870
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
She says, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, she like puts

2871
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
it. She like puts it on his neck.

2872
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
I see. I see. I see. Yes.

2873
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Does

2874
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
seastone negate hockey too?

2875
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I don't think it negates hockey.

2876
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I think it just makes devil fruit

2877
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
users weaker.

2878
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
So it's more difficult to do

2879
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
anything. Yeah.

2880
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Like you can't like physically

2881
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
overpower the effects of it.

2882
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
If you fall in the water, you sink. It doesn't matter

2883
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
how strong you are. If you're a devil fruit user,

2884
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
the power of the sea makes you

2885
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
completely immobile.

2886
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Yes, the power

2887
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
of the primordial

2888
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
nature that is the sea

2889
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
that wants to hold

2890
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
devil fruit users

2891
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
down from

2892
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
achieving

2893
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
the dreams of

2894
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Yeah, I forgot about all that.

2895
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
That shit.

2896
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
That confusing shit.

2897
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Yeah.

2898
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
The sea, it doesn't want you to reach

2899
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
the sea hates fruit. The sky of dreams.

2900
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
The fruit is all about

2901
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
what if humans wanted to fly?

2902
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
They unlock the human's

2903
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
potential to

2904
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
do whatever they want. To become rubber and

2905
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
things. The sea hates fruit

2906
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
and the fruit is dreams

2907
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
and man eats fruit

2908
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
and go up.

2909
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
And sea do not like

2910
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
man go up.

2911
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
And that's why the sea is at the bottom of the land.

2912
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Sorry, sea does not like

2913
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
zizi. Sea does not like zizi

2914
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
go up.

2915
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Okay, so we understand.

2916
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
We understand where the sea is coming from.

2917
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Yes, so Stussy

2918
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
takes him out.

2919
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
And it's not just, I don't know why I didn't think

2920
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
of this. I guess it was just sort of

2921
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
out of left field.

2922
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
But she was the lady on the phone

2923
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
that Vigapunk called earlier.

2924
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Oh, sure.

2925
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

2926
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
So she's the

2927
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
secret person on the island

2928
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
that could help them.

2929
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Which is

2930
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
quite a coincidence.

2931
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Pretty good.

2932
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I guess it's not a coincidence, but it's just

2933
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
sort of like, she is

2934
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
working for like how many years?

2935
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Yeah, I mean.

2936
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
As like a person undercover

2937
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
for all these things.

2938
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
And she's a clone loyal to Vigapunk.

2939
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Just like the Seraphim.

2940
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Yeah?

2941
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I guess so.

2942
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
But the Seraphim are different, more stronger.

2943
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
The Seraphim are different, more stronger.

2944
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Zoro says he sees

2945
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
humanity in little baby

2946
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Mihawk.

2947
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
So like,

2948
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
he seems to think the Seraphim

2949
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
are not like, they're not like automatons.

2950
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Yeah.

2951
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Potentially maybe

2952
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
try to break their programming if they wanted to.

2953
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Yeah, this is just like Mega Man.

2954
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I would say it is very

2955
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
yes.

2956
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Oh my god, just like Mega Man

2957
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
collecting the robot master's powers.

2958
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
A closer inspection, you're not the same.

2959
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
You actually have a spark of humanity still.

2960
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I don't know whether that means

2961
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Mihawk has no

2962
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
humanity.

2963
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
But I guess, well actually, no.

2964
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
I think he's saying, you're not the same.

2965
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Like the Seraphim are not the same

2966
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
guy.

2967
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
They're not the same soul.

2968
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
They have individuality still.

2969
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Yeah, I think he's saying like you're not just

2970
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
a robot taking commands.

2971
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Yeah.

2972
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
What the hell are you?

2973
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
So the Seraphim nearly kill everyone.

2974
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
But it's okay.

2975
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Because they managed to get a

2976
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
little command out and then

2977
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
they take

2978
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
the command and then they're here.

2979
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
No standing still.

2980
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Well, Stussy says

2981
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Stussy commands them

2982
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
to stop.

2983
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
No, it's

2984
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
the little guy.

2985
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Edison. He manages to say it.

2986
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
They think he exploded, but then Stussy

2987
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
saved him at the last second.

2988
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Yes, okay.

2989
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I see.

2990
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
So

2991
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
because Vegapunks orders

2992
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Super Seed,

2993
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
B-Zeroes.

2994
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Yeah.

2995
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Because Stussy couldn't

2996
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Stussy has the same

2997
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
clearance as Luchy

2998
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
which means that she could not override

2999
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Luchy's commands.

3000
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Yeah, wait.

3001
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
That's what they say, but like if they're the same

3002
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
why wouldn't

3003
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
why couldn't one

3004
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
cancel the other?

3005
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
My authority level is the same so I can't

3006
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
cancel it.

3007
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
That's odd.

3008
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I guess

3009
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
there must be a rule there that like

3010
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
if a person

3011
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
from a certain

3012
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
level of authority

3013
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
says something

3014
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
that another person of the same level

3015
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
can't confuse them

3016
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
by saying something else

3017
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
and that's the idea.

3018
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
It has to be a person higher up the chain

3019
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
to say something. It has to be the person higher

3020
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
in the chain and also

3021
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
the first person on that level of the chain

3022
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
gets to set the commands and then no one else

3023
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
on that same command level gets to Super Seed them.

3024
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Yeah, I guess that's

3025
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
it's an odd way to work.

3026
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
I guess it just means

3027
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
whatever.

3028
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
It gives an excuse for a

3029
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
thrilling moment where Edison nearly got blowed up.

3030
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
It's true.

3031
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
And I would have

3032
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
been so devastated

3033
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
if he got blowed up.

3034
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
So the stakes truly were raised

3035
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
in that moment.

3036
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
And then

3037
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
their docile

3038
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
and then it turns out

3039
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Vegapunk's main body

3040
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
has vanished

3041
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
and they can't find Bonnie either.

3042
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Bonnie obviously has just found

3043
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
the memory of Kuma.

3044
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Oh, right.

3045
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
We don't know whether she touched it.

3046
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
She looked like she was going to

3047
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
and

3048
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I guess we don't know

3049
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
at the moment what's going on

3050
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
with them.

3051
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
No updates on that.

3052
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Because it says vanished as in like they're gone

3053
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
but it could just mean they can't find them

3054
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
but I feel like

3055
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
vanished implies that they've actually gone somewhere somehow.

3056
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
My translation that I read

3057
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
says however an event will occur

3058
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
the disappearance of Dr.

3059
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Vegapunk which

3060
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
merely implies that they cannot

3061
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
find him to me.

3062
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Right.

3063
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I got another thing to say

3064
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
but I'll wait until the end of the chapter.

3065
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
So then we switch over

3066
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
to Sphinx New World

3067
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
White Beards hometown

3068
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
where Marco lives.

3069
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Does he live there?

3070
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Yeah, he lived there.

3071
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
He's a doctor there

3072
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
and everyone knows in there I assume he lives there

3073
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
because after the White Beard Pirates broke up

3074
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
he settled down there

3075
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
which is where he's been seen

3076
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
since White Beard's death

3077
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
so I assume so but

3078
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I think in the interim

3079
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
where Marco had left to go to Wano

3080
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Yeah, he was out doing like

3081
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
missions and like giving people messages

3082
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
and stuff.

3083
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Yeah, he was out flying around

3084
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
and then the Marines came

3085
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
those nasty stinky Marines

3086
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
with a rat face.

3087
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
He's like catfish man.

3088
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Oh yeah.

3089
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
He looks like a fishman.

3090
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

3091
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
They're gonna shoot some kids.

3092
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
This is like old school Marines

3093
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
from like Arlong Park.

3094
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
It is.

3095
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
The old school like we're evil and nasty

3096
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
and we'll just fuck with innocent bystanders.

3097
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
A child?

3098
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
How dare you?

3099
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
What if we shoot you one by one?

3100
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Wouldn't that make you cry?

3101
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
And then fucking Balaam

3102
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Edward Weevil comes in

3103
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
with the White Beard

3104
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
weapon.

3105
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
I don't know if it's the same one.

3106
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Oh yeah, he's got the big glaive thing.

3107
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Yeah, true.

3108
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I forget if he already had one

3109
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
like that.

3110
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Well they, I thought they left

3111
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
White Beards like on his grave.

3112
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Yeah, I don't think he would.

3113
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
He could have retrieved it.

3114
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
He could have retrieved it.

3115
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I feel like it maybe would have been mentioned.

3116
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
But he could have already

3117
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
had a glaive similar.

3118
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Yeah.

3119
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Cause I can't remember the last time we saw him

3120
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
what he looked like.

3121
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
But yeah, he's a strong guy.

3122
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
He makes all the Marines run away

3123
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
and he's protecting his father's

3124
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
hometown.

3125
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
So he believes that he's the son of White Beard.

3126
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
We still don't know actually

3127
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
but it's not really corroborated

3128
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
by most of other people.

3129
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Most other people just believe that it's a lie

3130
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
perpetrated by

3131
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
the lady that he's always with

3132
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
to get White Beard's money as a scam.

3133
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
It could be true.

3134
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
It could be true.

3135
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Maybe it's true.

3136
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
It would be cool if it's true because

3137
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
God this,

3138
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
the lady is

3139
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Miss Buckingham Stussy.

3140
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
She is a scientist.

3141
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
So this is the same lady

3142
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
who is the clone.

3143
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Her clone is betraying

3144
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
CP0

3145
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
on Egghead right now.

3146
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Her original form

3147
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
is, yeah, the mom of

3148
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Weevil.

3149
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Former member of the Rocks Pirates

3150
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
which leads a lot of credence

3151
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
to the idea that she could have

3152
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
sired a child

3153
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
of White Beards because

3154
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
he was also on the crew.

3155
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Definitely. No doubt.

3156
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
She's also

3157
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
old though. I guess Weevil would be old too.

3158
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
You mean White Beard?

3159
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
No, Weevil. I don't know how old Weevil is.

3160
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
He's such a

3161
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
beast looking guy. You don't really know how

3162
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
he can really tell.

3163
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
He could be 18 or he could be

3164
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
like 30.

3165
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
It's hard to tell.

3166
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
But yeah, she's not only a scientist,

3167
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
part of the Rocks Pirates.

3168
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
So all of this stuff with the mad scientists

3169
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
and

3170
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Is she in any of the

3171
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Rocks Pirates?

3172
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Art? Like the intro?

3173
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
I don't think we've seen her.

3174
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
I don't think we've seen her in those.

3175
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Yeah.

3176
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
It's those same three

3177
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Jerma and

3178
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Caesar and

3179
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
that guy who may or may not be

3180
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
the artist potentially known as Queen.

3181
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
The artist potentially known as Queen.

3182
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Yeah.

3183
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
And yeah, she would be there.

3184
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I guess they didn't want to spoil

3185
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
surprise for this moment.

3186
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Because if they showed

3187
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
what Stussy

3188
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
looked like, it would be obvious

3189
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
that Stussy is the Stussy that is

3190
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
currently in the comic.

3191
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
You think?

3192
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
You think it would be obvious?

3193
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Well, if it's, I mean,

3194
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
it might not be obvious, but like the idea

3195
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
is it's characters we haven't

3196
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
seen young before looking young,

3197
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
but Stussy as a clone is

3198
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
young. And so she

3199
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
would like, theoretically,

3200
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
she would look the same in

3201
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
those flashback. Oh, yeah,

3202
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

3203
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Honestly, that would make me

3204
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
honestly, that would have made me be like,

3205
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
why does she look the same?

3206
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
What the fuck? What the fuck?

3207
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
But isn't it been a while?

3208
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Vega punks old. Vega punks.

3209
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
And now we see she is old.

3210
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
She looks great

3211
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
as well. I love her

3212
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
like, her gnarly

3213
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
old hands with all the rings on them.

3214
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Hmm.

3215
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I

3216
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I

3217
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I was

3218
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
shocked and horrified by this revelation.

3219
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Seems

3220
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
seems like he probably

3221
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
seems like he probably is

3222
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Whitebeard's son, honestly.

3223
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
If she was a rocks pirate

3224
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
and all that, just seems

3225
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
perfectly reasonable.

3226
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Okay, so

3227
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
besides, you think she knows she has a clone?

3228
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Who knows? That's the thing.

3229
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Yeah, I don't know.

3230
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Besides the fact that we

3231
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
is a revelation of this character,

3232
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
we've only seen like a couple times before

3233
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
is very relevant to the effect of the

3234
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
events happening right now is

3235
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
that we've all protected

3236
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
those kids, protected the town,

3237
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
but then they sent Admiral

3238
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Rokyugu

3239
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
the new Admiral

3240
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
who I think has been revealed.

3241
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I can't remember what he looks like. Let me just

3242
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I think he

3243
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
arrived at the end of Wano

3244
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
and he tried to bully

3245
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Momonosuke and the guys

3246
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
and he was like, what was he?

3247
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Like a vine guy?

3248
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Wait, Weevil did? No.

3249
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Rokyugu, the new Admiral.

3250
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Rok-

3251
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Fuck.

3252
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
There's a new Admiral?

3253
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Yeah, because

3254
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Aokiji left and then Akainu

3255
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
got promoted to the

3256
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Fleet Admiral. So there's three.

3257
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
One of them is Kizaru.

3258
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
There's Kizaru and there's

3259
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
the purple monkey guy.

3260
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Purple man from Dressros and then there's this guy

3261
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
who was only revealed

3262
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
at the very end of Wano after

3263
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
everyone had been defeated.

3264
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Yeah, I

3265
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
totally forgot about this guy.

3266
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Yeah, so that's the reveal of that guy.

3267
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
That guy apparently

3268
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
took Weevil away

3269
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
which means that

3270
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Oh, um, um

3271
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
he got like arrested

3272
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
after the restrication with the

3273
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
with the Marines. Yeah, so they sent

3274
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Admiral Rokyugu. He took

3275
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Weevil away

3276
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
which means because right now

3277
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
does it say that in this chapter?

3278
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
She says it.

3279
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Stussy, old lady

3280
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
says that Rokyugu came

3281
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
as backup and they stole Weevil away.

3282
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Oh, Navy Admiral Greenbull came here.

3283
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Okay. Greenbull, that's the other name for him.

3284
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Right. Yeah.

3285
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
We're reading different scans.

3286
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Yeah.

3287
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
So Weevil is with, presumably

3288
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
with him or

3289
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
it's, he could have been taking

3290
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
to Impel down but I think

3291
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
the implication here is that

3292
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
because the admirals have been called

3293
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
with all of these warships to

3294
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Egghead is that Greenbull

3295
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
along with Weevil

3296
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
are on their

3297
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
way with all of the other warships

3298
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
and Kizaru and

3299
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Purple Man. So it's, I

3300
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
thought it was just, is it not just

3301
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Kizaru who's going there?

3302
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Like I know Kizaru is going there.

3303
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
I thought he was the only one.

3304
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
You know, I can't remember if this

3305
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
maybe they didn't say all the admirals would be there.

3306
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
I feel like it's such a big thing

3307
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
because we see

3308
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
it could just be Kizaru actually

3309
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
like he's the one heading it.

3310
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Yeah. But the fact is that

3311
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
we scroll down a bit

3312
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
one of the five elders is on one of the

3313
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
special boats.

3314
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Is he going there also?

3315
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Oh wait, he's talking to Kizaru so.

3316
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Yeah, Kizaru is there. Yeah.

3317
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
And there's one of the five elders

3318
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
of Marishua

3319
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
making a move for the first time.

3320
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I mean, if I can Jerry, Jerry,

3321
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
J Garcia, Saint J Garcia

3322
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Saturn.

3323
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Yeah. What's the make of that name?

3324
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I think it's a reference

3325
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
to like a. Is it Jerry, is it Jerry

3326
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Garcia?

3327
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Jerry Garcia.

3328
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Let me look up what he looks like.

3329
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
There's a chapter nose thing in the scan.

3330
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Saturn's name might refer

3331
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
to two unrelated musicians, Jerry Garcia.

3332
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
There's also a Russell Garcia

3333
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
who wrote a song called The Lost Souls of

3334
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Saturn.

3335
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Okay. So it could be.

3336
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
This is this is what Jerry Garcia looks

3337
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
like. And I mean, it looks

3338
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
looks like a match to me.

3339
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Yeah. So.

3340
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
J Garcia said it could be a combination.

3341
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
But anyway, the

3342
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
thing I wanted to mention earlier,

3343
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
the seraphim.

3344
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
The whole thing with like, oh, they listen

3345
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
to the five elders above

3346
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
and it just so happens

3347
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
that a five elder is coming at

3348
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
probably explicitly because of this

3349
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
thing. They need him

3350
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
so that he can control the seraphim,

3351
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
which are the most powerful guys.

3352
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Because.

3353
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
They said

3354
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
that even if they hear

3355
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
the voice of a

3356
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
of a five elder gore say over

3357
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
this transponder snail,

3358
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
they won't count. It doesn't count.

3359
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
But does it not count

3360
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
because it's over a transponder

3361
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
snail? I thought they were saying that it doesn't

3362
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
count because

3363
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
in the case of the seraphim

3364
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
specifically, the order

3365
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
of the order is different

3366
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
and Vega punk outranks

3367
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
the five elders in

3368
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
in ordering them specifically.

3369
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
But they did mention the transponder snail.

3370
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
So maybe it is just that he has to be there

3371
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
in person. I think that

3372
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
the idea is

3373
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
above Vega punk is

3374
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
the five elders. But when

3375
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
we when I've read that the first time is like, yeah,

3376
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
but when are they going to be in marriage? Why?

3377
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Yeah, when are they going to see a five

3378
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
elder? Well, now he's coming

3379
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
and I think he's coming because

3380
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
they know that that's how they work.

3381
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
I think that is almost

3382
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
definitely true.

3383
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
I had thought what they

3384
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
said. I had thought they had

3385
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
explained it as like, yeah,

3386
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
normally a gore say would

3387
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Trump them in

3388
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
the order of ordering them.

3389
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
But like, actually, they don't for some

3390
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
reason in this specific case.

3391
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
But the fact that he's here

3392
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
means like

3393
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
this has to be relevance.

3394
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
It probably does. They're making so much

3395
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
of this fucking order of like

3396
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
who commands the seraphim.

3397
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Yeah. And I think it's not just

3398
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
like you can't

3399
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
order them through

3400
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
like electronic communication

3401
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
regardless of who you are.

3402
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
You have to be in front of them.

3403
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
They have to hear and see it from you.

3404
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
I think that

3405
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
makes sense and

3406
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
okay.

3407
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
So this will be interesting because

3408
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
it's it's it's yeah.

3409
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
It'll be interesting

3410
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
on a couple of ways because

3411
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
we just saw that Edison

3412
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
almost got blown up

3413
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
because they're so powerful, so quick.

3414
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
It's hard to get a word in

3415
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
if they're trying to kill you to

3416
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
tell them to stop even though you have the

3417
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
authority. They don't recognize the authority.

3418
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
They just recognize the order.

3419
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
So is this guy is one of the five

3420
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
elders? Are we going to see them fight?

3421
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Is he going to be really quick?

3422
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Is he going to be super strong?

3423
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Or is he just going to be an old man?

3424
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
How's he going to do it?

3425
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Yeah.

3426
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Dude, that'll be fucked up

3427
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
to see like a Gora say like

3428
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
in a battle.

3429
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Even it just for half a second so he can

3430
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
get his

3431
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
his order out.

3432
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I feel like

3433
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
because of there being so many warships

3434
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
the marines

3435
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
are going to

3436
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
hold them off so that he can say his

3437
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
thing and he's not going to lift a finger

3438
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
which is going to be characteristic of that

3439
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
sort of a character.

3440
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
That's what I would think.

3441
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Yeah.

3442
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
You never know. He could have a devil fruit.

3443
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Got that.

3444
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
I feel like

3445
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
that

3446
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
I don't want everyone to have a devil fruit.

3447
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Yeah.

3448
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
I like the idea of the Gora say just being some guys

3449
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
who are in control.

3450
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
They're just guys who have a lot of political power

3451
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
and they just tell other people

3452
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
by their word

3453
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
they cause wars to happen

3454
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
and stuff.

3455
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
So they got all these warships

3456
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
coming.

3457
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Vegapunk

3458
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
has never been nullified

3459
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
for now.

3460
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
The seraphim are on the side

3461
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
of the straw hats

3462
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
presumably going to get on the boat

3463
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
with the rest of the Vegapunks

3464
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
and Stussy

3465
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
and leave

3466
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
but we can't find the actual Vegapunk

3467
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
and I think that's going to be the thing

3468
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
that holds them up long enough for the warships to get here

3469
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
and then there's going to be a whole fucking thing.

3470
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Yeah.

3471
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Because it seems like

3472
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
they have the seraphim

3473
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
CP-Zero taken out

3474
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
they can just go.

3475
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
But then Vegapunk is nowhere to be found.

3476
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Are they lost?

3477
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Are they teleported somewhere?

3478
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Where were they trying to go with Vegapunk?

3479
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Where are they trying to go?

3480
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
What do you mean?

3481
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
They were going to the ship

3482
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
and they were going to leave Egghead

3483
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
with Vegapunk

3484
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Where are they trying to go?

3485
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
They're just trying to get out of there.

3486
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
They're just trying to get out of there.

3487
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Vegapunk is like

3488
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I've discovered something about the voids entry

3489
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
or something and it's like bad information

3490
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
the government doesn't want me to know

3491
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
I gotta get out of here

3492
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
and it just so happens that the straw hats arrive

3493
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
at the perfect time to help him escape.

3494
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
So there's no goal other than

3495
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
get the fuck out.

3496
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Sensible.

3497
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
I really hope they use a coup de burst

3498
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
to fly over the warships.

3499
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Oh, yes.

3500
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
I haven't seen that in a while.

3501
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
The classic coup de burst.

3502
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
You know, I gotta admit

3503
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
it helps me a lot

3504
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
to understand what's going on

3505
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
to have these discussions

3506
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
because

3507
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
kind of all I really took away from reading the chapter

3508
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
was like

3509
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Oh, yeah, Weevil's still here

3510
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
and the Gorace is around

3511
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
interesting and

3512
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Oh, Weevil's mom is

3513
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
the clone lady.

3514
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Yeah.

3515
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I kind of didn't really think about what this means

3516
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
for the state of the battle

3517
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
but actually, yeah,

3518
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
there are pretty big implications

3519
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
for how this is going to go down.

3520
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I don't want to let it leave my head

3521
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
that there's

3522
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
a rescue operation with Garp

3523
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
trying to get Kobe from Blackbeard

3524
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
and Weevil has been taking

3525
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
by Red Bull, a green bull

3526
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
not Red Bull.

3527
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
From

3528
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Rokyoyoyo, don't know how to say his name.

3529
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Yeah.

3530
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
And if there's all these warships

3531
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
potentially other admirals

3532
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
because if they asked for Garp

3533
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
to be at this thing and he says, no, I'm going to help Kobe instead

3534
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
like they needed Garp

3535
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
they might need the other admirals.

3536
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
I don't think Aikainu is there.

3537
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
I think it's not that you know it like HQ.

3538
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
He's like, he's at HQ.

3539
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
He was getting like phone calls and stuff.

3540
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Yeah, and I mean...

3541
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Fuji Tora is...

3542
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Do you remember where

3543
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Fuji Tora was?

3544
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
I don't think we've seen Fuji Tora

3545
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
since Dress Rosa.

3546
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
I believe he's just not

3547
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
been around.

3548
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Yeah.

3549
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Yeah, I mean they would need

3550
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
two new ones because

3551
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Aokiji left

3552
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
and Aikainu

3553
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
was promoted.

3554
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Yeah.

3555
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
And Sengoku retired or whatever.

3556
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Yeah.

3557
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Sengoku retired.

3558
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Aikainu became the new...

3559
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Is it called Fleet Admiral?

3560
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Fleet Admiral, yeah.

3561
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
The highest position of the Marines.

3562
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Green Bull and...

3563
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
I think it's Green Bull and Purple Monkey.

3564
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Or

3565
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Purple...

3566
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Dragon?

3567
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
I don't think it's Dragon.

3568
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Or is Kizaru Yellow Monkey?

3569
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I forget the names like that.

3570
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Let's have a little

3571
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Google.

3572
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Fuji Tora is Purple Something.

3573
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
And Aokiji is

3574
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Blue... I think Aokiji is probably

3575
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Blue Dragon?

3576
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
No.

3577
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
No.

3578
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Isho, better known by his alias

3579
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Fuji Tora is an admiral

3580
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
in the Marines.

3581
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Where is Purple?

3582
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
He's got to be the Purple Man.

3583
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Does he wear Purple? I mean I haven't seen him

3584
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
drawn. Yeah, he wears Purple.

3585
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Well, the manga

3586
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
is in black and white.

3587
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I watched a bit of Dress Rosa anime.

3588
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I tried to watch the anime.

3589
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I think it was just a little

3590
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
slow going just generally.

3591
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Kizaru is Yellow Monkey.

3592
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Fuji Tora is

3593
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Wisteria Tiger, but Wisteria

3594
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
is like a purple flower.

3595
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Oh, Fuji Tora

3596
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
literally meaning Wisteria Tiger

3597
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
is in Japanese.

3598
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Okay.

3599
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Aokiji was Blue Pheasant

3600
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
and Ayaka was Red Dog.

3601
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Okay.

3602
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Nice color-coded

3603
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
villains.

3604
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Um...

3605
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Hell, yeah.

3606
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
They're all big.

3607
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
I found

3608
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
doing the pod de-cast

3609
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
was quite fun to like

3610
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
wrap my head around some of the

3611
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
longer...

3612
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Like, some of the things that just

3613
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
sort of leave your mind when they're not

3614
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
happening in front of you and then they come back

3615
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
and it's like, whoa!

3616
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
It's like, what the fuck?

3617
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
It was good to have the discussion

3618
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
so I could like wrap my head around stuff

3619
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
that was happening week to week.

3620
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Honestly,

3621
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
when I just read it

3622
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
there's like so much

3623
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
it kind of just

3624
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
leaves my head and I kind of just

3625
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
don't even bother to try.

3626
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
I kind of just don't even bother trying to keep it all in

3627
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
because like I know I can't do it.

3628
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I

3629
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I pride myself on remembering some stuff.

3630
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
It's fun.

3631
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
I like complicated, extremely...

3632
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
extremely complicated stories.

3633
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I really like the parts of the caribbean

3634
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
when in like two and three

3635
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
when they just kept getting weirder and stranger.

3636
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
I was like, fuck yeah.

3637
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
I understand. Nobody else did.

3638
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
They were all like,

3639
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
what? Huh?

3640
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Where's the crabs come from?

3641
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I don't think I saw that one.

3642
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Don't think I saw

3643
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
past like the second one.

3644
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
No, the third one carries

3645
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
on from the second one.

3646
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
It's like the continuation of that

3647
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Davy Jones story.

3648
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I definitely saw

3649
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
the second one with Davy Jones.

3650
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Yeah, and the third one is

3651
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Davy Jones part two.

3652
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
You gotta watch it.

3653
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
That's great.

3654
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I love it. It's pirates.

3655
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I love pirates so much.

3656
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Pirates are good,

3657
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I guess.

3658
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I guess.

3659
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
One last thing we didn't mention.

3660
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Stussy, old.

3661
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I don't know how to talk about Stussy.

3662
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Yes, true.

3663
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Old Stussy says

3664
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
that Vegapunk will know how to prove

3665
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
that Weevil is

3666
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Whitebeard's son.

3667
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
I guess

3668
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
that means

3669
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
the technology, DNA technology

3670
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
is not widely known and used.

3671
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Interesting, let me

3672
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
see here.

3673
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
But it could mean something more deep than that

3674
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
because we see Weevil has a lot of scars on him.

3675
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Is he a construct?

3676
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Is he like a freak made of the DNA

3677
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
of Whitebeard?

3678
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Yeah, I mean.

3679
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Is he like a clone

3680
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
of Whitebeard just like Stussy was a clone?

3681
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
She could mean that

3682
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
he can do a paternity test

3683
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
or

3684
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
she could mean

3685
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
that he knows something about

3686
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Weevil's history

3687
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
that he can vouch for it.

3688
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
I think the fact that

3689
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Stussy is already

3690
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
one of the rocks pirates cloned

3691
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
perfectly

3692
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
could mean that another rocks pirate

3693
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
was unsuccessfully cloned

3694
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
and they made a freak Frankenstein's Weevil.

3695
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Oh.

3696
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Does he have

3697
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Weevil?

3698
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I mean,

3699
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
I don't know if there's scars.

3700
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Could he be like a patchwork

3701
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
man?

3702
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Like they put pieces of him together

3703
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
out of pieces of Whitebeard

3704
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
or something?

3705
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
He could be.

3706
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
I think it wouldn't be as simple as

3707
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
just like an inheritance dispute.

3708
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
I think the fact that Stussy is like a scientist

3709
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
and Vegapunk knows the secret

3710
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
could lead to some sort of clone

3711
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
attempt

3712
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
that didn't really work.

3713
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
You know

3714
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
that's

3715
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
you're almost certainly

3716
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
right.

3717
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
This is

3718
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
weird paternity

3719
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
shit going on there.

3720
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Cloning is involved.

3721
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
What else can I say?

3722
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Cloning is almost certainly involved.

3723
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I'm

3724
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
sort of like

3725
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
because the Gorose is coming

3726
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
at least this guy

3727
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
and his ability to take over the Seraphim

3728
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
I feel like

3729
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
it's likely that

3730
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
the Straw Hats might escape

3731
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
but not with the Seraphim

3732
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
and the Seraphim will put up a fight

3733
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
because he's there somehow

3734
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
gets in contact with them.

3735
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
The Marines take over Egghead

3736
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
and Vegapunk

3737
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
and his Vegapunkettes

3738
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
and hopefully some of them will die

3739
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
but

3740
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
some of them will live

3741
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
and they'll run away

3742
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
but I think the Seraphim

3743
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
they're not going to be helping the Straw Hats

3744
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
on the ship. I feel like

3745
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
they're staying here somehow.

3746
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Zora says

3747
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
he sees humanity

3748
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
so I mean

3749
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
is it just going to be like

3750
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
at some point

3751
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
they have to

3752
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
follow the Gorose's orders

3753
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
but maybe at some point they'll be like

3754
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
I don't like this

3755
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
actually.

3756
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I'm going to be a good guy.

3757
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Maybe they'll be taken to Majora's

3758
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
like super bodyguards

3759
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
and then

3760
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
the special secret

3761
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
that something really inspirational

3762
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
will happen. Luffy will be so

3763
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
bathed and then they'll hear about it

3764
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
on the Denden Mushi on the radio

3765
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
and they'll be like you know what

3766
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
fuck the Goros saying and they kill them all

3767
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
they kill them all right there

3768
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
they got guys on the inside

3769
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
that's

3770
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
it would be really funny if

3771
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
that's just how they did

3772
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
literally

3773
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Luffy does something cool on the radio

3774
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
and they're all just like oh that's neat

3775
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
maybe

3776
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
slavery is bad and then they just kill

3777
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
the five presidents

3778
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
okay

3779
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
revolution

3780
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
I

3781
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
love one piece

3782
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
it's good I can't believe a comic

3783
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
is good

3784
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
and then there's the fucking

3785
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
the fucking laser beam from space

3786
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
that killed potentially

3787
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
killed

3788
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
are they going to use

3789
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
that laser beam on an egg head

3790
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
wait did they

3791
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
what did they blow up with that again

3792
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
which island it was just an island

3793
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Sabo was seen like hiding

3794
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
and after he escaped Marishwa

3795
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
because he like it was

3796
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
like oh he killed King

3797
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Cobra from alabaster

3798
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
that was the story anyway

3799
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
we don't know what happened but that's

3800
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
it's that's what's the story and then he

3801
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
was ran away he was in hiding and then

3802
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
they like from space

3803
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
or from the sky blasted it

3804
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
with a giant laser if they have

3805
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
a giant space laser

3806
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
what do they need the what do they need

3807
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
buster calls for

3808
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
because this

3809
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
takes a while to level up power

3810
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
up this the laser

3811
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
maybe it's maybe it's like

3812
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
it's hard to hide the existence

3813
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
of a giant laser so they

3814
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
don't want to do it

3815
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
all the time because if people like

3816
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
that island used to exist and then it suddenly doesn't

3817
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
that's a bit weird you know

3818
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
the giant speak no I kind

3819
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
of forgot about the giant space laser

3820
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
but that definitely happened and probably

3821
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
it deserves

3822
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
some consideration

3823
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
probably there will be

3824
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
consequences to that

3825
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
it's sort of interesting though because it's like

3826
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
it implies that Sabo learned

3827
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
information that is even more dangerous

3828
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
than what Vega punk has figured out

3829
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
because they're not using that here

3830
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
they could have

3831
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
probably yeah you know

3832
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
like what the hell did Sabo learn

3833
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
but I mean maybe

3834
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
maybe it's not a space

3835
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
laser maybe it's like somebody's fruit power

3836
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
and they have to be there to do it

3837
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
I well I think

3838
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
it's more likely that it's one of the

3839
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
ancient weapons that I mean

3840
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
the world government has control of

3841
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
yeah like the idea

3842
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
of these ancient weapons existing

3843
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
and like a bunch

3844
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
of history that's been erased probably

3845
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
speaks to me like

3846
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
the ancient weapons were used in the person

3847
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
it was devastating and the PR

3848
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
would be terrible if people knew about it

3849
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
the PR would be

3850
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
I mean it would yeah

3851
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
um

3852
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
yeah but then

3853
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
I guess it would

3854
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
beg the question of why they're not

3855
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
using it

3856
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
here and I guess

3857
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
either

3858
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
like there's something there's stuff here

3859
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
that they don't want to destroy

3860
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
along with Vega punk

3861
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
I guess so he does have a big brain

3862
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
computer

3863
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
yeah they might they might want to

3864
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
secure that

3865
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
that's so fucking weird the more I think about it

3866
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
like that's his actual brain

3867
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
that's his actual brain yeah

3868
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
basically the island itself

3869
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
or like a big chunk of it floating in the clouds

3870
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
is just

3871
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
his actual brain that he took out of his head

3872
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
and he put in a big ball

3873
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
and uh

3874
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
yep like if the if the if he runs away

3875
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
can't they just turn his brain off

3876
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
and then he becomes dumb

3877
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I think they just destroy it

3878
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
they I guess they wouldn't be allowed to destroy it

3879
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
I think that if they

3880
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
they could destroy if they destroyed

3881
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
the brain I assume it would kill him

3882
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
and if they killed

3883
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
him I assume that the brain

3884
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
would also die

3885
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
uh

3886
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
and but I mean

3887
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
I don't know how they would use

3888
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
the brain

3889
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
without him like surely he is the one

3890
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
who can use the brain

3891
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
or maybe he has

3892
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
some devices that interface with it

3893
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
well he already has like

3894
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
the other vega punks who are like

3895
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
constructs that share his brain

3896
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
yeah I assume and he was talking about

3897
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
like what if the entire world could be linked

3898
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
together and share knowledge

3899
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
yeah like he's probably working on

3900
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
the ability to disseminate information

3901
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
that's probably like a thing you could work on

3902
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
like I'm gonna tell everyone about

3903
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
the void sentry

3904
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
and then he's gonna broadcast it across

3905
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
the whole world everyone's gonna know

3906
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
everyone's gonna know it all at once

3907
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
that's I predict that happening

3908
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
I yeah

3909
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I think you're probably

3910
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
right I think probably something like that

3911
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
is gonna happen

3912
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
and everyone's gonna be like

3913
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
what the fuck the world government sucks

3914
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
and they're gonna revolt all at once

3915
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
it's funny because like everybody already knows

3916
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
what the world government sucks

3917
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
they kind of don't need to know

3918
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
they kind of don't need to be told about

3919
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
it would be unrealistic

3920
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
if like some

3921
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
because you know

3922
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
in real life

3923
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
the government declassifies

3924
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
like secret documents about like

3925
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
unbelievably fucked up shit the CIA did

3926
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
all the time and nobody gives a shit

3927
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
everyone's just like oh really

3928
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
yeah okay that's fine

3929
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
it's like how do you really fight that

3930
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
they have the power to stop you

3931
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
if you try and stop them

3932
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
it's like yeah whatever

3933
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
yeah yeah

3934
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
it's a nice idea though

3935
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
like oh everybody

3936
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
lets unite and

3937
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
overthrow them

3938
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
sharing the secret of the void sentry

3939
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
even if it's not like

3940
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
oh well if they did that

3941
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
then we've all gotta

3942
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
revolt and fight them

3943
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
even if it's not like that

3944
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
there could still be

3945
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
information

3946
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
involved in that that is important

3947
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
for something

3948
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
I guess the only thing that I could imagine

3949
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
is that the information

3950
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
being disseminated like that

3951
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
would mean that even the marines would turn on the world

3952
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
government and so it would be everybody

3953
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
in the world fighting against

3954
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
this guy at the top

3955
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
yeah

3956
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
if it were if it were

3957
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
if it were like

3958
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
I mean if they're doing

3959
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
I mean it seems like they're doing

3960
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
like

3961
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
the worst war crimes imaginable

3962
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
like blowing up whole islands

3963
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
with the freaking

3964
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
pluton or whatever

3965
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
there's pretty much nothing worse you can do

3966
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
in this world than that

3967
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
yeah

3968
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
it would be the sort of thing that would

3969
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
justify

3970
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
good characters being in the marines

3971
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
yeah there already are

3972
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
some good characters in the marines like we've got

3973
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Kobe and stuff and like Kobe must be part of

3974
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
like a marine network that's trying to

3975
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
like change the marines from the inside

3976
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
so

3977
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
I feel like that's it's not

3978
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
necessarily the case I think he's like he's a marine

3979
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
and he's trying to do the right thing

3980
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
and there are lots of marines like that

3981
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
and I think even on

3982
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
some level Ikeino is like that

3983
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
they're not like

3984
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
yeah I feel like if the information

3985
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
about the void sentry was leaked

3986
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
a lot of marines

3987
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
that are like Ikeino is the sort of

3988
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
character who like

3989
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
is very honorable

3990
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
and does like

3991
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
you know he's very strict

3992
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
but if he learns that he'll be like

3993
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
I can't in good conscience

3994
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
support this any bit longer and he'll be like

3995
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
ah cool like a bad guy turned good moment

3996
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
isn't Ikeino like a complete bastard though

3997
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
yeah I mean yeah but like

3998
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
he's only a bastard in the way that he's like

3999
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
you damn pirates

4000
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
I kind of think I don't know my impression

4001
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
of Ikeino is that he

4002
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
would justify like

4003
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
anything like in this for the sake of like

4004
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
peacekeeping or whatever

4005
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
he'd be totally fine with war crimes

4006
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
I don't know

4007
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
could be

4008
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
I don't feel like he doesn't feel like

4009
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
final boss evil

4010
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
I guess neither does Blackbeard

4011
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
in the same sense that like Blackbeard's

4012
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
just self-centered he just wants power

4013
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
yeah

4014
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I just like I like the trope of

4015
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
I just really like the trope of the guy

4016
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
who you don't expect to be a friend

4017
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
will be friend you

4018
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
when is needed

4019
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
maybe

4020
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
like oh Luffy and Ikeino like

4021
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I killed your brother but we got to kill

4022
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
the world government instead

4023
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
but that's all

4024
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
that's for later for now

4025
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
we gotta

4026
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
prevent war crimes Luffy

4027
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
I mean he came here to kick ass

4028
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
and prevent war crimes

4029
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
and I'm all out of ass to kick so

4030
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
let's prevent some war crimes

4031
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
I guess I don't know

4032
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
like Fujitora definitely strikes me

4033
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
as a good marine

4034
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
who is just doing his job

4035
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
and would revolt

4036
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
against the world government if it came to it

4037
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Ikeino is a one you wouldn't expect

4038
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
which is why I like the idea

4039
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
but yeah there's like Smoker

4040
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
there's Kobe, Helma Po

4041
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
who else

4042
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
there's a few other marines I think

4043
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
there's that old lady

4044
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
who's always around

4045
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
to me

4046
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
in my mind

4047
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Ikeino sort of represents

4048
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
like pretty much the worst

4049
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
of the worst elements of the marines

4050
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
he's the one who will like

4051
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
dispense

4052
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
justice that is

4053
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
and that justice can be as brutal

4054
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
as it needs to be and he doesn't care

4055
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
as long as it's like justice dispensed

4056
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
by the book

4057
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
I suppose

4058
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
I guess

4059
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
I don't think I've heard

4060
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
that the marines have become

4061
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
more evil under Ikeino

4062
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
like it's not like

4063
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
the marines have started to become bad

4064
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
people more so than under

4065
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Sengoku

4066
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
I mean they're already bad

4067
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
I know that but you know what I mean

4068
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Yeah

4069
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Sengoku is kind of a good guy

4070
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
but the marines were still bad

4071
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
still bad

4072
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
I don't think there's anything

4073
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
that's necessarily changed

4074
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
I don't feel like anything has necessarily

4075
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
changed at least not like

4076
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
explicitly with Ikeino being in charge

4077
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
oh my god the societal issues

4078
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
they were systemic it's not just

4079
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
about replacing the one guy at the top

4080
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
oh my god

4081
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
oh my god you mean it's just about

4082
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
investing individuals

4083
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
with the power to

4084
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
fucking oppress people at will

4085
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
and that's the problem

4086
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
no

4087
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
that would say something about society

4088
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
I love One Piece

4089
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
I do

4090
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
it's true

4091
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
yeah you know it is unlikely

4092
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
that Ikeino would like be a good guy

4093
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
right at the end

4094
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
but it's wishful thinking because I just

4095
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
love the trope I just love that trope

4096
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
yeah he would have blown up the earth

4097
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
he really would have

4098
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
and then he got beat up and he's like

4099
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
oh I love that do it again

4100
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
yeah but I mean

4101
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Vegeta had

4102
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
motives

4103
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
I understand I mean I'm in shirt

4104
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Ikeino could have motives

4105
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
that might

4106
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
affect his behavior

4107
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
when I was a little boy

4108
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
and he took a shit

4109
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
on my favorite toy and I cried

4110
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
and then from that day on

4111
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I said I'll kill that pirate

4112
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
now

4113
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
but now I realize

4114
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
that the marines shit on even more

4115
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
toys

4116
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
they shit with our giant lasers

4117
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
I think

4118
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
the One Piece

4119
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
is the friends they made along the way

4120
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
true

4121
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
we are One Piece

4122
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
of the puzzle

4123
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
of life

4124
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
the One Piece is

4125
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
world peace

4126
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
I mean

4127
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
you know what the One Piece is

4128
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
have I said what I think the One Piece is

4129
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
I think so I forgot though

4130
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
what did you say

4131
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
to me

4132
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
the foreshadowing

4133
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
seems clear

4134
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
that the One Piece

4135
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
refers to the unification

4136
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
of the four seas

4137
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
which will be achieved

4138
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
by destroying marriage war

4139
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
and shattering the red line

4140
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
and combining the four blues

4141
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
into the all blue

4142
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
it's the one world

4143
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
the unified world

4144
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
is the One Piece

4145
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
that comes with implications

4146
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
that whatever happened in the void century

4147
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
was

4148
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
is like maybe involved

4149
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
the ancient weapons building

4150
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
the red line to split everything up

4151
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
and put marriage war right at the top

4152
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
maybe

4153
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
they earth bent

4154
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
the red line into existence

4155
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
using an ancient weapon

4156
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
like there was no marriage war

4157
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
and no red line

4158
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
actually

4159
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
the red line is a very

4160
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
makes them easier to control

4161
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
if they can like split them up

4162
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
and it's like a

4163
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
maybe a parallel

4164
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
to like the Berlin wall

4165
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
and things like that

4166
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
I kind of never even really thought about it

4167
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
but yeah you know

4168
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
the red line is a very strange geographic feature

4169
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
maybe they might have created it artificially somehow

4170
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
so yeah

4171
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
I definitely agree with like

4172
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
the red line of marriage war

4173
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
being broken and then all blue and all that

4174
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
that's a good theory

4175
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
and I think

4176
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
will definitely come to pass

4177
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
the fact, what's your name

4178
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
the mermaid oracle

4179
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
or whatever

4180
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
the one that like prophesied

4181
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
that would destroy fishman island

4182
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
and then because

4183
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
fishman island is directly below marriage war

4184
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
marriage war, yeah

4185
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
then they're going to be

4186
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
falling on them

4187
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
it's going to be pretty fucked

4188
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
it's not going to be good

4189
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
it's not going to be good for those guys

4190
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
in particular

4191
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
yeah and then

4192
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
of course

4193
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
red line gets broken, laboon comes through

4194
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
and he's like haha it's we laboon

4195
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
and then brooks finally meets him

4196
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
oh wait I forgot

4197
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
the one piece actually

4198
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
refers to brook and laboon

4199
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
reuniting and becoming one pair

4200
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
of best friends forever

4201
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
yes

4202
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
and that's why roger laughed because he didn't know

4203
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
who laboon was

4204
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
yeah of course

4205
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
he said laboon

4206
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
haha what does that mean I don't understand

4207
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
anyway I'm going to die of cancer

4208
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
now goodbye

4209
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
exactly

4210
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
what did that's

4211
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
roger laughed when he saw

4212
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
one piece right when he saw what was on

4213
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
rafthel

4214
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
he went to rafthel and it was like

4215
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
either a pony glyph or a treasure

4216
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
or I don't think it was the one piece

4217
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
or maybe it was

4218
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
it must have been something

4219
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
left by joyboy

4220
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
wait a minute

4221
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
one piece is the name for roger's treasure

4222
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
roger left something

4223
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
and that's one piece

4224
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
so he didn't find one piece

4225
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
one piece didn't really exist before roger

4226
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
unless

4227
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
I mean I guess he could have found something

4228
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
yeah

4229
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
he went to rafthel

4230
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
yeah that was the thing

4231
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
roger searched the entire grand line

4232
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
and he figured out the void sentry

4233
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
by reading the pony glyphs

4234
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
and that made him

4235
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
probably reading the final pony glyph

4236
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
and learning the secret of the void sentry

4237
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
is probably what made him laugh

4238
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
yeah and joyboy

4239
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
I think there was a thing on rafthel that joyboy left

4240
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
like either a story

4241
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
or like a pony glyph special

4242
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
something that they

4243
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
yeah so the previous

4244
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
presumably the previous user

4245
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
of luffy's devil fruit

4246
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
and so

4247
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
he laughed when he found

4248
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
either the knowledge or the item

4249
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
that contained the knowledge

4250
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
and they just like ha ha

4251
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
I've got freaking chills

4252
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
I've got freaking chills

4253
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
I can't adequately

4254
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
express how much

4255
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
I get out of

4256
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
one piece is like thematic

4257
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
use of like

4258
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
smiling and laughter

4259
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
and joy

4260
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
it's like so good

4261
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
they have such big smiles

4262
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
they have such big teeth

4263
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
they sure do

4264
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
that's how I knew

4265
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
that's how I know this marine was a fishman

4266
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
because he had spiky R long teeth

4267
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
and funny BDAs

4268
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
that's how you know

4269
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
that's the tell

4270
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
sometimes

4271
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
unless they're like a different kind of fish

4272
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
doesn't have that

4273
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
and that's not the tell

4274
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
well do we have anything else

4275
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
to say about one piece

4276
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
oh sorry

4277
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
next week

4278
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
we will not have a new chapter to talk about

4279
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
no the podcast

4280
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
will only be two hours long

4281
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
and everyone will complain

4282
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
that's okay

4283
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
that is okay

4284
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
you're right actually it's perfectly fine

4285
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
you want to go to voicemails

4286
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
uh yes

4287
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
alright end of one piece discussion

4288
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
end of one piece discussion

4289
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
you can now continue listening

4290
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
that was Marty saying that

4291
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
yeah

4292
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
okay next

4293
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
the first voicemail

4294
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
the first voicemail is called

4295
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
you know are you ready

4296
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
3, 2, 1, go

4297
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
so yeah

4298
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
the last one was this

4299
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
first season finale

4300
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
of my saga

4301
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
you know I'm just being cool

4302
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
if I'm being too annoying

4303
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
too schizophrenic

4304
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I can

4305
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
settle for a little

4306
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
just being cool you know

4307
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
just being cool

4308
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
just being in the olympian fall

4309
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
secretly all on

4310

4324
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000

4325
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
mage

02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
do you think I'd want to kill her

4327
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
just to spite her as a reviewer

4328
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000

4329
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000

that was a voice of misanthropony

4332
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
I think that was clips of misanthropony

4333
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
spliced together

4334
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
I'm glad he does not want to kill

4335
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
mage just to spite her as a reviewer

4336
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000

4341
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000

oh this looks great

4345
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
this is a

4346
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
little homestucky

4347
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
oh

4348
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
I've got misanthropony there

4349
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
in the front

4350
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
and then

4351
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
gcat

4352
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000

4353
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000

4354
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
and then her house is mage

4355
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
I really like how mage looks

4356
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
in this little drawing

4357
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
oh mage is poking out

4358
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
the little window there

4359
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
poking out the little window there

4360
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
that's cute and you know

4361
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
misanthropony

4362
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
held outside of the premises

4363
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
by the iron gate as he should be

4364
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
he should not be allowed

4365
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
within 500 feet

4366
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
uh

4367
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
alright good

4368
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
awww

4369
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
cute

4370
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
I see the image you posted here

4371
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
um

4372
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
next one is called

4373
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
a dangerous mind

4374
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
from cock at sleeve dot

4375
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
ben

4376
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
3 2 1 go

4377
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
I can be here all day

4378
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
and if I send someone

4379
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
into a spiral through my conversation

4380
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
with them we're there now thinking all day

4381
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
sometimes I feel guilty about that

4382
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
like I really try not to get

4383
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
so real with people about

4384
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
what I read in their communication

4385
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
it's going to like fuck with their ability

4386
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
to be themselves

4387
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
because most people

4388
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
don't know where to go with that

4389
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
you can't just like experience

4390
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
an ego death and then just

4391
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
go back to work the next

4392
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
day and like

4393
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
well ok you will

4394
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
but it will just wear off

4395
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
basically that's what I'm saying

4396
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
you can't just be

4397
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
what the fuck

4398
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
I don't get it I think it's a little too

4399
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
out of context

4400
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
I mean I think it sounds like she is saying

4401
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
I think this is a little bit like

4402
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
aww people knew what I was really thinking

4403
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
it's like

4404
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
I don't tell people

4405
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
it's like ok I get it

4406
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
it's like

4407
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
I'm so smart and so

4408
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
perceptive that if I told people

4409
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
what I can immediately

4410
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
tell and intuit about them

4411
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
from the things they say to me

4412
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
it would literally destroy them

4413
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
it would break their mind

4414
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
it would shatter their psyche and give them an ego death

4415
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
but I don't do that

4416
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
I spare them from that

4417
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
because it would be cruel

4418
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
to impart

4419
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
that forbidden knowledge to them

4420
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
they're better off not knowing

4421
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
could it not be

4422
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
that you say something about someone

4423
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
that's untrue and also offensive

4424
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
and then they get mad

4425
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
could that also be the case

4426
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
is that

4427
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
it is never the case

4428
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
that like a snap

4429
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
a snap judgment I come to when I hear you say something

4430
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
or I see something that you say

4431
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
it's never me just assuming

4432
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
it's a profound insight

4433
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
that I've had into you

4434
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
every single time

4435
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
every single time

4436
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
and that's just what you gotta keep in mind

4437
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
we live in a society

4438
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
that's pretty funny

4439
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
honestly pretty funny quote

4440
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
next one is called

4441
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
the legend

4442
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
3 2 1 go

4443
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
have you heard the legend of Archimedes

4444
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
no

4445
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
yeah

4446
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
no

4447
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
no

4448
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
isn't Archimedes one of the vagapunks

4449
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
I was thinking of Achilles

4450
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
I guess I haven't seen Archimedes nuts

4451
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Archimedes

4452
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
who

4453
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
jumped out of the bath

4454
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
and said Eureka Eureka

4455
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
yeah that guy

4456
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
and he invented the screw

4457
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
he jumped out of the bath and he said Eureka

4458
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
Eureka Eureka

4459
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Eureka Eureka Eureka

4460
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
he said these nuts they Eureka they Eureka

4461
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
I gotta take a bath to make them smell better

4462
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
that's why he was in a bath yes

4463
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
he invented the screw

4464
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
like he screwed everyone

4465
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
he invented sex

4466
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
I love him

4467
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
do you know about the Archimedes screw

4468
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
do you know how that works

4469
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
oh the Archimedes screw

4470
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
it's a little device

4471
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
that transport you could transport liquids

4472
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
up a vertical

4473
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
oh yes I know about those

4474
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
they used them in fucking aqueducts

4475
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
he probably invented

4476
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
other things as well

4477
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
in fucking roman something or others

4478
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
maybe not roman things

4479
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
he invented it might just be named after him

4480
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
now that I think about it

4481
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
I don't know

4482
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
yeah displacement

4483
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
yes I know about Archimedes yes I read one piece

4484
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
isn't he one of the robots

4485
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
I don't remember

4486
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
I don't think so

4487
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
one of them is Edison

4488
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
I kind of thought one was named Archimedes

4489
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
oh well

4490
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
wait maybe I'm thinking

4491
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
is that the name of like

4492
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Night Owls

4493
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000

in

4495
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Watchmen

4496
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
or something

4497
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
I don't know

4498
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000

02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
Fly in Batmobile is called Archimedes

4501
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
okay

4502
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
very good excellent

4503
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
where was I

4504
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
next voicemail did I download that one

4505
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
no

4506
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
okay whatever next one is an image

4507
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
let's look at it shall we

4508
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
no you're not

4509
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
okay

4510
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
oh this meme I haven't seen this meme in a while

4511
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
what's all this racket going on up here son

4512
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
do you remember that

4513
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
I never see this one anymore

4514
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
I never see this comic anymore

4515
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
I feel like I've seen it like a handful of times

4516
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
you see it all the time

4517
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
what's going on up here

4518
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
this racket going on up here son

4519
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
you're watching your internet talk show again

4520
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
it's called PCP dead

4521
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
it's not about drugs and it's not to use anime podcasts

4522
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
this is where the best of voicemails is a deep intricate lore

4523
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
that normally you wouldn't understand

4524
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
watch for a second

4525
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
so the other day I took a bus to Oldies

4526
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
and there was a homeless guy on the bus

4527
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
and he smelled really bad

4528
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
I talked to the girl and I had to get off the bus

4529
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
the next stop we started just talking to each other

4530
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
until the last stop so then I had to find my way back

4531
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
so that's nice

4532
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
that's nice dear

4533
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
son how can you watch this

4534
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
there's no name

4535
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
this rules

4536
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
this dad is the joker

4537
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
the original is like

4538
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
the dad is like

4539
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
oh wait the original has the dad

4540
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
I know the dad from a lot of stuff

4541
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
they stopped using the comic

4542
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
yeah

4543
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
the original is like

4544
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
you watching them girl cartoons

4545
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
again son it's like it's called anime dad

4546
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
and then the third panel is like

4547
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
some stupid anime shit

4548
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
and the dad just

4549
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
that's one

4550
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
son how can you watch this

4551
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
there's no name

4552
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
what the fuck

4553
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
who's gonna teach you to be straight and white

4554
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
what am I doing in this panel

4555
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I think you're ironing

4556
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
a shirt

4557
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
or something

4558
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
that's nice dear

4559
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
I just said

4560
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
there's a vacant expression on my face

4561
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
my like glass eyes looking

4562
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
in two different directions

4563
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
feels good

4564
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
no thoughts head empty

4565
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
next one is another image

4566
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
another image

4567
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
let's look at it

4568
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
let's freaking look

4569
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
uh

4570
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
uh

4571
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
yeah I get it

4572
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
I get it

4573
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
now you're banging her Ben

4574
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
no

4575
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
it would be

4576
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
that's where it would go

4577
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
it would be she's

4578
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
who's banging who

4579
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
hang on

4580
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
it's like

4581
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Jeff or whatever

4582
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
wear your pants

4583
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
oh I took them off because I was banging your mom for a minute there

4584
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
and now you are banging her

4585
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
hehehe like that's the comic

4586
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
so in this situation

4587
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
you would be banging her at this very moment

4588
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
hang on I have to I have to confirm

4589
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
you can't remember this one that's the best one

4590
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
I just can't remember the exact

4591
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
machinations

4592
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
of it

4593
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
bro

4594
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
I took them off because I was banging your mom for a minute there

4595
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
and now you are banging her

4596
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
okay

4597
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
well I think you should switch them

4598
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
I think Christine should be on the left

4599
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
and I should be on the right because the

4600
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
I mean the punchline should be that it ends with Chris

4601
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
banging her own mom right

4602
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
and that's not the situation

4603
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
that's not the situation you've constructed here

4604
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
well it's

4605
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
it's past tense

4606
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
it happened

4607
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
oh that's right

4608
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
Chris's mom is not even involved in this situation

4609
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
this is a misplay

4610
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
oh that's true

4611
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
this is Ben's mom

4612
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
yeah and that's just disrespectful

4613
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
thanks for the voicemail

4614
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
so in the other one if it was switch

4615
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
you would be banging

4616
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
Chris's mom

4617
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
well no I think

4618
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
I should be saying yeah dude

4619
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
I was banging your mom for a minute there

4620
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
and now you are banging her

4621
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
hehehe

4622
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
that's how it should go

4623
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
I'm sorry

4624
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
I'm looking at the original comic again

4625
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
hehehe

4626
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
I love it so much

4627
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
I gotta post it

4628
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
I gotta fucking post it

4629
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
I always read it as hehehe

4630
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
I would say

4631
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
I guess

4632
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
I only think of a hair

4633
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
when it's got an H at the end

4634
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
yeah that's fair

4635
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
but I mean I would say if I were saying he

4636
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
I would spell it with two E's

4637
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
well that's why

4638
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
sweet brown hella Jeff

4639
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
it's so cool

4640
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
it bugs the trends of normal typing

4641
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
it makes you think

4642
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
it makes you

4643
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
makes you question

4644
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
makes you question everything

4645
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
okay

4646
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
the next one is called

4647
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
you know

4648
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
3 2 1 go

4649
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
what do you think

4650
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
when you are not

4651
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
thinking anything

4652
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
what does your mind go everyday to

4653
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
I always

4654
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
go to

4655
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
monkey

4656
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
and also

4657
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
monkey

4658
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
where does your mind go

4659
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
that's hard to know

4660
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
I think about

4661
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
stuff being gay

4662
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
like this like

4663
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
like gay

4664
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
that's gay I don't know

4665
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
sometimes I just default to thinking about

4666
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
calling things gay in my head

4667
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
oops

4668
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
homophobic

4669
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
I don't know how to answer this question

4670
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
I

4671
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
like

4672
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
when my mind's not

4673
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
occupied with any particular thought

4674
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
I also think

4675
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
about like aw fuck

4676
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
I'm gonna kill myself

4677
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
but in like a funny way

4678
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
in like a funny and cool way

4679
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
not in like a weird way though

4680
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
that's a good default

4681
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
thought that I have a lot

4682
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
just like wall kill myself

4683
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
you know

4684
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
oh like words I would use

4685
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
if I was just

4686
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
making up some song

4687
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
like a rap

4688
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
to nothing in particular

4689
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
and I default to some specific words

4690
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
like chicken and motherfucker

4691
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
because I like the

4692
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
the rhythm they have

4693
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
but that's not the same as like what thoughts enter my head

4694
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
when I'm not really thinking about anything

4695
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
don't know how to answer

4696
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
I'll have to think about it

4697
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
um

4698
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
yeah

4699
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
gay

4700
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
gay kill myself

4701
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
that's pretty much it

4702
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
I guess you two poop quotes

4703
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
they enter my head pretty frequently

4704
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
like lampoil rope bombs

4705
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
it's yours my friend

4706
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
as long as you have enough rubies

4707
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
that's a pretty fun one

4708
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
that's a pretty fun one

4709
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
mine's not that fun

4710
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
mine's not that funny

4711
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
alright next one

4712
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
download that one

4713
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
next one is called appreciating ben saint

4714
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
vomit

4715
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
3 2 1 go

4716
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
I've finally been watching ben's

4717
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
winnie the pooh retrospectives

4718
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
and they're good I like the videos

4719
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
one of these days

4720
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
but I've noticed that like

4721
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
either it's because

4722
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
ben has become

4723
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
funnier over the years

4724
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
or it's because

4725
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
of like the effects of

4726
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
either more speaking

4727
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
ad-lib style versus

4728
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
speaking on a more like

4729
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
maybe scripted basis

4730
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
in like more video essay-ish

4731
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
style in those winnie the pooh videos

4732
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
but I feel like these days

4733
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
in like the more modern lecture content

4734
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
I find

4735
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
ben a lot funnier

4736
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
these days

4737
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
even some like

4738
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
podcast moment just like random

4739
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
offhand comments make me laugh way more

4740
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
than like

4741
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
anything that's like a scripted joke

4742
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
in the video

4743
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
essay thingies

4744
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
and I just thought that that was interesting

4745
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
just you know

4746
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
none of those scripted jokes can live up to

4747
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
king you nerd

4748
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
from the fucking mega man

4749
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
video I don't know

4750
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
makes me chuckle

4751
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
that's funny

4752
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
that's funny because I did have

4753
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
a couple of like scripted jokes that I sort of

4754
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
like wrote ahead of time

4755
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
in the lecture

4756
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
I didn't

4757
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
I did kind of have notes

4758
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
for the winnie the pooh the winnie the pooh is

4759
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
off the cuff but I do have like

4760
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
notes that I'm like pretty closely

4761
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
following in like the things that I talk about

4762
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
I didn't really write

4763
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
many like jokes for it though I wasn't really trying

4764
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
to be funny

4765
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
yeah I felt like I mean it's not like

4766
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
you weren't funny around that time

4767
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
I feel like the winnie the pooh

4768
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
videos were like more

4769
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
deliberately serious

4770
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
in tone and that's why

4771
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
I don't like they have

4772
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
a different sort of feeling than other videos

4773
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
you had made and other appearances

4774
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
on podcasts and stuff

4775
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
well I think I did

4776
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
occasionally think of like a funny

4777
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
thing to say

4778
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
or a joke to put in there I don't think

4779
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
I did much of that I think I wasn't

4780
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
really prioritizing

4781
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
comedy I wasn't really trying to be funny

4782
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
that much

4783
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
and I was mostly

4784
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
yeah focused on like

4785
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
getting writing my thoughts down

4786
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
and then discussing my

4787
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
my like you know just my earnest

4788
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
thoughts about like

4789
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
the each episode of the show

4790
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
so maybe it was just like priorities

4791
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
is the reason why

4792
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
I don't think I'm funny

4793
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
ever

4794
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
you make me laugh all the time

4795
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
yeah I make myself

4796
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
laugh too but that just means

4797
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
that I'm not funny

4798
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
because you shouldn't laugh at your own jokes

4799
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
that's like not good

4800
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
God I did it again

4801
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
I was trying to do

4802
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
like a mean thing I was trying to do mean

4803
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
spirited like oh you make me laugh

4804
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
as in like I laugh at you because

4805
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
you're amusing as a human

4806
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
specimen

4807
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
but I don't know how to like

4808
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
I don't know how to do that

4809
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
set that up so that it makes sense

4810
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
no you did great

4811
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
no you did great

4812
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
I had to explain the joke I ruined it

4813
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
no that's good

4814
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
oh you got me

4815
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
no

4816
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
when will Ben St know that I hate him

4817
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
oh how I hate him

4818
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
that Charlie Brown

4819
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
was it like that Charlie Brown

4820
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
what a guy what a guy

4821
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
what a fellow that Charlie Brown

4822
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
and then as soon as he's off the screen

4823
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
how I hate him

4824
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
yes

4825
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
I guess I don't really have anything else

4826
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
to say I should finish that one

4827
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
we need a poo thing

4828
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
there's just not enough

4829
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
time in the week

4830
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,000
I can't believe it's another week already

4831
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
another week got away from me

4832
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
as they do

4833
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
alright enough

4834
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
next one is

4835
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
an image

4836
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
there it is

4837
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
it's I believe it is you

4838
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
and Munchie

4839
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
yes but why are we

4840
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
individually

4841
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:45,000
why are we saying these things

4842
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
oh is it like split

4843
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
like not split personality

4844
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
like swapped

4845
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
you would usually be the other way around

4846
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
I

4847
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
I feel like neither of you say either of these things

4848
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
no me either

4849
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
I feel like there's a joke here but like I

4850
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
I'm not getting it

4851
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
like why because you got a long neck

4852
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
yeah what's what's up with that

4853
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000
yeah I don't know

4854
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
I like that I like my face

4855
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
I look like Simpsons

4856
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:19,000
I look like Simpsons

4857
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
you do

4858
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,000
I like Munchie's curl

4859
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
highlights

4860
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
textured

4861
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,000
feathered

4862
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
I

4863
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:33,000
I don't know what else to say about this one

4864
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
if there's a joke I don't get it

4865
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
sorry

4866
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,000
next one is

4867
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
an album

4868
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,000
new PCP logo

4869
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
oh

4870
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
I get it

4871
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
is this a rebel pixels

4872
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
joke or is it just

4873
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,000
I think it's just our colors

4874
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
even though mine is not really

4875
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
that's that's too blue that's more of a

4876
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
DeVue color that's more of DeVue blue

4877
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
than Gibb turquoise

4878
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
I do like that blue though

4879
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
look nothing nothing against that

4880
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
I'm all about those Aquamarine

4881
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
blues and greens

4882
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
nothing against that particular blue

4883
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
just bluer than what I was

4884
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:15,000
imagining

4885
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,000
also blue in the face

4886
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
I mean those two

4887
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
the two do look good together

4888
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,000
that blue and that black

4889
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
yeah

4890
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000
it's funny

4891
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:29,000
the other seven just empty

4892
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,000
just gone desolate

4893
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:33,000
no

4894
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:35,000
I think

4895
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:37,000
do we already talk

4896
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
maybe on the stream I think we talked about

4897
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,000
I think I floated the idea of

4898
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
the logo for

4899
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,000
the perfect comic party

4900
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
new channel logo

4901
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
yeah yeah

4902
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,000
we will debut that at some point perhaps

4903
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,000
I'll maybe work

4904
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
yeah I'll maybe work on

4905
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
drawing up a more

4906
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:59,000
proper version of the

4907
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:01,000
the logo

4908
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:03,000
the title today

4909
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:05,000
oh it's exciting

4910
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
it gives me a hopeful

4911
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:09,000
feeling about the future

4912
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:11,000
the first time

4913
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
ever

4914
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,000
next one is

4915
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
Rod Serling

4916
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
Slime and

4917
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:21,000
Editing

4918
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,000
3, 2, 1, go

4919
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
for now finally the day has come

4920
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
the books are edited

4921
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
printed and out the door

4922
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:51,000
then the reviews roll in

4923
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
and opening up twitter you are horrified

4924
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
to find

4925
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,000
too thin

4926
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,000
this book is too thin they say

4927
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
why aren't there more pages with less information

4928
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
it's been seen

4929
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
girth shaming or something

4930
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
you're cancelled IRL

4931
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
and wither into a cyber realm

4932
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
and you realize what you should have realized

4933
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
there's always

4934
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
always

4935
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
something wrong

4936
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,000
true

4937
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,000
it's true that is a nightmare

4938
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
and I think that we should

4939
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
I think we should normalize

4940
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
cyberizing people into cyber elves

4941
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
as a punishment

4942
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
that was like the worst possible fate

4943
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
cancelling somebody

4944
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
so they turn into a cyber elf

4945
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:37,000
they shrink and contort

4946
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,000
no more body

4947
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:41,000
no more physical

4948
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
incarnation in the physical world

4949
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:45,000
to cyberspace with you

4950
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,000
cyber elves

4951
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,000
can appear in reality

4952
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000
but only briefly is that how they work

4953
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
they can appear in reality

4954
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:55,000
but they can't do anything

4955
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,000
most of the time

4956
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:59,000
they can't do anything without

4957
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000
pretty much expending all their energy

4958
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,000
and basically killing themselves

4959
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:05,000
so they're like a cool flashy looking ghost

4960
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,000
yes

4961
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:09,000
exactly

4962
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,000
a cool flashy looking ghost

4963
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:13,000
that has a

4964
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:15,000
that usually has like a one time

4965
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
like

4966
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
thing they can choose to die

4967
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:21,000
to accomplish if they feel like it

4968
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
but some of them

4969
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
making a cup hover

4970
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
um

4971
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:29,000
yeah and then they're just gonna

4972
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,000
that's the last thing they ever do

4973
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:33,000
yeah

4974
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:35,000
they're like a cool looking ghost

4975
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:37,000
you can see

4976
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:39,000
um next one

4977
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
do I have anything else to say about that

4978
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
um the book is

4979
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:45,000
the book is probably gonna be

4980
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
it's looking like the index is probably gonna be like

4981
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:49,000
50 to 60 pages

4982
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
so looking like the total page count is gonna be like

4983
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
260 pages

4984
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
that's pretty thick

4985
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
that's pretty good

4986
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
that's pretty girthy I would say

4987
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
about 60 of that

4988
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,000
so about a fifth of that will be

4989
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:05,000
which is fine

4990
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:07,000
you know whatever

4991
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
next one is

4992
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:11,000
he had to confirm

4993
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:13,000
3, 2, 1, go

4994
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:15,000
ah Ben's saying is just like

4995
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,000
Ben's just

4996
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:19,000
getting a voicemail of someone

4997
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:21,000
shitting their fucking bottles out on the toilet

4998
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,000
diarrhea farting into the toilet

4999
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:25,000
and he's just like

5000
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,000
oh no

5001
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:29,000
listen don't play it on the episode

5002
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:31,000
but I have to listen to

5003
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:33,000
the whole thing

5004
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,000
it was gross

5005
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:37,000
just a second more

5006
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,000
oh

5007
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:41,000
I have to confirm that it's just shitting

5008
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
it's like

5009
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,000
can you imagine if I could smell this

5010
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
too

5011
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:49,000
imagine if I put your hand

5012
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:51,000
into the bowl and scoop some of it out

5013
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:53,000
oh god that would be so fucking gross

5014
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:55,000
that would be so crazy

5015
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
unless

5016
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
look

5017
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:01,000
I was like already halfway through it

5018
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,000
so

5019
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,000
then you can sleeve halfway through it

5020
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
so I was like well I've listened to this much of it

5021
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:09,000
I might as well

5022
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
listen to the rest

5023
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
ah god

5024
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:15,000
you gotta learn to jump shit

5025
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
you gotta learn to run away

5026
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:19,000
you know

5027
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:21,000
just like with a slime and punishment book

5028
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000
at some point you gotta cut and run

5029
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:25,000
you gotta call it done

5030
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
I've heard enough of this shit

5031
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:29,000
literally literal

5032
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:31,000
and it's time to end it

5033
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:33,000
next one is called

5034
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:35,000
slime times weekend update

5035
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:37,000
number ten part one

5036
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:39,000
three two one go

5037
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:41,000
hello rowdies

5038
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:43,000
rowdettes killers

5039
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:45,000
and the rest give asked

5040
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,000
and here we are again

5041
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:49,000
there are no female killers

5042
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:51,000
killsers

5043
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:53,000
sorry

5044
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:55,000
the old head

5045
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:57,000
he promised to give it once 15 people

5046
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,000
had made art for him

5047
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:01,000
and the gangs took to ms paint

5048
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:03,000
beautiful art was made

5049
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
and the relic was finally awarded to a killer

5050
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:07,000
known as stin bug

5051
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,000
also endless war seems to have been getting

5052
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:11,000
a mighty migraine from all the new cops

5053
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
roaming around the streets

5054
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:15,000
because people have been encountering numerous

5055
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:17,000
anomalies upon dying

5056
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:19,000
from staying dead

5057
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000
in featureless voids

5058
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,000
to speak of

5059
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:25,000
and no data

5060
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,000
or your data being completely

5061
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:29,000
swiped from existence

5062
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,000
oh my satan the pain won't ever end

5063
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:33,000
tech developers are hard at work

5064
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:35,000
in endless wars bowels

5065
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:37,000
to see if they can fix things

5066
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:39,000
for interview they had this to say

5067
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:41,000

5068
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:43,000

5069
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:45,000

5071
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:49,000
onto the next part

5072
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:51,000
levy jevy was around that's crazy

5073
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,000
that guy is fucking

5074
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:55,000
that guy disappeared into the

5075
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:57,000
into the freaking deaths

5076
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
that's wild

5077
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:01,000
that's wild

5078
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:03,000
wow

5079
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,000
and yeah get up all in those bowels

5080
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:07,000
anyway next part is part two

5081
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:09,000
three two one go

5082
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:11,000
part two finally

5083
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:13,000
right after the graffiti contest was judged

5084
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,000
suddenly a fiddle by the name of

5085
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
morty came out in front of the crowd

5086
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,000
and assassinated the mayor

5087
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:21,000
bang execution style

5088
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,000
the mayoral role was all rabs

5089
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:25,000
and friends have already begun to backstab

5090
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
and slander each other over it

5091
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:29,000
there's no telling what will happen yet

5092
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,000
but if the last mayoral election

5093
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,000
was anything to go by

5094
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:35,000
we should expect nothing but good things

5095
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:39,000
I've heard it now under the authority that

5096
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:41,000
captain metalhead is running on

5097
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
the mayor lord of ghost

5098
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:45,000
to electric boogaloo

5099
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,000
I like the sign of that

5100
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,000
maybe the second time

5101
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
that's it for this one and remember

5102
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
the slime time is the best time

5103
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
oh yes

5104
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:57,000
and we at the redaction

5105
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:59,000
of the

5106
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,000
slime times weekend update

5107
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
we're very excited to hear about

5108
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,000
the new zine

5109
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:07,000
or karmic

5110
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:09,000
strip shonen jump

5111
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
eskstein coming out

5112
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
and the suggestion that perhaps

5113
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:15,000
there should be a slime time

5114
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:17,000
section mentioned

5115
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:19,000
we would be more than happy to contribute

5116
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:21,000
if that was ever wanted

5117
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:23,000
anyways

5118
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:25,000
goodbye excited for that

5119
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:27,000
either way

5120
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:29,000
yes

5121
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
if you provide the article I will definitely

5122
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:33,000
print it in the

5123
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:35,000
the issues when we start

5124
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,000
making them

5125
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:39,000
there used to be

5126
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:41,000
those guys used to make

5127
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:43,000
the actual slime times newspaper

5128
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:45,000
they used to make a digital

5129
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:47,000
publication

5130
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:49,000
I loved that

5131
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:51,000
we could

5132
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:53,000
bring that back a little bit

5133
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:55,000
this is going to be so cool

5134
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:57,000
because it's not just going to be like

5135
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:59,000
oh on the cover what do we put

5136
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:01,000
we put the comics that are in here

5137
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,000
so my character

5138
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:05,000
your character that's it

5139
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:07,000
no we can put a slime thing

5140
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:09,000
on there now if we have like an article

5141
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,000
we have a little thing like oh secret

5142
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:13,000
like news about this thing

5143
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:15,000
we could make

5144
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:17,000
the front cover really busy

5145
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:19,000
I love busy covers

5146
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:21,000
it would be

5147
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,000
that's fun

5148
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:25,000
I like the idea

5149
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:27,000
I like the idea of having

5150
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:29,000
a lot of people

5151
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:31,000
just kind of that have stuff to contribute

5152
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:33,000
but

5153
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:35,000
I mean I would want to be

5154
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:37,000
picky about it

5155
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:39,000
I mean the slime times weekend

5156
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:41,000
update is great so if they just

5157
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:43,000
turn that into text

5158
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:45,000
it's going to be fine

5159
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:47,000
it's going to be good

5160
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
I know we let you guys

5161
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:51,000
I know we let you guys get away

5162
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:53,000
with anything in these voicemails

5163
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:55,000
and we have no quality control

5164
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:57,000
that doesn't mean

5165
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:59,000
yeah

5166
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,000

03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:45,000
created for levy jevy's art

5189
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:47,000
giving extravaganza

5190
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:49,000
for which eventually

03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:51,000
to thin bug once again

5192
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:53,000
a relic was awarded

5193
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:55,000
even though prince valiantly

5194
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:57,000
did try to

5195
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:59,000
pry another relic off of his head

5196
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:01,000
did not work

5197
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:03,000

5204
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:17,000

03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:37,000
tell us is it a weapon

5215
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:39,000
a key

5216
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:41,000

5217
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:43,000
from his madness

5218
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:45,000

5219
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:47,000
flat cap

5220
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:49,000

5221
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:51,000

5222
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:53,000

03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:55,000

03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,000
a you got it bus kind of guy

5225
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:59,000
a bully demeanor towards his lessers

5226
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:01,000
who wouldn't bend my eye to pushing around

5227
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:03,000
juvies or unprepared opposing gangsters

5228
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:05,000
oh my god smear through something

5229
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:07,000

5230
03:24:07,000 --> 03:24:09,000
I'm scrolling

5231
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:13,000
endless war penis

5232
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:15,000

03:24:17,000 --> 03:24:19,000
there's a lot some of these I had seen

5235
03:24:19,000 --> 03:24:21,000
around

5236
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:23,000
this is shooting for

5237
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:25,000
oh there are quite a lot

5238
03:24:25,000 --> 03:24:27,000

okay well let's not

5240
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000
we can't dwell on them but

5241
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:35,000
these are

5242
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:37,000
marenpan

5243
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:39,000
marenpan one

5244
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:41,000
marenpan was one of the two winners

5245
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:43,000
of the graffiti contest

5246
03:24:43,000 --> 03:24:45,000
the other day to finally judge

5247
03:24:45,000 --> 03:24:47,000
after like three months which was interrupted

5248
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:49,000
by the assassination of the mayor

5249
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:51,000
and the announcement of the new contest

5250
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:53,000
which is the mayoral election contest

5251
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:55,000
the mayoral campaign contest

5252
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:57,000
mark two

5253
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:59,000

you know I don't know

5256
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:07,000
maybe that's true

5257
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:09,000
maybe not in endless war

5258
03:25:09,000 --> 03:25:11,000
I'm not sure

5259
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:13,000

because you said that

5279
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:53,000

5280
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:55,000

put a beat on that

5288
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:13,000

5289
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:15,000
nah there was a beat there

5290
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:17,000

5291
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:19,000
uh oh

5292
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:21,000

it's time to fucking smoke up

5294
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:25,000
and escape this world

5295
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:27,000
and taste this cycle of yearning

5296
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:29,000
and dissatisfaction

5297
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:31,000
we gotta escape the Dharma

5298
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:33,000
and achieve Nirvana

5299
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:35,000
it's time to free myself

5300
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,000

of that I guess

5330
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:41,000
nah they're making a video game

5331
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:43,000
with quite impressive animated cut scenes

5332
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:45,000
it looks like

5333
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:47,000
hmm um

5334
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:49,000

5336
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:53,000
um

5337
03:27:57,000 --> 03:27:59,000

wow

5346
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:27,000
um

5347
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:29,000
I mean

5348
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:33,000
what is

5349
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:35,000

03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:37,000
well ena is in it

5351
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:39,000

5353
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:43,000
hmm

5354
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:47,000
or I guess she's that girl

5355
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:49,000
she's that girl

5356
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:51,000
something about her ends up

5357
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:53,000
making her into a double faced thing

5358
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:55,000
right

5359
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:57,000
I mean I

5360
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:59,000
I don't really understand what ena is

5361
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:01,000
but I don't really think you're supposed to

5362
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:03,000
yeah it's just sort of

5363
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:05,000
the videos always had

5364
03:29:05,000 --> 03:29:07,000
like a dream like quality

5365
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:09,000
of them you know not really supposed to

5366
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:11,000
understand what's happening it's just sort of like whoa

5367
03:29:11,000 --> 03:29:13,000
nice

5368
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:15,000
planned release date 2023

5369
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:17,000
hmm

5370
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:19,000
I'll play it

5371
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:21,000
um

5372
03:29:25,000 --> 03:29:27,000
like looks like a little you know walk around

5373
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:29,000
uh pick up

5374
03:29:29,000 --> 03:29:31,000
things maybe there's puzzles

5375
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:33,000
the

5376
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:35,000
I mean my my initial

5377
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:37,000
impression

5378
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:39,000
the cutscenes

5379
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:41,000
seem very different

5380
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,000
from the very small

5381
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:45,000
moments of gameplay

5382
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,000
shown there but

5383
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:49,000
I don't know might

5384
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:51,000
work might be I liked

5385
03:29:51,000 --> 03:29:53,000
I liked the way I mean the the 3d looks

5386
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:55,000
pretty low poly and low res

5387
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:57,000
but I did like

5388
03:29:57,000 --> 03:29:59,000
it being

5389
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:01,000
paired with like the quite

5390
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:03,000
high quality 2d animation

5391
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:05,000
characters in the world the animation

5392
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:07,000
stands out to me a lot more

5393
03:30:07,000 --> 03:30:09,000
than the game

5394
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:11,000
which is okay

5395
03:30:11,000 --> 03:30:13,000
that's like how the videos are as well

5396
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:15,000
they're like in a weird like windows

5397
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:17,000
98 95

5398
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:19,000
like they something or other

5399
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:21,000
world kind of look like

5400
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:23,000
yeah they're like in like a low

5401
03:30:23,000 --> 03:30:25,000
poly sort of 3d

5402
03:30:25,000 --> 03:30:27,000
and they sort of like a like visual

5403
03:30:27,000 --> 03:30:29,000
novel like the character is kind of

5404
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:31,000
facing you and like talking

5405
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:33,000
at you

5406
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:35,000
yeah yeah

5407
03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:37,000
philip cdi as well

5408
03:30:37,000 --> 03:30:39,000
the the

5409
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:41,000
fucking hotel mario

5410
03:30:41,000 --> 03:30:43,000
the 2d animation is so

5411
03:30:43,000 --> 03:30:45,000
good looking

5412
03:30:45,000 --> 03:30:47,000
it almost looks like a completely different

5413
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:49,000
thing

5414
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:51,000
but

5415
03:30:51,000 --> 03:30:53,000
I'll watch it I'll keep I'll keep an eye on

5416
03:30:53,000 --> 03:30:55,000
it

5417
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:57,000

this girl

5420
03:31:01,000 --> 03:31:03,000
I think she's on tiktok

5421
03:31:03,000 --> 03:31:05,000
but she's also on twitter

5422
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:07,000
you know what I'm talking about

5423
03:31:07,000 --> 03:31:09,000
stop motion

5424
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:11,000
really weird warped like

5425
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:13,000

creepy

5427
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:17,000
staring sort of thing

5428
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:19,000
yes but the one that's like

5429
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:21,000
clicking on stuff like an adventure game

5430
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:23,000
yeah an adventure game

5431
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:25,000
and then she usually kills you

5432
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:27,000
she usually kills you or

5433
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:29,000

5444
03:31:49,000 --> 03:31:51,000
I think she mostly

5445
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:53,000
does like only fans

5446
03:31:53,000 --> 03:31:55,000
she's like an only fans girl and her only fans

5447
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:57,000
she's really unironic like it has nothing to do

5448
03:31:57,000 --> 03:31:59,000
with any of that stuff

5449
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:01,000
it's just yeah

5450
03:32:01,000 --> 03:32:03,000
but like

5451
03:32:03,000 --> 03:32:05,000
that like horror

5452
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:07,000
glitchy like game aesthetic stuff was like

5453
03:32:07,000 --> 03:32:09,000
I think it was really making the rounds on social media

5454
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:11,000
like a couple weeks ago

5455
03:32:11,000 --> 03:32:13,000
I saw it and I looked into it and I was like

5456
03:32:13,000 --> 03:32:15,000
huh this stuff is neat

5457
03:32:15,000 --> 03:32:17,000
this stuff is like

5458
03:32:17,000 --> 03:32:19,000
I don't know some people call it horror

5459
03:32:19,000 --> 03:32:21,000
I didn't call it horror

5460
03:32:21,000 --> 03:32:23,000
it's sort of it has a creepy vibe

5461
03:32:23,000 --> 03:32:25,000
it's

5462
03:32:25,000 --> 03:32:27,000
it evokes a lot of

5463
03:32:27,000 --> 03:32:29,000
horror themed

5464
03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:31,000
things

5465
03:32:31,000 --> 03:32:33,000
it wasn't scary but it was like

5466
03:32:33,000 --> 03:32:35,000
this is really creative

5467
03:32:35,000 --> 03:32:37,000
I like that it was on tiktok

5468
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:39,000
it was a bit creepy

5469
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:41,000
it was kind of funny like the one where you're the baby sitter and your baby sitting

5470
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:43,000
the fly baby

5471
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:45,000
and then it ends with like

5472
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:47,000
daddy's going to be mad

5473
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:49,000
and she opens the door and like the giant

5474
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:51,000
fly is outside like that made me laugh

5475
03:32:51,000 --> 03:32:53,000
like that's just

5476
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:55,000
I'm not sure if it was going for comedy

5477
03:32:55,000 --> 03:32:57,000
but it was funny

5478
03:32:59,000 --> 03:33:01,000
to me

5479
03:33:01,000 --> 03:33:03,000
that stuff I don't know

5480
03:33:03,000 --> 03:33:05,000
that's what Ena

5481
03:33:05,000 --> 03:33:07,000
made me think of

5482
03:33:07,000 --> 03:33:09,000
I don't even remember that girl's name

5483
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:11,000
but

5484
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:13,000

games ever made

I've never heard of dark and darker

5557
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:43,000
I am just expressing

5558
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:45,000
my honest appreciation

5559
03:35:45,000 --> 03:35:47,000

5561
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:51,000

03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:53,000

03:36:11,000 --> 03:36:13,000
I wouldn't want you to

5573
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:15,000
miss out on this amazing

5574
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:17,000
game the play test

5575
03:36:17,000 --> 03:36:19,000
is only going to last for like 10 days

5576
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:21,000
and you don't have to pay for it

5577
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:23,000
it's free and it's on steam

5578
03:36:23,000 --> 03:36:25,000
it's called dark and darker and it's like

5579
03:36:25,000 --> 03:36:27,000
is this a joke I don't get it it's kind of like a roguelike

5580
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:29,000
but

5581
03:36:29,000 --> 03:36:31,000
it's multiplayer battle royale roguelike

5582
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:33,000
and it has pve

5583
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:35,000
and it has pvp

5584
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:37,000
it's the worst thing ever

5585
03:36:37,000 --> 03:36:39,000
you've got abilities

5586
03:36:39,000 --> 03:36:41,000
like two of them

5587
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:43,000
there's not that many abilities it's not like league of legend

5588
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:45,000
and

5589
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:47,000
you get your sword

5590
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:49,000
and you whack skeletons

5591
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:51,000
and the games are

5592
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:53,000
like 10 minutes long each

5593
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:55,000
and I'm just so addicted to it

5594
03:36:55,000 --> 03:36:57,000
best game ever

5595
03:36:57,000 --> 03:36:59,000
I can't tell if that was

5596
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:01,000
sincere does he actually like this game

5597
03:37:01,000 --> 03:37:03,000
I'm looking at the steam page and it looks

5598
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:05,000
it looks like it could be good

5599
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:07,000
but I hate

5600
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:09,000
not roguelikes I hate

5601
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:11,000
battle royales so I don't

5602
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:13,000
I don't think I'll play that but yeah it's a fantasy

5603
03:37:13,000 --> 03:37:15,000
first person

5604
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:17,000
something or other do you fight the other players

5605
03:37:17,000 --> 03:37:19,000
is that how it's a battle royale

5606
03:37:19,000 --> 03:37:21,000
and I'm forgiving hardcore fantasy

5607
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:23,000
FPS dungeon p player versus

5608
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:25,000
player versus environment adventure

5609
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:27,000
band together with your friends and use your courage wits

5610
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:29,000
and cunning to uncover mythical treasures

5611
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:31,000
okay so it's sort of like

5612
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:33,000
it sounds like it's like a

5613
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:35,000
diablo thing almost

5614
03:37:35,000 --> 03:37:37,000
you're with your buddies in a dungeon

5615
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:39,000
you're killing stuff

5616
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:41,000
I think it sounds

5617
03:37:41,000 --> 03:37:43,000
potentially pretty fun

5618
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:47,000
I don't know where the battle royale comes from

5619
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:49,000
well I see people

5620
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:51,000
like fighting each other in like a big group

5621
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:53,000
in like the trailer

5622
03:37:53,000 --> 03:37:55,000
video

5623
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:57,000
so it seems like

5624
03:37:57,000 --> 03:37:59,000
they're supposed to kill

5625
03:37:59,000 --> 03:38:01,000
maybe you're in a little party and you got to fight against other parties

5626
03:38:01,000 --> 03:38:03,000
oh no I see

5627
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:05,000
I see a fortnite like death cloud

5628
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:07,000
so they've got to get to the middle of the dungeon

5629
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:09,000
get the loot

5630
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:11,000
and then get out

5631
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:13,000
I don't

5632
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:15,000
know about the fortnite death cloud

5633
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:17,000
the fortnite death cloud the idea

5634
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:19,000
is that at the beginning of the map

5635
03:38:19,000 --> 03:38:21,000
everywhere is available

5636
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:23,000
but slowly the death cloud a big circle

5637
03:38:23,000 --> 03:38:25,000
around the map will get smaller

5638
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:27,000
forcing the players to interact

5639
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:29,000
to get closer to the middle

5640
03:38:29,000 --> 03:38:31,000
so that like

5641
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:33,000
if the players can't kill each other

5642
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:35,000
the circle will kill everyone

5643
03:38:37,000 --> 03:38:39,000
okay

5644
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:41,000
gotcha

5645
03:38:41,000 --> 03:38:43,000
okay I mean

5646
03:38:43,000 --> 03:38:45,000
looks kind of fun

5647
03:38:45,000 --> 03:38:47,000
I don't know if I'll actually play it

5648
03:38:47,000 --> 03:38:49,000
but

5649
03:38:49,000 --> 03:38:51,000
could be fun

5650
03:38:51,000 --> 03:38:53,000
wait

5651
03:38:53,000 --> 03:38:55,000
so this alpha playtest has ended

5652
03:38:57,000 --> 03:38:59,000
this guy was too late

5653
03:38:59,000 --> 03:39:01,000
we read this thing

5654
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:03,000
oh was it

5655
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:05,000
well it might have become

5656
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:07,000
will this

5657
03:39:07,000 --> 03:39:09,000
stream next

5658
03:39:09,000 --> 03:39:11,000
he left this only 20 hours ago

5659
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:13,000
I think he said that like another one

5660
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:15,000
another test might be coming up

5661
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:17,000
oh no yeah that's right

5662
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:19,000
February 6th to 13th

5663
03:39:21,000 --> 03:39:23,000
so I guess come back then

5664
03:39:25,000 --> 03:39:27,000
could be fun

5665
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:29,000
next one

5666
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:31,000
is called a Gibbs weekly reminder

5667
03:39:31,000 --> 03:39:33,000
to reach the big twist in inscription

5668
03:39:33,000 --> 03:39:35,000
no

5669
03:39:35,000 --> 03:39:37,000
I'm playing

5670
03:39:37,000 --> 03:39:39,000
I'm playing Disco Elysium

5671
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:41,000
and I didn't even get any weekly reminders this week

5672
03:39:41,000 --> 03:39:43,000
dab

5673
03:39:43,000 --> 03:39:45,000
dab

5674
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:47,000
that means you've forgotten all about the dots

5675
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:49,000
around chapter 2

5676
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:51,000
what even is that nobody knows

5677
03:39:51,000 --> 03:39:53,000
it's so like it's funny

5678
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:55,000
because like

5679
03:39:55,000 --> 03:39:57,000
I only just realized a few days ago

5680
03:39:57,000 --> 03:39:59,000
that this means that you have no idea

5681
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:01,000
who Spampton is

5682
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:03,000
you haven't seen Spampton

5683
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:05,000
I am aware of him but I don't really

5684
03:40:07,000 --> 03:40:09,000
I don't know him

5685
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:11,000
there was so much

5686
03:40:11,000 --> 03:40:13,000
like hype around

5687
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:15,000
all of the stuff in the second chapter

5688
03:40:15,000 --> 03:40:17,000
so much content made

5689
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:19,000
and it's like wow

5690
03:40:19,000 --> 03:40:21,000
you don't even know that

5691
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:23,000
you know Jevil

5692
03:40:23,000 --> 03:40:25,000
I mean I don't know Jevil because I never fought Jevil

5693
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:27,000
oh

5694
03:40:27,000 --> 03:40:29,000
so I don't even know that

5695
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:31,000
look at this Delta Rune noob over here

5696
03:40:33,000 --> 03:40:35,000
that's a me

5697
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:39,000
you played long enough to see sands and that was it

5698
03:40:41,000 --> 03:40:43,000
you know what

5699
03:40:43,000 --> 03:40:45,000
maybe I like being a Delta Rune noob

5700
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:47,000
maybe I'm going to internalize it

5701
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:49,000
and make it a part of my personality going forward

5702
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:51,000
maybe I'll be that guy who doesn't know

5703
03:40:51,000 --> 03:40:53,000
about Delta Rune

5704
03:40:53,000 --> 03:40:55,000
maybe that's my character from now on

5705
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:57,000
oh no

5706
03:40:57,000 --> 03:40:59,000
terrible

5707
03:40:59,000 --> 03:41:01,000
oh yeah

5708
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:03,000
you're gonna like it

5709
03:41:03,000 --> 03:41:05,000
well that's the last voice

5710
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:07,000
that's the last voice now

5711
03:41:07,000 --> 03:41:09,000
alright

5712
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:11,000
thank you everybody for listening

5713
03:41:11,000 --> 03:41:13,000
to the show

5714
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:15,000
come back to

5715
03:41:15,000 --> 03:41:17,000
if you didn't see the stream last time

5716
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:19,000
we're going to do more of those

5717
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:21,000
become a patron if you want

5718
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:23,000
a million

5719
03:41:23,000 --> 03:41:25,000
oh yeah we're going to stream more

5720
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:27,000
maybe not this week

5721
03:41:27,000 --> 03:41:29,000
probably

5722
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:31,000
maybe next week

5723
03:41:31,000 --> 03:41:33,000
okay yeah I think every other week is like

5724
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:35,000
pretty fair

5725
03:41:35,000 --> 03:41:37,000
become a patron if you want

5726
03:41:37,000 --> 03:41:39,000
like

5727
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:41,000
50 or so bonus episodes

5728
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:43,000
behind the scenes commentary

5729
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:45,000
things like that

5730
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:47,000
also

5731
03:41:47,000 --> 03:41:49,000
to be included on the thank you page of the

5732
03:41:49,000 --> 03:41:51,000
upcoming perfect comic party

5733
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:53,000
digitally distributed

5734
03:41:55,000 --> 03:41:57,000
anthology

5735
03:41:57,000 --> 03:41:59,000
um

5736
03:41:59,000 --> 03:42:01,000
yeah

5737
03:42:01,000 --> 03:42:03,000
yeah and

5738
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:05,000
I guess we just call it a party because it's a

5739
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:07,000
perfect comic party

5740
03:42:07,000 --> 03:42:09,000
we can't just call it a party

5741
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:11,000
it doesn't explain what it is

5742
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:13,000
next week's party

5743
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:15,000
next week's party

5744
03:42:15,000 --> 03:42:17,000
I mean sure if we

5745
03:42:17,000 --> 03:42:19,000
if you could say oh it's weekly jump

5746
03:42:19,000 --> 03:42:21,000
people will say oh it's the weekly party

5747
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:23,000
it's the weekly comic party

5748
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:25,000
and we should have

5749
03:42:25,000 --> 03:42:27,000
an in group

5750
03:42:27,000 --> 03:42:29,000
of regular viewers and we should

5751
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:31,000
refer to them as like

5752
03:42:31,000 --> 03:42:33,000
we should come up with a nickname for them

5753
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:35,000
to increase their parasocial engagement with us

5754
03:42:35,000 --> 03:42:37,000
we should start every

5755
03:42:37,000 --> 03:42:39,000
day partygoers

5756
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:41,000
welcome to the perfect comic party

5757
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:43,000
and hey what about this what if we had

5758
03:42:43,000 --> 03:42:45,000
what if we had food at the party

5759
03:42:45,000 --> 03:42:47,000
and we themed

5760
03:42:47,000 --> 03:42:49,000
and we themed the party the podcast

5761
03:42:49,000 --> 03:42:51,000
around that so what if we called

5762
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:53,000
it like the pizza party podcast

5763
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:55,000
what if we did it what if we just

5764
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:57,000
did that

5765
03:42:57,000 --> 03:42:59,000
I guess what would happen

5766
03:42:59,000 --> 03:43:01,000
what would happen

5767
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:03,000
what was the pizza party podcast

5768
03:43:03,000 --> 03:43:05,000
disbanded dissolved

5769
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:07,000
what happened to it

5770
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:09,000
it is not dissolved it was

5771
03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:11,000
basically

5772
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:13,000
co-opted by dafpina

5773
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:15,000
and the

5774
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:17,000
previous hosts

5775
03:43:17,000 --> 03:43:19,000
dafpina moved in

5776
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:21,000
and basically took over co-hosting

5777
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:23,000
with rebel taxi and they

5778
03:43:23,000 --> 03:43:25,000
kicked the old co-hosts out

5779
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:27,000
that seems to be what happened

5780
03:43:27,000 --> 03:43:29,000
okay so it's just different

5781
03:43:29,000 --> 03:43:31,000
so we can't steal a name

5782
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:33,000
not that we could if they had stopped

5783
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:35,000
we can we can

5784
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:39,000
we can?

5785
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:41,000
what are they gonna do

5786
03:43:41,000 --> 03:43:43,000
stop us

5787
03:43:43,000 --> 03:43:45,000
I think they're gonna send their millions of

5788
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:47,000
pizza eaters

5789
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:49,000
that's called free

5790
03:43:49,000 --> 03:43:51,000
that's called free engagement

5791
03:43:51,000 --> 03:43:53,000
they're gonna send their pizza eaters

5792
03:43:53,000 --> 03:43:55,000
over to us but we're gonna have

5793
03:43:55,000 --> 03:43:57,000
our monks

5794
03:43:57,000 --> 03:43:59,000
it'll be pizza eaters

5795
03:43:59,000 --> 03:44:01,000
versus party people

5796
03:44:01,000 --> 03:44:03,000
and we're gonna have our preachers

5797
03:44:03,000 --> 03:44:05,000
who are gonna tell a good word of the pizza party podcast

5798
03:44:05,000 --> 03:44:07,000
and they're gonna be converted

5799
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:09,000
turned into loyal subscribers

5800
03:44:09,000 --> 03:44:11,000
pizza panners

5801
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:13,000
versus party people

5802
03:44:13,000 --> 03:44:15,000
party people

5803
03:44:15,000 --> 03:44:17,000
and whoever loses we win

5804
03:44:21,000 --> 03:44:23,000
I think

5805
03:44:23,000 --> 03:44:25,000
I think that's the strategy going forward

5806
03:44:25,000 --> 03:44:27,000
I think the strategy for engagement is just

5807
03:44:27,000 --> 03:44:29,000
violate the copyright

5808
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:31,000
of everyone and anyone

5809
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:33,000
of people with bigger audiences than us

5810
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:35,000
and then they'll get mad

5811
03:44:35,000 --> 03:44:37,000
and then they'll talk about how mad they are at us

5812
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:39,000
and then their fans will come and listen to our show

5813
03:44:39,000 --> 03:44:41,000
then they'll become instant fans

5814
03:44:41,000 --> 03:44:43,000
I'm

5815
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:45,000
I think maybe I'm gonna start

5816
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:47,000
going by Daft Pina from now on

5817
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:49,000
I think maybe that's my new name

5818

5835
03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:29,000
we're gonna reinvent the PCP

5836
03:45:29,000 --> 03:45:31,000
at the end of every episode now

5837
03:45:31,000 --> 03:45:33,000
yeah

5838
03:45:33,000 --> 03:45:35,000
what

5839
03:45:35,000 --> 03:45:37,000
it's called iterating

5840
03:45:37,000 --> 03:45:39,000
you gotta fail faster

5841
03:45:39,000 --> 03:45:41,000
you gotta learn to fail faster

5842
03:45:41,000 --> 03:45:43,000
we're gonna try something new every week

5843
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:45,000
every week it's gonna fail and we're gonna learn a lesson

5844
03:45:45,000 --> 03:45:47,000
and it's gonna make us strong

5845
03:45:47,000 --> 03:45:49,000
we're gonna learn a lesson about friendship

5846
03:45:49,000 --> 03:45:51,000
we'll write a little letter it's to Celestia about it

5847
03:45:51,000 --> 03:45:53,000
every week

5848
03:45:53,000 --> 03:45:55,000
the podcast opens with a new bit

5849
03:45:55,000 --> 03:45:57,000
wherein we write like dear princess Celestia

5850
03:45:57,000 --> 03:45:59,000
here's why today's exercise

5851
03:45:59,000 --> 03:46:01,000
in rebranding the PCP has failed

5852
03:46:01,000 --> 03:46:03,000
and what I learned from the experience

5853
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:05,000
and how I'll do better going forward

5854
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:09,000
and that's okay you know what

5855
03:46:09,000 --> 03:46:11,000
we'll change like next week to the my little

5856
03:46:11,000 --> 03:46:13,000
podcast

5857
03:46:15,000 --> 03:46:17,000
then we'll be the

5858
03:46:17,000 --> 03:46:19,000
talking pirates

5859
03:46:19,000 --> 03:46:21,000
talking pirates after that

5860
03:46:23,000 --> 03:46:25,000
my little podcast funding is mandatory

5861
03:46:27,000 --> 03:46:29,000
after that we'll be

5862
03:46:29,000 --> 03:46:31,000

5863
03:46:31,000 --> 03:46:33,000

and then the Ralph Rattort

5865
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:39,000
and then we'll be the Ralph Rattort that's right

5866
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:41,000
which keep getting lower and lower

5867
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:43,000
yeah yeah we can find worse and worse

5868
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:45,000
podcasts to become

5869
03:46:45,000 --> 03:46:47,000
alright I think this is a

5870
03:46:47,000 --> 03:46:49,000
I think this is an actionable business model

5871
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:51,000
great good

5872
03:46:51,000 --> 03:46:53,000

5879
03:47:05,000 --> 03:47:07,000
I don't want it to take a long time

5880
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:09,000
to make the first thing but it will require me

5881
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:11,000
to work hard this coming week

5882
03:47:11,000 --> 03:47:13,000

5883
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:15,000

03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:17,000
I'll have to get back into

5885
03:47:17,000 --> 03:47:19,000
Biscuits page I'll have to remember

5886
03:47:19,000 --> 03:47:21,000
what the heck was even going on

5887
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:23,000
when I left Biscuits page

5888
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:25,000
