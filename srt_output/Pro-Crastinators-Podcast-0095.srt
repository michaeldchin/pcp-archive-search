Last month's episode was Gamergate vs. the 2016 presidential election.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Donald and Hillary, the original Goku and Vegeta will unite when the world needs them most.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It is the Gurren Lagann to the elections Kill La Kill.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All of these fucking psychopathic, Ben-Saintian, blue-pilled motherfuckers.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A depression quest. The greatest indie game in ever made.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Jeb was a fantastic character. I want his narrative to keep going.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
God-tier Dorito, Dustin, Crustin, red-pilled motherfuckers who said,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No, not our video games.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't give a fuck about Gamergate, but Donald Trump, he's my dad.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You don't know shit until you hear about my boy, Ted Cruz.

13

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators podcast.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's me, your host, and your boy, Ben-Saint here.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I'm here with Munchywares Tiny Hats.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey everyone, welcome to my Photoshop tutorial.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to be teaching you how to make a gradient transparent.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's start with the break-up of the Ottoman Empire.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's going to be a really easy Photoshop tutorial.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have to explain the entire history of the Middle East first, though.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What the fuck, and we're here with Tom Oliver.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm here talking about the topic.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I also, I had Zabram earlier, so I'm going to be silly today.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's do it.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Whoa, and there's also the best guy ever.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I did the mash.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I did the race war mash.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What? What is going on?

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What were you doing earlier, and why didn't you invite me?

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And in a rare twist of fate, we've got Lethal Aurora Mage.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Can this mean that I'm not on the podcast die already?

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You have to fix it. You're the master of your own main destiny.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was on the podcast like a month ago for the whole month.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mage, you're the only female member of the PCP,

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
which means you have to be here five times as often to count for anything.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I haven't seen you been Lethal once.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're a representative for your entire gender.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's all writing on you.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
My gender is purple. Excuse you.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're the only purple gender on the podcast.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The PCP is the most gender-realist podcast on the net,

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and we need the other side to be there as a strawman

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that we can defeat week after week after week.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I personally find this very vivid aquamarine.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's true. That's true.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ben, why don't you tell us what the fuck we're doing, you baby boy?

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We're talking about monsters,

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
which we thoroughly, thoroughly covered,

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and pretty much said all there is to say about on the drawcast,

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the ultimate PCP content.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They say a picture's worth a thousand words,

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
but if all those words are fucking bullshit,

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
you've got to come in with some real words that are targeted.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All we have to do is increase the number of word count in this episode

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
by number of pictures produced in that podcast,

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
multiplied by a thousand.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We just have to talk more than that,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
which I think is an easily attainable goal.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
One of these Superfans, Denix Jack,

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
count the number of words that are in this podcast

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and tell us if we meet it.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What happened was me, Ben, and Major were all squibbling

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
in our scribed in, in the inner walls of Jericho,

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and the villain thief, Nate, was peering over the palace walls,

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
trying to learn our trade secrets,

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and so he banished forever from the garden of even

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
that is the PCP drawcast.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Like Adam before, cast Wrout into your drawcast.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He has to reverse this podcast, this drawcast topic,

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
so he can get his grubby fucking hands on it.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's what's happened here today.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
There was just too much, too much delicious, rich content

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
within the subject of monsters to just be left there

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
in the festering dirty floor of the drawcast.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There's never enough monsters if you ask me, so I'm here.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't know, I don't even think monsters are real guys.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ben, I don't know what a monster is.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I've never had that explained to me before.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Can I, can I cut in here for a moment?

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I would like to describe to everyone what exactly

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
a monster is that we're talking about.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, so here we go.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Urban Dictionary, our old buddy, tells us

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
that a monster is nuclear horse piss

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
sold as a disgusting energy drink.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh shit!

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What a monster is, yep.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's see what else we got here.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Describing anything that is large,

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
these are all part of one definition apparently.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The creature that lives in your closet and under your bed,

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
okay, and then one last one,

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
a sadistic pedophile who molests and rapes children he abducts.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Whoa, I didn't know Nick was a monster.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
None of these descriptions describe monsters

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that we're talking about.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Monsters are scary, mostly fuzzy things that go brar

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and I go, ah!

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I know about monsters.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I imagine monsters are like creatures that don't exist.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Monsters are like big men with rubber on their face.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
All I know about monsters is that they're incorporated

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and they're great people.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Monsters are usually fuzzy fucking government fat cats

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
who just want to subjugate the weak.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Alright, listen to this one more definition of monster.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This one is like the third most popular.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's what you become when you break up with a girl.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What the hell is this?

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Man, listen to this quote.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Man, we need to talk.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Woman, you're a monster.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Dude, that's some real shit, man.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's fantastic.

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Monsters are fake things that scare me.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Much like all fake things.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As I exist only and completely within the realm of reality.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Whenever I'm confronted with things that are not in fact real,

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I can't contain my emotions

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and all my anger and sadness flows out of my body

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
when I'm confronted with a fictional being.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Alright, let's go around real quick

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and everybody talk about either your favorite

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
or a favorite monster of yours.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The Slender Man is a monster who has tentacles

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and he's really tall and he is a black suit.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Dude.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And all the fucking other ones,

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
okay, Marble Hornets is the best fucking creepy ARG on the planet.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And all the bullshit, like Tribe 12 and fucking Everyman Hybrid,

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
all that shit is horrible.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I tried watching Everyman Hybrid and it fucking sucked shit.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It made no sense.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was purposely just trying to be like a weird meta.

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It was fucking like the reluctant YouTuber,

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
but if it was a Slender Man ARG,

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
that's what Everyman Hybrid is.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Marble Hornets was OG shit.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Marble Hornets is fucking,

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
what does Alicorn Twilight Princess Sparkle mean to you?

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's what fucking Marble Hornets is.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's the real shit.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I love Marble Hornets.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Slender Man, he's not even called Slender Man that way.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's called the operator.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can operate your sickness if you look at him.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The screen shakes.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I have operate your sickness whenever I get on the PCP

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
because the PCP is just too powerful

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and it reminds me too much of Slender Man.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Slender Man used to be my waifu before it was cool.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Really? Is that true?

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Has anyone else seen Everyman Hybrid and Marble Hornets?

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because I actually have.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I have seen Marble Hornets.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No, I've never seen them been.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, I mean, besides you.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
See, I saw them thinking that probably nobody else

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
on this podcast would have ever seen them.

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I saw Marble Hornets.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Guys, guys, guys.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I knew about Slender Man before it became popular.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It was just around the time, just before it became mainstream.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I was fucking post about it on Reddit.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So I can upvote you then, god damn it.

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I was fucking Marble Hornets before it was even done.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I was Marble Hornets before they even found out

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that Tim was the mascot.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm fucking day one.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm fucking day fucking one.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Pulls off mask.

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
My face is revealed to be a hornet made of marble.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's me.

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I did it.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Am I the joke, guys?

178
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's good, right?

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You would like Marble Hornets.

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You would like it.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Because there's a bunch of fucking...

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm googling it right now.

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm looking at the weird spooky shit here.

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There's a bunch of shit.

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, I think someone beats a woman in it one time.

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, hell yeah.

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Me?

188
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I watched the video.

189
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's me.

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
How many episodes are there out there right now?

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Marble Hornets just recording me.

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's like 107 or something, I think.

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, okay.

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's me in my daily life.

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's just what it is.

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I caught up with Marble Hornets in one night.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Like procrastinating, going to sleep for like my first day of sixth grade.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, this is a show.

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Is this like a TV show?

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, it's a YouTube show.

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's like a webtoon.

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh, okay.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's like a YouTube series kind of semi-found footage photo documentary.

205
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Exactly.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Trying to document this weird thing that happens.

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's an energy.

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's recorded in a way that looks realistic, but it's totally bullshit.

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay.

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How old is this thing?

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's very old.

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's a fictional story.

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not like it's trying to trick you.

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's like it's a Blair Witch project.

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, yeah.

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's a YouTube video series.

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You know, that's the weird thing.

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I feel like a lot of people, okay.

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I mean, first of all, you've got like those girls who like literally tried to sacrifice

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
their friend in the woods to Slenderman, who is a literal made-up fake internet.

221
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Who is me?

222
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Who is me?

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Which was Munchy.

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Munchy was the girl being sacrificed and the people doing the sacrifice.

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And Slenderman.

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You know, it was a big thing.

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And Slenderman.

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He's basically the Trinity.

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He's the father, son, and the Holy Ghost.

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Sacrificing himself to himself to appease his own wrath upon the people he created.

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's who Munchy is.

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay.

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is cool.

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, what I was going to say is like, people really seem to like get whipped up into a storm

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and like take this shit seriously.

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it's weird to me.

237
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's weird to me that people are so...

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I mean, it's the...

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What's the opposite of skeptical?

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You know, like believers or something or have so much credulous.

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I guess that...

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, I think that's right.

243
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
People like look for things to believe in like this.

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I've never understood that.

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I guess because it's fun.

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I guess because it's just fun.

247
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Eggs.

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You know?

249
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What other reason do you need?

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know.

252
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Like, is it fun to sacrifice your friend in the woods to Slenderman?

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, because Slenderman like you then.

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I know.

255
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
People like spooky stories.

256
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Dude.

257
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh.

258
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Isn't that a fascinating thing though?

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why do people like being scared?

260
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You know, I also don't quite get it.

261
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm not as into it as I feel like a lot of people are.

262
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
As I said in the Ghost episode, ghosts aren't real, but they should be.

263
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Right.

264
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I love ghosts.

265
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And if I pray every night at some day they'll magically become real and I'll be able to

266
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
see a ghost with my own eyes.

267
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Just like in season three of Korra where all the airbenders just literally became real

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
again.

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It was awesome.

270
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So good.

271
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What a great development.

272
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I love Korra.

273
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Me too, dude.

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's some fucking...

275
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Korra!

276
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I just want to put it out there.

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Korra is my favorite monster.

278
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She is the most evil being who ever existed.

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
She makes the world a worse place with her mere presence.

280
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The monsters don't always have to be evil to go.

281
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

282
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But Korra is.

283
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Korra is undeniably evil.

284
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah.

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm just making a statement.

286
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah.

287
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's true.

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And you were saying this on the draw cast too.

289
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're a staunch defender of monster rights.

290
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

291
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah.

292
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

293
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay.

294
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We must defend a monster free speech.

295
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's important.

296
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
People like monsters because they put you closer to death and what do we all want but

297
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
death?

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We all seek oblivion.

299
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Blindly.

300
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Now I'm speaking my language.

301
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And I quickly just mentioned a dream I had before this podcast.

302
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It has a monster in it.

303
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And I just wanted to...

304
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Sure.

305
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay.

306
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So quickly I'll try.

307
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay.

308
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So the dream.

309
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Man-made island and on the island is just nothing but this big building and I live there

310
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and there's a mansion and other people and slowly one by one people are getting murdered

311
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,400
in very horrible ways.

312
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,080
You just see the bodies laying on the floor and just blood everywhere and they kept getting

313
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,080
dragged away and like me and the manager trying to figure out what's happening.

314
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,120
And then like I finally found out that like there's this monster here like and it's trying

315
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
to kill us.

316
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,960
And I was one of the few people left alive and the only reason I was left alive because

317
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,440
I kind of like casually flirted with the monster.

318
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,440
The monster just noked away.

319
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,800
I guess he didn't like me.

320
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm sad.

321
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,440
But I like the monster a lot.

322
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
He was really cool.

323
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,680
He had like this skull face thing but not like a human skull.

324
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,440
It was like a like a deer skull or something.

325
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,040
And like these huge claws that he would rip people up and stuff and he was just he looked

326
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
really cool.

327
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,200
Your description sounds like that anime.

328
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,920
You know that one it's like it's called like a necromancer bought me or something.

329
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,480
It's like about a literal slave was bought by like this necromancer with a big skull.

330
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
I forget.

331
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
I have not seen that anime.

332
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
You know what I'm talking about.

333
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Okay.

334
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Well whatever.

335
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,400
I think I've heard of something like I heard yeah Twitter talking about something Stockholm

336
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:05,720
syndrome yada yada but no I haven't seen that anime I should look into that.

337
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,120
Maybe it's a sign.

338
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,920
I did a nightmare as well last night where I was on my computer and some invisible force

339
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,520
some some invisible insidious force moved my hand for me and made me type into my my

340
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,880
Google search bar laying with a bunch of pop up ads and you know I try to download various

341

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,960

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,680
Kickstarter still happening everybody please give to the fucking Radcon three Kickstarter

353
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,320
we need that money so I forget we can dress up as monsters in real life I if we're close

354
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,080
enough to woods I'll pretend to be the Jersey Devil on film that's a promise that's gonna

355
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,000
be a yeah go ahead back to slender man Ben what what did you think of every man hybrid

356
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,360
compared to marble hornets I didn't watch that much every man hybrid because it wasn't

357
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,960
that good yeah it's so it was it was fucking it was horrible like like a meta bullshit it

358
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,440
was it was fucking like dude home suck is so meta I love accents that's that's that's

359
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,240
a horrible horn that that's what I mean marble I mean marble hornets had some intrigue like

360
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:16,980
the barn and stuff yeah is Kino I barely remember anything from from every man hybrid at first

361
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,500
I thought that it was like at first I thought that it was kind of funny that it was framed

362
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,460
as they were making a YouTube show yeah some other kind that became a slender man thing

363
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,140
because slender man was there but yeah that didn't carry it for very here here here let

364
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,180
me explain everything hybrid to you so the gimmick of the channel is that it's these

365
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,660
like like three like bros make you like a fitness channel and then like like episode two slender

366
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,340
man is is like just awkwardly put into like the background of videos and then they're like

367
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,940
we were making a slender man ARG but now slender man is real and he's really trying to kill

368
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:02,880
us yeah oh I forgot about that yeah not not great fucking a fucking pitiful display every

369
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,940
man hybrid fucking you know they probably got like a cp they probably got like yeah they

370
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,740
should they probably got like exposed or something like in some way they like couldn't deny that

371
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,780
they were like doing things related to slender man in some way so they had to like rationalize

372
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,820
it somehow like I would it just seems like such a dumb idea to like admit that you like

373
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,740
we're from the start doing a thing with a slender man yeah like it just seems counter

374
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,140
to your narrative like acknowledges the fakeness of the whole thing oh yeah so like there's

375
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,380
no way I'm gonna take it seriously now in any way and then the fucking rake comes in

376
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,140
because just like that shows like another like creepypasta TM character that we can just

377
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,020
like like steal from another story just put in our fucking thing because we're hacks

378
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:49,340
speaking of YouTube stuff have you guys heard or seen poppy poppy yes yes poppy is a good

379
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:55,100
monster on YouTube yes interesting I don't know what her endgame is I guess release albums

380
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,180
and just be a weird oh on the internet um yeah she's cool she's got some poppy I don't think

381
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:10,540
she's active anymore is poppy like a monster no I mean poppy is a weird creepy semi-robotic

382
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:19,180
possibly internet creature maybe I don't like I've seen some of her videos and I don't know

383
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,020
what she is but I kind of like the associations will illuminati the devil and the possibility

384
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,260
that she's actually like a clone of herself well well they are been on explainer they're

385
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:37,180
both the same to me poppy is this fake pop star on YouTube who makes music videos like

386
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:43,820
you know top 40 like Katy Perry shit but she has sinister undertones in between music videos

387
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,300
which have you know they're just like fucking what I get fucked in my ass you know stuff

388
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:55,900
like that like put your hooves up I don't know about well okay between those she has I guess

389
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,980
I would call them like vlogs they're not like like hey YouTube they're like her staring

390
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:08,140
at the camera and kind of yeah there's like a childishly mumbling about things about how

391
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,460
she like she like loves her like Lord and she makes like five or six minutes of her just

392
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,540
saying that she's poppy and like ASMR and stuff yeah yes that's right that's right she's

393
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,460
like weird creepo ASMR in a way but mostly she's just obviously a bizarre freak and in the

394
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:31,180
best way I like her a lot I I really wonder what the endgame is here I think about that

395
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,460
all the time like what is the point of all these I guess the medium is the message I

396
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,460
suppose just doing these weird videos are just fun for these people I assume I don't know

397
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,380
it's something about fucking Illuminati and fucking you know like celebrities and shit

398
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,460
but fucking I don't know if there's like a message per se I think it's just like art

399
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:54,580
just like displaying this idea of like you know celebrities being like aliens and shit

400
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,380
like yes it's definitely that yeah it's definitely an artistic piece the character of poppy which

401
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,500
I is really cool I'm watching one called Dracula glam right now it's sick as shit she's just

402
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,060
like gnashing her teeth with these fucking vampire fangs and for no reason well this

403
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,220
spooky ambient music plays and then she's opening a box called nightmares at the end

404
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,460
of the video and she's bashing with a fucking bat incredible incredible I saw that's that's

405
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,420
yeah the stakes are really getting raised on the poppy show um yeah she's a fantastic

406
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,620
monster of the internet I love her let's talk about the greatest villain and monster of

407
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:39,740
all time binge Dr. Wolf Dr. Wolf works too I feel like they're intertwined binge run

408
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,340

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:57,540
fucking Jesus Christ the podcast the not a monster podcast major a mask is so creepy

412

of monsters and Nate just mentioned Pokemon our monsters I love Pokemon the only monsters

416
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:41,020
that I acknowledge is real the Pokemon are real having you play Pokemon go then you discuss

417
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,660
me you know I played Pokemon go before it was cool meaning as soon as it came out and

418
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,660
everyone immediately started playing but the real question is do you continue to play it

419
00:20:51,740 --> 00:21:00,140
now that it is no longer I the real test I'm ashamed to admit no never ever again exposed

422
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:19,500

432
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:34,620

436
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:12,220
just it's that it's just like me guys look at this guy though hey incredible do you oh my god

437
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,660
do you guys you guys know how how digimon was founded do you do you know the origin story

438
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,940
you need to you need to you need to look up lady devimon then you'll be converted to we all know

439
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:29,260
how to start you know the the creative poke bunch sirgi Miyamoto what was touching some bugs but

440
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,700
do you know how digimon was made digimon was was you know you know during the japanese air raids

441
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,380
you know you know you know well will be bombed to shit the creator of digimon uh james digimon

442
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:48,620
was was was fucking sliding out of his war torn country he was his home roof collapsed upon him

443
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,180
and he was crawling out like inch by inch and he stumbled and staggered a chest ripped completely

444
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,740
open out of his japanese city and wandered into the nearby mounds and inside inside a pit a thousand

445
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:08,140
trucks long he descended and saw not one but two computers and thought i can make a i can make a game

446
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:17,260
out of this or or whatever digimon is i don't know that's the origin story it was and then he

447
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:26,220
heard those hear that ancient american war song hey we're champions and he was like wait

448
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,740
i'm james digimon i can work with this i can make something happen here and the rest was history

449
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:39,980
um incredible i'm glad we solved this crisis when louis and clark were doing the expedition

450
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:47,020
of the pacific coast they came across a wandering tribe unlike any any engines they had seen before

451
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:53,660
they were all playing their tamagotchi tm around their circles screaming various back in those days

452
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,660
you'd have to get a literal chicken to lay an egg that you would carve into a digivice so that's

453
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,140
how you would connect with your fucking digimon uh things have evolved since then obviously but

454
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:15,580
yeah exactly well that's digimon for you we've solved it uh uh yeah digimon uh superior pokemon

455
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:21,100
this is the superior franchise well here's proof that's not true because look at the screenshot

456
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:29,180
nate just put in that's proof the digimon is shit how dare you get a fuck he's wearing a little

457
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,780
he's wearing a little color i'm gonna have to prove all of you wrong but that color is decidedly

458
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,900
unpopped you but it's probable you know he's about to pop it okay he's about to pop it or

459
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,420
i'm not gonna stop his head with one finger no no look he's fucking gray and brown i don't

460
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:50,700
believe ever he's boring uh but no as bad look look you can think whatever you want about lot

461
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,380
mod but let me let me ask you this like how can you disagree with that that's fucking retarded

462
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:02,140
that's the that's the worst thing i've ever seen in my life that is the antithesis of quality

463
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:10,460
lady devimon the best her upper arm reaches her hips yeah exactly well you know that's just how

464
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,260
they roll the digital world they were able to digitally enhance and enhance and enhance the

465
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,100
length of that arm just looks like oh wait a minute wait a minute ben that's actually like

466
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,140
correct look at this other perspective of this fucking character her arm is decidedly weirdly

467
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:33,100
huge she goes to her fucking ankles um all right well she's christ enough in enough digimon

468
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:38,700
no no no this character looks like i'm just getting started this character looks like a like a

469
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,420
discorded grim dark sabre spark that's what that like human looks like a human that's clearly the

470
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:51,020
best thing in the world so you're just you're just proving my point right now well listen guys okay

471
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,660
the digimon are really cool and all but but and and yes digimon were the original monsters but

472
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,540
frankly i'm a little more interested in talking about like the people who are inspired by characters

473
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,820
like lady devimon as the as the monsters of the modern age a lot uh adolf hitler for example i

474
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,420
thought you were going to say women which i was going to say was definitely the worst monsters

475
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,540
should have gone with women i would like to nominate a group of monsters like like like i would

476
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:21,500
like to nominate a monster as the like number one monster in all categories all fear in fields

477
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:28,940
here it goes here's my nomination every creature in the ocean every single one of them are fucking

478
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:34,860
monsters the deeper you go the work the more monstery they are every single creature in the

479
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:41,740
ocean is despicable nihilistic uh they're pragmatic they're capitalist they're fucking they're all of

480
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,580
the things that you don't want a thing to be and they're all of them and yet still even more they

481
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:55,500
they're their scale of monster to priest is full monster full monster they're so creepy look look

482
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,860
just google like ocean and you'll see shit you don't want to see there are murkabahs are 100

483
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:07,100
inverted it's a nightmare down there i don't believe i don't believe in anything below sea level

484
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,620
yeah i don't either they're i've never look at this this is one this is one of the well-known

485
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,020
ones this is one of the ones like people like tankling oh yeah i know what that is look at this

486
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,940
i linked lotus oh look at that oh what the fuck is this okay it's a demon sharks are good boys

487
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:29,020
shut up that's a demon he looks like a he looks like a medium boy at best to me he's a good boy

488
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,900
oh he will murder you though no he has the chance no but what if he did

489
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,380
sharks can we afford to take that chance not not only are there hideous monsters such as octopi

490
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,900
and starfish in the ocean there's also the lowest rung on the pcp iceberg

491
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:57,100
oh that pcp fan iceberg yes is that a dolphin or a beluga whale it's the lowest rung mate that's

492
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:04,780
a beluga but yeah right i was gonna say beluga oh oh i love lilymon i love lilymon too lilymon was

493
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:10,300
great um i also really like garudamon garudamon was my favorite ultimate and lilymon but that was

494

mart including some fucking kanji and a weird helmet with like lines on it what the fuck is

498
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,540
god that's too much it's too much i'm being scared by ocean things i'm on google image i'm

499

being scared by ocean guys no no no wait hold on hold on hold on guys the ocean itself best girl

500
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:49,260
though who's the quiaman hold on sequoia man dude the ocean itself not even the ocean you you

501
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:55,100
fucking go to the seafloor and you're crushed by pressures grave the geothermal chemistry of life

502
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:01,100
human to calm down and look at the kriamon is i'm with bunchy though boiling me it's boiling

503
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,060
the ocean itself is the worst monster of all i was just gonna say just like how uh the skin is

504
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,380
the largest organ on the human body even though that's a lie and i don't believe it for one second

505
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,380
similar the ocean is the largest monster in the world i am the ocean do you know what comes from

506
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:20,620
the ocean though the king of the monsters himself god zilla the greatest true of all time uh destroys

507
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,860
your cities fucks your bitches and doesn't give a shit the greatest monster okay here's a real

508
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:32,060
question the ocean or am i wrong he does he lives in like an alternate dimension but comes from the

509
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:37,580
ocean in the the short story the call of kathulu where they're running away from the island and

510
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:43,900
kathulu himself rises from the ocean and is undecried but strikes fear into the hearts of all

511
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:50,300
who witnessed it i have heard of being described as a a like a water elemental guy like a water

512
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,420
kind of i mean it's all made up bullshits with a fanfic monster so he brought us tentacle porn

513
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:02,300
so therefore not a monster but a god for all of us to worship it's true uh lovecraft and some good

514
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,580
stuff i really love kathulu's appearance in the my love pony fanfiction my love pony the nae of kathulu

515
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,860
i really like that one i don't even know if you're bullshitting because that sounds a hundred

516
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,420
you can read that if the full length of that on uh on on fanfiction on fanfiction.net you can read

517
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:25,660
that all there yeah i was gonna say that um listen guys this is all good and all but here's a serious

518
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:32,300
question i want to add this is a serious question can a human be a monster yes in whatever way you

519
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,380
divide it yeah okay are we all just gonna say yes because like what does a monster actually mean

520
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:41,580
all all it takes is you just gotta put you just gotta put chopsticks in your mouth and stick the

521
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,340
the top of your nostrils yeah if you're a monster there you go you've left your humanity behind

522
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,380
and okay well you've become something greater here's why i'm curious are you trying to get some

523
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,180
intellectual discourse out of this shit show of a podcast right now maybe i would never attempt that

524
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,780
we'll see what happens uh okay so like no person ever thinks that they're a villain right so like in

525
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,620
their own mind they think they're doing like what's best i mean some people are psychopaths so like

526
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,260
they're the exception but like a guy like hitler for example thought he was doing what's best for

527
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:17,020
like germany probably as is the pcp as is that we'll do whatever it takes he'll do whatever it takes

528
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,340
so like he probably would not call himself even evil you know let alone a monster and of course

529
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,780
most of the world would disagree obviously uh but like i don't know does that does that count this

530
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:34,620
comes down to your to whether you think there's a subjective or objective view of reality if you

531
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,100
say there's an objective morality and objective standards and of course hitler's a monster and he

532
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:45,500
was just uh completely off his rocker but if you're a post-modernist kind of guy who's like

533
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,940
everything's subjective like no from hitler's perspective he wasn't so he wasn't and there's

534
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,140
no way of judging it's there's no way of saying what a monster is or isn't because there's no

535
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,580
objective standards anyways well there's no objective standards there are consent there's

536
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:03,100
consistent standards there's there's consistent whatever that word is however you say that one

537
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,300
i mean there's a lot a lot of people think he's a monster so for all intents and purposes he's

538
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,780
basically objectively a monster yeah i mean i hear what you're saying that's a fair point well

539
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:18,380
that just means that ever that just means that individual people think that he is i think a lot

540
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,700
of them do though a lot of them most of them in fact well i mean it's all it's all the individual's

541
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:31,820
opinion right if there are multiple individuals there is no actual like thing that is the

542
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:37,020
collective will it's not actually a real thing it is just a force kind of in society and you know

543
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,260
that's playing guilty gear where there's the universal will which i'll talk about in my lecture

544
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,900
at rack on three excellent fun the kickstarter fun the kickstarter click the description what do you

545
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,100
mean there's no force like like there's no like like the i mean okay well it's not think something

546
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:59,660
because it's not like a real thing but a lot of if a lot of people individually think something

547
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04,620
and those the people in society then it's not okay here's here's an easy way to think about

548
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,340
things some way here's an easy way to to kind of like refute that it's just like okay so let's

549
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,180
say like literally everyone on earth believes things are a certain way then let's just say that

550
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,980
that whole population of humans just gets like dropped rick and morty style into a like galactic

551
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,580
population and now there's like trillions and trillions of other people who just totally

552
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,860
believe that morality works a different way so now what was the majority opinion is no longer the

553
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,540
majority opinion within like the actual population of like sentient beings it's like in an instant you

554
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,980
can like change how morality works like on a on the you know on the large scale so like it doesn't

555
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:46,140
actually it doesn't like scale that kind of approach like static it evolves with the society

556
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:51,420
so i don't know how are you trying to prove that like well i'm trying to prove that there is no

557
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,300
actual thing that is like a collective will it's it's that that is just the sum of the individual

558
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,140
people's will and like those are the things that one should try to change and that's what actually

559
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,740
matters like it's like if one yeah an example like that back in very old medieval days or whatever

560
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,860
uh people from europe when they were fighting people from where do elephants come from africa

561
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:19,340
or whatever like and they were like oh shit monsters but then you know they gain knowledge

562
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,780
about the topic and it turns out elephants are good boys not monsters that's true the the whole

563
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,860
whether or not to monster thing applies to animals just as well as it does to human beings

564
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,700
hashtag elephants are not monsters everybody stop the stigma and this hate

565
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,500
hashtag giraffes are monsters though have you ever seen a giraffe fight something it's fucking brutal

566
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,180
it does not i've seen every day of my fucking life because i get savaged by action giraffe

567
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,620
despite his emaciated body he still retains 90 percent of his full fighting powers you can't you

568
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:57,820
can't get rid of that fighting instinct that's right that that's his body material but his spirit

569
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,900
indeed indeed that's why he continues to place well in the pcp royal rumble that's true god i can't

570
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,140
wait for another fucking rumble so we can have action giraffe be back in the ring i can't fucking

571
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,100
wait and watch all my fucking characters get destroyed instantly again as they always do why

572
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:22,060
what did i fucking do okay well we'll see fucking donate donate to the kickstarter everybody

573
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:28,060
uh god what else is the rake i felt like the rake what is this rake you mentioned that before

574
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,620
but you didn't describe it dropping i'm so glad you weren't hosting this one because you don't

575
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:38,860
know fucking anything apparently i don't i don't i'm not i'm actually i'm gonna save my rake discourse

576
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,940
for the creepypasta episode because because evidently that's all i that's all the things i have to

577
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:49,900
say about monsters is from creepypasta okay okay fair enough oh by the way quick point as to why

578
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:57,180
objective reality is true uh it is objective uh what was the word morality is true uh to what

579
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,900
someone was saying before it's because there are baseline fundamentals that we can understand

580
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,300
consciousness is real as far as we can tell consciousness is at least real for you and there

581
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,340
are things that are and i know this is gonna sound like some fuzzy language but we can generally

582
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,420
all agree on things that are largely true even if there are some exceptions fuzzy like

583
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:22,380
things like fuzzy life is generally preferable to death too fuzzy pleasure is generally preferable

584
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:28,380
to pain generally but we know these things are like that is that is all just a matter of opinion

585
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:34,300
no one comes down to the individual to decide what is preferable okay but but if things apply to

586
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:39,420
like 99.9 percent of the population is it really correct then it applies that's what i was just

587
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,700
saying throw it out the window that's what i was just saying there's nothing outside of the person's

588
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,820
preferences that is made real by those preferences okay but it's okay well for example newtonian

589
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:55,820
physics is not 100 percent it does not fully map out reality but we still use it practically

590
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,220
to determine all kinds of stuff about the real world so it's super useful so in the same way

591
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:06,700
more our moral systems are maps to optimize the way we want society well newtonian physics isn't

592
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,700
real i well yeah i mean that that is true it is it is just a way of understanding shit no

593
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:18,060
that is not completely accurate guys that's that's not fucking even real because physics is mapping

594
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,100
out a thing that exists in the world and like morality is mapping out what people think about

595
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:29,820
consciousness then it's all preference it's it's opinion all the way down question like

596
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:36,060
would you prefer to get punched in the face or get it or get a free milkshake um milkshake but

597
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,260
that's just that's all the boys i might if i was if i was feeling really bad about myself i might

598
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:46,300
want to get punched in the face okay what if a bunch of bullies were coming to beat you up good

599
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,740
what if a bunch of bullies were coming to literally beat you up real real bad and your friend said like

600
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,900
oh here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna punch you in the face so that you look like you've already

601
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,460
been beat up and they won't beat you up even worse and in that case getting punched in the face might

602
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,540
be a better idea than getting a milk you're changing the you're changing the situation yeah well what

603
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:12,220
is the situation we didn't get punched in the face so you get an offer get punched in the face or get

604
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:17,500
a free milkshake okay but the whole this doesn't actually prove anything this is just showing what

605
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:23,340
we personally want the real monsters are people who wax philosophically for no reason on podcast

606
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:29,420
you're all about i hate you you're fucking general preference implies some kind of greater truth

607
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:35,980
stupid uh there there is too large your truth you guys you just we just it was gonna be a podcast

608
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,660
where we have fun talking about monsters and now you're just i'm having a great time

609
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,980
here's the real monster the philosophical insights of who's a monster and who's not but that's

610
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,820
essential uh you can't describe something unless you know what it is you know what you know what

611
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,620
What's a monster?

612
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,320

campaign,

690
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,740
through the camera but like the camera extends it so it's like this long like

691
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:57,140
tube thing. I think they're actually called rods. I think they're like called

692
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,500
rods. Yeah. They were in a JoJo chapter. I think rods might be my favorite. Crypto

693
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:09,300
cryptocurrency. Well I know that rods trade exclusively in Bitcoin.

694
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,340
Yes. Which is why I'm trying to collect them so that I can enter their economy.

695
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,860
Bitcoin taking a beating right now under under 8,000.

696
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,340
Munch, can you like post a rod? I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

697
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:24,860
Just read JoJo part six. There's a part where I don't actually know.

698
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,020
I'll post a picture of rods. In case any of you needed convincing, this is proof

699
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,420
that the Mothman is in fact real and he's not like a fantasy thing. He's real.

700
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:39,300
Here's proof. Okay. There he is. I'm convinced. The Mothman is real everybody.

701
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,980
Oh no. I see no reason to doubt this whatsoever. This is less floofy. This

702
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,980
doesn't look like a Moth. This looks like a bat.

703
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:53,980
The bat man is real. I'd like to nominate this as the best monster of all time.

704
00:41:53,980 --> 00:42:01,180
This looks like the one. You got this shit. Oh no. You found that right now because you

705
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,780
were searching for rod monster didn't you? That's exactly because I found the

706
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,420
same one. Oh hell yeah. Okay. I really touched about enemy earlier and I just

707
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,340
wanted to say there's had a lot of like like monster grills and I want more

708
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,140
monster boys please. That would be nice. Yeah okay. Okay. I just wanted to make

709
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:24,820
that statement also. You will never know the pleasure that I feel whenever I go

710
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:29,700
to Egypt and I plunder tombs sanctioned off by the government for being too

711
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,460
culturally significant. I plunder them anyway outside the the prying eyes of

712
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,460
the government. I plunder those tombs. I raid those caverns and I party down

713
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,700
with the mummies the various mummies that line the underground layers of

714
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,460
Egypt. I do that every single day and that's why mummies are the number one

715
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,580
monster because they are party animals. They want to get down just like I

716
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,420
want to do. They want to get down. They want to put their hooves up and they

717
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,540
love they love drinking booze and love fucking sluts just like I do. That's

718
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,620
that's nice but fuck the mummies. The coolest monsters were these. The only one

719
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,180
ever to play with these back in the day. That was the coolest shit of all time.

720
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,260
They were like they were like monster trucks that turned into actual monsters.

721
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,700
It was the coolest shit ever. Okay that is awesome but something looks vaguely

722
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,820
familiar. I think I might have seen commercials for them. Dude they were so

723
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:25,260
vaguely terrifying. They were like cars that like transformed into like monsters.

724
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,740
They have like giant mouths and they eat eight shit. It was it was fucking. Does it

725
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,940
like exude slime or something? Because I'm seeing some slime. Some of them some of

726
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,380
them do. That one did I believe. Oh my god this is up my alley. This is up my alley.

727
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,940
Into the fucking podcast because this is going to be a nightmare because no one

728
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,980
can see what the fuck we're talking about. We're giving this one a give. He's gonna

729
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,420
end all of these for being late. I'll put all these in the show notes. Click on the

730
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,060
link in the description you can see all of these. Okay fantastic. Okay here's a

731
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,900
thing we're doing this real quick. We're gonna go through all the universal

732
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,180
monsters and give them a score out of ten. All right here we go. Starting number

733
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:05,420
one Frankenstein zero. What Frankenstein's monster four. Frankenstein's monster yes.

734
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,460
Oh we're talking about the monster than a ten out of ten. The monster's a good

735
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:17,020
boy. I like him. He's a flesh golem. He's sick. I don't know. He's fine. He's a

736
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:23,100
little bland. I never read the book. I only played the video game. The most

737
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,300
interesting thing about Frankenstein's monster is Frankenstein himself who would

738
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,300
just bring a guy alive for some reason. But okay. Actually Frankenstein was the

739
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,220
real monster. If I remember the lore correctly he was. No no it was the mob

740
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:42,580
that was the real monster. No Frankenstein was a dick. No our real monsters was the

741
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:48,380
real monster. Okay good. He's zero out of ten. Count Dracula. Count Dracula. Seven.

742
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:52,180
He's got a funny accent. I like the fact he's a foreigner so I can make fun of him

743
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:59,020
without any moral justification. Dracula is honestly more boring than Frankenstein.

744
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:05,900
No Dracula's great. He has fucking teeth that he makes you go bye bye with. Dracula has to

745
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:11,460
be the best monster because he's a real person. He's not some fucking joke. He's real.

746
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,780
Nosferatu's are sick. I would give a Nosferatu like an eight out of the gate but this is

747
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:21,580
Count fucking Dracula. He's a bitch. Whatever. He's gay. The Wolfman. Oh that one is like

748
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:28,380
the worst one of all. He's fucking zero. Zero. He's a furry. He's a furry. I give him

749
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:34,860
one point out of ten for being ten percent real. That sounds good. He's a little bit

750
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:40,260
real but not enough to make the cut. I have never liked the Wolfman. I'm giving him like

751
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:46,420
a two. What is cool about him? He is a wolf. He's a fur sona. He is a wolf. Okay but you

752
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:51,180
know that guy is like in there was that one kid who's like in every way other than physical.

753
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,460
I am a wolf. Barks. This guy is actually a little bit along that. He is slightly physically

754
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:02,980
a wolf as well. So in that way I give him bonus points. And he goes aloo. He does. I like

755
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:07,980
him. Okay. What else? For some reason also in this line is Van Helsing is here for some

756
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:16,580
reason. Oh I love the anime. That was a sick anime. I'm going to give him like a I don't

757
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,900
know he's pretty cool. I get to five just for because Helsing the anime exists because

758
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:27,860
of that. Yeah. Yeah. Wait what is the real Van Helsing? Is he a real person? He's just

759
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,060
a dude who went around killing monsters. That's what he did. So he's a monster hunter not

760
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:41,300
a monster. He's like blood born but less cool. But he kills the beasts. He's seven. He's

761
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:46,060
at least a seven. I like him. I'll give him some points because all the universal monsters

762
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,780
suck so he's getting rid of them. So. Okay. Listen to this. For some reason the next one

763
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,380
on this list is Henry Frankenstein. Oh that must be the guy. That's the guy who made Frankenstein.

764
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,620
Yeah I told you he's a monster. He's terrible. But what the fuck. I click on the link and

765
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,460
now it's Victor Frankenstein. That's the whole point of the book is that he's the real monster

766
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,300
and the monster is more human. But why does he say Henry here and Victor on the other

767
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:12,420
page. I don't understand. Okay this must be out of date. Okay Victor Frankenstein. Fuck

768
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,860
it. The guy who made it. Now that guy's cool. He gets an eight. Is he such a bad guy. He

769
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:22,740
just wanted to do science. No no he's terrible. He just wanted to be God. How bad can he be.

770
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:29,860
He didn't do nothing. I will not approve the slanderization of Victor Frankenstein. He's

771
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,060
a wonderful camera operator. He went to college for the shit. He knows what he's fucking doing.

772
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,500
He can make better quality videos than we ever fucking could. He's gonna have his slanderization

773
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:43,460
Victor Frankenstein. I hate it. That's a very rude thing and I hope Mage when he is our

774
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:49,100
cameraman at RideCon3 you'll be a little nicer about what he's doing for us. Not that Victor.

775
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:54,620
It's too late. We understand what you meant. Next vote up. The invisible man. The invisible

776
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,380
man. I like that one. I'm gonna give him an eight. I really like him. I like the fact

777
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,300
that he's like kind of a mummy but like he's also invisible. There's like two things there.

778
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:10,500
I saw the movie. I'm gonna give him like four. He fucking sucks dick. Oh but really you suck dick.

779
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,220
Have you ever thought that what you say about people actually reflects upon you as a person?

780
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:19,380
He's only gay so he can sneak into men's locker rooms and literally suck dick. That's his whole end

781
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:26,060
game and so I give him like an eight out of ten. He does deserve points for that. Exactly. I respect

782
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:32,500
his gumption. I was gonna argue with you Nick but I googled the invisible man and I can't deny

783
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,860
what he's wearing and his bi-language indicates that he is in fact the most homosexual person

784
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:42,260
I've ever seen in my life. There's nothing to argue against. He just clearly is the gayest fucking guy

785
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:50,620
ever. That's correct. That's correct. Hold on. Look at this fucking photo of the

786
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:58,340
the original faggot. Oh man. He's looking fab. He's looking fab. Oh that's spectacular. I kind of

787
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:05,220
like it actually. He looks cool. He looks fucking dope. I was that cool. He's fucking dope as hell.

788
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:12,260
He sucks so much dick I can't help but respect him. Same. Same. Okay next on the list for some

789
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:17,820
reason is Elizabeth which is Victor Frankenstein's fiance. Does anyone know anything about this

790
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:24,780
character? Ten because it's a woman. The scariest monster. Yeah. Tips. Oh there you go. She's a name.

791
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,180
There you go. She has a name. You know what skip. I don't give a shit about her. Okay last on the

792
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:36,020
list of actual people is Igor. Igor the freakish. Igor's good. Hunchbacked. Ten out of ten. He was

793
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,060
just a real boy trying to make a living. That's right. You see the thing that's great about Igor

794
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,100
is that he looks like a monster on the outside because he's so weird and goofy and silly and

795
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:49,620
hilarious but on the inside he's just the greatest person, nicest boy who ever lived. Fucking

796
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:56,660
thumbs up if you've seen the greatest movie of all time Igor 2008. If not but it looks fucking

797
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:04,820
incredible. It's fucking dope. Igor 2008 is my fucking jam. Igor is played by John Kuzak.

798
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:12,260
It's the universal constant. It's fun and clever. Exactly. Wow. Wow. I'm just not pronounced Igor

799
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,820
and was sponsored by Apple to promote their new line of iPods that were coming out at the time.

800
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:27,860
The new deep web service Igor. Yes. Oh no. This may fucking 30 million point seven dollars at the

801
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:36,660
box office. He's powers before Igor. What the fuck. Powers before him. Cryptocurrency tanked when

802
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:42,820
this movie came out because real monster currency soared after Igor dropped and everyone. Igor

806
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:06,340
adorable. I love it. He's like an aunt. He looks like something from a bug's life. I feel

807
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,940
probably dream works animate or something fucking Igor. If you listen to the podcast we want you

808
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:15,300
on dude. We want you on this shit. We need we need you. We need you're wrong. We got one last

809
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:20,500
prowess. We got one last person here and it is mummy the mummy. What do we think of the

810
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:25,780
10 out of 10. He's my favorite 10 but I honestly I think that the invisible man wears the bandage

811
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:32,340
is better and like so mummies mummies don't have organs and somehow still are able to function

812
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:42,340
which means yeah what the fuck. It doesn't look real. I was that was a fucking slut.

813
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:47,060
Also I was going to say the fucking mummy the movie with Brendan Frazier was fucking sick because

814
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:53,140
that guy like fuck bitches and he like summoned like if we if we just guys if we have money on

815
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:57,860
this list why don't we have zombies on this list because well it's not a universal monster.

816
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,260
Yeah that's true. There are new things but zombies are fair. Zombies are fucking cool.

817
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:07,700
Before I'll just be that guy. I don't get I don't get the appeal of the mummy. I feel like the

818
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:13,620
appeal of the mummy is just the appeal of like ancient Egyptian stuff but like when I think of

819
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:18,260
a mummy there's nothing particularly Egyptian about it except it's just a zombie. It's just a

820
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:24,100
fucking did it. Yeah it's it's aesthetic which is not which is not true in reality but but in

821
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:29,220
but in movie land is the only place that actually matters and then listen listen the real okay there

822
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,460
is a there is a secret monster that came out in in the wake of the mummy and it is the realest

823
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:38,180
most terrifying monster that's ever existed so everyone's familiar with the saga of Brendan Frazier

824
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:43,860
I'm sure who has fallen from grace in the most tragic way possible and at the height of his

825
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:50,500
popularity he got a divorce and now he has to pay these like $500,000 alimony payments to his wife

826
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,180
and he is not getting into rules because no one wants to hire him because he got too tight cast

827
00:52:54,180 --> 00:53:00,260
and exploded he burned out too too hotly and too quickly at the height of his career and he's

828
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,020
starting to get a little bit of shit now but like he's totally fucking dead and the real monster

829
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:09,380
here is alimony. Yeah alimony is the ultimate monster it ruins great men who could have otherwise

830
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,860
made something of themselves it is a beast like Brendan Frazier everyone's favorite alimony is just a

831
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:18,900
weapon the ultimate monster women yeah you know you're not wrong you're not wrong kill them all

like is this like straight up biblical yeah please describe this for our list call please

881
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:02,180
describe it i think um but the okay the thing about it the thing about it like the reason why

882
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,740
angels are always depicted as like people with wings is because like in the bible angels appear

883
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:13,380
in the form of people right right isn't jacob that like wrestles an angel or something i don't know

884
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:18,020
someone wrestles an angel and and that angel is a guy but like that's not what he really looks like

885
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:23,940
he's appearing as a human but like in in the bible they appear they generally appear as humans but

886
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:28,100
that's not what they really look like uh this is what they really look like and they're fucking here

887
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,540
i'll find another one i'll find a seraphim and just describe this like at least cherub's cherub's

888
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:39,540
i think used to have like you know how cherub's are depicted as like little babies or not but

889
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:44,100
that that's not how they used to be i think they had three heads one human one lion one

890
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,660
bull or something yeah yeah they were like um they were like why do we make the bible so uncool

894
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:08,420

895
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:12,260
it to myself to actually read the thing oh is this like the thousand wings or whatever that's the

931
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:29,140
you know separate thing just for questions there that we will refer to uh but let me get the pity

932
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:35,220
question here from the the twitter real quick this is from at a mundane critic and the question is

933
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:44,260
the more of a request it is define meme define meme is it just meme is a joke that isn't funny

934
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:52,340
right that's your definition it's a viral joke that isn't funny i i i've led i've led this crusade

935
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:57,860
on arm retrieval the the the bible the bible retold for the for the modern era where we need to

936
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:01,780
make a distinction when we think things are funny refer to them as jokes and we think things

937
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:06,260
aren't funny refer to them as memes that that that's my that's my official doctrine and i

938
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:11,380
train from that whenever i can if there's one thing to discuss to me about the word meme it's

939
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:18,020
when it's used to mean like a still image of some quote unquote funny thing happening with text on

940
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:24,580
the top and bottom yeah that is a meme now that i hate that but like that's kind of what it

941
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:29,700
me people mean when they say it now like i don't i don't think i don't i think that i think we've

942
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:37,060
lost that battle yeah you're right yeah it's a shame i do it's not we've lost that that's what a

943
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:45,540
question from the discord chat western dragons versus who's it from ends western dragons

944
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:50,660
versus eastern dragons which are better i say western dragons eastern dragons western dragons

945
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:56,020
are fucking awful and i hate them so so so much they're cool lizards with with giant wings and the

946
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:01,380
brief fire and eastern dragons are just long noodles if i see western dragons for the win

947
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:13,220
if i see a single other castle night brown earth or dragon i will fucking buy off the handle

948
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:20,180
western fantasy it are the dregs of all fictional settings western fantasy is the opposite of

949
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:25,860
creativity and the graveyard for all potentially good ideas listen i when i was young i definitely

950
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,940
felt burned i read a lot of fantasy novels as a kid i definitely got burned out on like western

951
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:35,300
fantasy it's specifically like western dragons but then i got more into d&d which now i don't

952
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:40,420
really like so much but the point is i read the monsters manual and i read like all the books

953
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:46,020
and the like i would say that on average eastern dragons are just like they're cooler by default

954
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:52,260
but when you've got a really like majestic and like dignified looking like sick ass ancient

955
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:58,260
worm elder like gold or red or white dragon or something and they're just like so fucking wise

956
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:03,860

1037
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:20,100
answer probably uh happy d from the patreon lounge thoughts on monster any or energy drinks um oh

1038
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:27,060
disgusting excellent monster like diesel i used to be a huge fan believe it or not back in the

1039
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:33,620
college days but i graduated to red bull and rock star and haven't looked back the no sugar kind of

1040
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:40,820
the monster ultra series is my favorite of all hey in case you guys haven't seen ben here is

1041
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:46,340
quite the connoisseur of monster energy drinks having just made an art piece using the cans right

1042
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:52,180
that was monster right um the big old yeah i made volpix for jackie out of like 50 fucking monster

1043
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:58,900
cans meticulously cut monster cans into one yeah it is into one inch pieces of metal and then like

1044
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:04,580
linked together with a hole punch and tiny metal key rings how did you keep that a secret

1045
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:09,140
how did you keep that a secret that's what i'm wondering well see because like i started working

1046
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:14,900
on it a long time ago like i started working on it like almost a year ago okay but it kind of like

1047
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,660
it kind of like lost momentum but then our anniversary came up and i was like this i think

1048
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:23,460
this is the time to finish it yeah okay so i did i pushed through because like i already i mean i'd

1049
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:28,420
already put i'd already put all that work in like i had to do it was like now's the time if i'm ever

1050
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:33,940
gonna baggy and like pop artness at the same time i love it i love it made of fucking monster

1051
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:40,020
cans it's oh that's great it's it's it's really it's something that uh i don't know i mean i'd

1052
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:45,300
i'd want it in my house you probably have to like map out like pixel by pixel like i absolutely did

1053
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:51,140
i have like i have like files um yeah i had to like i had to like divide the original sprite

1054
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:57,060
into its pixels find out how many of each color i needed how and then like estimate how many cans

1055
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:02,180
that was going to be uh separate them all and then like i took the thing and i split it into

1056
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:07,460
its vertical sections and then i would link together one vertical section at a time um and

1057
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:13,380
then i would connect them by the top and then i i yeah um it was it was labor and and energy

1058
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:22,020
intensive it sure looks like it well okay you know there's one last question we have to answer

1059
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:27,860
from AJ Shoup here that's just thoughts on monster cheese with a little o w o face

1060
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:38,900
hey i love cheese i am i'm i'm not a white person because i don't really like cheese that much

1062
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:51,380

1063
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:56,180
no cheese on it because it's like well cheese has a lot of extra calories in it and i don't like

1064
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:00,740
cheese that much so i'm willing to lose the cheese because i don't care about the cheese

1065

well sure i mean you get like bakery pizza or something you know that's no cheese the bakery
