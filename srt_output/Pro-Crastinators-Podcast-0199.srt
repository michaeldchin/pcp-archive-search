00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Hello everybody and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,480
the best guy ever, and I'm about $20,000 richer off of this Kickstarter.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,440
Hey everybody, this episode of The Pro Crastinator is brought to you by Mike Bloomberg for President

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,360
2020, depositing $20,000 directly into our Kickstarter account, and now we're bought

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,360
and paid for, baby. Mike, he's the cool candidate. Bill, Mike, love that guy. Did you hear as well?

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,880
This message is sponsored by Pete Buttigieg's dog, who he roleplays as on Twitter.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:50,600
Yeah? It's true. Much like Spoonie, Pete Buttigieg also has dog roleplay accounts on Twitter,

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,080
where he roleplays some dogs. Well, I'm gonna have to look into that. I mean, the joke about Pete is

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,200
that he strangles dogs in the studio. So I don't know if that's a deliberate attempt to get ahead of

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,120
that message. He roleplays the dog being into it. That's what he does. Every day he strangles dog

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,880
after dog, but one day there was a dog whose neck was so strong he just couldn't ring it, and he

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,720
thought, you know what, this one comes with me. Yes, that's right. Hey guys, in case you haven't

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,160
seen it, of course, you should definitely go check out the now concluded Radcon 4 Paradise

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,120
Kickstarter page. Obviously, it was a success as of several weeks ago. When you hear this,

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,240
it'll be closed. For us, we've got like two days left, and we are right on the cusp of 20,000,

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,480
as we speak. Incredible. As we speak, we are almost there, with about, what, 40 hours to go? 45?

17
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,680
That's right. And I'm talking like $150 to get their give or take. So it's looking good. It's

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,000
looking good. Oh, well, well, well, well, well, well, well. Here we are. Hot fuck.

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,080
I mean, when we started, so, man, it's funny to look back on it. When we started, there was all

20
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:06,680
this debate and ringing of teeth and gnashing of nails about how much to charge. And I mean,

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,880
you know, it was all understandable that we not try to overcharge people based on like how much

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,760
we earned last time. We undercharged them. As a matter of business, we 100% undercharged,

23
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,800
because we just lost money on the whole operation. This time, oh, praise God. Oh, the first time.

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,920
No, no, no, no. Listen, we've lesson learned again. You can never gouge hard. And we have just

25
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,720
at the, wait, oh my God, I just saw the tally on the Kickstarter tick up. Let me refresh the,

26
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,360
what the fuck? It went over 20,000 and then it dipped back down. I think someone pledged and

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,840
then immediately unpledged. Oh, wait, no, there it goes. Boom. There it goes. It's going back over.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm going to die. 20,000. I'm seeing 19,831 for me. I did. I'll refresh the damn page. Okay. I got

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,560
it. I got it. I'm going to die. Oh, no. Help. Oh, please. I'm seeing the page go above it. No,

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,480
okay. It keeps like cycling over 20,000. Okay. Well, I have no doubt it will make over 20,000.

31
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,920
Yeah, it says 20K for me. I just want to see the number. I just want to see the number.

32
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:15,400
20,081. And $81.77. I'm going to put a link in the show. For me, it says 19. Okay. Now I'm

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,560
seeing 20,000. It updated actually without me having to reload the page. For me, it says

34
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,000
19,831. It'll do in a second. I'm seeing 20,080. Give it a minute. My internet is being shit today.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,440
Well, that means I'm writing chapter five, I guess. Chapter five. And a physical release.

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:42,360
Print that shit. Yep. So let's talk about that. 20,001. Oh, 081 actually, but close enough.

37
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,560
Ben, you've done some physical printings of comics before. Yeah. How has that gone for you?

38
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:55,160
Pretty easy. Yeah, yeah. Well, actually, I've been thinking about this. Yeah, I printed

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,560
vapors one and vapors two. It was pretty easy. I used a website or a printing service called

40
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:09,000
Blam, with a dash between Ka and Blam. I mean, yeah, you just like saved your, you get like

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,640
high res image files. Okay. Yeah, I, this, this service was for like comic printing.

42
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:22,120
There would probably be cheaper ways to print like a text thing. I imagine like,

43
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,280
yeah, people say Amazon publishing is good for that. So you don't even have to submit like a

44
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,200
PDF, but just actually image files. And they like, I mean, they wanted me to save them as this,

45
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,160
like a TNG file or something, but like, whatever it was. The next generation Star Trek.

46
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,720
I don't think that was, it was something, it was some weird format, but yeah, they were just like,

47
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,600
save all your files in high resolution as this file, like send them to us in a zip file, and we'll

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,920
just, we'll send you the fucking thing when it's ready, which, um, yeah, can't wait to do that

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:03,000
again for papers too. Once all my guests artists get their pages in, hint, hint, hint, if you are

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,040
listening, I was planning to use the same website to print my book just because there's going to

51
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,360
be a bunch of comic pages, manga pages in my book. And, uh, they have the option on that website to

52
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,720
get the book manga sized as a paperback. Like, yeah, you can get it a little book. That sounds nice.

53
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,080
So yeah, I think that would be sick.

54
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,040
You know, I don't know, I got recommended that service by another comic maker.

55
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,760
You might want to maybe ask around other like book writers about whether it's the cheapest

56
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,680
way to go about printing a text novel. I mean, again, I've heard that the Amazon service is good

57
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,120
for, even for printing, so I don't know, I had to look into that as well, but if...

58
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,600
Call up our old friend, ask him with that experience as well.

59
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,200
He's Lulu, he didn't use it.

60
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,400
Oh, okay, okay.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,920
I was, uh, I was fucking around the other night. I was feeling like too probably, probably in the

62
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,960
wake of like the New Hampshire, the New Hampshire primaries or something. I was too emotionally

63
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,920
drained. I was too, I had gone through too much turmoil and I couldn't think anymore.

64
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,040
So I was like, man, I'm not, I gotta, I gotta do some shit. I gotta do some work, but I can't think.

65
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,840
So I was like, I'll do some thoughtless work and I'll just, for no, no particular reason at all,

66
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,960
like just, just because maybe. I'll just, I'll just take slime and punishment and arrange it into

67
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:25,000
pages as though it were to be printed in a book or something at some future date. And I'll just do,

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,440
I don't know why. I don't know, just, just fucking around. So, so I was doing that and then I was

69
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,560
looking around for like printers, because Ka-Blam will not, I was thinking if it were going to be

70
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,720
printed, it would be in like, I was imagining it like the Homestuck book, you know, basically

71
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,680
landscape style, like four panels like that. But Ka-Blam won't print in landscape. It only does

72
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,200
formats that are portrait arrangement. So I was like, fuck. So I briefly started looking around

73
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,280
for like alternatives and I didn't find anything, but I'm sure there's, maybe I should look at Amazon

74
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,440
for, I don't know, because thing about slime and punishment is that it's like full color and like,

75
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,760
if there were like any limitations on color in like, in like the physical printing, it would

76
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,680
look like complete shit, right? Because it's got so many like fully saturated, like crushed

77
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:30,360
collies and stuff. So the, it must be robust. Anyway, I don't know. That's, that's, I'll, I'll,

78
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,160
I'll look at it. I'll take a look at Amazon might, might be worth it. Fucking Ka-Blam,

79
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:43,000
fucking Ka-Blam will only print comics that look like comic books or manga. It will do like,

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,640
because slime and punishment printed physically would be like, well over 100 pages. And if you

81
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,920
get over 64 pages, it doesn't, it won't print it as a comic. It will, it has to print it as a,

82
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,040
like a quote unquote paperback. And I guess that means, you know, it has a spine and everything.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,920
But it still won't change the, it still won't, it still won't landscape.

84
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,320
I need it landscape. I don't want to print it vertically. That's dumb. It was published on

85
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,680
Twitter in a, in a four, in a four image, an update, layout. I want to preserve that.

86
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,360
That's important.

87
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,800
Makes sense, makes sense. Yeah, I was wondering about the, the whole like amount of pages,

88
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,280
because the Vapors chapters have only been, what, like, 20, 20 pages? Vapors one was 40 something.

89
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,480
The Lord of Ghost comic, I was thinking of, of making a thing as well. Chapter three is out,

90
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,840
by the way. Yeah, that's right. Chapter three, link in the description. It just came out, right?

91
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,440
Just came out. Minutes ago.

92
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,000
As soon as I entered the call. Minutes ago for us.

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
For us. Right. It's been out since.

94
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,360
Sunday for you listening, folks.

95
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,480
Yeah, but the final thing will be about 100 pages almost. So I'm thinking,

96
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,360
is that, would that be a problem? But I guess not. Yeah, yeah.

97
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,240
I'm sure there's a way to do it.

98
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,960
Guys, and we got to talk about this, because I'm here with the two of you, Ben and Gibbon,

99
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,440
who draw comics. And that's all I've been doing for the last couple weeks.

100
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,800
Yeah. And it's, it's pretty great. Drawing comics is better than drawing regular illustrations.

101
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,920
IMO. You think so? How do you figure?

102
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,280
Let me put it to you like this. In a similar sense that, I think that the more complex a medium is,

103
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,320
at the same time, there are more ways that you can fail, but also the failures are kind of muted

104
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,440
by the successes of other areas. I saw a great tweet yesterday. And I was like, I was like,

105
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,760
yes, I am living for this tweet. So relatable. I said, drawing comics is about accepting your

106
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,360
ugly panels and moving on. And I was like, that's so true. Ben, I have a new catchphrase, and this

107
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:10,360
is kind of going to be the overall like linchpin arc words of the book, Cus Omega, which is,

108
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:19,800
it's not about being clever. It's about pushing forward. And in so many ways, you know, yeah,

109
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,320
basically, AKA, please excuse my bad project, but I had to make something. So here it is.

110
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,120
Anything finished is like Brian Leo Malley said, anything finished is automatically better than

111
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,240
anything unfinished. Whatever it takes to get it done. The perfect is the enemy of the good. I

112
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,040
completely agree. The arc that the character goes through in the story is that like he had killed

113
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,240
himself because of the fact that he was writing nothing but bullshit for so long and never got

114
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,040
around to writing his ideas for stuff that would be like really great works of literature because

115
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,000
he didn't think he was good enough to actually write them. And so he just didn't. And then

116
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,600
ultimately ends up killing himself. And when he reflects on it, he's like, well, you know,

117
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,360
even if those stories hadn't come out the way I wanted, it would have been better to try than to

118
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:11,320
kill myself, you know, indeed, since it puts him into the situation and all. But but did you don't

119
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,400
you know that being born is inherently abuse? Our parents didn't get our consent to be born to

120
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,800
have to carry these burdens in this world. I think the character possibly could have made that

121
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,160
argument if not for the fact that killing himself just didn't bring him any release at all. It's

122
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,560
simply trapped him in a narrative of how I would argue it would for us, though. It would bring us

123
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,080
relief, ladies and gentlemen. We don't know that, though. You don't know. That's the mistake that

124
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:48,520
he made. You never see it coming. So so with regards to the comics, like more so than just

125
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,440
like bad panels being held up by good ones, but even just when we think about one punch man,

126
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,320
right, the original release, the strength of it was not just that it had a great concept,

127
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,240
which is already the biggest strength of one punch man, but also that one sincerely has

128
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,360
great compositions in his imagery. They're just not well drawn, you know, and so like I kind of

129
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,080
looked at it like as long as I can communicate the story through the facial expressions and poses

130
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:26,280
to a degree where you understand what this is supposed to look like, then it kind of can carry

131
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,680
itself. That's it. You've got it. You've got it. You activate the imagination. It's just about like

132
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,720
my, especially with slime and punishment. I mean, in particular with slime and punishment. It's just

133
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,440
about get a page done and done means it conveys the thing I wanted to convey. Right. Yeah. And then

134
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,160
it's done. I mean, it's funny because I'm already used to doing that in other forms of art, so it

135
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,040
kind of comes naturally to me to transition that mode of thinking into comics. I just had never

136
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,880
really tried it before, but because of the fact that I'm doing this physical release of Cusomega,

137
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,960
and I decided to hire a bunch of artists to work on it, and I storyboarded all the comics

138
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,600
that are going to be in it. So I did 18 pages of comics and then another 12 for... Did you ever

139
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,000
giggle to yourself thinking like, hey, I'm just like that guy from Bakuman, you know, the one who...

140
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes. The writer. Exactly. That's what I would do. You mean the blonde guy? The glasses guy. Yeah,

141
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,120
that guy. I mean the author himself, because like in Bakuman, they sometimes will show the

142
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:35,720
storyboards that Tsugumi Oba does for Bakuman, and then show Takeshi Obata's redone storyboards,

143
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,360
where he like, you know, he redraws it and makes it more dynamic and like changes the

144
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,280
structure of all the boxes before he goes in and draws it, you know, which is exactly what

145
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,560
some of these artists did who are working on... Like, some of my comics, they took it and really

146
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,200
re-adapted it into something very different, whereas there's one guy who is the one who kind of gave

147
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,120
me the idea to do this project, who really just wants to draw comics written by me. Like, that

148
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,840
was his goal. He was like, I will just... He didn't even want payment. He was just like, I just want

149
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:12,040
to draw comics, you write, right? Based on this story. So I've got him doing like a 12 page comic.

150
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,840
Kind of fucked that guy a little bit. For bringing down everyone else's potential

151
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,000
earning, potential buy. A little bit of a scab, a little bit of a pick and line crossing.

152
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,960
They need a union. No, for what it's worth, I'm not having him do anything for free. I told him...

153
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:35,080
There you go. I will not accept that. But uh, unless it was for no profit, but this particular

154
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,600
profit is... Sure, sure. If nobody's... If nobody's... If nobody's making any money, then sure.

155
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,440
But it's fascinating because he has been adapting my storyboards like

156
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,360
almost exactly to where it's basically just the same images, but with that level of detail that

157
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,400
I am just not capable of, you know? That's what you want. But it's funny, it's not exactly what

158
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,760
I want the most because I don't think my storyboards are necessarily amazing. So if they can be

159
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,920
improved, then by all means go for it, you know, which a lot of the other artists have done. But

160
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:13,080
it is... It's good in a sense that I can say, okay, well, like, this will let me see exactly

161
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,160
what this would look like fully realized. And then I can truly understand, like,

162
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,080
what am I doing right and wrong in my storyboarding? You know, this is a fascinating

163
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,160
point because not to be an asshole to that guy, but it sounds like he might be the kind of guy

164
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,360
who's such a big fan of yours that he might be afraid to tweak anything that you put. So he

165
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,960
wants to just stick to it. Whereas if you have somebody who... Let's say like you just reach out

166
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,320
to like a true pro and you pay him a million dollars, and they're like, yeah, I know what I'm

167
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,320
doing, I'll adapt your ideas, then they'll add some of their own expertise and artistic flair.

168
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,040
I mean, for what it's worth... I don't want to downplay how much he adds to it just because

169
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,720
the quality of my drawing is so low that the fact that he could extrapolate it into something that

170
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,280
looks correct is like, oh, wow, this is what you would need to add. Like, it's significantly

171
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,520
different, you know, in spite of the fact of being the same pose-wise.

172
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,280
You posted some of these redrawn stuff on Twitter, right?

173
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,360
I posted the two-page comic that he did. Link that.

174
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,960
Oh, that's his? I thought that was pretty good. The one with... Yes. Yeah, I saw that. It looks good.

175
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,600
Yeah, it looks real good. I agree. That's why I'm excited about this project.

176
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,400
But yeah, I'll link... I will post in the gross audio links the original storyboards as well,

177
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:37,000
so you can prepare them. Oh, this one. Oh, yeah, this does... This is excellent.

178
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:46,680
That's solid. By the way, the thing about... I like about the comic vibrations with numbers for

179
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:52,040
letters. This link is to the storyboards. These are probably available, so it's no big...

180
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,600
Yeah, the thing I like about the drawing of comics, and it is kind of like a storyboard

181
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,000
for animation a lot of the time, where you can imply a lot of movement by just having the same

182
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,200
thing shot like a few seconds after what it looks like. You're basically doing keyframes,

183
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,280
but really with no in-betweens whatsoever, and then that way you can convey so much more movement

184
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,880
than... Well, I mean, traditional illustration, just one image, it's always just felt like

185
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,160
there's not enough going on, because nothing can happen. It's a still moment in time. It's a photograph.

186
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,680
I mean, I wrote a piece on this before, but I actually had a website for Cusomega that got

187
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:41,240
taken down today because it exceeded its bandwidth limit from a fucking 3-note or whatever the...

188
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,680
They give you very low bandwidth limit. That or it was taken down because it had adult content on

189
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,920
it. I'm not sure which, because they didn't tell me anything, and it's just gone, so I might have

190
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,720
to build a whole new website, which is really annoying, because there's a lot of content on...

191
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,480
Like, I literally wrote a fucking massive thing that I only posted there and do not have backup of,

192
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,920
so let's hope I get that back. But in there, I was talking about how part of what inspired

193
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,640
all these comics and illustrations is that in the book, these two characters, Crom and Baila,

194
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,160
do not get really described in all that much detail. They're briefly touched on. Baila is not

195
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,680
described enough that you could even draw a picture of her. She didn't get any fan art.

196
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So I was thinking just, what is the maximum amount I can convey about these characters

197
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,360
with images in the span of a couple pages? And it's like, even just seeing the range of facial

198
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,880
expressions that a character would make, even just seeing three of them tells you so much about

199
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,680
the character, just because it's like, you only would imagine them making so many faces.

200
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:54,600
So in this comic, Baila's got the really intense... She's having a ton of fun casting magic,

201
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,040
almost like sadistic in the first page, and then it's more relaxed on the second page,

202
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,040
whereas her dad mostly looks kind of serious. And in the book, he never jokes about anything,

203
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,000
but because I have a comic, I can do a thought bubble on him and give him kind of a snarky thing

204
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
to say. And the last face is like, this really expressive anime face really only makes sense

205
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,800
visually. I don't know how I would describe it in text. So it's like... I know that face well.

206
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,360
Just being able to add that in and give you that mental image, going back to read the story,

207
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,680
will change your impression of the story. Now you have these anime characters in your mind,

208
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,920
and this range of expressions they're capable of. So when I describe the expressions that these

209
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:45,480
characters are showing, you are more likely to think about other anime you've seen with

210
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,480
characters who look kind of similar, and kind of just plug in those expressions. And I think

211
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:56,920
that's why light novels exist, basically. That's my theory. The theory is to make quick cash with

212
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:03,320
one good picture of an anime girl. Is there even any other medians where speech bubble or thought

213
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,400
bubbles can even be a thing that isn't weird? Anime does it, but it is weird. But they speak

214
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,240
sort of like in their head, because it's motion and it's movement. If somebody's thinking something,

215
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,720
the amount of time it takes for them to say the words that they're thinking is a lot longer than

216
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,840
it would actually take to think those thoughts. So it's like, it's a disconnect. Maybe this is

217
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,640
just because of the fact that I do this kind of analysis, and I'm always thinking about these

218
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,600
things. But what brings... I feel like I'm fucking trying to say, oh, I'm fucking, I just started

219
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,880
making comics, and they're already good. But the theory behind what I'm approaching these

220
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,560
comics with is, what can I do in comics that I couldn't do in writing, and couldn't do in these

221
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,080
other mediums? Because that's what excites me the most about the idea of making them is, oh,

222
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,440
this is a whole different angle. These are stories that... This story in text is not interesting

223
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,880
in any way, but as a visual guide to the characters, there's a fun snappiness to it.

224
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,640
It got me really excited, because after drawing all these comics, none of which I planned at all.

225
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:20,840
I did not write anything. I just started drawing and let it develop, and it was so much fun,

226
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,880
I couldn't stop. And now it's a problem, because...

227
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,840
You should just stop the whole YouTube thing. Be like a creator boy, like me and Ben. Make comics.

228
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm implying that YouTube is not creation in any way. I mean, okay, for many people it's not, but

229
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,400
okay. It's literally the dumbest thing you could ever do.

230
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,440
That's not true. Frank Yang is an artist who makes weird fitness slash art piece videos that are

231
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,240
about the perfect sprinter, Tom Cruise, how I will obtain. It's Andrew Yang's younger, more

232
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:00,440
muscly brother. Definitely, yeah. By the way, I just let me just say, fuck comics, all trash,

233
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,640
put them into the garbage, and thank God that on today's episode we have an announcement of

234
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,600
a happy time from a guy who has abandoned comics for all time and become an exclusive video man,

235
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,560
one Munchyshatsky, who has destroyed Investigator and is releasing today, the day we are recording

236
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,360
this, three new episodes of Stealing Your Dad have just dropped. I can't believe it. They're all

237
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,000
out right now. No, they're not. Oh, you're right, you're right. They are at the time of you listening

238
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,840
to this, but they are coming out every three hours over the course of the whole day. Episode

239
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:40,280
one is out though. Are they on his channel? Yes, they're on Munchy on his channel. So I just

240
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,000
linked his channel, we'll put it in the show notes there. To clarify, because nobody actually has any

241
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,360
idea what Stealing Your Dad's is. I was on it and I still don't. Let me explain. So Stealing

242
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,520
Your Dad's is originally a podcast that me and Munchy were doing in which we review fast food

243
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,120
by both of us going and getting the same fast food, because obviously fast food exists all around

244
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,280
the country. We would buy the same fast food and then record a podcast of us eating and reviewing

245
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,440
it. But also, because we were describing the setting of the world that we were in,

246
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:21,720
which is extremely, we would say it's basically the prototype of the world in

247
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Ratty Fockers' Comkillers. Yeah, endless war. There is fear eyes that they're located in the same

248
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:36,440
along the same time. They are similar enough, fallout-esque super apocalypses that they can

249
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,280
feasibly exist in the same universe. They're both highly fast food-based. Yeah. The thing about

250
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,080
the show, though, is that for the most part, it was highly experimental. The audio quality is

251
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:57,560
not good. It is experimental audio quality. The experiment is, what if I turned it down?

252
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,120
What if I made it worse? So most of these only have a couple hundred views. I don't know that

253
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,560
there was any expectation from any audience that this would continue or that they wanted it in

254
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,520
any way. Well, clearly there was a small but dedicated audience. Well, because the thing is that

255
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,360
the three that we recorded at Radcon were videos, live-action videos, which were meant to be fully

256
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:28,600
edited by Ethan, I think, who also edited the Spicy Bro Pack video, which there's also a Spicy Bro

257
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,000
Packed from Radcon 3 that also has still not come out. But the one from Radcon 2 took a whole year,

258
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,040
so that's not a surprise. But yeah, these three have just been waiting in Limbo for the last

259
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,920
fucking literally nearly two years since we fucking did it. That's right. Is that how long it's

260
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,160
been? Wait, when did we do Radcon 3? Yeah, it took T-Bap Resurrection one full year to get done,

261
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,680
and it's been over a year since that. Oh my god. I was going to say these were the last Radcontent,

262
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,880
but no, I guess that Spicy Bro Packed is still... Oh wait, technically it was in March, so it's

263
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,600
technically been just under two years. That's the time for me. Yeah, sure. Which by the way,

264
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,400
the original Spicy Bro Packed video was like one of my favorite videos. It was fucking just

265
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,680
legendary. It was sick. And so that's why I've been nauseating. That's the reason like my excitement

266
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:20,120
over stealing your dad's has... I mean, I'm looking at people have screencapped some incredible

267
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,080
moments from the first episode in my Discord. Yeah, I'll go ahead and I'm going to have the...

268
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,440
Yeah, I haven't watched any of them, obviously. They just came out like minutes ago.

269
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,040
You know, we need to call this episode. We need to call this episode We Did It.

270
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:40,680
Munchie did it. Gib did it. Ben did it. Did you. Nate did it. The Radcon's a huge success. We did

271
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,560
it. They're on Munchie's channel, right? Yeah, they are. They're all there. Okay. Ew, gross.

272
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,280
Why is that happening? How unfortunate.

273
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,280
Let me bathe you in my meal. That might have to be my new avatar on Twitter or something.

274
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,480
That's pretty good. Ew, it's so gross. Oh, I don't like that at all. It's a Wendy's ice cream.

275
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,120
It's in Gross Disgusting. Gross Disgusting is right.

276
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,520
We did it. So true. So true. Click the link, everybody. God, I'm so glad those videos are

277
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:25,320
out. We did it. There it is. They did it. We did nothing. No. We were in the vicinity.

278
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,600
We were on the right side of history. Oh, they're from here. You know, the only issue I have,

279
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,520
or the one thing I'm concerned about with Radcon, not really, but I just want to,

280
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,520
we've got a bunch of stuff we've got to do. I want to leave those precious spaces in

281
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,240
between things to do whatever the fuck we feel like, you know? So maybe we can just

282
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,600
smash everything out really fast and then just do whatever we want for like the last bit of time.

283
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:54,040
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. And then I saw on Twitter the thing, I saw one individual whose name I forget

284
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,560
say the thing that gets tossed around here and there. And this guy is just like,

285
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:04,520
y'all nibbaz really paid these guys $20,000 to go on vacation, which is hilarious, which is a

286
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:11,960
hilarious thing to say. And entirely true. 100% true. That's definitely a major component of the

287
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:20,920
story. But hey, voluntary exchanges of currency for products and services. Good stuff. Good stuff.

288
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,240
Very excited. We've got like three weeks until we're out there doing shit. When you hear this,

289
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,760
it'll be like two weeks. So incredible. What a world. By the way, this is episode 199.

290
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,640
Next episode is 200. That's right. So I don't know what that means, but it means.

291
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:46,200
Oh yeah. Shall we talk about our plan to like do episode 200 at Redcon 4 regardless and just

292
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,240
skip. Just skip it. Skip it. Skip it for the meantime. Just do it. Well, when we're there.

293
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,520
We could, we could, we could role play for the next two episodes from the post-apocalypse

294
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,000
episode. Like it's a flash forward in the narrative. The post-apocalypse with the word,

295
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,640
with the number 200 doesn't exist. And we have to skip to 201 instead. We have to find it.

296
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,360
We're recording them from the future after like, oh, okay, just here's a thought. We record next

297
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,680
episode, episode 201. It's us. Maybe I shouldn't even say it, but it's us responding to the reaction

298
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:23,080
to Radcon 3 from the future narratively and the cataclysmic failure that it was and how everything

299
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,040
went wrong and we lost all the money, you know, et cetera, et cetera. It was all embezzled by,

300
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,240
was that company that stole all of Hussie's money when he was trying to make that game?

301
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,960
We partnered with them. The King's Crab, Darling House. No, the, the, the, the, the something

302
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,360
gentleman. The odd gentleman. The odd gentleman. Yeah, we partnered with them for distribution

303
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,440
and that turned out to be a bad idea. But you know, we were rolling with the punches.

304
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,640
We got to ask Daddy Mike Bloomberg for some more funding. We got, we got to go dip back into that

305
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:56,440
well. You know, speaking of corporate investment, I, I was looking at a couple of the, after our

306
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,320
stunning success with the Garling House Industries people, we still don't have our channel back,

307
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,000
by the way. That's pretty cool. Hopefully that'll be fixed soon. They seem to be really nice. It'd

308
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,080
be really nice if we had it back, which it seems, well, YouTube said they were on the cusp, but

309
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,560
YouTube said we were on the cusp of getting it back. They seem to be preparing to give it back

310
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,440
to us. They're just edging. They're edging us for sure. It would be really nice if we could have

311
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,480
it back by the time that the Kickstarter ends, because we're going to do that, like on the day

312
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,120
it ends, we're going to like stream for a few hours beforehand, like count down the hours,

313
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,920
probably like shout out like big doughnose and stuff. Let me just say for fun that like the,

314
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,880
the last message of substance I got on like the PCPA account was them saying like, hey,

315
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,800
hey bro, like we're working on your thing. We are going to move your account to like a new brand

316
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,560
account. So like they seem to have identified the problem. They're like, make a new brand

317
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,880
account, which is just like a new type of YouTube channel. We will like move the PCP onto the account,

318
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,880
give us the link, bro. I'm like instantly, okay, provide them the link. And then I'm also like,

319
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,760
Hey, also, should I make more for like the other channels? They have that. And they just have not

320
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,240
fixed the problem. And it's been like four days. I don't know why, maybe because the weekend is

321
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:18,440
happening now. But they have everything they need to restore the channel and seem to be waiting

322
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:26,120
and willing to do so instantly. They just have not let alone. This makes me really,

323
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:32,440
this makes me really depressed about the potential about the future of the other channels like the

324
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:39,320
PODcast and TBAP and a little bit. Yeah, like the fact that they are so lazy about it. Like,

325
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,880
I mean, I guess TBAP and PODcast have like, I mean, best guy ever is obviously the biggest channel.

326
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,600
The other ones are all like that. How many how many subs did the PODcast have?

327
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,720
Like 5,000 to 5,000, 6,000 something like that. So not a high priority thing.

328
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:02,040
In theory, I think the PCP should be next and then TBAP's got like 13k. So that should be that

329
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:08,280
should be next, right? Yeah, I'm glad that to my knowledge, nobody's been like uploading

330
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,480
shit or fucking around with that one other than changing the description to some weird

331
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,040
cryptic Russian shit. I would feel so violated if the stuff that was going on on these other

332
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,880
channels were happening on TBAP. I would be I would feel I would be sick. Well, now's a great

333
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:28,280
time to mention what is happening right now on CanTent, which is legitimately fascinating.

334
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,800
As Digi pointed out on Twitter, and I had also noticed that on CanTent right now,

335
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,920
let me I'll link you guys to the channel down below, we do not have control. The last two,

336
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:45,080
no, I think three videos now, what they are, are re-edits of me and Digi's old

337
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:52,040
Eremaga Sensei podcast. That's correct, Gib. They have specifically re-edited the full content

338
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,640
and made new thumbnails and new titles for them. We have never given them. Someone's working on

339
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:04,120
this shit. What's crazy is they're doing a good job. It's not a bad job. Yeah, better than us.

340
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,680
They took the episodes. I think what they did is they downloaded the ones that are on After Dark

341
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:17,240
because they're uploaded as individual episodes with the images. They used the same images that

342
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,360
were in the After Dark uploads, but then they add an episode one big splash on it. And then the

343
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,840
thumbnails, they cut together three different screen caps from the episode, it seems like,

344
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,120
and bleed them together. Which is your style of editing on CanTent now. It looks like shit the

345
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,880
way they do it, but it also is good. I look at it and I go, that looks like shit, but I bet

346
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,120
everybody would click on that. It's like a missing connection. I would never do, but I'm aware that

347
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,200
people who watch the video won't give a shit and will click on it anyway. They're doing a better

348
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,160
job because they're more cutthroat. The titles and descriptions and everything are like,

349
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:59,240
they use the actual titles of the episodes, which what they're probably trying to do,

350
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:06,440
and this might work, is so one of the problems we've had on the PCP channel and on DigiBro is

351
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,800
the Ghibli cast has a shit ton of views, but it's because somebody has taken them and plugged them

352
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,680
in on some like watch cartoon online website as the movies because they're about the same length.

353
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,680
They have the titles of the movie and the date, the year, which I think is really what makes them

354
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:31,880
think it's real. All of them have like 60% dislikes and just tons of angry comments that it's not

355
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:39,560
the movie, which is annoying and probably not good, healthy for the video, but I wonder if that's

356
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,720
what they're going for, which also happened to Rixity Minutes. Every episode had the same problem.

357
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,120
It's too bad. That's too bad. I'm really excited guys because let me see. Tonight at 7 p.m. I'm

358
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,600
really excited because Aramunga Sensei Anime Discussed Season 1 Episode 4 premieres on the

359
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,000
content channel. I'm really excited to watch that and see what these guys have to say.

360
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,800
By the way, these all have like hundreds of views. What are they doing in the video edit wise?

361
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,400
Are they just like cutting bits or moving things around? They just loop a gif over the video mostly

362
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,160
and just let our audio play. Looking at the first episode, it's just the exact same one image that

363
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,520
I had. Oh wait, Episode 2? Yeah, they do loop a gif the whole time. That's even more advanced.

364
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,280
What the fuck? Is it? This is advanced. I like how it works.

365
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,040
They literally improved it. I know.

366
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,320
On whatever black market, as what I was thinking, the black market of YouTube sites, we could just

367
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,080
buy free subs, you can buy YouTube channels from Russian hackers. Somebody who knows,

368
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,840
who Canton or Digibro or Nate is, was on this site and would be like, what,

369
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:57,000
Canton? Yeah, I'll buy it. And they know a little bit about something.

370
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,480
Did you mention the original title that it was premiered with?

371
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:07,800
Whoa. When the first re-upload went up and premiered, it was called He-He-It's-Dakanton, right?

372
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,880
Oh, okay. Well, that's because that's the default title on the channel, so that's not...

373
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,440
That's like a... They just haven't fixed it yet.

374
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,480
That makes a little more sense and it's slightly less creepy.

375
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,840
It's weird. I don't know why would anyone use a channel? I guess they just hope for...

376
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,240
I mean, this channel has been moved to some thieves' Google account,

377
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,800
and they are now earning all the ad revenue generated by all videos on the channel.

378
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,520
I just wonder if there's some troll who knows what they have.

379
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,240
Someone knows something about how this works.

380
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,840
Well, whether it just so happens to be someone who knows a little bit about anime YouTube videos

381
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,560
enough to edit and re-upload the same thing.

382
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,560
If they know about anime YouTube videos, they must know who Digibro is.

383
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,800
Very likely. It's all very curious and I don't understand.

384
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,640
I got to say, my favorite thing about this is that the thumbnails themselves,

385
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,040
they made thumbnails, they added more images.

386
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,760
I got to say, they're doing a good job with the thumbnails.

387
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,320
They are shitty, but they're clickable shitty.

388
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,560
Shout out to Brad Garlinghouse.

389
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,000
A cutthroat businessman. I've got a lot to learn.

390
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,600
I'm learning a lot here.

391
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,920
Here's what I want to know, because again, these videos, these re-uploads,

392
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,160
are getting pretty good views.

393
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,280
For our channel, not bad.

394
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,960
Probably a lot of its curiosity clicks just like, what the fuck?

395
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,040
Maybe some people sincerely haven't listened to it and are listening to it for the first time.

396
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,480
I want to know what the sub count looks like, because they hide that shit when they take over

397
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:41,960
your channel.

398
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,360
Yeah, we might be gaining from them sometimes.

399
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,840
It would be so fucking funny.

400
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,440
That would be fascinating.

401
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,720
This is a new channel with you and me, so there's definitely growing going on in general.

402
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,800
But I mean, the upload rate is basically every half a day.

403
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,160
They're posting another episode.

404
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,240
It is our content.

405
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,320
It's good content.

406
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,400
They're marketing it well.

407
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,360
I just don't know if this would even cost us any subscribers.

408
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,400
The only thing it's costing us right now, if we never get the channel back, that's bad.

409
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,080
If we get it back even now, we'll have lost some ad revenue.

410
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,200
But we gained some subs.

411
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,840
I mean, hey, I'll call that one a wash, I guess, a month of ad revenue loss.

412
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,720
I mean, we weren't posting videos on the channel, so if any...

413
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,600
I mean, we were going to post the Pat LeBour, Pat Labor video on there.

414
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,880
I'm saying we can't post anything there right now.

415
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,560
So at least they're posting for us.

416
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,200
Oh, so they're helping.

417
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,000
Right, right.

418
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,760
They're keeping the algorithm happy.

419
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,760
My favorite thing is that they've kept the can-tent logo,

420
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,040
like editing scheme for thumbnails that we were doing, the KH.

421
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,640
But because no one except you and I has access to the can-tent logo without the background,

422
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,760
they've shittily cropped out the edges from our channel logo and slapped.

423
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,800
You can see that a lower editing skill level is making these,

424
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,760
but this is absolutely fascinating what's going on in this channel.

425
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,920
Please give it back, though, YouTube.

426
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,720
I'm dying here.

427
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,680
We just only got the channel up and running and actually making some money and then this shit.

428
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,160
We are up to $20,182 on the Kickstarter.

429
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,680
It just keeps going.

430
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,280
It just keeps charging along.

431
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,040
44 hours to go.

432
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,400
We did it.

433
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,480
Yeah.

434
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,600
That's the meme this episode.

435
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,240
We're doing it.

436
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,000
At this very moment.

437
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,600
Man, Wrecked Hunt 4 is going to be so fucking cool.

438
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,640
It's going to be a great time.

439
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,160
It's going to be so lit.

440
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,720
Holy shit.

441
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:35,800
Oh, lit.

442
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,680
I'm excited.

443
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,640
It's going to be the shit.

444
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,320
I got the fucking anime wig in the mail the other day.

445
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,200
Oh, you did?

446
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,840
Do you want to tell us what any details?

447
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,880
Because I'm fascinated.

448
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,680
I'm going to save mine for the video when it comes out, I think,

449
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,880
but I'm curious about everybody else.

450
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,440
All right, it's just a long black girl hair wig for cosplay and you just put it on.

451
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,040
But it made, it was like, huh, this is sort of, this is sort of punk like,

452
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,000
you know, I could almost pass myself off as punk.

453
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,520
So I was thinking of buying clothes.

454
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,640
Kind of like in Radcon, The Road to Radcon 3 Chapter 3.

455
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,840
You know what I'm saying?

456
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,240
You know what I'm saying?

457
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,480
Yeah.

458
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,840
And I was looking at myself in the mirror with this fucking punk wig on my head.

459
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,160
And I was like, hmm, this feels right.

460
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,760
I have a very masculine jawline.

461
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,960
I've just realized.

462
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,520
You do.

463
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,160
That's true.

464
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,000
In my, in my head, like putting on a wig would make me look like a girl.

465
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,040
And then that would be that.

466
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,800
And I would look like a girl on the screen.

467
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,560
It's me, the anime girl.

468
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,760
Yeah.

469
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,840
But instead I looked like a 70s rocker.

470
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,160
And I was like, oh, well, that's still cool, I suppose.

471
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,440
And it's on special way.

472
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,040
So you guys, have you all listened to The Road to Radcon 4?

473
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,000
I have listened, yes.

474
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,840
I have not gotten around to listening to any of The Road to Radcon.

475
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,560
I'm sorry.

476
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,600
Go men aside.

477
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, I just haven't finished it yet.

478
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,080
I want to know everybody's perspective on how you feel about your portrayal in the story.

479
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,880
Oh, great.

480
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,080
Yeah, let's talk about that.

481
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,360
All right.

482
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,160
I love ripped jacked punk.

483
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,040
I hope so.

484
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,000
Ripped, ripped jacked punk.

485
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,640
Oh, ripped jacked punk is so, I mean, as soon as I saw the thumbnail, I was like, oh.

486
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,480
Oh, no, what is this?

487
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,360
And it just got, it was cropped at like the abs.

488
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,120
When you click on the video, you can see the abs.

489
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,480
And they're just like, it's like a fucking accordion.

490
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,440
Well, it says she still has the stick legs of normal punk.

491
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,160
But yes, they just connect straight to the abs.

492
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,400
So, or he, I should say, because it's you.

493
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,760
You are jacked punk.

494
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,880
I am jacked punk with J-Pump tits.

495
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Yes.

496
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,280
The little bit of boob popping out below the shirt is by a.

497
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,640
They got under boob.

498
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,760
Yeah, under boob.

499
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,440
There is massive under boob going on.

500
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,840
Are those two pumpkins in there?

501
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,040
That's gotta be what's going on.

502
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,760
That's hilarious.

503
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,680
Two, three, three more.

504
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,400
I think jacked pump and also the even more so possibly the

505
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,720
illustration of Ben in episode two are my two favorite things

506
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,240
I've ever drawn in my whole life.

507
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,800
Oh, yeah.

508
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,720
I would put them both on t-shirts.

509
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,440
Absolutely.

510
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,400
I want people to draw a fan art of jacked punk.

511
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,960
I think that like, I mean, punk is a very easy to draw sort of face.

512
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,160
So it sort of works well.

513
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh, you know what I'm saying already.

514
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,120
I'm very upset about my portrayal in this image.

515
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,600
You are vaping from the exhaust pipe of the of the Gravedigger monster truck.

516
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,440
I thought it was like, yeah, hooked up a hose to the to the tail.

517
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,960
You reside at the bottom of a basically the Goron city from Ocarina of Time,

518
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,840
except that it's full of antifa and smoke from your vape.

519
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,960
And that's basically cop kill town is what you describe.

520
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,360
Regarding my portrayal in the second part of chapter two,

522
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,080
to me, now I hate that I don't mean to overstate the case,

523
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,200
but I really feel like you were like, I did all the work with Ben.

524
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,680
Let's just get this Nate part done and move on to.

525
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,560
Well, have you heard part three yet?

526
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,080
I did not finish part three yet.

527
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,720
When you get to parts three and four, you'll truly appreciate what I have done with you.

528
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:38,040
Because the joke is that you are a shockingly accurate portrayal of you.

529
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,920
All the commenters agree that my Nate is spot on,

530
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,640
because everybody else is over the top and ridiculous.

531
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,160
I was crying for personality.

532
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,960
I'm like, I'm so boring in this, but if that is the joke.

533
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,720
The joke is that nothing has changed about you.

534
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,080
You are exactly the same.

535
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:00,280
And you are so predictable that I can write you to a level of accuracy that is

536
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,320
makes it feel weird even for me.

537
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,480
Did she knows you better than you know yourself?

538
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,920
But yeah, you're kind of like the main character,

539
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,520
because Brad fucked you over.

540
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,760
So you get a lot of dialogue in parts three and four.

541
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,600
Well, shit, I gotta get to it.

542
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,480
There's a lot of Ben and Nate back and forth banter, especially in chapter four.

543
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:28,520
I really tried to capture the feel of the PCP anytime there's a conversation.

544
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,320
I wanted it to feel like you are listening to an episode.

545
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,640
Yeah, I can get that a lot.

546
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,720
Never mind, I'm not listening to this.

547
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,360
I mean, I'll just read the record.

548
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,320
I loved the description.

549
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,320
I mean, your start at the beginning, Digi, of being a broken,

550
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,480
basically like a hollow from Undertale.

551
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,280
From doing too much.

552
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,320
Just being a waste rule of a man,

553
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,600
but some precious passerby just bringing the essence of life,

554
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,560
that piss that went straight into your mouth and revived you from the grave.

555
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,640
Munchy's piss is what literally I've been living on for God knows how long.

556
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,240
Munchy's piss and crack, which in chapter four,

557
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,840
you will learn the truth about the crack,

558
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,080
the true nature of Digi Bro's crack addiction, and what it really is.

559
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,640
I see.

560
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,600
I'm looking forward to it.

561
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:16,840
What could it mean?

562
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,800
Now we've got all the five parts, the whole thing, it's all funded.

563
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,080
Yeah, five is funded, so I gotta make the epic finale.

564
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,920
It's gonna have to be, I mean, these are part five,

565
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,240
I don't have to rush it because it's already done.

566
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,360
So like, it's not advertising the Kickstarter anymore,

567
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,000
but it'll probably be a lot longer.

568
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,680
I was so sure we would not hit 20k.

569
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,600
Yeah, let's talk about that for a second.

570
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,880
I was positive it was like a complete pie in the sky.

571
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,040
Like, this is a promise that will never have to be.

572
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,840
We thought 10k might have been unreachable at the very beginning.

573
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,680
I was pretty confident we had 10k.

574
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,600
But like, once the really good start happened, and then it sort of slowed down,

575
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,360
there was a lot of talk of like, at this rate, at this rate,

576
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,920
we're not gonna get to 20k or anything like that.

577
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,000
And I was like, yeah, but there's always a bump.

578
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,760
There's always a bump near the end.

579
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,520
There is always a bump, but it's not always-

580
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,920
There's always people, there's definitely people

581
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,400
who are like holding off on getting a paycheck.

582
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,080
It's not like doom and gloom just because it's at a certain rate,

583
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,320
because the rate changes every day.

584
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,440
I've heard tales around that there is at least one person

585
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,160
who I believe is planning to donate $1,000 to this day.

586
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,560
I don't know that for sure, but that's what I heard, Taylor.

587
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,440
That would be crazy.

588
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,520
Listener, that could be you.

589
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,800
It could be all of you.

590
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,080
It could be you every day.

591
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,680
You can do that any time you want.

592
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,240
You don't have to wait for a paycheck later.

593
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:41,960
That's true.

594
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,360
Just go to $70,000, please.

595
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:50,520
I mean, this is in the past now, so we won't know the final total that they will.

596
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,560
Well, that's true, that's true.

597
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,640
After the tragedy of having one more thousand boys

598
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,720
drop down- It's never too late to send us money.

599
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,600
Somebody actually has one time sent me $1,000.

600
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,520
That has happened before, so that was pretty sick.

601
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,240
That's pretty sick.

602
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,440
Disgusting.

603
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,560
The clothes, I mean-

604
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,480
It's disgusting because it happened to you and not me.

605
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,520
Exactly.

606
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,320
Arthur Mus gave me the Cintiq that he had liner,

607
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,960
which is probably valued at $1,000 plus.

608
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,840
It is, yeah.

609
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,480
Closest enough.

610
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,120
That's sick.

611
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,920
That's great.

612
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,280
$800 something.

613
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,760
Let me just review real quick.

614
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,440
All the things that's going to come to you.

615
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,360
So people have pledged, you get pins.

616
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,880
I mean, I know I've said it a million times,

617
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,560
I've got my Rad Country pin.

618
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,560
The pin brings me probably more joy,

619
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,640
like my shirts are in the closet.

620
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,280
I wear them all the time, sporadically, they give me joy.

621
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,120
Every day I sit down at my computer,

622
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,200
I look over in my purple and blue

623
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,360
Rad Country pin on the starry background,

624
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,960
and it just makes me happy.

625
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,360
It sparks joy is what it does.

626
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,800
I don't know if everybody else feels the same way,

627
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,600
but it does for me.

628
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,920
I have no purpose for pins,

629
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,040
so I don't know where to be tomorrow.

630
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,840
Well, in this case,

631
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,120
I kind of just have a little spot

632
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,000
on my printer to my right,

633
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,680
where I have my Puba pin,

634
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,560
my Rad Country pin,

635
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,560
and my little Slime Corp logo pins.

636
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,000
It's just my pin spot, I guess.

637
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,760
There's not on anything.

638
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,600
Michelle is hers on her bag or whatever.

639
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,800
But I'm not losing these,

640
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,280
I just want them to be there and make me happy.

641
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,200
But I mean, I've got walls here.

642
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,240
You're going to get a poster

643
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,160
if you pledge to a certain degree.

644
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,760
I'm going to slap down on my wall as well.

645
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,360
That will also spark joy.

646
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,880
And you know what, I'm just thinking now

647
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,200
about the fan arch that we're likely to get

648
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,720
from this OVA at some point.

649
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,240
It's going to be nuts.

650
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:21,800
Oh, hell yeah.

651
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,360
Like, remember Nexus's amazing art of us

652
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,240
like during the...

653
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,600
Yes, yes.

654
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,280
That was the fucking sickest shit,

655
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,360
and there will likely be more.

656
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,400
Holy shit, I can't wait.

657
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,440
I mean, what do we got?

658
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,760
We got all the lectures are coming.

659
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,760
We've got the fucking shirts and the PTA.

660
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,600
The rumble is happening.

661
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,280
The Tiki Bar, the OVA,

662
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,200
which we're packing so many fucking ideas in this OVA.

663
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,920
Have we explained what the idea for the Tiki Bar is?

664
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,320
We have explained.

665
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,360
Well, we definitely did in the Kickstarter video.

666
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,680
If you want to restate it, feel free.

667
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,040
It's just going to have drinks.

668
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,080
The general idea is like certain streams that we do

669
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,160
will be controlled by the PTA members, I think,

670
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,120
just them or just people in the chat.

671
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:06,920
Well, we can give the PTA...

672
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,240
You get people to drink on stream for various reasons.

673
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,080
My thought is that we can give the PTA

674
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,040
amount of control, but it should be open to the public.

675
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,280
And anyone at any time in the YouTube chat or whatever

676
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,640
will be able to...

677
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,600
If you donate...

678
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,800
There will be a menu.

679
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,320
Probably put a menu on screen.

680
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,080
If you donate an amount for a drink

681
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,280
and specify who has to drink, you can buy drinks for us

682
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,640
and force us to drink.

683
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,800
And I think that probably there should be some...

684
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,400
If someone's like, I can't drink anymore,

685
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,960
I'm going to die or I'm going to throw up or I'm too drunk,

686
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,480
you can tap out.

687
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,120
But maybe there'll be some kind of like penalty

688
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:44,840
associated with it.

689
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,040
I think that'd be funny.

690
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,560
Okay, I don't know what that would be exactly.

691
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,600
I don't know how legal that is, but...

692
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,920
Well, we're all...

693
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,680
Well, I mean, you can't make munchy drink.

694
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:53,880
Well, you also...

695
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,080
I don't know if you can legally pay someone to drink.

696
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,680
Like, can you...

697
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,920
I mean, you're buying the drink?

698
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,560
I don't know.

699
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,240
Well, if you have the option to...

700
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,960
If you have the option...

701
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,520
That's what I'm saying.

702
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,080
It's like...

703
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,760
If you have the option to say no.

704
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,080
You have the option to say no and then we kick your ass.

705
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:09,480
I don't know.

706
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,680
Or we throw you into the sea.

707
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,600
Just kick my ass right now.

708
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,320
I'm going to destroy that.

709
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,120
Yeah.

710
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,520
Oh, of course, it's the calendar, the Brad lecture.

711
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:21,000
Brad's going to be the diss track that we will have to start working on imminently.

712
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,280
And then the music video that we will produce.

713
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,080
I mean, we got to get the song out, I guess, before Radcon,

714
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,880
so that we can make the music video at Radcon.

715
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,480
And so we'll be working on that.

716
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,880
And the fucking light novel, funded, physical release,

717
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,200
coming to all 100 and plus backers.

718
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,880
So I hope that you made it in time.

719
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,240
That's going to be that.

720
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,560
Maybe we'll fucking sell copies after separately or something.

721
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,640
If people want them.

722
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,360
If they want them.

723
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,800
We could easily just sell it like through Amazon.

724
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,320
Like the Amazon printing service or whatever it is that you ever requested.

725
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:53,960
Yeah, god.

726
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:00,920
I really love internet creators with physical products that they're selling.

727
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,920
Not like t-shirts and stuff, but like, you know, comics, books.

728
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,520
It's fucking sick, dude.

729
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,480
Things that you could put on your bookshelf and say that came from an internet guy

730
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,720
that would otherwise not exist because it's hard to get published.

731
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,200
It makes it feel real so that mom and dad can finally get it after all.

732
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,520
I definitely want to get the Digi's light novel

733
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,800
and the Rotoradcon novel when I have those for real.

734
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,840
I have no idea what the Rotoradcon is going to look like,

735
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,920
because it's not long.

736
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,120
So I don't know if it's going to be like a pamphlet or...

737
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:35,960
It'll be a little thing.

738
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,840
It's short and sweet.

739
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,400
Like Common Sense by Thomas Paine.

740
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,120
We will secede from the union and become our own nation at Rotoradcon for Paradise.

741
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,720
It's just a bad time.

742
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,200
All right.

743
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,920
Did we say, was there like an agreement that Tom would do like the artwork if...

744
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:51,960
For what?

745
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,720
He did say he would do that, yeah.

746
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,120
Yeah, so you'll have to draw Jacked Punk.

747
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,240
That's really funny.

748
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:57,480
Yes.

749
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,400
I mean, I don't know if he's, it's exclusively going to redo the art that I've done

750
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,920
or do original art for it.

751
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,720
I have no idea.

752
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,320
We probably need some more art.

753
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:07,800
I don't know.

754
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,680
I don't know how it's going to work.

755
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:09,720
Whatever.

756
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,680
We can figure it out.

757
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,200
We got, we got options here.

758
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,680
And we've got money to do things with to make it nice.

759
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,880
Oh my God.

760
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,600
Imagine that.

761
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,880
Oh, by the way, we're at $20,294.

762
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,080
It went up again.

763
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,720
Oh my God.

764
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,680
It went up again.

765
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,840
This is like the, this is like the, the, the, remember the first time we recorded the podcast

766
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,720
after we launched the kicks.

767
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,760
Oh yeah, that's right.

768
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,840
During the stream, we were like, oh, we're up another 100.

769
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,120
Oh, we're up another 200.

770
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,800
Holy shit.

771
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,920
By the way, we are, we are, we might pass.

772
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,080
I was worried because for a while, like even though we exceeded the amount raised in the first one,

773
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,600
the number of backers was actually trailing behind the first one.

774
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,720
We had fewer for a while, but now we're catching up.

775
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,880
We had 308 the first time now.

776
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,360
That's right.

777
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,640
We're up to 291, do 292.

778
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,520
So yeah, we might end up with at least as many backers.

779
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,880
It would make me very happy to break the number of backers, just to feel like,

780
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,920
hooray, our audience has grown, even though like we are charging more.

781
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,880
I really think, yeah, the fact that we made it with literally like less backers,

782
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,240
more than twice as much money.

783
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,000
It must mean that people really liked Radcon 3.

784
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,520
Like, it was such a triumph.

785
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,320
We did everything we promised and they were all pretty great.

786
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,480
I mean, it's kind of like, it's hard to understand when it's, when it actually happens,

787
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,120
because like you do the Radcon and none of the videos get more than 5000 views.

788
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:33,720
And they, you know, some of them take an eternity to come out and the response is like,

789
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,880
it's a positive response.

790
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,840
But when you just see like, you know, one day worth of comments and they're just kind of like,

791
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,880
good job guys.

792
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,600
It's just like, all right, well, there it is.

793
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:50,440
The Radcon 3, the arena video that I slaved over with all the different GoPro footage things.

794
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,360
And like, we go around shooting each other.

795
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,200
It was really fun, really cool.

796
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,160
It's an amazing video.

797
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,560
Legitimately.

798
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,240
It didn't get much of a response though.

799
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,000
It's just sort of like, yeah, cool.

800
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,640
Oh, yeah.

801
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,120
It's like, yeah.

802
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,320
I mean, look at them, like we've got a few thousand views, like, all right.

803
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,600
The numbers don't lie when it comes to the Kickstarter.

804
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,800
You know, clearly those few people were into it.

805
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,560
You know what's interesting?

806
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,120
Like during this Kickstarter, I also noticed, maybe you guys know this as well,

807
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,520
that like another Kickstarter launched during this time.

808
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,520
The Matthew Matosis just made a video about, which is the Wonderful 101.

809
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,400
And that's already, I think it's shot past, but at a $1.5 million already.

810
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,960
And they were looking for like 90,000 to just make it happen or like 100,000 or something.

811
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,000
But then they had all these crazy tiers above that, some of which were like,

812
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,360
if they got like 2 million, then Hideki Kamiya will clear his block list on Twitter.

813
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:45,640
And you know, like, by the way, the lower tier was like, if you pledge like $100,

814
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,120
whatever, he will block you on Twitter.

815
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,400
That's like one of the rewards.

816
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,400
So like they're working the memes, which I respect in a big way.

817
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,120
Yeah.

818
00:53:54,120 --> 00:54:00,200
But like that product, I think, has far more like, okay, they'll be making a game

819
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,840
that everyone can buy and everyone can play.

820
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,800
Whereas like with our thing, it's a different animal,

821
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,240
which I think just inherently has this like niche community.

822
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,240
Like people are high pledgers, are pledging to be like part of the experience

823
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,120
by being in the PTA to like shape and like the dark, the fucking dark PTA guys who are

824
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,040
going to help make like a fighter.

825
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,600
And then of course the thousand boys who are going to be in the Royal Rumble,

826
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,040
like personally or whatever.

827
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,520
That's a very different experience, I think, than just like, I don't know,

828
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,040
helping a game exist.

829
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,720
And sure you'll get a copy, but that you'd have to buy otherwise.

830
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:39,320
I think that there's two reasons that contributed to the high like average

831
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,080
pledge amount.

832
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:46,280
One, yes, people really loved Rad Country and like the people that were into it were

833
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,120
happy with the results and are looking for more of that.

834
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,720
Imagine your audience was just bigger with the same level of passion.

835
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,960
Ooh, that's a recipe for money right there.

836
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,320
Well, the other thing is that like.

837
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,000
It would require the PCP to be good at any time other than Rad Country.

838
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,800
Damn, you're right.

839
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,840
You're right about that.

840
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,680
The other thing I think is real is that like it's two years later.

841
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,760
Probably a lot of our audience has aged by two years and like probably a lot of them

842
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,880
that were like in college before are now like working.

843
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,720
Like a lot of the audience has probably grown by two years, aged up from like college

844
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,640
and entered the workforce or whatever.

845
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,560
Probably just a lot of them just have more money now.

846
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,480
Now that they have those precious Yang Bucks.

847
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,480
Now a lot of them probably have disposable income that didn't have it before.

848
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,080
That's an interesting thought.

849
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,280
Yeah.

850
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,520
Maybe some of them have just been saving with anticipation of Rad Country eventually.

851
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,440
I don't know if I would flatter myself to think that these people have been saving up for two years

852
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,800
for the specific purpose.

853
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,360
Well, we also think.

854
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:42,920
Fair enough.

855
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,320
Fair enough.

856
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,440
But they've probably been getting their shit in order at least to some of them.

857
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,560
Audience, I'm proud of you.

858
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,880
I'm proud of you that you've got your shit well enough in line to back Rad Country for.

859
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,640
Even proud a little bit of that guy at the beginning who pledged a thousand dollars

860
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,520
and had to drop down because he just like realized he was too much money.

861
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,200
You know, it's unfortunate that to us that looked like a dip.

862
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,240
But that's just life.

863
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:03,800
Good for you.

864
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,800
He provided a valuable service of getting people hype about it succeeding easily.

865
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,120
That's true.

866
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,320
That's true.

867
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,360
In a way, it helped because it was like seed money.

868
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,480
Now we're.

869
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,520
Some Kickstarter's will launch and then the creator will just like put like

870
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,720
a hundred or a thousand dollars into the project at the very beginning as like seed money.

871
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:28,760
And not to mention when he pulled that, we then got to play the victim card in a big way.

872
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,800
And it was wonderful.

873
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,000
I love it every time.

874
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,040
I didn't phrase the tweet to sound like too victimized.

875
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,240
But more like, oh, we've had a little setback, but we can.

876
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,360
But we're still going to make it.

877
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,880
And hey, look at this.

878
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,920
We fucking did.

879
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,280
Take a look at this.

880
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:43,480
Okay.

881
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,560
Take a look at what?

882
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,680
Are you linking something?

883
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:46,920
No.

884
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,240
Oh, it's just recording Resident Evil.

885
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,080
Well, that's how I feel.

886
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,840
We should do like a spooky mansion rad con one of these days, you know.

887
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:02,440
I think the next rad con should be we should do it next summer and it should be Christmas or like

888
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,520
snow themed in the summer.

889
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:10,360
Why do you think what do you think would be in like a new a Christmas themed?

890
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:16,440
I mean, I want to bring up again the idea I had for of us doing like a cabin.

891
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,280
Out in the mountains and rad conning from a cabin doable.

892
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,440
Also, let me just throw this at you, everybody.

893
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,680
We talked about this amount of money.

894
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,960
There is a 100% chance we could find a reasonably priced air and be and get tickets to somewhere

895
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,960
like, oh, I don't know, Tokyo, Japan and do one there.

896
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,760
That is possible.

897
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,720
That is 100% to go to the no question.

898
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,960
Like we have to consider now like we have to level up our understanding of what we're capable of.

899
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:50,120
Part of what why I thought we could reach 20k with this Kickstarter was that Ben's

900
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,720
Vapors 2 Kickstarter made so much money because Vapors 2 I think made more than twice what

901
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,080
Vapors 1 did as well, right?

902
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,720
Something like that.

903
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,720
When I had seen that and it was more than the it made more than rad con 3, right?

904
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,480
Yes, it did.

905
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,960
Redcon 3 made $9,000.

906
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,200
Redcon 2 made exactly $12,000.

907
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,480
So, yeah, like when I was looking at not pure not pure profit, by the way,

908
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,520
that's just the number.

909
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,520
When I was looking at how much the Vapors had made, I was like, well,

910
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,000
like Ben's making this much off of this like relatively obscure comic.

911
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:35,480
Part of it is a lot of it is the promotion and the stretch goals and the fact that you

912
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,280
created this like sort of meta narrative with the continuing stretch goals,

913
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,920
just like giving people something to do essentially.

914
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,800
And I was like, yeah, this kind of seems like representing like the full potential.

915
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:52,600
If Ben were to go all out on something like on a project,

916
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,720
what's the most money he could make on that?

917
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,640
And that felt like it represented that.

918
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,600
And so I looked at it and I said, okay, well, I know that my audience is way

919
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,720
the fuck bigger than Ben.

920
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,600
So like if I did something with this level of push,

921
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,520
it should be able to get even bigger numbers.

922
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,800
And like I never promoted Redcon 3 at all,

923
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:19,960
because I was just like lost in a whole other world while Redcon 3 was being planned.

924
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,000
But with this one, I was just like, as soon as I throw my hat in,

925
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,560
I know it will do something to bump this.

926
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,440
And since it already hit the goal right away in the first couple of days at first,

927
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,600
I was like, well, maybe I don't have to do anything.

928
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,120
And then I was like, well, like I looked over the numbers and I was like,

929
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,120
nobody wrote in, we get paid.

930
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,960
Nobody wrote that in.

931
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,920
How did that happen?

932
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,080
How did I not notice?

933
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,520
It was there for a bit.

934
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:49,880
And then we like with like anxiety of not getting that amount.

935
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,600
But we didn't want to ask for too much for the initial.

936
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,960
So we said, okay, what is completely necessary?

937
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,800
And we here's the dirty secret.

938
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:03,320
And the getting extra like paid for the time we were spending was like something we cut.

939
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,200
Here's the dirty secret that I would never have admitted until that had been funded.

940
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,800
And now you can't take your money back.

941
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,200
So you can't know that we made a bad business decision,

942
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,720
which was because we were so jazzed to it.

943
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,960
We committed our plane flights and the money to getting the Airbnb.

944
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,400
So if we hadn't done it, we would have been purely out of pocket.

945
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,080
So we had to make sure we hit that goal by any means necessary.

946
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,720
If they had launched the Kickstarter and it had made zero dollars,

947
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,760
we would be like three or like five grand in the hole.

948
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,320
Yeah.

949
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,600
It wasn't like a stupid.

950
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,960
That will never happen again.

951
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,160
I will never do that again.

952
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,160
It wasn't a stupid idea to buy the Airbnb early.

953
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,960
Because we were worried that, you know,

954
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,000
there's only so many Airbnbs that completely fit the criteria.

955
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,080
If we didn't put the money down, we would have lost it or not gotten it.

956
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,920
And then everything would have been ruined anyway.

957
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,160
So we had to get that first.

958
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,000
Not to fearmonger.

959
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:06,760
But like when we did RFCConK the last time, we had the B&B.

960
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,520
Munchy had the B&B all sorted out.

961
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,400
And then the guy just canceled like the day before.

962
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,360
Well, okay.

963
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,560
So I guess I sure hope that doesn't happen.

964
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,200
Surely you've got your money back at least, right?

965
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:20,760
Yeah.

966
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,000
Yeah.

967
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,920
But then we had 24 hours to scramble to find a new place.

968
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:25,880
You know what?

969
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,600
We'll roll with it.

970
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,400
We'll figure it out.

971
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,080
But I mean, we can't control for such a thing.

972
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,840
There's nothing we can do to prevent it.

973
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,080
This is like a business and they seem to know their shit.

974
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,200
So I'm pretty confident.

975
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,560
But nonetheless, nonetheless, always a fear to be...

976
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,280
Like, you see, that's the thing.

977
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,000
Terrifying.

978
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,280
But like the fact that we've now...

979
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,920
I mean, I'm much more worried about the fact that

980
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,120
what if the coronavirus airport,

981
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,520
yeah, what if they don't let given come into the country

982
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,680
by the time this happens?

983
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,880
They'll just scan me.

984
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,760
I'm not that worried about that.

985
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,000
They'll scan me like, are you gay?

986
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,880
No.

987
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,280
If he was coming from China, I'd be a little worried.

988
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,920
Are there any coronavirus reports from the UK?

989
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,720
There's...

990
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,040
Yeah, there's like one in all the countries.

991
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,880
There's eight confirmed cases.

992
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,960
No one's serious.

993
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,440
I was probably higher than that by now.

994
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,640
It's the last time I checked.

995
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,400
I know China is a big place,

996
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,720
but I know that Econ was planning to go to China.

997
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,000
Is that happen or...

998
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,320
That has not happened yet and I don't think it will.

999
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,440
Unless they open the country back up by then.

1000
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,880
I was gonna say, isn't half of China in quarantine mode?

1001
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,800
Yes, most of it is locked down

1002
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,320
to the point that they're not allowed to leave their houses

1003
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,200
and they got drones yelling at old ladies in the street to go home.

1004
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,120
It's fucking hilarious and crazy.

1005
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,240
That does sound really funny.

1006
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,200
They're also mass burning bodies somewhere in the...

1007
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,000
Yeah, that's right.

1008
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,440
Somewhere out in the fields.

1009
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,880
But yeah, China's a mad house right now.

1010
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,160
I don't know if Econ will be able to go by, you know,

1011
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,400
if it'll be reopened by the time he's gonna leave,

1012
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,760
but he had said something about coming to Radcon 4.

1013
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,000
Oh yeah, right, right.

1014
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,360
I was having some interest in that,

1015
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,520
so I assume he was gonna leave after that.

1016
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,920
I'll give you one hour of our time, Econ.

1017
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,440
That's how much I'll budget.

1018
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,120
Then you have to be out the door.

1019
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,440
Maybe we could invite Christian at the same time.

1020
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,160
That sounds like a great idea.

1021
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:17,800
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1022
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,520
Econ and Christian would...

1023
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,480
My two favorite people.

1024
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,840
They would really play off each other.

1025
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,200
They would have great chemistry together.

1026
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,200
I'm sure Econ would be interested in meeting Chris Chan, right?

1027
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,360
I suppose that's true.

1028
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,320
The funny thing is that meeting Chris is not that interesting.

1029
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:31,880
She doesn't like...

1030
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,520
Well, I mean, what do you expect?

1031
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,800
She doesn't do anything.

1032
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,920
Yeah, she doesn't...

1033
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,280
She's funny to think about,

1034
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,360
and she says funny stuff online,

1035
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,080
but she doesn't do anything interesting in person.

1036
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,600
It's just what you're describing.

1037
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,480
It's like you're describing a toy that you bought

1038
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,920
that's not that interesting.

1039
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,680
Yeah, I brought it home,

1040
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,360
but it's just like it doesn't really do anything.

1041
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,480
It's just kind of looks funny.

1042
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,720
It's like you go to the zoo,

1043
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,960
and you're like, oh, I want to see the lions,

1044
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:56,680
but then you go to the...

1045
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,800
And there's just one,

1046
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,640
and it's sitting there behind the bush,

1047
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,800
and you tap on the glass, and you're like, hey, move.

1048
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,080
It doesn't hold anything.

1049
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:03,720
It doesn't live up to the shape.

1050
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,600
But it just doesn't.

1051
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,280
But it means about the stories that are told.

1052
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,240
It's about the experiences.

1053
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,640
A lot of it's been mythologized,

1054
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,040
like the man in the pickle suit and whatnot.

1055
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,240
That event was probably less entertaining

1056
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,040
to see as it is to think about and just mull over.

1057
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,160
I don't know.

1058
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,040
A full-on pickle man costume?

1059
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,480
I mean, it sounds pretty spectacular.

1060
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,080
It's full of that one, maybe.

1061
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,800
But like Chris probably didn't do it.

1062
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,080
Chris probably just kind of froze up

1063
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,520
and stood there in confusion.

1064
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,040
Yeah, I would probably do the same to be fair, but yeah.

1065
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,960
It reminds me of lectures.

1066
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,880
I was thinking about doing a lecture or two or something,

1067
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,280
and I was racking my brain trying to think,

1068
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,440
what do I know that's also like a lectureable subject?

1069
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,560
And I kind of came to the conclusion that

1070
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,960
in order to make it a lectureable subject,

1071
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,800
I would need to do an amount of research

1072
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,720
that is essentially, I don't, you know.

1073
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,200
That's kind of where I'm at.

1074
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,160
I would need to do so much more research

1075
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,680
than what is already in my brain.

1076
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,800
And if it's not in my brain,

1077
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,080
it's going to be a fucking nightmare.

1078
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,280
And I kind of don't want to bother.

1079
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,200
Let me give you an example of something.

1080
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,080
Yesterday in my stream,

1081
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,040
this is why I was the right man

1082
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,320
to do the Kingdom Hearts lecture.

1083
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,720
And it is because when I was playing Kingdom Hearts,

1084
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,920
or I was doing my stream,

1085
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,280
I was talking about my experience

1086
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,040
of playing through the new Kingdom Hearts III DLC,

1087
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,320
I went on a rant about something

1088
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:31,800
that deeply offended me in Kingdom Hearts III's DLC.

1089
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,000
And it's that, oh, these so-called scholars,

1090
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,760
that, oh, they've got all this lore.

1091
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,200
They know everything about the series.

1092
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,600
They're such geniuses making this DLC

1093
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,600
that is literally just a canon retcon

1094
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,680
because they fucked up the story the first time

1095
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,440
and they had to fix it with DLC.

1096
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,240
These geniuses, such as Nomura,

1097
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,520
in Kingdom Hearts III,

1098
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,720
there's a section in the DLC

1099
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,240
you can play as Roxas briefly.

1100
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,960
And what they did was they gave Roxas

1101
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,960
the special power from Kingdom Hearts II called reversal.

1102
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,080
But here's the thing,

1103
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,440
reversal was a reaction command in Kingdom Hearts II,

1104
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,360
emphasis on the word reaction.

1105
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,160
Because in that game,

1106
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,480
reaction commands relate to the specific enemy

1107
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,520
you are fighting,

1108
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,360
not the character you are fucking playing

1109
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,120
as, you idiot Nomura.

1110
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,960
And so what he does is he makes it

1111
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,160
so that when you play as Roxas,

1112
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,320
you can use this reversal power,

1113
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,320
which puts you behind the enemy.

1114
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,160
It kind of swoos around behind him.

1115
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,920
But the problem is, in Kingdom Hearts II,

1116
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,560
you could do it to Dusks, to Xemnas,

1117
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,880
and I believe the Twilight Thorn as well.

1118
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,160
Those were the only enemies

1119
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,560
with the reversal reaction command.

1120
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,320
And in Kingdom Hearts III,

1121
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,840
they act like it was an intrinsic power that Roxas had

1122
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,320
and you could use it on enemies like Luxord

1123
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
and Larzin, which you could never do it.

1124
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,200
And it shows a fundamental misunderstanding

1125
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,560
of what a reaction command is

1126
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,720
and what the fucking reversal power is.

1127
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,560
And that kind of knowledge.

1128
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,920
And even Keyblade Spirit says,

1129
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,640
wow, Nate, even I'm not this autistic about Kingdom Hearts.

1130
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,720
That's why I'm the right man for the job

1131
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,600
to do that lecture.

1132
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,960
It's like, I don't have,

1133
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,480
maybe I do,

1134
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,840
but I don't have anything that,

1135
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,120
like I could really make a big old lecture about

1136
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,360
that would also be an interesting topping

1137
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,720
that anyone would want to listen to.

1138
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:13,800
I feel you.

1139
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,080
That's where I'm stuck because...

1140
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,240
I've got very few things to be fair.

1141
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,440
My first idea was,

1142
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,480
I wanted to talk about the five album narrative

1143
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,720
of the Coheed and Cambria albums.

1144
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,720
And there's a ton of comics

1145
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,640
and supplementary material to read,

1146
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,120
to study for that that I haven't read.

1147
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,600
But like, I thought about it and I was like,

1148
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,160
well, the main appeal of explaining

1149
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,920
the Coheed album narrative would be

1150
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,880
that I could say like,

1151
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,080
all right, this song, this is what it's about.

1152
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,000
You know, like this song that you've heard

1153
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,080
and you know, here's what it's about.

1154
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,000
But no, I don't think anybody in the PCP

1155
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,680
listens to Coheed and Cambria at all.

1156
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,600
So it'd be me lecturing you guys and being like,

1157
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,600
okay, well, when he says this lyric,

1158
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,760
it's like, you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1159
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,920
So I was like, maybe that's not such a good idea

1160
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,120
for this context.

1161
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,720
It could be because I knew nothing about guilty gear

1162
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,680
and Tom's lecture was engaging just for the...

1163
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,720
It was good.

1164
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,720
For the things he was explaining as he went.

1165
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,960
The thing about it is that like,

1166
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,120
you know, the actual...

1167
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,000
It's that the actual experience of the Coheed and Cambria albums

1168
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,560
is not the same as the story.

1169
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,840
And so what makes the story interesting as a deep dive

1170
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:28,520
is that you can have a different experience than the albums.

1171
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,480
So like, you won't get a sense of what this music sounds like

1172
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,720
or what the actual lyrics are or...

1173
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,520
No doubt, no doubt.

1174
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,520
Any of that if I just tell you the story.

1175
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,960
And the story isn't inherently interesting.

1176
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,840
It's interesting that this story is being told

1177
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,920
in this incredibly bizarre way through these lyrics and music.

1178
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,640
You know?

1179
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,520
Yeah, you're right.

1180
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,760
That doesn't sound like a great format for...

1181
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,200
It has to be a wacky, crazy story told in a wacky, crazy way.

1182
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,240
Yeah, I mean, the story is...

1183
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,320
That's what made the Guilty Gear lecture,

1184
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,960
because like, yeah, the story of Guilty Gear

1185
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,960
is not analogous to playing the games,

1186
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,640
but it is just weird in its own right.

1187
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,440
The story of the Cohed Albums is also insane.

1188
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,080
It's completely fucked up.

1189
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,560
Oh, well, sure.

1190
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,760
Okay, then fair enough.

1191
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,240
So it would be entertaining in that sense,

1192
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,520
but like, to me, the intrigue of the story is like,

1193
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:19,800
you hear these lyrics that mean ostensibly nothing,

1194
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,000
and then you look into them,

1195
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,560
and it's like this massive sci-fi fucking war story,

1196
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,760
and you're like, what the fuck?

1197
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,440
Like, this is what you were talking about.

1198
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,320
This seems like it would be best told in like,

1199
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,960
YouTube video format to me, where you clip.

1200
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,360
This reminds me of, okay.

1201
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,560
I think it would be a good lecture.

1202
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,240
It just would have to be in front of people

1203
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,680
who know the music.

1204
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,360
I might be exposing my ignorance here,

1205
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:44,120
because I don't know anything about K-Pop,

1206
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,600
except that I see it on Twitter all the fucking time,

1207
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,160
and I'll be looking at a seemingly normal thread,

1208
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,720
and then suddenly K-Pop gifts start getting posted,

1209
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,240
and I check out because I'm like,

1210
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,280
I'm not gonna understand anything that's being said from now on.

1211
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,520
When I posted about how my grandma just died,

1212
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,880
and that guy replied with,

1213
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,440
should've stand Bu Jung Po, or whatever,

1214
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,960
I was like, I mean, fair enough,

1215
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,640
she did not stand that guy.

1216
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,920
Maybe that would've done it, as they usually post.

1217
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,720
I don't know why, but I clicked on the Wikipedia article

1218
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,640
for BTS the other day,

1219
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,800
and apparently they also have like,

1220
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,160
a alternate reality storyline going on.

1221
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,080
Okay, that sounds kind of interesting.

1222
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,400
There's tons and tons of stuff

1223
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,800
that I think would fit the lecture format well.

1224
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,480
It's just like a matter of,

1225
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,480
will this be interesting to people

1226
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,040
who don't know what it is already?

1227
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,280
And in the case of Coheed, I think it could be,

1228
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,640
there's an entertaining lecture

1229
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,800
that could be done just about the story,

1230
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,640
but it would not be as interesting

1231
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,240
as comparing it to the lyrics

1232
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,600
and being able to mind expansion people who know them.

1233
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,920
The other idea I had, and the problem with this one

1234
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,120
is it would require even more research on my part,

1235
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,200
but it wouldn't be too hard to do, is Toho.

1236
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,600
Oh, that's a great idea.

1237
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,640
Great idea.

1238
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,920
That is a good one, yeah.

1239
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:03,320
But the problem with Toho is that there's not really

1240
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,520
a ton of official narrative that's that interesting

1241
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,320
to dive into.

1242
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,360
Mostly it's about the characters,

1243
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,080
and I mean, there are a ton of official stories

1244
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,680
and weird details about them,

1245
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,640
but it would be like, when it comes to the fan content,

1246
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,240
it's like there's nowhere to start.

1247
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,040
It's endless.

1248
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,480
There's more fan content for Toho

1249
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,240
than anything else on the planet.

1250
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,400
So yeah, I don't know.

1251
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,160
I think someone could work in,

1252
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,240
someone could definitely make a good Toho lecture

1253
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,720
that would probably be skeleton around.

1254
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,320
You go through the games from start to finish.

1255
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,160
You talk about Zune's life and stuff,

1256
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,480
and then as relevant characters come up,

1257
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,440
you just tell anecdotes about what this character has done.

1258
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,360
That one seems like a really, really strong idea for a lecture.

1259
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,000
Yes.

1260
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,240
The only problem with it is that I have no fucking idea

1261
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,560
about Toho lecture, and I'm in these circles personally.

1262
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,160
That's just guilty gear.

1263
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,960
Everybody knows it, but probably how many people

1264
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,160
actually know what the fuck it's about.

1265
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:57,960
And here's the thing.

1266
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,520
When it comes to these lectures,

1267
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,160
I like when we do them about these super autistic things

1268
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,520
because most of their fans can't explain that all.

1269
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,160
True.

1270
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,840
They're so into it that they don't know

1271
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,200
how to communicate about it,

1272
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:14,360
and if you go to Toho panels at Otacon or something,

1273
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,200
they're fucking incomprehensible.

1274
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,840
Even for me, with a surface-level understanding,

1275
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,360
because the people at them know everything,

1276
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:26,440
it's just constant references and obscure left hooks

1277
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,440
and just rambling, incoherent,

1278
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,200
nonsense and shouting about the characters.

1279
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,840
Just a bunch of people who are really excited about Toho

1280
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,280
spurring the fuck out about Toho.

1281
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,280
And there's no way to get a grasp

1282
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,080
on what the hell you're experiencing in that context.

1283
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:43,560
Yeah.

1284
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,360
Yeah.

1285
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,960
And even if you do know Toho, for someone like me,

1286
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,680
and this is why I would have to do a lot of research to do it,

1287
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,240
there's always new games and new characters coming out.

1288
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,560
So like most people probably know the main characters

1289
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,800
from like Imperishable Knight.

1290
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,000
From Reimu's upcoming inclusion in Super Smash Brothers

1291
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,080
and the new DLC pack, that's going to be the one.

1292
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,560
But like there's just fucking hundreds of characters,

1293
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,080
you know, there's so many to go through

1294
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,040
and so many side stories and manga and all that extra shit.

1295
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:12,760
So I don't know.

1296
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,760
Monkey's Pod choice.

1297
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,480
All right, you get your PCP lecture about Toho,

1298
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,080
ladies and gentlemen, listening at home,

1299
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,720
but it's done by a man who I know could do it,

1300
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,960
who has the skills, Econ.

1301
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,800
Guest lecture from Econ about Toho.

1302
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,520
I honestly don't even think Econ would be willing to

1303
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,000
because of how much research he would think he would have to do.

1304
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,600
I think he has the knowledge to do it,

1305
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,960
but I mean, no, he's not going to do it.

1306
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,800
He wouldn't, unlike, the reason that,

1307
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,040
okay, this is why I'm so worried about me doing it,

1308
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,600
is that like there is a standard of research

1309
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,200
that I would approach it with,

1310
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:48,680
which is enough to tell somebody who doesn't know about Toho

1311
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,240
as much as they need to know to become interested.

1312
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,400
Anybody who already knows about Toho will look at me and say,

1313
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,040
you motherfucker, you got this wrong, this wrong,

1314
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,000
you didn't go into this,

1315
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,400
like there's all these extra details you could have talked about.

1316
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,720
Toho is exactly that kind of community.

1317
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,320
It's exactly that kind of community.

1318
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:09,000
They're extremely hardcore, they're very opinionated.

1319
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,120
So like, that's scary.

1320
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,720
If you started something like that,

1321
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,800
that's a very real possibility,

1322
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,680
but if you started with, like, this is designed to be,

1323
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,440
look, this is Toho 101.

1324
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,400
It doesn't matter if you say that.

1325
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,440
If we get the 50,000 Kickstarter, we'll do Toho 102,

1326
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,720
and that's the advanced course.

1327
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,560
I would probably keep it to just official canon.

1328
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,360
That would be the easiest way to have...

1329
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,840
Honestly, dude, the best way to get the most views,

1330
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,560
you have like an hour long, maybe two hour long lecture on Toho,

1331
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,840
and you include shit like,

1332
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,160
why is Chirono associated with Nine?

1333
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,280
Why is she a baka?

1334
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,080
And then you'll explain that kind of shit.

1335
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,200
That's all the stuff, yeah.

1336
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,000
Basically what I would probably do is go through each game,

1337
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,760
explain each character,

1338
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,800
all the like, most famous lore pieces

1339
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,720
and where they came from about those characters

1340
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,240
that are like, tied to the actual narrative.

1341
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,200
That's a million view video right there is what that is.

1342
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,800
Somebody making that, I think.

1343
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,280
If the Christian, well, maybe 500,000, I don't know,

1344
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,520
but that one's got legs.

1345
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,560
That one's got legs.

1346
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,840
I might do it, but that's probably the best idea I've had

1347
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,000
other than the co-heed lectures so far.

1348
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,760
So, and I'm also curious if anybody listening

1349
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,560
or if any of you guys just has ideas for things

1350
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,000
that you know I know about that you would want to lecture.

1351
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,240
What spawned this whole lecture series

1352
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,480
was literally that Ben would just tell stories

1353
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,080
about Christian all the time.

1354
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,720
And I said, you need to lecture us about,

1355
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,160
I really want you to just sit us down

1356
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,840
and like blackpill me on Christian

1357
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,680
because I don't know enough to have context

1358
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:31,880
for what the hell you're talking about.

1359
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,680
So, I don't know, because you do.

1360
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,360
So I educated the whole world.

1361
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,000
I do talk about a lot of the things that you,

1362
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,280
you know, like at length in videos and stuff.

1363
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,080
So like, is there really even that much stuff

1364
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,840
that you haven't talked about that you could do in a lecture?

1365
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,120
It's hard to say because it's hard to know what stuff like,

1366
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,280
maybe there's something that I have talked about it,

1367
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,160
but not nearly at the depth I could, you know,

1368
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,920
or just haven't at all like, there's certain subjects.

1369
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:08,280
I mean, again, like say the co-heed and Cambria album narrative,

1370
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,480
like I haven't talked about that.

1371
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,840
Well, you know about a lot of music stuff.

1372
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,680
I don't know really anything about rap.

1373
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,160
What is rap?

1374
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,800
Death Grips is not a bad one.

1375
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,960
Death Grips, I do have a video about,

1376
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,120
and there's not that much to go into

1377
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,240
because a lot of their thing is that

1378
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,920
they're just very mysterious.

1379
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,160
So, you know, they don't have like a,

1380
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,320
there's like all the little legendary things

1381
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,600
they did at the start of their career,

1382
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,600
but at this point, they basically just,

1383
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,240
every year a new album drops out of nowhere

1384
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,920
and you go, oh shit, new Death Grips.

1385
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,760
You know, this would be redundant

1386
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,440
because I actually just watched a video about it,

1387
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,800
but it does strike me as a story

1388
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,240
that would work well for the formula,

1389
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,760
which is just the life and times of one John McAfee

1390
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,840
and all the adventures that he's been up to.

1391
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,280
I mean, that's a perfect story.

1392
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,160
I want to watch a video about it.

1393
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,840
I watched that four part by that one dude

1394
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,360
who interviewed him after it was done.

1395
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

1396
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,560
I don't know his name, Michelle pulled it up for me,

1397
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,000
but I mean, it was really funny.

1398
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,160
And actually that guy clearly was biased against John McAfee.

1399
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,800
And the whole time I couldn't help but be like,

1400
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,640
you know, John McAfee may be responsible

1401
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,160
for a few people dying and stuff,

1402
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,920
but like, at least he's not a pussy like you, dude.

1403
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,040
At least he's like not a little bitch, you know.

1404
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:20,040
I, McAfee is definitely one of my, one of my heroes.

1405
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,840
He's a libertarian God on this earth, no doubt about it.

1406
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,400
I will be writing him in on the ballot

1407
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,280
if Pete Buttigieg is the pick for the Democratic Party.

1408
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,360
It's looking pretty unlikely that Pete's gone.

1409
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,840
We don't know about it, we have no idea.

1410
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:35,960
We don't.

1411
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,800
Well, like fucking Bloomberg keeps rising in the, in the bedding odds.

1412
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,920
Super Tuesday, baby.

1413
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,680
He hasn't, he hasn't, he hasn't even been on a single ballot yet.

1414
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,360
So like it remains a complete like hypothetical at this point.

1415
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,000
Nobody knows.

1416
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,600
Is he trying to, so is he running independent or for the DNC?

1417
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,680
No, he's running, literal Democrat, Pete Bloomberg

1418
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,520
is running as a Democrat.

1419
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,480
And then all these people were like, Bernie's not even a,

1420
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,320
Bernie's not even a real Democrat.

1421
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,680
Bernie's not even a real Democrat.

1422
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,800
He hasn't been vetted.

1423
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,480
Bloomberg, literal Republican comes in, runs on a Democratic ticket

1424
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,680
and everyone's like, yes.

1425
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,320
All the media shows are like, yes, let's get behind fucking Bloomberg.

1426
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,960
I mean, Bloomberg, the fact that they, they,

1427
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,200
he clearly pays people to talk about him.

1428
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,360
Like even in the debates, they've brought him up.

1429
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,080
Admittedly, admittedly.

1430
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:25,080
Like it was obvious that they had been paid to bring him up

1431
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,360
because they like quote him like in a, it was ridiculous.

1432
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:33,480
But how does he, how could he get the Democratic candidacy?

1433
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,040
Like who's, he hasn't been voted on anywhere.

1434
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,400
Like how does one become this position without participating?

1435
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,680
I mean, I think the idea is just to saturate the media

1436
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,960
and saturate the mainstream media and the airwaves and commercials

1437
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,960
with like Bloomberg propaganda

1438
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,600
and then hopefully like win big on Super Tuesday.

1439
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,200
I think that's his plan.

1440
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,720
Is he even included in the polls that they do?

1441
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,760
Like he will be.

1442
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,840
Was he in the Iowa pockets at all?

1443
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,040
He's waiting for it.

1444
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:00,840
He was.

1445
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,560
Well look, like the reason why the early states matter

1446
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,360
is because it sets the tone for who's going to win.

1447
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,400
But if you can just manufacture good tone

1448
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,040
for the upcoming states that truly do matter,

1449
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,040
you like theoretically you could bypass it.

1450
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,400
It hasn't really been done much,

1451
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,240
but it's, you know, in theory it's possible.

1452
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,440
And that's what he's banking on, I think.

1453
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,480
Although some people think he's not actually trying to win,

1454
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:26,920
but it's just trying to, I don't know, fuck shit up in a good way.

1455
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:31,240
Word is going around that he might name Hillary as his VP.

1456
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,200
I heard about that.

1457
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,040
Which, yeah.

1458
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,320
Oh, what if he then retires?

1459
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,960
He then gives up the mantle of president at last.

1460
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,240
Retires immediately.

1461
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:39,320
Immediately.

1462
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,440
He's like, yeah, Rizan.

1463
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,120
That's probably exactly what would happen.

1464
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,240
She's going in the back door.

1465
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:45,880
Holy shit.

1466
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,800
And even please make it happen, Mike.

1467
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,400
I guess now might be a time to briefly mention

1468
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,320
that yes, Bernie won New Hampshire.

1469
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,040
Very exciting.

1470
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,440
If you're hearing this on Friday,

1471
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,600
tomorrow, Saturday, is the day of the Nevada caucuses.

1472
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,960
So if you're in Nevada, get out and vote for Bernie.

1473
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,120
Good night, sweet yang.

1474
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,400
Good night.

1475
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,800
Do not realign yourself to any other candidate.

1476
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,200
If Bernie is unviable, unlikely, but a possibility,

1477
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:12,760
just go home.

1478
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,000
I mean, I've been hearing these things

1479
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,560
about clobementum going on, though.

1480
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,120
And I gotta say, I'm liking what I'm hearing.

1481
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,000
The purple shirt.

1482
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,320
It is, in fact, clober in time.

1483
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,680
Clober in time.

1484
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,320
Shout out to Bevan for his incredible image.

1485
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,760
Oh, because she looks like the Hulk.

1486
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,080
She's tiny.

1487
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,400
But she's sturdy, though.

1488
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:37,960
She's stout.

1489
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,640
She's sturdily built.

1490
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,680
Like a female dwarf.

1491
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,240
We're talking about a quivering a little bit.

1492
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:44,360
Yeah.

1493
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,280
Yeah, she's always quivering a little bit

1494
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,480
on the debate stage.

1495
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:52,600
Sometimes she's just vibrating, like a hummingbird.

1496
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,640
That's that clobementum.

1497
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,920
She's just raring to go.

1498
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,040
She's got to hit gas.

1499
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,360
She could barely contain the forward motion.

1500
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,160
All right.

1501
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,680
Vote for Bernie, everybody.

1502
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,320
There you go.

1503
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:05,400
There's the message.

1504
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,320
Are we ready to move to voicemails then?

1505
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,240
Oh, wait, before we do that,

1506
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,880
let's talk about my problematic tweet

1507
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,840
where I insinuate that right people don't think.

1508
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,600
Okay, sure.

1509
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,120
Oh, there is the response to my tweet.

1510
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:18,200
Yeah.

1511
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,840
She also tells what it said, first of all.

1512
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:21,800
Great tweet.

1513
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,360
My tweet.

1514
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:22,680
All right.

1515
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:26,280
Well, my tweet was a retweet from Rational Disconnect

1516
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:31,000
with a screenshot of a Louder with Crowder video

1517
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:37,400
called Exposed, Buttigieg's leftist extremism, 108K views.

1518
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,080
And I said, there is no skill floor for being conservative,

1519
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,600
meaning that you can be as dumb and as wrong

1520
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,880
and as thoughtless as you want.

1521
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,720
And nobody on the right cares

1522
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:51,640
as long as you are appealing to their basic sense of fear

1523
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,080
and disgust, and they will eat it up

1524
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,240
and you will make a million dollars.

1525
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:58,840
And that was my tweet.

1526
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,800
How could someone say something so brave?

1527
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,440
Yeah.

1528
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,400
Thank you.

1529
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:03,480
Thank you.

1530
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,520
Controversial.

1531
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,680
Yeah, I have no issue with that.

1532
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,000
Certainly.

1533
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,640
Yeah.

1534
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,520
Within the Rational Disconnect.

1535
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,040
But then I follow it up with a thought I had been having,

1536
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,520
which is what I say is it literally does seem to be

1537
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,240
that the difference between the left and right political

1538
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,480
persuasion is the amount of thinking you do.

1539
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,160
It's not even that all people on the right are stupid.

1540
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,400
They just don't bother thinking about things.

1541
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,200
First impressions.

1542
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,000
Well, hang on.

1543
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,760
Your first tweet was just that first sentence.

1544
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,000
No.

1545
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,400
All this is...

1546
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,120
No, it was the whole...

1547
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:32,680
No, he's still...

1548
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,840
This is the tweet.

1549
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,720
First impressions and gut reactions are often wrong.

1550
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,080
And that was my tweet.

1551
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,520
And the...

1552
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,120
Oh, did you not read it?

1553
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,800
Did you get triggered?

1554
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,360
I thought I only saw the first half.

1555
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,360
No, I just didn't realize.

1556
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,160
Okay, whoops.

1557
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,240
Yeah, well, I agree.

1558
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,040
You don't...

1559
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:57,880
It's a gut reaction to be a reactionary conservative.

1560
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:58,680
It's like, oh, I don't like this.

1561
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,920
Yeah, it's literally the exact same on both sides.

1562
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:01,720
It is kind of the...

1563
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,520
Yeah, that was the thing I realized off the board.

1564
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,040
All of it is the exact same.

1565
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,320
There's no difference at all.

1566
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,480
I will admit that you can be a liberal,

1567
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,520
that you can be a shit-lib without thinking about anything.

1568
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,800
I mean, you just like, oh, Trump's mean online.

1569
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,360
You can be good or bad of either.

1570
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:20,200
It is the case.

1571
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:25,160
The left, the real left is data-driven.

1572
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,040
The thing that I was trying to get at was...

1573
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:26,680
We love data.

1574
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,480
We love facts.

1575
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,360
We love logic.

1576
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,680
We love rational...

1577
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,440
Oh, R-L-Y.

1578
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,240
Yes, one hundo.

1579
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:35,800
The thing...

1580
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,000
All right, I have been getting really into...

1581
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,760
Last time I talked about bread tube and philosophy tube

1582
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:46,760
and country points and stuff, and I've been feeling really left,

1583
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,920
really cuck-lib, cuck-loser.

1584
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,080
Like, I played Dark Souls 2, and I liked it.

1585
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:56,920
You got to take a little of each medicine.

1586
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:57,960
You got to mix some up.

1587
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:03,720
I watched the ladder with Crowder video.

1588
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,560
I watched a full-on ladder with Crowder video.

1589
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,880
You don't need to watch Stephen Crowder.

1590
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,320
All right, fucking...

1591
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,240
Could you let me finish the thing I was saying?

1592
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:11,640
Yeah.

1593
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:17,080
All right, so I've been getting more left, just ideas in my brain

1594
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,120
that I didn't have before.

1595
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:22,280
And what I was realizing was that a lot of social justice stuff,

1596
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:27,560
when presented not as stark, raving, mad, crazy, feminist, screeching,

1597
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:28,840
it actually...

1598
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,400
Like, a lot of the things make sense.

1599
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,640
Things like white privilege that I would have assumed.

1600
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:37,160
Oh, that's complete bullshit, because it's said by people who are crazy.

1601
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:42,200
The people who I see in videos by Thunderfoot and stuff like that.

1602
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,480
And I still like Thunderfoot.

1603
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,520
I like his videos.

1604
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,800
I like the Amazing Atheist.

1605
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:50,200
I like the Razor Fist, the Rageaholic.

1606
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:59,240
But these new ideas, which I previously dismissed out of hand,

1607
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:06,200
it was sort of a revelation to me that I thought this whole time...

1608
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,880
I had the same revelation.

1609
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,000
I had the same one.

1610
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,400
It's so funny to hear you guys say this because of the fact

1611
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:17,560
that I come from this and have moved in the direction of appreciating the other side,

1612
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,960
and being like, oh, these guys aren't slobbering morons on this other side.

1613
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,440
It really just depends on where you started.

1614
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:32,360
Like, I started with the Amazing Atheist, and he'd made fun of feminists and Christians and all that.

1615
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,240
So it's like, this is my default position.

1616
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:39,160
I believed it because I didn't have any reason to doubt it, and I thought it was funny.

1617
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:44,280
And then in the future, there's this conflict, and I choose a side.

1618
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:48,920
And now I realize that there's no point choosing a side.

1619
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:56,120
You're stupid if you stick with the side that you first went into,

1620
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:02,680
instead of exploring the other one with genuine curiosity and open-mindedness.

1621
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,160
Because I used to think I was open-minded,

1622
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:10,040
but I would dismiss things that are like, oh, that's stupid.

1623
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,040
You know, I've got an open mind, but only if they have a good idea.

1624
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:18,840
But they don't have any good ideas, because I saw them as screeching idiots.

1625
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,800
So really, what I was was not open-minded, because I hadn't looked at what they were

1626
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,360
actually saying before casting my judgment.

1627
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:31,720
I had believed I was open-minded just because I wasn't, you know,

1628
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:39,320
I assumed that because some of it told me that this is stupid, I was like, yeah,

1629
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,160
okay, I get it now.

1630
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,040
And I didn't get it.

1631
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:52,680
And it's just a cool to be a person who takes all the pieces and puts them together

1632
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,440
and then makes a decision.

1633
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:00,200
I was having a Twitter discussion, I think it was yesterday, about South Park.

1634
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:04,600
Someone made a tweet about the damage to the discourse that South Park had done,

1635
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,760
or something, and I agreed with it.

1636
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:13,240
And someone disagreed, and we had a pretty civil discussion about it.

1637
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,840
And my point was just that, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1638
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,880
I remember being influenced by media-like, media-like,

1639
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,600
centrist media like South Park that says both sides are dumb.

1640
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,560
And I didn't mention these, but also like, yeah, like a reaction channel.

1641
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,800
It's not centrist to say both sides are dumb.

1642
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,400
It is, though.

1643
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,840
That's what centrism is.

1644
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,240
I feel like we've been over this, but...

1645
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:42,040
We had a whole fucking video, YouTube discussion on it, over on StComics.

1646
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,160
What'scentrum.com?

1647
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,600
What's centrism?

1648
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,760
Maybe I should look into this, this new way of thinking.

1649
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:57,240
It's just that there's, to say that it is center, I don't want to get into it.

1650
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,640
That's a good definition.

1651
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,680
It's like, oh, left, right?

1652
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,320
No, they're both dumb.

1653
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:06,360
Well, yeah, the thing, you know, it's silly and reductive,

1654
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:11,320
but it's kind of unavoidable to contain all of the policies considered left

1655
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:15,640
and considered right and call them one thing, and you are on one side or the other.

1656
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:16,360
Absolutely.

1657
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,720
So that's the real issue there.

1658
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:21,080
Someone was talking about, I think Tom said a thing about like gun control,

1659
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,160
like two, at least something, something gun control.

1660
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:28,200
And I said, well, I know that gun rights are generally considered a right-wing thing,

1661
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:32,600
but like Marx himself was super high on like that.

1662
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,480
You already broke it.

1663
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,760
It already makes no sense, right?

1664
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,200
Left and right makes no sense.

1665
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,560
You don't even have to finish the sentence.

1666
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,560
They don't make no sense.

1667
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,240
They have a general sense.

1668
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,520
They have a logic behind them.

1669
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,240
I'm saying that there is, yeah, they're in some issues, there is crossover,

1670
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,280
because if you're a hardcore lefty, Marx himself was very pro-gun.

1671
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:56,600
If you find yourself in a position of, I agree with, like half of my stances are left-wing,

1672
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,560
and half of them are right-wing, by the way, they're constructed currently.

1673
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:06,280
This somehow makes me a centrist for thinking that people on either extreme are wrong,

1674
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,400
even though I'm not in between the two.

1675
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,600
I feel strongly one way or another about each issue.

1676
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,280
I'm not in the center, you know?

1677
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,960
I just think in practice, such a person is like

1678
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,200
fantastically unlikely.

1679
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,480
There are some issues that I think the figure of.

1680
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,760
No, I think that such a person is almost everybody,

1681
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:29,080
and that all of us just make tons of compromises on shit that we're not sure about,

1682
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:32,680
or don't care that much about, because we want the issues we actually care about.

1683
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:35,240
I think that most people are single-topic votes.

1684
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:38,680
I think that if you really have put a lot of introspection into these things,

1685
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:42,360
you will find that you have a tendency in one direction or another.

1686
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,560
I think there's a general...

1687
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,440
And you might not agree with everyone who shares your tendencies on everything.

1688
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:51,320
The policies that you hold, the things you agree with could be on one side or the other,

1689
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,920
and then there's the level to which you are engaged in politics in general.

1690
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:01,480
I feel like people who are like, what's the word for somewhat radical?

1691
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,440
If you are radically on the left or the right,

1692
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:09,240
that doesn't necessarily mean that you are with all of these specific policies,

1693
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,360
but some of them you are very far on that side.

1694
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,360
Let me put it this way.

1695
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:23,560
You can be, to be a centrist, I think is implied that you're not heavily one way

1696
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:30,920
or the other in terms of a political direction that you're trying to go for.

1697
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:31,320
The reason this is so confusing.

1698
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,560
The policy is separate, I think.

1699
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:37,720
Okay. It can't be separate, because policy is what defines the parties are.

1700
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,920
I guess it can't be separate, but I feel like there maybe is a trend.

1701
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:45,400
I don't have a position on what centrism is. I'm just trying to figure it out.

1702
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:50,520
Well, that's what I'm trying to say. It doesn't make sense, because the problem is,

1703
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:56,760
if I were retreading the argument I had with Ben, but if I were to say that I felt

1704
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:03,320
very passionately pro-gun ownership rights, which is considered a right-wing position in America,

1705
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:08,280
and also I'm extremely pro-abortion rights, which is considered an extremely left-wing

1706
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:14,200
issue in America, then I now cannot wholesale throw my hat in with either of those parties,

1707
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:18,680
each of which is going to take away something I care about. If I sincerely cared about both

1708
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:25,480
these things, I am now in a third party, because I want them both. To call that a center party,

1709
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:31,960
the only reason that those things are construed as left or right is that they just so happen

1710
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:37,560
to fall into the bubble of people who tend to have certain other beliefs, but there's no

1711
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:43,400
real correlation between them other than that. People by and large are willing to throw some

1712
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:48,520
things under the bus, or they just don't care, because they care more about other issues. In

1713
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:55,160
my case, growing up, I was very... I'm a freedom of speech person, and that's the reason I'm in

1714
01:31:55,160 --> 01:32:00,760
such a weird position, because growing up, liberal meant freedom of speech protector. That was a big

1715
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:05,480
part of the party's identity. The conservatives were always trying to take shit away from us,

1716
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:11,640
take away what we could say. Now, I don't know if it actually is the opposite now, but it feels

1717
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:15,720
that way, because it feels like the liberals are the ones taking away what we can say.

1718
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:24,760
The shit-lives and their id-pole shit is very anti-free speech. I agree that it is a big problem.

1719
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,840
I think that that's what leads. I think that that identitarianism is what leads to this,

1720
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:35,880
because people so badly want to have an identity of being with this party. As long as this party

1721
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:39,320
supports the one issue they care about, they will tow the party line on all the other shit

1722
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:45,720
and just assume that what the party thinks is true and correct. The way that people talk about

1723
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:53,320
the whole AR-15, the automatic rifle with 15 rounds information, it's so easy for that to

1724
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:59,800
spread through democratic circles, because they will just lap up anything that their side says

1725
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:05,320
with just, they just don't care about gun rights, so they just say, oh, the Dems hate it, so I hate

1726
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:12,280
it too. Their arguments make sense, ergo, I agree, but then you actually go listen to some Republican

1727
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:17,240
voters who really care about gun rights, who do not care about abortion. They're like, yeah,

1728
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:20,760
that should be legal, whatever. I don't care, but I'm voting Republican because they're not

1729
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:25,480
taking my guns. When you talk to somebody like that, you think, okay, so most of these people

1730
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:31,000
voting, they don't really have an opinion on most of these issues that are getting thrown in with

1731
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:39,640
their party, and I think that if more people were, if we had something like alternative vote,

1732
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:44,120
as I'm always saying, and we could have third parties that were viable, I think more people

1733
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:48,680
would gravitate towards third parties that strip away the things that you don't like about

1734
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:55,000
neither of the main parties, and just focus on a coalition of things that creates you in your

1735
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:01,640
perspective. It is definitely stupid to have left and right. The only reason it has any value,

1736
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:08,680
quote unquote value, is that at the moment we're in a two-party system, which generally goes left,

1737
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:15,560
right. Well, I don't think that's the only reason. Well, yeah, I mean, the thought that generally

1738
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:21,800
people of a certain persuasion think certain different policies are like, I like that section

1739
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:28,520
of policies. Here's what I think about the hypothetical of a person who's very pro-gun,

1740
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:34,600
very pro-abortion. I think if you are someone who, those are the only two opinions you have,

1741
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,320
and you don't interrogate why you have them any further than that, sure. Then it would be

1742
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:45,160
impossible for you to draw any ideological line for yourself and be like, oh, these are my,

1743
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:52,200
these are my overarching beliefs. But if you think about, you could have those things,

1744
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:56,600
and then you might think about why do you have them, and if you think about your underlying

1745
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,480
beliefs that underpin those and cause you to think that way, I think what generally what you find is

1746
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:05,560
people are inclined to one of two lines of thought. You either favor egalitarianism or you're in

1747
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:11,000
favor of hierarchy. People tend to fall into these two camps. People have these two patterns of

1748
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:15,320
thought that are diverged from each other. Causing everybody to fall. For me,

1749
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:23,880
as a voter, I have nothing that draws me to either the Democrat or Republican side as like,

1750
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:30,600
oh, this makes them better than the other one, so I need to vote for them. There's nothing I feel

1751
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:40,360
that they are saying that makes me feel that way. I was arguing with a hashtag still voting

1752
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:45,800
Yang. Those people, I don't understand that. I don't. It's kind of disappointing, but I think a

1753
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:51,160
lot of them are probably like former Republicans or libertarians who went Yang, so I'm like, I'm

1754
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:56,360
not too sorry to lose their vote. But anyway, I was arguing with one and she was sent, she was,

1755
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:01,080
you know, no, actually, no, this was a Bernie or Buster. I had, it doesn't matter. But I said like,

1756
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:06,360
like, I won't, I won't vote for Bloomberg, but, but I would probably vote for most of the Dems

1757
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:10,040
if they got, I'm not, I'm not full on Bernie or Buster, but I'm also not full on vote no matter

1758
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:18,040
who. I'm a centrist about it. But, but I was saying, I was saying, she was, I said, like, you know,

1759
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:22,040
I know I hate Hillary, everybody hates Hillary, but like the fact of the matter is like, for example,

1760
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:27,240
if we'd had Hillary for the last four years, it wouldn't have been great, but we would probably

1761
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:31,960
be closer to Medicare for all or a decent public option, like, and we would have a better like,

1762
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:36,760
we would have gotten better picks for the, for the Supreme Court and stuff like this.

1763
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:40,120
See, I don't know all that stuff. We wouldn't have been happy about it, but we would have been,

1764
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:43,320
we would be, we would be materially better off. That's the kind of thing that I view as like this

1765
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:48,760
weird party think mind poison, because it's like, we could have got better seats. I don't know who

1766
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,520
the fuck Hillary would have picked. Like, yeah, maybe they would have been Democrats, maybe in

1767
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:57,720
some vague way that would get us closer to some ideals that I don't even really care about or

1768
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:04,280
believe in anyways, but like, I just can't, I can't visualize in my mind this world in which

1769
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:10,520
things were better because Hillary became president. Like, I, Hillary, for all her faults,

1770
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:15,800
she was running on a platform of like expanding on the Affordable Care Act and stuff. For all

1771
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:21,880
her faults, Hillary was pushing a, she was pro like expansion of the Affordable Care Act and like a

1772
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:27,240
strong public health care option, which is a thing that I agree with. See, that's a topic that I

1773
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:35,080
have no particular stance on. I feel like both arguments have a lot of strength and water.

1774
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:39,960
Like, I've heard, I've heard both sides talk about it and I go, okay, I understand the issues.

1775
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:47,480
Like, neither solution sounds like obvious to me. Neither one is like, oh, this will definitely

1776
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:52,520
make things better, might make things different, could be interesting, might be worth a shake up.

1777
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:57,960
But you know, like the level of like confidence that people feel and like, oh, if my guy wins,

1778
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:03,800
things will get better. And it's like, if your guy wins, things will move very marginally in a

1779
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,760
direction that will likely be counterbalanced in the next cycle as it usually is. Like,

1780
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:13,320
this is, this is what I say. This is what I say to people that like scoff at Bernie and say like,

1781
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,080
oh, well, you know, Medicare for all is too hard. It'll never get passed. And it's like, okay,

1782
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:21,480
you even, let's assume you're right. Let's assume you're correct about that. And Bernie will not

1783
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:26,040
will not be able to fully deliver on everything he says he wants to do, which,

1784
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:30,040
you know, is the case for most presidents because they get thwarted by Congress because

1785
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:36,120
separation of powers, this is how it's designed. And that's fine. I just, the reason I'm, I don't

1786
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:41,560
care about that is because, sure, but at least he's a guy who will be pushing things in the,

1787
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:45,880
he will at least be pushing in the direction that I want things to go in, even if we don't get all

1788
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:50,840
the way there. It's better than having someone like Trump or like Buttigieg or even Biden or

1789
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:55,880
someone who is going to be like way more, even if like, even if someone like Biden like wants,

1790
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:01,480
like, I know that he would prefer that like more people be insured, right? Like, even though I

1791
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:04,280
like expanding the American, the affordable character, I don't think is the best way we should

1792
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:10,280
just go full on fucking socialized medicine. But even if like, he's not going to be pushing as hard,

1793
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:14,920
right? Even if he's generally going the way I want, Bernie, Bernie goes harder for it.

1794
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:19,240
We're going so far into the weeds and that's what I want, ideologically and materially discussion

1795
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:25,240
than usual though. Yeah. But where I kind of want to back it out to is, I guess what frustrates

1796
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:30,040
me about political discourse is that people have a tendency to look at things within the framework

1797
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:36,760
of how they operate currently. People look at it like, like the Iowa caucuses, they matter because

1798
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:41,800
of these like precedents of what they mean, you know? And so everybody gets excited about it and

1799
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:47,320
we talk about it. But then particularly this year, like the Iowa caucus was a complete fucking joke

1800
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:52,440
the results essentially mean nothing because of how badly it was cocked up.

1801
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,360
Incidentally, I didn't know this, but apparently in 2016, Nevada was like an equally big debacle.

1802
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:03,480
I didn't know this, but apparently in 2016, the Nevada caucus, the one that's coming out

1803
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:08,920
this Saturday, the ones happening this Saturday, was an equally huge debacle and a nightmare rigged

1804
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:13,560
by the fucking DNC. They stole it from Bernie. But less people were paying attention at that point.

1805
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:19,080
Probably yes. So anyway, that's the one that's happening this Saturday, so I'm looking forward

1806
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:22,440
to another night. When it comes to these caucuses and everything, people are paying all this attention

1807
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:29,320
to it and like saying all this stuff about like what it means. And it's like, that all assumes

1808
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:35,160
that the precedent will be kept to, but the precedent doesn't have to be kept to, it could

1809
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:40,760
be completely subverted. Like Bloomberg currently is trying to completely subvert the precedent.

1810
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:46,360
He's just using money to try and put his name in front of people and just get in. And Trump,

1811
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:51,240
in many ways, what made Trump succeed was that he went outside the boundaries of what other

1812
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:57,400
candidates were doing. He was using the internet. He was using memes. He is just way more blunt and

1813
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:04,040
upfront than other presidents. He does not care about like maintaining this uber professional,

1814
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:11,640
sanitary presentation that recent presidents, particularly Obama, have had. He rejected

1815
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:17,480
all that because his thought process is, well, this may be the way that everyone's doing it,

1816
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:24,920
but it's not the only way it can be done. And I can prove that. And he was so controversial for

1817
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:29,320
that or for everything about it and that the mainstream media just fell all over themselves

1818
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:32,760
to cover him. And he got billions and billions of dollars worth in free advertising.

1819
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:38,520
He gets tons and tons of advertising because he is popular content. He will always show up on TV

1820
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:44,360
and he knows how to be popular content. So, and there was that, have you seen the

1821
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:48,760
Emplemen video about Trump, about how he memed this way into presidency? You should definitely

1822
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:53,720
check it out. It's a great video. It just basically goes through Trump's whole history and how he has

1823
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:59,560
always basically propagated himself as a human meme to get into, you know, eventually into the

1824
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:07,400
presidency. But like, I think that the way that Trump looks at the world, he just says like,

1825
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:13,240
I know that this will work. I'm not going to listen to anybody telling me otherwise because I already

1826
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:19,080
see how this will work. And that tends to be the way that I look at things, which is like,

1827
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,640
all right, I know that like, for instance, getting into the industry as a writer, you know, like,

1828
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:28,680
all of us knew at some point in the past, oh, we could try to get published traditionally. Like,

1829
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:34,520
we could try to work for a company, get some kind of pro gig. But like, we saw that there was this

1830
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:40,280
alternative path of YouTube. And we went, okay, like, it seems like this is a way you can do it.

1831
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:44,280
So let's figure out like how we can experiment with this and find another way forward. And like,

1832
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:49,560
when we think about politics, I think people tend to think about it inside the box of what we

1833
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:54,840
expect to be the way things work. Instead of going, how do we rebuild this box? Like,

1834
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:59,800
how do we reshape this? Where can we start? What moves can we make? And there are certain things

1835
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:05,800
like the reason I hammer on about the alternative vote so much is not that I think it would like

1836
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:11,240
magically change the system or anything. It's just that it's such an obvious step in the right

1837
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:17,080
direction that would have so much power. And it's so easy to do. Because all we have to do

1838
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:23,960
is demand it as a people. Like, if everyone in America decided, hey, alternative vote is a

1839
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:28,040
better way than first pass the post because it means third parties have a chance of existing,

1840
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:34,120
then like, that's all it takes to change that. And I look at it and I just think this is so

1841
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:39,080
obviously a good solution, even if it does nothing in the long run, it would be worth

1842
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:45,960
having changed it because it's better as a system. Why aren't we doing it? Why aren't we

1843
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:52,680
doing it? Why aren't we making a big fuss about it? And it's because nobody thinks it can happen.

1844
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:56,440
Like, people don't convince themselves that those kind of changes can happen because they just think,

1845
01:43:56,440 --> 01:44:01,160
well, how do you even change something like that? Well, you just ask. You just tell the government

1846
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:07,160
to do it. You are the government, ultimately. So it's like everybody gets so caught up in

1847
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:12,120
participating in the political game instead of thinking outside of it. And like, obviously

1848
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:17,080
Bloomberg is thinking outside of it, but the way he's doing it is so cynical and so

1849
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:21,560
transparent that everybody who looks at it goes, oh, well, this is like gross, you know.

1850
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:25,240
Guys, can I get in for a second here? Because, okay, this whole discussion has been very interesting

1851
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:31,960
to listen to. But every single thing all of you guys have said so far doesn't vibe with me because

1852
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:37,080
it is all inherently, and I know these words have tons of meanings and, you know, whatever,

1853
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:42,600
to me, everything you're saying, including you did, seems super left-wing. And by that I mean,

1854
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:47,480
you guys are all talking about what the government should be doing. Whereas, as you were saying,

1855
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:52,440
Ben, what does it mean to be left versus right? I definitely just approached this whole conversation

1856
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:57,000
from a different perspective because I have the one fundamental belief I have that people

1857
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,200
just basically do everything better than the government, and we should not expect them to

1858
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:05,800
solve our problems because they're just shitty at it and worse.

1859
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:08,280
Wait, nothing I was saying was implying that the government should do anything.

1860
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:11,240
Everything you were saying is about how we need to change the system politically. Now,

1861
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:15,160
maybe you're saying by destroying the government or minimizing it, is that what you meant?

1862
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,400
I'm an anarchist. I'm all for destroying the government.

1863
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:18,280
Oh, okay, okay, fair enough.

1864
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,920
Let everybody do what they want. I would say that my...

1865
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:24,920
Kind of not exactly how I would define anarchism, but...

1866
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:29,960
Well, what I think would be ideal would be to just have,

1867
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:39,080
you know, we don't need a government. We just need everybody to not fuck with each other, you

1868
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,800
know? I mean, I agree, but how do you enforce that? That's the question.

1869
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:50,280
Let me throw this at you and see if it sticks. All right. Now, I agree that it is bad for the

1870
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:55,960
government to control people. I agree that if the government is stepping in and telling you

1871
01:45:55,960 --> 01:46:01,880
what to do and they are a force, if they are a totalitarian force that is in control of everything,

1872
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:11,480
that is bad. However, my issue is that power can accrete anywhere, and it is theoretically possible

1873
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:18,600
that individuals, such as like a private ownership of a business, Amazon, for example,

1874
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:24,920
or any other big corporation, or corporations in general, they have the potential to accrue

1875
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:30,680
power, and that is basically becomes oppressive just like a government does.

1876
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:36,680
So, while I agree that it's bad for the government to be too powerful, I think it is totally possible,

1877
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:43,160
and I would say that it is probably happening now, that private corporations and individuals are

1878
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:47,560
becoming authoritarian in their own, right, and exerting undue influence over the public.

1879
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:53,800
And the only way to fight back at them, I think, would be through government regulation,

1880
01:46:54,520 --> 01:47:00,680
because if private industry, private interests are all aligned with each other against the public,

1881
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:04,360
then what instrument does the public have to fight? I mean, strikes?

1882
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:11,240
Ideally, not buying things from bad companies would help.

1883
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:14,040
I understand that. I understand that, but like...

1884
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,560
It's hard. It's very difficult.

1885
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:16,280
People use our goods.

1886
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,320
I mean, the reason we have government is...

1887
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:22,520
When you vote with your wallets, when you vote with your wallet, people with bigger wallets get

1888
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:27,880
more votes. And the people with big wallets all have class solidarity with each other.

1889
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:31,640
All the rich are ideologically aligned with each other against everyone else.

1890
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:36,680
I mean, the biggest threat, I think, to the ability to not have a government is the lack of

1891
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:43,640
education, the lack of the ease with which those who have power can control the upbringing and

1892
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:47,640
the knowledge that is had by those who are, you know, grow up in the system.

1893
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:52,520
They can control how we think about the world, what power we think we have.

1894
01:47:53,880 --> 01:48:00,840
They teach us to be docile and to follow the script and follow society by their rules,

1895
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,520
so that they can keep it organized.

1896
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:07,640
And I think that whether you find comfort in that or not depends on, A,

1897
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:13,960
how happy are you in this system, which the average person obviously is, and to at least

1898
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:20,760
enough of an extent that they participate. And also, like, how brave are you? Because

1899
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:27,560
those of us who don't like the system, we don't like it because of the limitations it puts on us

1900
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:32,520
in what we can do with our lives. And there's a lot of people who would probably say,

1901
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:37,480
I don't want to be able to do those things. I would happily forego my ability to do these

1902
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:42,360
things in order to be safer, to have the government have more control over my life,

1903
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:47,880
because I trust them, they are better at keeping me safe than I am. And for me,

1904
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:52,360
I don't feel that way, because the government makes the lifestyle that I want to lead

1905
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:58,680
put me in danger. A lifestyle that would not be dangerous if not for the fact that it's illegal.

1906
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:03,480
Like smoking, buying drugs or something. Like buying drugs, like A-Cab.

1907
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:09,000
Yeah, just, I mean, that's the perfect example just on its own. I can't legally,

1908
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:16,040
can't buy weed here. There's no harm in me smoking it and consuming it and buying it because it's,

1909
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:21,720
I mean, it's legal in tons of places, but they make me a criminal. They make my actions dangerous.

1910
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:26,760
Look, even somebody like me, despite what I've said before, I am absolutely prepared to discuss,

1911
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:31,960
I do not believe in no government, I am not an anarchist. I am in favor of a small force that

1912
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:37,080
just like, the society doesn't completely collapse and fall in on itself. And potentially,

1913
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:43,080
just as an example, maybe if we legalized heroin or some magic super drug of fantasy,

1914
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:46,600
like maybe that would cause all of society to collapse because everyone just does that.

1915
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:49,400
That's what Pete wants to do. He wants to legalize all drugs.

1916
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:53,640
I mean, I am not convinced that such a thing exists, but like if we knew that would happen,

1917
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:57,480
I would be for the government preventing that happening personally, because I don't want

1918
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:03,000
society to collapse. That is a net bad, I would say. So for things like that, like I'm totally

1919
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,240
on board, but like there's other things, like the whole idea of businesses being overly powerful

1920
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:12,520
and stuff, that's probably true in many ways, and we should fix those things. But I mean,

1921
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:16,520
there are definitely fundamental disagreements. I know we've previously discussed about just the

1922
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:22,600
existence of billionaires, and I guess giant corporations as well, being inherently immoral,

1923
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:28,600
whereas I just don't agree that just the, I need tangible examples of what they're doing to police

1924
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:33,720
and could someone go to the point? Could someone reach the point where like this

1925
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:38,120
company has done so many bad things, it needs to cease existing, because I also believe that with

1926
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:42,040
criminals, I'm for execution if they do enough bad stuff. Same thing with businesses. If they do

1927
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:47,320
enough bad stuff, break it down. But until that, like Amazon has Amazon, for example,

1928
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:54,920
to so much bad, we should destroy it. I would argue that their profits alone constitute a,

1929
01:50:54,920 --> 01:51:00,200
what should be a crime. Maybe. I think. I would need to see some data. It's not so much like

1930
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:07,000
having a lot of money literally makes you do evil things. It's the whole system of capitalism

1931
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:15,640
that encourages a, you know, it leads to certain outcomes when, you know. Are you talking about

1932
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:21,320
like unrestrained rampant capitalism with no caps? Yeah, like, I mean, the whole thing with

1933
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:27,640
fossil fuels being, you know, like climate change, there's no incentive for them to stop

1934
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:33,320
getting that cheap, easy fuel from, from under the sea and all that. They're still going to use oil

1935
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:41,800
because it's good for money. And like, there's not really an incentive to heal sick people if they

1936
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:48,200
aren't, you know, they don't get a lot of money back. There's way more money in like an ongoing

1937
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:51,480
treatment as opposed to a cure, for example. So that could be bad incentives. Do you know about

1938
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:56,120
what's going on right now in Canada with the Wutsueten? I think I might be saying it wrong,

1939
01:51:56,120 --> 01:52:02,280
the Wutsueten, like, tribe of native people. Okay, well, there is a, there was a little,

1940
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:09,560
it is a, it is an independent territory. It has never ceded control to Canada. Canada does not

1941
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:16,200
rule it, but some fucking oil company wants to put a like toxic oil pipeline directly through

1942
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:22,920
their territory to make money. They do not have the right to do this legally. And yet, and yet,

1943
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:28,360
like the Wutsueten people like made like truck blockades to like block the company, because

1944
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:32,120
the company just wanted to try to do it anyway. The people there like fought back, they set up

1945
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:37,640
blockades to like prevent them from doing it. And Canada responded, they sent the Royal Canadian

1946
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:43,080
Mountain, the Royal Mounted Canadian Police or the RMCP or whatever, they sent the cops in to

1947
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:48,920
like fucking use lethal force to just fucking genocide these people, just like kick their

1948
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:53,880
fucking asses and be like, no, it doesn't matter that we like, we're just, we're just gonna, no,

1949
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:58,440
they can just do it now. I know you're, they're not allowed to, but we want them to. So they're,

1950
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:01,560
they're just, they're just gonna do it. Is there more to this story than just being,

1951
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:05,720
well, there's been a, well, there's been a huge backlash against it, like on the internet.

1952
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:08,680
Was this recent? Was this a recent thing? Yeah, this was like last week.

1953
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:14,840
Okay. Okay. Well, look, based on the facts provided, look, I agree, I would not, I would

1954
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:19,640
like oppose that with whatever levers of power I have, because that sounds bad as described.

1955
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:27,400
So, I mean, I'm with you, I'm with you. I mean, this is a particularly bold and barefaced example

1956
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:34,120
of like the ruling class and the government and the, the, the, you know, big corporations,

1957
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:39,400
the interests of capital, just like, just like, just nakedly fucking over people.

1958
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:45,400
I haven't talked about, I'm still utilitarian and I, so I don't think I'm not an anarcho capitalist

1959
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:50,680
despite the memes. I don't think people just do anything. There has to be some checks, but I'm,

1960
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:54,360
I'm not a scholar. I don't know the specifics. And you know what, I've got a confession to make

1961
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:58,680
for these stuff, you know, all the stuff that we've been talking about, I'll tell you,

1962
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:05,000
I'm strongly considering voting for Trump. And I'll tell you why. It is, it is because

1963
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,280
exactly as you said, Ben, when it comes to more government control of things versus less,

1964
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:15,240
ideologically, I just know super clearly which side I'm on and which I would want to win the day

1965
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:21,720
ultimately. I'm not for no government. I'm not for like bad things. I think we would agree on 95

1966
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:27,720
percent of every single thing we want to have happen. I just don't think that on these, on these,

1967
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:34,120
everything seems generally good in America, the localized place where things are right now.

1968
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:39,240
And I don't know, like I just haven't been presented with a case that anything that other

1969
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:44,040
people would do would make the world a better place, which is my main goal. So it's fine,

1970
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:50,600
it's fine for the middle class probably, it's fine for the one percent. Yeah, the, yeah, the

1971
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:56,680
shrinking middle class, the shrinking middle class is doing pretty, is doing reasonably well

1972
01:54:56,680 --> 01:55:05,960
for now. We could use, poor people could use healthcare, I think. Also, the minimum wage

1973
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:12,200
should be higher because people work in these fucking like slave, slave wages, like Uber jobs,

1974
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:17,000
gig economy. I just don't think that the government incentive system presented is a better

1975
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,640
solution to make the world a better place overall. In the absence, in the absence of any like raising,

1976
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:27,320
federal raising of the minimum wage, we've got like increasing, increasing wealth inequality,

1977
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:32,840
and we've got fucking the GDP rising while like these standard of living drops.

1978
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:37,480
Well, I just haven't been presented with solutions that make me think they'll make the

1979
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:44,520
world better. But I'm just curious, Nate, why, like what have you heard from Trump that makes

1980
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:49,880
you think he would be good to vote for? I will be completely honest, I don't follow politics

1981
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:55,400
subjectly at all. Oh, here it is again. Here's this shit again. Look, like you said, Ben, we all

1982
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:59,640
know our core ideology. I'm for a smaller government. I know which side that is. Why do you think Trump

1983
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:05,640
is for small government? I don't think so. The guy just fucking completely overreaches his

1984
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:08,520
presidential power. What are my options? Vote libertarian that'll lose? Trump is basically an

1985
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:13,720
authoritarian. He'll just do whatever he wants. He doesn't care about this. Well, I mean, less,

1986
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:17,880
some more than others. Anyway, I don't think Bernie's an authoritarian. Bernie's pro-labor.

1987
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:24,760
Bernie is considered one of the more libertarian candidates. I feel like if you have not gone

1988
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:32,120
into any depth to see what the policies are, you shouldn't vote. I agree. Well, I agree. I would

1989
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:35,960
not cast a vote today because I don't have enough information. If you go into, if you research what

1990
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:41,320
Trump is saying on whoever the Democratic Party is and you say, well, you know what, I do still

1991
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:46,680
prefer Trump, then that's fine. But the fact that you don't even follow it in any way and you just

1992
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:51,560
assume that Trump is your guy. For what it's worth, there's not much reason to even think about it

1993
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:57,720
yet because as much fun as we all are getting hyped in these primaries, speaking for me personally,

1994
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:03,240
I've literally never watched any primary debates or anything until this election,

1995
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:08,360
and it's only because I'm with May who gives a fuck. I would not, I didn't even know about the

1996
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:12,920
primaries until the last election. I did not know that was a thing that they didn't just select

1997
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:17,400
their guy. I also was only vaguely aware of the process of the election before 2016.

1998
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:22,440
All of this is just because Twitter now is politics Valhalla, which I'm fine with because

1999
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:28,520
it's hilarious. Now that I follow nothing but what I'm going to call woke, but not what you're

2000
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:34,280
thinking when you think woke accounts, it's been great. I follow Moon Cult and

2001
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:41,000
guys like Michael Tracy. I don't actually follow him. He tweets too much. There are certain people

2002
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:47,800
on Twitter who, not that I trust them as in I think everything they say is true, but I trust

2003
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:53,720
them to be politics I want to follow, essentially. Everybody's got an agenda. Nobody's perfect.

2004
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:56,040
What are we supposed to do? Look, I'm not going to count your vote.

2005
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:58,440
Yeah, so just vote Trump. Simple.

2006
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:00,840
Life's going pretty good. Yeah, seems fine.

2007
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:05,000
Horrible. Absolutely nightmare. Let me say one last thing about,

2008
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,040
I want to say one last thing. Hey, can you guys hear me?

2009
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:16,280
Yes, now we can. Okay. One last thing about Bloomberg is that, oh, fuck, was it? Oh, yeah.

2010
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:17,560
He's actually a giant balloon.

2011
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:28,200
Bloomberg is a great dipstick, if you know what I mean, for liberals, right? Because a lot of

2012
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:33,400
people really hate Trump. A lot of people can't stand Trump, but a lot of those same people

2013
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:36,920
are fine with Bloomberg, even though he's just as much of an authoritarian,

2014
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:42,440
just as much of a racist, misogynist, douchebag, just as much of a piece of shit as Trump is.

2015
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:46,520
Well, it's not like ability voting because they don't have to see it. With Bloomberg,

2016
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:52,600
Bloomberg acts presidential. He puts up a nice front. He's polite on Twitter, right?

2017
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:58,360
Comparatively. And a lot of shit libs are like, oh, thank God, a return to normalcy.

2018
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:01,240
They don't care about what he's actually going to do. They don't care about any

2019
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:06,440
material consequences. They're just like, Trump is ugly. Trump is offensive.

2020
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:09,240
I don't like seeing him. As long as I don't have to see him,

2021
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:13,720
Bloomberg, if Bloomberg, I won't have to think about it as much because I won't hear as much

2022
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:18,200
about it. Thank God. And it's a very sad state of affairs that we live in. And everyone that

2023
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:23,400
supports Bloomberg should be put on a blacklist. And let me be clear. Anybody in the comments is

2024
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:26,280
going to be like, oh, my God, Nate's going to vote Trump. Shut the fuck up. I'm not voting for

2025
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:30,440
anyone. I'll tell you, if I had to vote today, I would blindly vote for the libertarian candidate.

2026
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:32,680
That's what I would do today. Oh, you should vote for vermin supreme.

2027
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:37,960
Well, who's that guy? I forget. He's the guy who wears the boot. He's the presidential guy.

2028
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:43,560
Who wears the boot on his head. Let's get him up to 1% for the giant rat party.

2029
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:48,840
I followed vermin supreme on Twitter the other day, but then I had to immediately

2030
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:53,320
unfollow him because he tweets too much. He was retweeting something every five minutes.

2031
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:56,440
Nothing worse than somebody you follow because they're cool, but then they just tweet too much

2032
01:59:56,440 --> 02:00:01,320
bullshit and they water it down. Yeah, it's the worst. All right, well, let's go to voicemails.

2033
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:06,360
Let's fucking do it. I got them all right here. I test this beforehand. So hopefully they work

2034
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:12,360
as they sometimes do and you ladies and gentlemen can leave your voicemail at the speak pipe link

2035
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:16,680
down below. All right, what do we got first? Oh, I'm very excited for this one. This is my favorite

2036
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:21,480
voicemail. How many? How many we got today? There's like five. There's like only five. Okay. So first

2037
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:27,640
one is simply titled, fuck you, munchy. Is this better be about dads? Munchy, you're a real son

2038
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:32,600
of a bitch. You know that? You know that you piece of fucking garbage used to be one of my favorite

2039
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:38,440
members. But this last episode, every episode that you've been on recently has just been garbage.

2040
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:45,240
Somebody says that you do that. You do that. You do what I just did. You're a son of a

2041
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:48,840
bitch. You're a snake in the grass rat bastard. You'll never fucking hear this because you're

2042
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:54,280
not going to be on the podcast. I'm all about the self improvement. We're like, I'm so fucking intelligent.

2043
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:04,680
Damn. I wish Munchy were here to defend himself. If only he was here. But I guess this is, we'll

2044
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:10,120
have to take his word for it. He's too busy stealing dads. It was like an actually scathing

2045
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:14,440
criticism kind of, but it was embedded in such a funny sounding voicemail. I just, I just enjoyed it.

2046
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:21,640
I hope he hears that and gets offended enough to come on next episode and respond. Me too. Me too.

2047
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:27,400
We can only pray. All right, what do we got? Next one, we've got a professional podcast

2048
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:32,680
procrastinator. Okay, take it away. I think this one was kind of quiet. So turn up your volume. All

2049
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:38,200
right, go. So I'm about 10 episodes beyond the procrastiners podcast. Just finished watching

2050
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:44,280
Pokemon Sucks. Now, if I were to watch the rest of the PCP episodes right now, how much of that

2051
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:48,600
spicy YouTube bread money would be going to our ripple overlords instead of you guys?

2052
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:55,800
Mmm, all of it. That's it. Yeah, right now, all of it. So for people in this guy's position,

2053
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:01,640
as of the recording of, of, yeah, it's still in the hands of Brad Garlinghouse. We don't

2054
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:06,040
have it back yet. Hopefully this will, this statement this week, hopefully this statement

2055
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:13,880
will be incorrect. And when you hear it, we can only hope if this episode or whatever, if you're

2056
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:21,000
listening to a new episode past like 195 on the PCP, then you're good. If not, I mean, it's fine.

2057
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,160
That person will get the ad revenue on their channel, I guess, which is also fine. Okay,

2058
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:29,720
that's it. So there you go. Don't watch other stuff on a channel until it's back. Fuck them.

2059
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:35,320
All right. Next one, we've got, oh, I think this is a longer title, but I just called it proof.

2060
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:39,560
It's proof of something, but I can't remember what. Let's find out. Go.

2061
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:49,080
Hello, PCP. I hope you know I have your grapefruit held hostage. And if you ever want to see it again,

2062
02:02:49,080 --> 02:03:00,120
unharmed and unsweetened, then you will deliver 1000 pounds of bread and 1000 pounds of garlic

2063
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:06,920
to the Washington Monument three hours after listening to this. Your beloved grapefruit won't

2064
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:14,120
be unsweetened for long. Click the link. There's a link I posted in the gross disgusting audio

2065
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:22,040
links to a DeviantArt image that this man uploaded. It's cute. Quandary poser, I guess. Oh, at least

2066
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:28,520
he's using zero calorie sweetener. Oh, thank God. Thank God. That's good to say. So he's got a spoon

2067
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:32,520
up to a grape, or he's going to eat it with a spoon with sweetener. Oh, God. I noticed that his first

2068
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:39,400
thing says 1000 loaves of bread, which is different from pounds. That's probably less. We should

2069
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:43,080
probably play it safe and go for pounds, because I'm pretty sure a loaf of bread is less than a

2070
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:51,320
pound. Also, the plural is loaves with V. That's true. That's true. How is he expecting to feed

2071
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:57,560
that grapefruit the sweetener when he taped his mouth shut? I think he's going to have to cut it

2072
02:03:57,560 --> 02:04:05,240
open. He's going to have to surgery. Is he going to joker the grapefruit? He's going to be bifurcated,

2073
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:10,600
yeah. Well, we'll see what happens. Good luck to us. Poor disenfranchised grapefruit.

2074
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:16,520
He never had a chance. I really like his face. Let me see. Yeah, there's actually pretty good

2075
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:22,600
art on there. This is not bad. All right. We've got a completely unfunny voicemail from a concerned

2076
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:29,640
citizen. Let's see what he has to say. What else is new? Hey, PCP, it's me. One of your brainless

2077
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:36,120
fucking fans. I just wanted to call and ask you about the Radcon 4 fan meetup thing that you guys

2078
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:41,320
were talking about two weeks ago. You're going to set a date for that, because if I'm going to buy

2079
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:48,040
a plane ticket to go halfway across the continent to go fucking look at you and then murder you.

2080
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:54,680
If I'm going to do that, I kind of need to buy a plane ticket in advance, and it gets

2081
02:04:54,680 --> 02:05:01,320
more expensive, the closer to the date you are. Could I know when that happens? That's a great

2082
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:08,040
point. That's a great question. First of all, the Radcon, we will be at the place

2083
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:16,040
doing Radcon stuff from the 6th to the 16th. It's in that window. So if you buy a plane ticket

2084
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:23,800
to be, where were we thinking we are? Somewhere on Virginia Beach? We're in that town. We should

2085
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:32,440
probably do it on a Saturday somewhere in that stretch. We had a thing on a calendar that we

2086
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:38,760
were thinking of a possible meet update near the end. Where did I put that? Yeah. Okay, because

2087
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:44,360
let me see. March 6th to 16th. Okay, 16th is a Monday. Okay, so like Saturday and Sunday. So

2088
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:49,640
Munch is leaving Sunday night. So maybe Saturday or Sunday at the end of the con. So at the end?

2089
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:53,560
So like we have all our stuff done and we can just kind of, I don't know, hang out.

2090
02:05:54,600 --> 02:06:00,760
14th. Yeah, that makes more sense. Maybe should we commit to the 14th Saturday

2091
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:07,560
sometime during that day? We could do it Sunday too. We could do it the next day. I think Saturday

2092
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:12,600
is a better idea. And I think, yeah, I do think we could do it on this. There's two Saturdays,

2093
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:17,880
the 7th and the 14th. What do you think? I just don't know. Yeah, I think we should do it on the

2094
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:24,120
14th. Okay, yeah. Okay, there's four of us here. Digi is muted for some reason, but I'll assume he

2095
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:32,120
agrees. Right, so the 14th, Saturday, March 14th. All right, we're committing. That'll be the day

2096
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:36,840
when we have a meet up and we are gonna do one. We should make an announcement outside of this

2097
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:41,160
episode so that it comes out. I will make an update on the Kickstarter confirming that and I'll let,

2098
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:44,360
I don't know, Tom and Munchy know that we're gonna do that. I guess it's not as critical that we

2099
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:49,960
pick a place as long as we know that it's gonna be in Virginia Beach, but we should. Okay, yeah,

2100
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:56,920
we can commit to that Saturday, March 14th in the area of Virginia Beach somewhere on that day.

2101
02:06:56,920 --> 02:07:01,640
If you want to come and do your stuff that's on you, that's not for us. It's not our problem.

2102
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:08,520
We'll keep you posted here and on Twitter. Yes, we will. It's at tpcrastinators.

2103
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:13,560
About where exactly and when and what the times are. There you go. That'll be the day.

2104
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:19,960
Okay, well, let's update the Kickstarter with that information too. So that's in stone somewhere,

2105
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:26,120
but okay, we got one more voicemail and this one is from Boyan. Let's hear Boyan finale,

2106
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:32,760
as I'm sure it's called. Go. Guys, for the special occasion of episode 200,

2107
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:38,120
could you please consider returning written questions? Some of us really appreciate that.

2108
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:42,520
And maybe, maybe, maybe question mark live questions.

2109
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:48,440
Live question, like doing the PCP live.

2110
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:55,480
Well, the PC, well, episode 200 is going to be the streamed live at Radcon, right?

2111
02:07:55,480 --> 02:08:00,600
Yeah, I don't think we 100% settled on that because we'd have to do the 200 and one and like

2112
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:05,480
202 episodes first. Yeah, we said we were just going to skip 200. Okay, if you want, all right,

2113
02:08:05,480 --> 02:08:10,440
that's fine. Okay, that sounds funny. It sounds amusing to me. Okay, we will probably do, I think,

2114
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:18,200
okay, let's do like live questions via super chat, which are... Yeah, yeah. That's what we did last

2115
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:21,640
time, right? We're going to have streams going... I think he was thinking that we wouldn't do it

2116
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:26,920
all the time anyway, so. Yeah, that's, it'll be basically like a live stream, but we'll love

2117
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:31,880
probably Victor's camera set up like we did last time and do it. That was so strange. I remember

2118
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:37,240
watching, then, the way he zooms in right on our faces, like, oh god, it's too close. It's too close.

2119
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:42,440
He was very close. You could give him notes, if you like, to be less close. Good memes, though,

2120
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:47,480
good memes from that. So, okay, since we're doing things like out of order that way and we'll do

2121
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:53,240
200 at Radcon, yes, you will in fact get a chance to say things to us. Although, I guess on the

2122
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:56,920
larger point, I mean, as for bringing back written questions on like Twitter and stuff,

2123
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:02,360
I don't know, bro. I'm not really feeling it. It seems like a lot of work and I don't care.

2124
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:04,520
Well, it's not a lot of work. It's just, I don't care.

2125
02:09:05,720 --> 02:09:08,680
Yeah, I'd have to go somewhere else. Twitter questions are sweet about it.

2126
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:13,480
In fact, it's because it's less work that the quality of the questions is usually so much worse.

2127
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:17,960
Yes, that's why I was going to say the skill floor for asking a speak pipe question is higher,

2128
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:20,920
and I think it self-selects for quality to a certain extent.

2129
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:24,680
And I'm just reading minds here, but I don't know if this guy's maybe thinking that because he's

2130
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:29,000
got a thick accent or it makes it harder to like, I mean, I'm sure whoever you are, you could make

2131
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:33,720
a good voicemail with whatever good question. If you really, really needed to, you could do

2132
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:40,280
like a text-to-speech robot voice to say the thing. Maybe he just doesn't want to put in the work,

2133
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:44,200
which I guess. Look, guys, this guy can clearly speak English. I don't think that's the issue.

2134
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:48,440
He was wondering. I don't know what he meant there. I mean, if there are any other people who

2135
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:52,840
have struggling with English or like have a thick accent and they feel like they wouldn't get

2136
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:56,600
understood, they can use a robot. Some people I think legitimately have that concern, I think,

2137
02:09:56,600 --> 02:10:03,080
when I call in. I don't know. But we're doing what we're doing. Use text-to-speech. I mean,

2138
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:07,880
you can figure it out. Just be creative here. That's it. That's our last voicemail for the day.

2139
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:12,600
So again, if you want to leave one, that is the speak pipe link down below. Click on that,

2140
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:18,040
and leave us a voicemail. There you go. Let me see. We got a bonus episode coming up soon.

2141
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:22,280
It'll be the bonus episode before Radcon, just like a couple of days before, and that'll be

2142
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:29,160
on the 1st of March, and you can get that by pledging $5 to the Kickstarter at

2143
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:36,760
what is it? Patreon.com slash TheProCrastinators, $5 bonus episodes, $1. You're in the bonus lounge,

2144
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:42,600
or the normal talky discord lounge with all of us hanging out good times, and pledge as much as

2145
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:47,960
you want. Do $1,000. Why not? I beseech you. Oh, and you know what? It'll be

2146
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:54,440
funny to see. There will be a PCB episode that comes out at 2pm normally, and we get into our

2147
02:10:54,440 --> 02:11:01,240
Airbnb at Radcon 4 at 4pm, so that episode will probably just be rapping as we get to the house,

2148
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:06,040
and we'll probably set up a live stream real fast. So on that day, on March 6th, you'll see

2149
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:11,960
a bunch of stuff coming that evening, I'm sure. And also, follow us again for more info and updates

2150
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:17,000
at TPCrastinators on Twitter. Updates about more stuff about the live meetup probably. Maybe we'll

2151
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,960
iron that out fully on the Kickstarter. If not, TPCrastinators, follow us there for more info,

2152
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:26,600
and yeah, I guess that's about it. Anything else? And we'll let you know on there when we get the

2153
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:33,000
channel back as well. Go check out The Lord of Ghosts, Chapter 3 out on you. Yes, I have not read

2154
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:40,600
it yet. I'm very excited to check it, to scope it, to peep it, to scopio-peepio it. Yeah. Go read

2155
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:46,360
Chapters 1 through 4 of The Road to Radcon 4, Chapter 5 coming soon. That's right, Chapter 5

2156
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:51,160
will be out very soon. Pledge to my Patreon to get early access to the pre-finale Slime and

2157
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:59,400
Punishment updates coming out now. Patreon.com slash Ben Saints. Don't wear it out. And my channel

2158
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:05,480
will have videos again soon. If we don't get this channel, if we don't get the PCP back,

2159
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:16,120
I assume we'll stream the Radcon countdown to the end of the Kickstarter on your channel.

2160
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:22,120
Maybe. We could do it on Twitch or something. I don't really want to do it on my main channel.

2161
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:24,760
I guess we could. I don't know. Because it's closer to the Radcon

2162
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:33,080
like viewer base, I guess. That's true. People would know the PCP would know your channel more

2163
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:38,200
than they would know your Twitch, I think. Yeah. I mean, definitely true. Plus, there'd be way

2164
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:43,880
more viewers just being on that platform. I would be in favor of that if you'd be okay with it.

2165
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:48,440
Okay. We'll tell you what. I'm not super opposed. We'll iron that out and we will let people know

2166
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:53,400
where it's going to be. Yeah. Okay. We'll decide that stuff. Well, it will have already happened.

2167
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:57,480
Oh, yeah. Right. Oh, yeah. That's totally inside baseball right now.

2168
02:12:57,480 --> 02:13:00,520
Lol. You will have seen it. And oh, won't that be exciting for you?

2169
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:04,680
All right. Anyway, we're out of here. Thanks for funding Kickstarters.

2170
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:09,800
Road to Radcon 4. Radcon 4 Paradise, everybody. We're going to make all that good shit.

2171
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:12,680
It's going to be good. You're going to enjoy it. I promise you.

Thank you, everybody, for supporting. $20,349 right now. My God. It just keeps going.

2173
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:25,640
It just keeps happening. Well, thanks, everybody. And hopefully we hit that 2-2-2 goal.

2174
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:29,800
Radcon 4 is going to be sick as fuck. Yes, the 2-2-2 goal. Will we have hit it by now?

2175
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:35,320
I am optimistic, but we'll see. As am I. All right. We'll see you next week, everybody. Bye.

02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:42,520
Losers.
