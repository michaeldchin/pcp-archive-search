1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Can I intro? Please, go ahead.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What's up everyone on the episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Why'd you hit me? Listen, we all have our sins that we have to atone for, Ben.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We aren't all free of the vices of humanity. We have to be punished.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And in this glorious Wild West saying that this episode takes place,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and yes, that's right, we are in 1986, aka the pure barbarity of man in nature.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm able to do whatever I want to you, my wife. God ordains it.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You know, Munchy, I'm glad that it's the end of history, and we've scientifically discovered

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that all morality derives from religion and that there's no God, and therefore everything is permissible.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's very liberating.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I agree. We also have Nate.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A friend to all the peoples of the earth, but most especially what is known as the honorary Aryan race, the Japanese.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
They're my favorite.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What? Any particular reason? I can't imagine anything that they've done that's worth.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Name one thing done by the Japanese or the Aryans.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll tell you what, Ben.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Or the Aryan's effect.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In a supporting role in 2003's smash hit starring Tom Cruise, The Last Samurai,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and gotta say, big hit. Big success. Way to go.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Actually, speaking point for later, you know what the Japanese also did? They did...

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's one piece you're hearing right there. We'll get into that in just a second.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But we also have Meij.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, yeah. I'm back, and this is what I come back to. Okay.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Meij, you've been... You're our prodigal son. You've been gone for...

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're our hell of Troy, Meij.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You're our hell of Troy.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're our Joan of Arc. You're our Steve Brule.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where you been?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I've been in Lithuania as I usually do during the summer.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Stuff happened. A lot of stuff. I don't want to talk about it.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But I'm back in the UK now, literally.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
She's been running drugs across the border for the cartels.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I've been gone for literally one episode, but I feel like it's been a lifetime

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
since I've ever talked into a microphone.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I feel like I've aged a century at the time that I've been gone.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now that I think about it, I'm actually surprised that you're here, Munch.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I was expecting you to be continuously occupied.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Aren't you on a road trip or something?

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All secrets will be revealed, but I have one thing to tell you right off the bat.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is the last PCPM recording in the house that I've spent my entire internet career in.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm leaving at 10PM this evening, and I will not come back until Christmas, if even.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If not for summer. This is the end of an era.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's actually happening. The wheels are in motion, and I'm going to college.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Literally, I'm heading to Boston tonight.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Actually, that's not entirely true. I'm heading to DC and then to Baltimore and then to Boston,

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
but the idea is there.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hey, aren't we all getting a bus together?

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We are. We're all going to be jammed out.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So after BronyCon, me, Ben, Cassie, and Hippo are all going to run the same Greyhound together,

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and it's going to be glorious, and we're going to have the whole place to ourselves,

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and we're going to force everyone else out.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We're taking the bus there, too, right, from Boston to Baltimore.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Nah, nah, I'm flying in.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You are?

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So I think you're, yeah, as is Gib, I think you guys are just taking the bus out together?

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Right?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay. All right.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So let's just be super clear.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Most of us, not Mage, but the bunch of us are going to be at BronyCon next week,

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
which might mean that this is one of the super rare occasions when no PCP gets made.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We're not quite sure how that's going to work out, but they're going to make it.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to go on my own.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Dude, we need like a, it's got to be the PCP, the PCP B-Listers, you know,

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
all the second-rate characters that nobody likes.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Digi, Jesse, Mage, Davoo.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
God, that sounds so much better than us.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Monkey Jones, Jeff.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Monkey Jones, Jeff.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can't tell you how sick I am of us.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Nino, Econ, the, you know, the gangs all here.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ben, why must you increase the sniper red dots on your face to more

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
than the already astounding 20 that it's at?

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Or I guess like 15,000 or whatever the Twitter followers have started on Avocados.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
God, well, I want it, I just, I want, I'd like him.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm like a little cat.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I like to fucking, I like to paw at them with my little paws.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ah, curiously killed the cat, they say.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hey, anyway.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm just asking questions.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You were right, Ben.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I was an original.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I know.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I got back from it.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I went to Chris State.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Originally, the plans were quite-

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What is, what is Chris State?

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, well, you know, cross the state means you go one way.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, Chris goes upwards.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Chris crossed them.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, all right.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So I went to Chris State.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You went, you went, you went, you went Chris Country skiing.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, basically.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And it was great.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I'll spare the details as a matter, but I went from my hometown of San Diego, my soon

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to be ex-wife of San Diego.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You capped any motherfuckers?

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I capped a few.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There were many instances.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh, one of my friends got scammed by a fake homeless person.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That was cool.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There were many people to cap.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There were many, there were many like, like unfortunate shadowy figures.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I assume you'd be, by that, you mean like TF2, like capture the flag like along the

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
way, just like capping territories and, you know, that's basically the case.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I mean, basically in between Los Angeles and San Francisco, there's, there's nothing

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
really of note other than Monterey, which we stopped in, but there's basically nothing

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
there.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So it was a lot of long driving and the only stop that we had on the second day while

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
we were going through that long, like five hour stretch of basic nothingness.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There was like a really like shit hard to describe tourist trap, which like, oh God,

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
it was like, it was, imagine a gift shop for a theme park and the theme park is themed

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
as the Wild West and it's only the gift shop and it's this really tacky antique shop.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The place is called Bravo Land.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's called Bravo Land.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Look it up if you can.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Johnny Bravo Land?

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Basically, Bravoville, the Bravilians call it, of course.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's this antique shop, but the only antiques are literal trash.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm talking used soda bottles.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That kind of stuff is on display.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, some of those are collectibles, I guess.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
For $10, you're going to get a used Dr. Pepper from 1980s.

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is that, is that worth $10?

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If it's some kind of collectible to some, perhaps, I don't know.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Maybe, I don't know if that's the logic or not.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There were rusty wrenches.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There were like, there were just like logs of wood that you could buy.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Was there an old Nokia in there?

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There's what?

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
An ancient Nokia pose.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No, there was no Nokia, unfortunately.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I would have just snapped that in a second.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That was great.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Here's the only thing I want to talk about about this.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Here's the only thing, is that I had a sequel to something that happened in Rome and something

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that I want to talk about on this very podcast.

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And that's, I fell back into my old, disgusting ways.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This was the Leaning Tower of Pisa 2.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The San Francisco Chinatown.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The Leaning Tower of Pisa 2, 9-11.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Basically.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now there's two of them.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Now there's two of them.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Listen, I didn't understand what the big deal was about 9-11,

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but now I understand after a personal tragedy has happened to me,

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I understand what it must be like to experience pain due to 9-11.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The San Francisco Chinatown.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I understand what it's like to experience pain, period.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's a fucking nightmare.

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The San Francisco Chinatown is a fucking nightmare.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Imagine the most generic tourist shops you can imagine.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Not anything themed towards China.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just get your key chains here, San Francisco.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, get your fucking giant's caps.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Who buys the generic New York tourist things?

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Who buys, like, I love San Francisco.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Or who buys, like, giant shirts?

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Like, who does this?

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What kind of person to be?

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The thing is, like, I actually asked myself that same question when I was in an airport.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And I thought, like, you know, they're marketing to the wrong people.

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They're marketing to the tourists.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But, like, I think the people who would buy such things

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
was probably people living in those places because they have pride in where they live.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So I'm confused.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You can only buy so many pieces of merchandise.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What's the merchandise you live?

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What's the merchandise we're talking about?

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We're talking about really tacky touristy things that say I love San Francisco

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and just have, like, pictures of California on them

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and that are just, like, I mean, in every other place.

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, here's the thing.

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The people that live around there, they might buy, like, one shirt to rep for their hometown.

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But the tourists, the tourists that want to show, like, how well-traveled they are,

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that's a continually refreshing resource.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There's going to be more of those guys every fucking day.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Day!

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Indeed.

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I guess.

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But I would totally buy an I Love Lafainia T-shirt.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Except no one would ever make such a garment under any circumstance.

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I want to get, sometimes I think about getting, like,

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
sometimes I think about getting, like, a map of the Boston T-System, like, tattooed on me.

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Dude, oh, okay.

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I want to team up so much.

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm looking at, like, right now I'm looking at a map of Boston that I got.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a really, like, cool, like, almost, like, three-dimensional, old-timey map.

197
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And it's sick as hell.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I would totally get, like, Boston merch.

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm way into that.

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Dude, Ben, you remember when we were in the traditional center?

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I would get one thing.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
When we saw those, like, play toy, like, T-trains that you could, like, buy for, like, your kid?

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I want, like, a full set of those.

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Look at this, look at this link in the description to the fucking thing that Mae just posted.

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, shit!

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Lithuania T-shirt.

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Pretty sick.

208
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Whoa!

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, my God.

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, I want it.

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Whoa!

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's, yeah.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's sick as hell.

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Hey, by the way, quick point.

215
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Quick point, because we met new PCB character Grace last week.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
My sister, who was on.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
My sister.

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
She's mine, damn.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Who are you?

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
All right.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But the point, I was just, I said to Grace, as I said before, like, the one tattoo, and

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
speaking of tattoos, that I ever thought of even possibly getting, was, like, the Joe

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Star Star on the Joe Star place on my shoulder.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, wow.

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And I just said to Grace, because she's a tattoo artist, and I just said to her, like,

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Grace, I just, I'm just curious, like, has anyone ever asked you for, like, and I describe

228
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,680
it's on this exact spot, and she's like, like, one week ago, this guy comes into my shop

229
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,000
and gets this exact same tattoo.

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And I was like, oh, I just felt the wind rush out of my face.

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And you were just like, oh, yeah, yeah.

232
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I mean, I mean, I'm sure you knew that you wouldn't be the only one.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But to have, to have, like, the first tattoo artist my sister, who I talked to, is like,

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
yes, this is extremely common.

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're a basic bitch.

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're not cool, Nate.

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're not interesting.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Your idea sucks.

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I mean, come on.

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You're talking about, like, a popular anime, right?

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Like, a mark on a character's body.

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
A mark on a character's body.

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Populars it is now.

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
God damn it.

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I read the manga.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Which anime?

247
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What anime?

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Joe Joe's Bizarre Adventure.

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe you've heard of it, Mage.

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, okay.

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah, Joe Joe.

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes.

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Ah, whatever.

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay, sorry, sorry.

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Anyway, Munchy, finish your tale, please.

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So Chinatown sucked, and it just was all that.

257
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Right, right.

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Also, a bizarre genre of store.

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't even know how to describe it.

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Like, money laundering ridden all over it.

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It just is a marble statue store with no cash register and no one manning it.

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Imagine you're on, like, a popular street, so just Chinatown.

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You turn into a store, it's full of, like, bronze and marble statues,

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and no one's inside of it.

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I guess someone's gonna make those.

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That is weird.

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh my God, Mage, that's the coolest piece of merch.

268
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Look at this fucking Lithuania basketball.

269
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Is the world exploding?

270
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No, it's being dunked.

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's being dunked.

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is like the Lithuania, like, actual Olympics basketball team jersey.

273
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Look at these skeletons.

274
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, I love it.

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, the skull dots.

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Holy shit.

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's crazy.

278
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Did these represent Lithuania in some way?

279
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Are skeletons integral to, like, the lore?

280
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Or is it the origin story?

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Basketball is like the second religion of Lithuania.

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Are you serious?

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They were one of Lithuania's original settlers, the skeletons, who played basketball.

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I had no idea.

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This second one was just the skeletons playing basketball.

286
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is like some big dog shit.

287
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think it's a variation of an original design in 1998 or something.

288
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm not sure, but this is like the original.

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It was really popular at that time, and people are bringing back it.

290
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This is incredible.

291
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Ridiculous.

292
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I didn't...

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I didn't...

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Is it all...

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is that...

296
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's so weird.

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I didn't know there were any European countries that gave a shit about basketball.

298
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, I mean...

299
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I wouldn't imagine.

300
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I guess Lithuania...

301
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Mage, you're known to be quite tall.

302
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Are Lithuanians tall?

303
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Is that why they play basketball?

304
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know.

305
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was pretty tall in comparison, but the guys were taller than me once they hit puberty,

306
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
so I guess we're kind of tall on average.

307
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And we were pretty good too.

308
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I see.

309
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
People who play basketball in Lithuania.

310
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, I suppose there's probably some Norse genes going on.

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They're Viking blood and whatnot.

312
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They didn't even know to dunk.

313
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I found out.

314
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I learned a term.

315
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I learned a historical term.

316
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Fuck.

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Lithuania is in the region called the Balkans, right?

318
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No.

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Baltics.

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Baltics.

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Fuck.

322
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I always confuse those two.

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Okay, nevermind.

324
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Baltic is the sea.

325
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, okay.

326
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I see.

327
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Balkans is the World War I.

328
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I learned what the word balkanize means.

329
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I think I'm thinking of...

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's like a...

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Down in like a Middle Eastern, like Russian, like Turkey kind of region.

332
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Balkanize a region means to divide it into mutually hostile states.

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Huh, okay.

334
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes, so that's something you don't want to happen.

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, like they did with India and Pakistan back in the day, right?

336
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's...

337
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I guess so.

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay.

339
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And like, I think this is what happened to a lot of the former USSR.

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You know what I'm saying?

341
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, all right.

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You go to Slavia.

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I learned this.

344
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I heard this word thrown around and now I know what it means and I feel intelligent.

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Good job, man.

346
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
My IQ points.

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I gained two IQ points.

348
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, the Balkans, I'm pretty sure they're like in the southern part of your...

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Let me see.

350
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They are.

351
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
They're just north of Greece.

352
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Looks like the Balkans are...

353
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
South of...

354
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania.

355
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Enough with the fucking geography lesson.

356
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's get back to the epic meme story.

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
All right.

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay.

360
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Meme away, my friend.

361
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
We're actually learning something for once.

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I hate learning and I love losing information.

363
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh, and Montenegro.

364
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Take it away.

365
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I forgot Montenegro.

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I forgot Montenegro.

367
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Everyone's favorite.

368
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I start dancing for Nate's amusement.

369
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's right.

370
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Tippity tap, tippity tap.

371
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Cool.

372
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Excellent.

373
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:42,440
Hey, by the way, as I said before, I'm leaving this house and I've built up such like a genuine

374
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,360
friendship with the people that staff my Chipotle.

375
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
They know me by name, by order.

376
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:59,320
I walked in to my Chipotle, my last visit and it seems like everyone was on staff.

377
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,600
There were like 20 people in the kitchen and that line for some bizarre reason.

378
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,240
It's like a small store and everyone like jumped up and said like, hey, double-stake

379
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,440
queso, double-stake quesos here.

380
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
I took my order.

381
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
They said, oh, like, oh, you're going to leave.

382
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Oh, you guys, you got to come back.

383
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
Wait, wait, wait.

384
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
They call you double-stake queso?

385
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,440
They call me double-stake queso.

386
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,160
Like when I said that it was my last day, like everyone was like upset and sad.

387
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,600
They gave me my meal for free.

388
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,440
They said, like, come back as soon as you can.

389
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Is that true?

390
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Did they really do that?

391
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
No, no, I'm serious.

392
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
I'm 100% dead serious, Nate.

393
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Hey, that's crazy.

394
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,960
I have an absolute kinship with Chipotle, with the Chipotle staff at my local venue.

395
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
And it's great.

396
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,480
The only family I've ever known is the only time I've really felt loved by another group

397
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
of people.

398
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
It's great.

399
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,760
Like, just like walking and having new people you've never talked to be like, hey, wait

400
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,520
a second, are you the double-stake queso guy?

401
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
I'm like, yeah, I am.

402
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,920
I am a double-stake queso guy.

403
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,760
Hey, hey, everyone, check it out.

404
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
It's that double-stake queso guy.

405
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Literally, that's happened, man.

406
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
That's literally happened.

407
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Like, oh, hey, guys.

408
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
It's double-stake queso.

409
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
He's here.

410
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,400
What a weird quirky order, double-stake and queso.

411
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Are you kidding me?

412
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,160
Wait, I genuinely don't feel the audacity.

413
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,000
Why are you double-stake queso?

414
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,480
Because the frequency of my visits is because I'm such a regular.

415
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
They know me by heart.

416
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
They know my order by heart.

417
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,760
Because in fact, the order itself is significant.

418
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,680
The fact that it happens like every day.

419
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,880
Chipotle shares your cultural and genetic background, an ungodly mix of the white man

420
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,120
and the red man, and out comes double-stake queso onto God's green earth, offending us

421
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
all with his presence.

422
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,560
Anyway, that's what I call my dick.

423
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
But delighting us as well.

424
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Gross.

425
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Delighting our humor.

426
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
Our four humors.

427
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
I'll miss them so.

428
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,080
I'll miss them from the bottom of my heart.

429
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,360
The Chipotle's in the east coast are terrible.

430
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,240
They're abjectly terrible and are disgusting.

431
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
They're like...

432
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
No base for comparison.

433
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
They're so bad.

434
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Yeah, I'll believe that.

435
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
I'll believe that.

436
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
West Coast Chipotle's are the way to go.

437
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
And I'm going to miss them.

438
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,240
The only family I've ever known that's upsetting.

439
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Well, that's the end of that chapter, I guess.

440
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Welcome to the east coast.

441
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Well, I'll come back.

442
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll get off the plane, I'll rush back into my Chipotle, and then I'll go to the grounds

443
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
where the Chipotle once stood.

444
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,800
And it's going to be like the dystopian wasteland from the end of Joe's garage.

445
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Music is going to be outlawed.

446
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Chipotle's going to be outlawed.

447
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm going to have to eat a Chipotle burrito in my imagination because there's no more

448
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
burritos to be eaten.

449
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
It's going to be like a barren, like it's going to be like a junkyard.

450
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,920
It's going to be just like death and decay all around me and just brown, rusting pipes

451
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,400
where the Chipotle once stood.

452
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,160
And I'm going to beg God, I'm going to drop down my knee and start bawling.

453
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm going to ask God for a burrito.

454
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,840
And it's going to be like, hey, is that double steak queso guy?

455
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,880
Hey, Jesus, go right, it's double steak queso guy.

456
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Uh, sad.

457
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
I know, literally.

458
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,480
Ben, you were looking really rowdy on Twitter yesterday.

459
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,160
Uh, yeah, my hair was supposed to be purple, but it ended up pink.

460
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Okay.

461
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Yes, I have pink hair now.

462
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,840
Um, the, the, I kind of don't want to make it purple though, because when it's like

463
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,880
dark, it's like, kind of looks like it's not, like it looks like you kind of, you can't

464
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,800
even tell that it's purple unless you sort of look at it like in the right lighting.

465
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,040
And that means yourself, or did you go to like, uh, I did, I did it myself.

466
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
I did it myself.

467
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Okay.

468
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Maybe, maybe you had a professional do it.

469
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,560
Maybe it would look good.

470
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,360
Uh, well, I'm not going to fucking do that.

471
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
You kidding me?

472
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,720
Well, do I, what do I look like I'm fucking Mr. fucking money bags over here?

473
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
All right.

474
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,120
Uh, uh, when it looks, well, it's purple, it looks like an accident, so I might just

475
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
keep it pink.

476
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
I don't know.

477
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
You know, that's, that's fair.

478
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,360
But I mean, we have to address the elephant in the room that, that killer morale has never

479
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
been lower.

480
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
It has never been lower than right now.

481
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,200
No, no, no, it's not the image.

482
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
It's kind of pinkish purple.

483
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
It's like a symbol.

484
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,760
Maybe it's the symbol of unity.

485
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
No, that's a lie.

486
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
That's not.

487
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Don't blow me on that.

488
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
It's the symbol of unity.

489
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
No unity.

490
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,880
So there is an unnamed, if you were to look at the chat, there's an unnamed individual

491
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,640
and I won't name any names.

492
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,360
He has pink hair.

493
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,080
He is looking at the camera aggressively.

494
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,080
He is breaking the law as vandalized a, a fire hydrant by posting a sticker claiming

495
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,560
that his heinous act of vaping is not a crime and he's wearing the smoking gun.

496
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,680
He's wearing a rowdy pride shirt.

497
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Tell me.

498
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
That's not right.

499
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,320
It's a pajama pants on with Japanese kanji plastered all over it.

500
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,040
He's crouching in the middle of a darkly-lit suburb.

501
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,640
It's shiny as you raise this.

502
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,320
That's literally rowdy.

503
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Tell me it's not right.

504
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
How's it not rowdy?

505
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Ben, tell me how it's not rowdy.

506
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Tell me how.

507
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Tell me how.

508
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Okay.

509
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Well, he's wearing this shirt.

510
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
Shut the fuck up.

511
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
You piece of shit.

512
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
He's wearing this shirt ironically and he didn't put that sticker there.

513
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
He found that sticker there.

514
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Someone else had put it there and he, he felt a sense of camaraderie and he had to express

515
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
it.

516
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
This is the most rowdy image I've ever seen in my time.

517
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
That's my read.

518
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
This is my personal image.

519
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,680
I can see it in his eyes.

520
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Listen, photographs are all about cultivation.

521
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
They're all about exclusion.

522
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
There he is.

523
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Maze posted it.

524
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
Maze found it.

525
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:17,240
Ben, okay, so what has made you want to be a total fucking faggot?

526
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,600
A total fucking asshole.

527
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Yeah.

528
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,760
I just, I thought it'd be funny.

529
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,720
Will the descent ever stop?

530
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
No.

531
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Into madness.

532
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
I just, I'm uncovering new depths.

533
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,440
I'm uncovering new depths to sink to every single day.

534
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Okay.

535
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Wow.

536
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
This re-encouraging.

537
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,240
If I remember correctly, I think Ben has described wanting to do things of this nature

538
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
for a while.

539
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Of course.

540
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,800
I wanted to, I wanted to do like a purple hair and killer thing, cop killer thing.

541
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Right, right.

542
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
And then I ended up liking how the pink looked better.

543
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
It doesn't mean anything.

544
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Yeah.

545
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
We'll see.

546
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,000
This is gonna be just a fucking killer piece of propaganda and the fact that you're not

547
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,280
denying it more vehemently and not rejecting it.

548
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,800
I did it purple and it was like, it's too dark.

549
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I don't like how it looks.

550
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Oh, it's too dark.

551
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Did you hear that?

552
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
It's too dark.

553
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,520
I put more bleach in it thinking it would become a lighter purple, but it ended up,

554
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,960
but it ended up pink instead, like pink and purple swirl, like a fucking, like a cotton

555
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
candy swirl.

556
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
It reminds me too much.

557
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,920
It reminds me too much of, hey, hey, I don't like your girlfriend, reminds me too much

558
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
of that shitty pop singer.

559
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,240
I'm gonna go thrash, ladies and gentlemen.

560
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
I'll see you later.

561
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,280
I'm really a quote from Ben right now.

562
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, get my fucking lawyers on the case.

563
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Yeah, I will.

564
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,400
I'll kill them before you're able to call them.

565
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,440
Listen, have my people call your people and let them know that I'm supposed to be suing

566
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
you right now.

567
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
All right.

568
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
All right.

569
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,920
I'll have my people call your people and give them death threats over the internet.

570
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
We'll settle this.

571
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,360
We'll settle this on the court, on the basketball court, on the Lithuanian skeleton basketball

572
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
court.

573
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,760
Nate, I'm sure you know, you know about that Japanese lawyer that was so hardcore doxxed

574
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,000
and it was like a whole like needy of frenzy for a while?

575
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm not sure.

576
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,040
No, I don't think I know what you're talking about.

577
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
His name escapes me.

578
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,680
I think it's Karasawa, I believe.

579
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,640
Anyway, it was a funny event in Japanese history.

580
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,760
Japanese internet goers are like the scariest fucking group of people, like basically like

581
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
ever.

582
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,480
I feel like if you were to offend like the Japanese like two-channel audience, like your

583
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,240
life could just be like over and like an instant.

584
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,360
So there's this Japanese lawyer who like, I don't know, was trying to defend some anon

585
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,480
on two-channel who was made fun of.

586
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,600
Anyway, he got so hardcore doxxed that people would go to his house every single day.

587
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,960
People were making like art of him and posting it everywhere in the city.

588
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,400
It was this whole like giant like media frenzy and it was crazy and Karasawa, here let me

589
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
see.

590
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Let me see if I can find it.

591
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

592
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Karasaki, here.

593
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
One second.

594
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,880
I will post in just a moment.

595
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:06,440
But it's crazy that people are able to just like completely shut down like a person's

596
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
career.

597
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
God damn it.

598
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Where is it?

599
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Hold on.

600
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
I'm not fully following the story here.

601
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Yeah, I need more information.

602
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Me either, yeah, yeah.

603
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
What happened?

604
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Who?

605
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Where?

606
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
When?

607
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Okay.

608
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,880
Some random douche was being bullied online.

609
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
He calls a lawyer.

610
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Okay.

611
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah.

612
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,160
He calls a lawyer and the lawyer is like, hey, I'm going to sue two-channel and he posts

613
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,080
it on the web, on the forum.

614
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,280
Because he got bullied there?

615
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
No, yeah.

616
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,160
Well, not the person himself like he calls a lawyer and the lawyer steps in and posts

617
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
on two-channel.

618
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Okay.

619
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Okay.

620
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
And then.

621
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,400
That's really funny.

622
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,400
The lawyer's identity is discovered.

623
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:59,800
And then people go on a trolling spree and docks the lawyer and the client, of course,

624
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,160
and just like makes a ton of art to ruin the reputation.

625
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,160
And it's a big, funny meme here at Google.

626
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Okay.

627
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
I was not there.

628
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
I mean, the lawyer was just doing his job.

629
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,600
I mean, you know, okay, but didn't he do a stupid thing?

630
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,680
Didn't he do a stupid thing by saying he was going to sue two-channel?

631
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Yeah.

632
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,040
Like, isn't that being bad at his job?

633
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,520
I mean, that's, look, a lawyer's job is not to know ahead of time if they're going to

634
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,240
necessarily win or lose any given case.

635
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,600
And like, I don't know, lawyers just do things that they think they have a chance of succeeding

636
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
at legally.

637
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I don't know.

638
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,720
I don't have the same kind of, I don't know, animosity towards lawyers doing shit.

639
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,040
They're just trying to see what they can get away with according to the law.

640
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,360
I get being annoyed at like all the law shit, but, you know.

641
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,800
But it seems like, I mean, it seems like his goal was to take down two-channel, which is,

642
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,120
and it's really stupid.

643
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,720
So I can see why they would be like, they're defensive of their site.

644
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,400
And also they're like, look at this, look at this fucking clown thinking he can sue two-channel

645
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
over this.

646
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,040
I mean, what I would have, if it was me, I mean, you know, this is me, but I would have

647
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,360
allowed him to attempt this and then just fail because there's no grounds for this.

648
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,120
Well, I mean, they, well, they didn't stop him from doing it.

649
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,560
But they did, it sounds like they did far worse than that.

650
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,800
What exactly did they do?

651
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,560
What exactly did they do to destroy him?

652
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,560
So like, they defaced a family shrine of like a tomb of his family.

653
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,680
That's fucked up, man.

654
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,280
That's just illegal.

655
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,760
And they stalked him constantly, like they sent drones to his house to try and observe

656
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,800
him in old times and like constantly rang, like went to his house and tried to like talk

657
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,680
to him, like did like funny like worship of him, made him really uncomfortable.

658
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,080
And they posted like, like, like bizarre photos of him, like everywhere around the city, like

659
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,600
on like, like, like train stations and stuff like that.

660
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
They tried to make him famous.

661
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Yeah.

662
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
It was a good old time.

663
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
No, that's a little too far.

664
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,600
I mean, like making fun of him online for being a dumb.

665
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,320
It's, it's quite excessive on, and you know, I mean, I don't know, people are silly about

666
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,760
it, but like, even when you do things by the letter of the law, it can still be morally

667
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,080
wrong and like not a cool thing to do, you know, sounds like some of the things they

668
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
did were illegal.

669
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Other things.

670
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
I don't know.

671
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
I get it.

672
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
They're defensive of the site.

673
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
They don't give a fuck.

674
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,080
A lot of people on 4chan and 2chan or whatever are very nihilist minded.

675
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Fair.

676
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
I understand.

677
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
You could expect these sort of things.

678
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,280
And lol, it's funny that bad things happen to them as a consequence.

679
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
I'm with you.

680
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
I'm with you.

681
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,280
I mean, I wouldn't want a fucking family shrine to face.

682
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Yeah.

683
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Yeah.

684
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Yeah.

685
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
But you mess with the bull, you get the testicles.

686
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
I guess.

687
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,040
It would have been okay if they just sort of made fun of him, but then doxing him and

688
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,040
stalking him and then the shrine thing, that's a little too much.

689
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Well, I mean, I mean, of course, yeah.

690
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Well, did they dox him?

691
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,440
I mean, he must have doxed himself if they found out who he was.

692
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,040
Well, he probably was like, hi, I'm this lawyer and I'm fucking gunna sue you or whatever.

693
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Well, yeah, but his home address was not publicly known.

694
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Well, I mean, it sounds like I have, I bet it was publicly available.

695
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,240
Like if he knew his family shrine was to though and include that information in his post, I

696
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
mean, probably not, right?

697
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Probably not.

698
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
No, probably not.

699
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
Well, okay.

700
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Nonetheless, we don't know the details.

701
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Who knows exactly how bad or good it was, but very funny.

702
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
I'm going to go with 100% good.

703
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Yeah.

704
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,240
I think that's the default state that everyone should go to for any event.

705
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,240
You know, just assume that it was a blanket positive.

706
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Since all morality derives from religion and we've proven that God is fake, I'm going

707
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,240
to call this 100% good thing that happens.

708
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
What does this mean?

709
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,240
What is this new like line that you're parroting then?

710
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,240
What did thought slime say that once and now it's the new thing you're saying?

711
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,240
Yeah, he said it and I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, there's no God.

712
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
I can do anything I want to do.

713
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,240
And then I started smoking weed and now I'm a libertarian.

714
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Wow, that's a great story.

715
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
It's just that easy, folks.

716
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
It's just that easy.

717
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
You know, you never know.

718
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,240
And a little things going to come along when you're going to take a bite and change your

719
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
life.

720
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,240
You know, speaking of all this Japanese defacing of family graves and whatnot, I got to tell

721
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:22,240
you, the last samurai global box office smash hit from 2003 starring Tom Cruise is a real

722
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
roller coaster ride.

723
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Ladies and gentlemen, I highly recommend.

724
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,240
Boy, this is a fucking timely review.

725
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Yeah.

726
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
Just in time.

727
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,240
I was just thinking about should I watch last samurai?

728
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,240
I mean, I'm talking about I'm talking about a hundred and forty million budget of four

729
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,240
hundred and fifty eight point eight million dollar box office intake.

730
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Just just excellent work, everybody.

731
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Warner Brothers pictures are really knocked out of the park.

732
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Fantastic.

733
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
I can't watch a nobby commanding performance.

734
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,240
This could be a big break for for this up and coming young star Tom Cruise.

735
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,240
I hope to see more of him.

736
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Hope to see more of him in the future.

737
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,240
I hope he boxes Justin Bieber and that that happens.

738
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Did that happen?

739
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Pretty cool.

740
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Justin Bieber tweeted that he wants to in the style of these YouTubers who have been doing

741
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,240
fights for entertainment, he wants to fight Tom Cruise, you know, in the ring.

742
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Because Tom Cruise is like 70.

743
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Yeah.

744
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Yeah, recently.

745
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,240
I mean, I think Tom Cruise would kick his ass personally, but you know, what do I know?

746
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
I don't know.

747
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,240
He's like a hundred years old.

748
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Let's see how old Tom Cruise is.

749
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
Just for fun.

750
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
He's got the church on the side, dude.

751
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
He's got Scientologists.

752
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
He's going to drink like some like secret potion.

753
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
He's going to become the whole.

754
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
He's at least 60.

755
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
Tom Cruise is 57.

756
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Tom Cruise is 57.

757
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Oh, wow.

758
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Okay.

759
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
And Justin Bieber is probably like 25.

760
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
So like prime of his life, obviously.

761
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
I still got to put it on Tommy.

762
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
I think Tom would have some.

763
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
I mean, they're both.

764
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
They're both.

765
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
They're both manlets.

766
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
They're both manlets.

767
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
They're both manlets.

768
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Absolutely true.

769
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,240
He's going to get some like 11 year olds to like a bath and some sort of like spirit

770
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
cooking pot event.

771
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
He's going to drink.

772
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
He's going to drink some of their essence.

773
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,240
And then he's going to grow tin sizes and become a literal God and destroy.

774
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,240
Ken Watanabe literally surgically implanted the spirit of the samurai into Tom Cruise

775
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
during 2003.

776
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Smash it.

777
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,240
The last samurai wet, which can I can I just remind got over 300 million dollars in

778
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
profits at the box office.

779
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Just incredible work, everybody.

780
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,240
Got to give it to a Han Zimmer for that score.

781
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Read our pictures.

782
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
The Bedford Falls Company.

783
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Cruise Wagner Productions.

784
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Everybody just did such a fantastic job.

785
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
This is my timely review.

786
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
The last samurai.

787
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Good work, everybody.

788
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
I was going to say, speaking of Thought Slime, everyone's on the Thought Slime train now.

789
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,240
Hippos on it.

790
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Jesse's on it.

791
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Everyone.

792
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Soon we're all going to be.

793
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
I'm going to convert the whole piece.

794
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
That's the entirety of the world right there.

795
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I'm going to convert the whole PCP to a narco communism.

796
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
OK, but my contrarian nature does not allow this.

797
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,240
I will not consume any Thought Slimes.

798
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Well, I'm sorry.

799
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
You're going to be left behind in the revolution.

800
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Good.

801
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Prepare to have your fucking.

802
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Oh God, what's the word?

803
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Prepare to have the have your means of production seized.

804
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Is there any place in this lonely old anarcho communist world for an anarcho capitalist just

805
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
trying to make a buck?

806
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Yeah, in a fucking grave.

807
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
It is the place.

808
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Tom Cruise looks like Keanu Reeves in the poster for the last samurai.

809
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
This guy looks so like.

810
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
OK, tell me it's not true, Nate.

811
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Tell me he's not the last samurai.

812
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Tell me there's more.

813
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
There's hope for man.

814
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Even even now there has to be hope for man.

815
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,240
Well, you know, interestingly, the last samurai focuses on how Tom Cruise is not in fact.

816
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Well, he kind of was the last samurai standing at the end of the film.

817
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
I guess I'll spoiler alert.

818
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,240
It's about the transition from the the way of the samurai from Japan incorporating like

819
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,240
1870 and whatnot, more like Western technology and the emperor being all up on up on that

820
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
business.

821
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,240
But then Tom Cruise, a lonely old soldier from the Indian uprisings in America and the

822
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Civil War and whatnot.

823
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,240
It's about him addressing the sins of his past and finding comfort in the ways of the

824
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Eastern samurai warrior and learning to quiet his mind in times of tumult.

825
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Is this really just a parallel to your life, Nate?

826
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Is it the big screen?

827
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,240
Yes, the answer is yes.

828
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
God, I hope so.

829
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,240
This lonely soy boy twink roaming around the streets of America begging for a cock to suck.

830
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:37,240
It's shipped off a cargo crate to Japan and just learns the way of the of the of the piston

831
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:43,240
punch is able to become a full blooded samurai and make YouTube dollars like no one king

832
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,240
or emperor had ever seen before.

833
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
Oh, you know, I don't know.

834
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
I suppose this is whatever it doesn't.

835
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
It's just that there's something real.

836
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,240
There's something like it's it's you feel there's a hopelessness.

837
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,240
The movie ends with the samurai just being like, yep, our time's up.

838
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Samurai are done.

839
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
So we're just going to go fight and then we'll all die.

840
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,240
And Tom Cruise who became a samurai, you know, whatever.

841
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
He became one of the peeps during the thing.

842
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,240
He became fell in love with their ways.

843
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
He like everybody else died except for him.

844
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,240
So he is, I guess, the last one and everyone else is like, yeah, that's it.

845
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
Samurai are done.

846
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
But oh, there was beauty in their simple lives.

847
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Oh, there was there was a there was a humble, these noble savages.

848
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Ain't nobody calling them noble savages.

849
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
They're just noble, Ben.

850
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
They're just noble.

851
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Yeah, I know.

852
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Yeah, I it's been a long time.

853
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
It's been a long time.

854
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,240
Some people have called this like a white savior film.

855
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
It could not be further from the truth.

856
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,240
It's about how the white man could learn so much from the East and how they're better than us.

857
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,240
And now I need my samurai sword to cut down these filthy Western enemies of God's creation,

858
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,240
a.k.a. the samurai and God, I could not be more on board.

859
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Wait, no, they fucking lose the war, right?

860
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,240
Like Tom Cruise just gets absolutely like gunned down by like the like new invention of

861
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,240
the tide of history turning slowly against them.

862
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Yep.

863
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Yeah.

864
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
But there's there's beauty to be found in that history.

865
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Oh, it's beautiful.

866
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
I fucking love it.

867
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
That's so good.

868
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,240
That's it.

869
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
PCP is over.

870
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Nate says like playing off his his kabuki armor.

871
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,240
And his beetle off my armor.

872
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,240
Nate Bestman is the last podcaster.

873
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Listen, everyone's going fucking VR.

874
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Everyone's going on hologram.

875
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,240
Yeah, they're just getting they're just getting auto directed like like like via syringe

876
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
directly into their fucking eyeball.

877
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
No one's got time for podcast anymore.

878
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
We can't fight the tide of history, man.

879
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,240
We all know the way of the future is Internet drama, Internet blood sports, you know, etc.

880
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,240
But I sit here making my humble whittling away bit by bit in my humble anime reviews and

881
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
I will not cease.

882
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,240
I will let history crash around me as I stand against the tide because I would rather die

883
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,240
on my feet than die on my knees as a slave.

884
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
That's how I am.

885
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
And that's how it will go for me.

886
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Remember me, the last anime reviewer on YouTube.

887
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,240
Games upon video essay.

888
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Clicked new track over a thousand times just completely completely made into a mirror shine

889
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
polished into oblivion.

890
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,240
And I will slice down any of the naysayers.

891
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,240
Point being, I just watched The Last Samurai before recording this episode of the PCB and

892
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
it was a great time.

893
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Highly recommend.

894
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,240
I can't tell if The Last Samurai is like genuinely good or if it's just actually good.

895
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,240
I'll let you know what the difference between those is never.

896
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,240
I actually had like ten minutes left but I gotta say, you know what's funny, here's

897
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,240
my little bit more of a review.

898
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
I could not have loved this movie more.

899
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
It was absolutely fantastic.

900
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,240
But like it ends with, so like the thread going up through the background is that like

901
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,240
America wants to do an arms deal with Japan and Tom Cruise has brought over to like train

902
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
the Japanese soldiers in the western ways or whatever.

903
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
And like that's all fine.

904
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
Then it becomes a samurai later.

905
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:17,240
But like the idea is that like Tom Cruise decides to join like the honorable samurai who are

906
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
defending like the ancient ways of Japan.

907
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
And like they know that history is going against them.

908
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,240
But like we can't forget who we are like Japan, you know, whatever we've got the spirit.

909
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
We can't just be cut by the west or whatever.

910
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,240
But like it ends with the emperor just being like, they were cultivating this whole deal

911
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,240
between Japan and an American weapon or whatever.

912
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
And just like, nah, fuck it.

913
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,240
At the end he's like, I am convinced by these samurai who all died in defense of their ways.

914
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Like we can't forget that we are Japanese.

915
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,240
So I guess that means we won't use modern technology and we won't progress.

916
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,240
And I'm like, is that really the lesson to take away?

917
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
I didn't learn anything.

918
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
That's kind of like, I'm with you.

919
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
Like remember the spirit of Japan.

920
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
Don't forget who you are.

921
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
That's all fine.

922
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,240
But like you got to buy new weapons to like defend yourself.

923
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
So what have we learned here?

924
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Like they did.

925
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,240
So it's weird that it's like painting as though it didn't happen.

926
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,240
I don't really understand exactly what the point of it is.

927
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,240
I guess just don't forget the spirit of Bushido or whatever, which is pretty cool.

928
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
Yeah, I wish I was a samurai.

929
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
That's how I feel.

930
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
Living a simple life.

931
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
I think we can all learn something from 2003 is the last samurai.

932
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,240
And about Tom Cruise's role in the history of Japan.

933
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
Directed by Edward Zwick.

934
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
Is that kind of fucked up?

935
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,240
That like Japan was wiped off the face of the earth because they weren't able to like buy new weapons

936
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,240
because Tom Cruise stopped them from participating in the Meiji Restoration like in 1870.

937
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Isn't that fucked up, guys?

938
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Isn't it fucked up that in America their invention of the guilty gear system nuked all of Japan

939
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
and no survivors were reigned afterward?

940
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
That sucked.

941
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
That was too bad.

942
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,240
I think I saw a lecture about that.

943
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
I think so.

944
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
One historical document.

945
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,240
It is Tom Cruise's soul bad guy.

946
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
I think we can pretty much all agree.

947
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Is Tom Cruise Tom Oliver and he single-handedly destroyed Japan?

948
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
God, I wish.

949
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Well, there you go.

950
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
There's my review of the last samurai.

951
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,240
Speaking of goddamn movies that we saw.

952
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Alright, here's the bombshell that I want to drop here.

953
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,240
I'm going to spin a yarn here because it is like the lowest point of my entire life.

954
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
I did something really bad.

955
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,240
I did something like naughty.

956
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,240
I did something that I'm going to have to get on my hands and I'm going to have to confess to you guys.

957
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,240
I saw the live action line king movie and I know.

958
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
No, how dare you pay for that.

959
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
I know.

960
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
I know.

961
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Listen, this is a mistake.

962
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
That's human core.

963
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,240
Seeing Disney remakes is the most human core thing you can do.

964
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
No, seeing them is fine.

965
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,240
It's paying for them to see them.

966
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,240
They're both wrong in their own way.

967
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Listen.

968
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Okay.

969
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,240
Here's I want to paint a picture for you.

970
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,240
It's the last day of my trip in San Francisco.

971
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,240
This is the last moment that I'll be able to have in San Francisco.

972
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
So far, it's been a wash, really.

973
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I mean, the piers were nice.

974
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,240
The fishmen's worth were nice, but I didn't really get a sense of anything truly local.

975
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
It just felt like a bunch of tourist traps.

976
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,240
And Chinatown the previous day was the epitome of that.

977
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,240
It was just completely just four numbskulls come in here, spend a lot of money and then get out.

978
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
There was nothing of actual substance inside of it.

979
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Sure.

980
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,240
The next day, we're walking across the city.

981
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,240
We see a lone movie theater and we see the lion king is playing.

982
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,240
It's about, you know, maybe four or five.

983
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
We get seats.

984
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
We watch the lion king.

985
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
It's a nightmare.

986
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,240
And, you know, we ha ha chuckle about how bad it is.

987
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:00,240
You know, we think that we've made a fine decision in watching a movie that was bad for the sake of just joking about it.

988
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
And then we vowed to watch the original.

989
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,240
Big mistake.

990
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,240
And then we walk to what was the point of that day.

991
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:13,240
For you see, we wanted to check out Chinatown's sister, Japan Town, because we thought there would be a great time.

992
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Wait, is that a real thing?

993
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
It's completely real.

994
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
It's completely real.

995
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
What town is this in?

996
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
San Francisco.

997
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
You have a Japan Town?

998
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,240
Yeah, Japan Town.

999
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Do they do they frequently perform Nanking reenactments on Chinatown?

1000
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
Are they next to each other?

1001
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Oh, God.

1002
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Tensions are high.

1003
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,240
They're actually separated for fear of riots, so, you know, they're separated by people.

1004
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
Race war!

1005
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
So, so, so we get out the lion king.

1006
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:43,240
We had just spent $14 to see live action lion king, the sun setting.

1007
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,240
And San Francisco, if you guys don't know, it's vertical.

1008
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
It's a TF2 map.

1009
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
It's a quick green map.

1010
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
It's vertically integrated.

1011
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
Literally.

1012
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
It's a vertical slice.

1013
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,240
There are vast mountains we must climb up to to get to our destination.

1014
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,240
We're crawling up talking about how John Oliver Azazi was so bad.

1015
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Seth Rogen is poomba was so bad.

1016
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
We're walking.

1017
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
We're walking.

1018
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,240
And so far, we're just twiddling our fucking thumbs.

1019
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
We've wasted our time here in the city.

1020
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,240
We get to Japan Town, ready to have some fun.

1021
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,240
We're ready to, hopefully, Japan Town to live up to the promise of what we thought China Town would be.

1022
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
We're here to save the trip.

1023
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
It's closed.

1024
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,240
Every single shop in Japan Town is closed.

1025
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Just like Japan after they dropped the bomb.

1026
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,240
I mean, by that, I mean, Guilty Gear happened and Japan was wiped off the map.

1027
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
Literally.

1028
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
So, we're rushing through.

1029
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,240
We're seeing, oh, used anime VHS store.

1030
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,240
We're seeing cool, like, manga book stores that we've got inside, too.

1031
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,240
We're seeing all these little food like sushi stands we could have gone into.

1032
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,240
We're seeing all these things that we would have loved to see.

1033
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,240
We're seeing all these things that we have spent an entire day inside of.

1034
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Just this one little mall in Japan Town.

1035
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,240
And we gaze upon the iconic Japan Town Tower Pagoda thing.

1036
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,240
You can Google search.

1037
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,240
And when you Google search, like, it seems to go to Japan Town, there would be like a needle looking thing.

1038
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
We looked upon that.

1039
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,240
And we saw, and we thought, we wasted our time in San Francisco watching the live action Lion King.

1040
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
That was what we spent today doing.

1041
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:25,240
That's what we spent our last day doing was, was paid money for our own bondage, was paying money for Disney

1042
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,240
to monopolize more and more and more and to enslave us instead of actually living our lives.

1043
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,240
I already ruined the trip to San Francisco.

1044
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,240
And as we laid there, depressed, sobbing on the floor for our own mistake,

1045
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,240
it's no one's fault but ourselves that this calamity was done to us.

1046
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,240
We sit there and we think, and we think to ourselves that even now there's hope for man.

1047
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,240
Don't say this is how it has to be.

1048
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,240
And then the next day, we had our steely American resolve, our steely Japanese resolve.

1049
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
We were the way of the samurai.

1050
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,240
We were, at that point, the last samurai looking.

1051
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,240
The tide of history, us going home, it cannot clash upon us.

1052
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
The spirit flowed into you, giving you power.

1053
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,240
And did you know, Munchy, that when a samurai, according to the Code of Bushido,

1054
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,240
I think I said this last time, but when a samurai rides into battle,

1055
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,240
he considers himself already dead as it makes him deadlier.

1056
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,240
And I'm sure you felt the same way beginning your mission that day.

1057
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,240
And so we woke up extremely early.

1058
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,240
The crack of dawn, like seven, we got out to the city

1059
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,240
and we spent our final moments before we were set to leave.

1060
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,240
And keep in mind, this is a torturous drive.

1061
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,240
This is like a seven hour drive to our destination.

1062
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,240
We had to have left as soon as possible or else we would be dead tired by the time we got there.

1063
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,240
If you could factor in stops and stuff like that, you know, do the bathroom.

1064
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
So we had to get in there and out.

1065
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,240
And we willingly flogged ourselves and made it to Japan Town

1066
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,240
in time for everything to open.

1067
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:01,240
And we spent a few cursory moments looking over the anime VHS store and the manga store.

1068
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,240
It didn't, we was saved. We saved the trip.

1069
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,240
You did it.

1070
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,240
And at, I believe it's called like Sakura Books or something in that effect,

1071
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,240
I bought the first volume of One Piece.

1072
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
And I'm starting my journey.

1073
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,240
Of course.

1074
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,240
One of these days, I will become a ship captain.

1075
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,240
Like I guarantee you.

1076
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,240
The journey, the fact that you, oh my God, that honestly, that's an inspiring story.

1077
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,240
You persevered and you did not give up on your quest despite all the hurdles you face.

1078
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,240
And what did you get?

1079
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,240
What was your prize for pursuing this and obtain your goal?

1080
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:42,240
It was the greatest prize of all, the beginning of yet another new journey.

1081
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
Adventure, yes.

1082
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,240
That's what could be better.

1083
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,240
And that's why that's how One Piece is going to end.

1084
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Mark my words with the beginning of a new adventure because that's what life is about people.

1085
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,240
It's about pursuing your goals and find fulfillment in doing so.

1086
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,240
That's how the samurai lived.

1087
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
And that's how you live, Munchy.

1088
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,240
And as the last samurai myself, I'm happy to dub you.

1089
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,240
My samurai for life.

1090
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
Welcome.

1091
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,240
Welcome to the club.

1092
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,240
Oh my God, honorary samurai.

1093
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,240
This is like the reverse of what we were talking about at the beginning.

1094
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,240
This is callbacks.

1095
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
This is true narrative stakes.

1096
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,240
This is it.

1097
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,240
Yes.

1098
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,240
It's happening.

1099
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,240
It's Ghazam Kutsverk of epic proportions.

1100
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,240
They're going to get to the monopoly, the anarcho-capitalism island.

1101
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,240
And then Luffy's going to get up and he's going to watch live action Lion King.

1102
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,240
And that's how One Piece is going to end.

1103
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
Incredible.

1104
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,240
Incredible.

1105
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,240
Well, Munchy, I could not be happier to hear.

1106
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,240
You know, people talk, even me, you know, when I'm week to week, me and Gib doing the

1107
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,240
potty cast, we get all wrapped up and like, what's happening right now in these chapters?

1108
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,240
Actually, when we do the potty cast, you guys probably don't listen because you're not on

1109
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
the latest chapter or anything.

1110
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,240
I wouldn't know.

1111
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,240
But like, we can be very critical of like, what's happening on any given chapter, especially

1112
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,240
considering reading chapter to chapter is kind of the most critical way.

1113
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,240
Cause you're like, is the thing that happens next going to live up to our expectations?

1114
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
Is like, like, is this art going the way we want?

1115
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,240
We can be very critical.

1116
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:06,240
But every time I look back and read like any section of One Piece, if there's a reason

1117
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,240
why I do it every week, it's the only thing I talk about every single week because it

1118
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,240
has brought me the most joy of anything I've been involved in my life.

1119
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:21,240
And I'm such just a humbled fan to be able to, I don't know, talk about and share it

1120
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,240
with people like you and other people who I've had the honor to get into One Piece

1121
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
through listening to the stuff I've said about it.

1122
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
So I'm just, I'm so happy for you.

1123
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,240
And I'm so, whatever, you don't owe me anything.

1124
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,240
You don't owe anybody enough that you could hate it.

1125
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,240
And that's fine too.

1126
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,240
But it just very, makes me very happy to hear.

1127
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,240
I mean, so far I'm obviously only a chapter in, but just the art itself is a loan for

1128
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
me to want to keep watching.

1129
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
It only gets better.

1130
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,240
I mean, I believe you.

1131
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
It's so different.

1132
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,240
It's not, it's not your, like, I don't know, we all, there's a lot of discussion in anime

1133
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,240
circles about how like anime all looks the same.

1134
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,240
It's all the same.

1135
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,240
One Piece is so unique.

1136
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,240
It's such a unique style and a lot of people don't like it, but I love it.

1137
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,240
People don't like it because it doesn't look, it doesn't, doesn't really look like anime.

1138
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,240
It kind of looks like a, I feel like the Otis art style has sort of like a kind of French

1139
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,240
Belgian-ish kind of look to it a little bit.

1140
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,240
Yeah, I see that actually.

1141
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,240
I know what you mean by that.

1142
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,240
Yeah.

1143
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,240
I think I know what you mean.

1144
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,240
But it's very cartoony and, you know, sort of proportion sometimes and whatnot.

1145
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,240
Well, whatever, man.

1146
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,240
Yeah, I could go on all day about One Piece if I don't want to lecture anybody about it.

1147
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,240
I'm just very happy to hear that you're, you're, you're getting on the bus, getting on the

1148
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,240
boat.

1149
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,240
If you're ever in a new location, here's my advice to you.

1150
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,240
And I said this advice before, but I need to reiterate because even myself, I forgot.

1151
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,240
Don't go anywhere just because other people go to it.

1152
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,240
Have a reason.

1153
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,240
If you have a reason to go to Chinatown, if you look up on Google Maps and there's like

1154
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,240
a cool restaurant you want to go to, by all means go to Chinatown.

1155
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,240
But don't just go there, you know, because it is the thing to do.

1156
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,240
Because you're going to get fucked up and you're not going to be able to learn the joys

1157
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,240
of whatever your town's equivalent to Japan town is.

1158
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,240
There's surely a cooler place you could be going to than something that everyone else

1159
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,240
already has.

1160
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,240
Probably true.

1161
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,240
Easily.

1162
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,240
Easily.

1163
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,240
Easy.

1164
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,240
Easy fucking peasy.

1165
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,240
Well, what a journey.

1166
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,240
What a Japan-centric episode.

1167
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,240
My favorite kind.

1168
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,240
God, I want to play Sekiro again.

1169
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
Sekiro is the greatest game ever made.

1170
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
I love Japan, period.

1171
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,240
And that's all there is to say about it.

1172
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:26,240
But by the way, also in Japan town, I got a manga that's exclusively in Japan and I can't

1173
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,240
read it.

1174
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,240
It's a Kirby manga that wasn't released in the West.

1175
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,240
Oh, fascinating.

1176
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,240
She should put a picture up somewhere.

1177
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Yeah, sure.

1178
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,240
I will.

1179
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,240
Because I can't Google it.

1180
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,240
I will take a picture and I will put in the show notes.

1181
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,240
Fantastic.

1182
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,240
Fantastic.

1183
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,240
Hey, I have a left turn topic I wanted to bring up that's a total other thing.

1184
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,240
Before we switch topics, I just noticed an odd little pattern.

1185
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,240
It has absolutely no meaning.

1186
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,240
But everyone, all the PCP members currently in the chats, the exception of then has a

1187
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,240
six in their Discord number.

1188
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,240
And I just noticed that and I thought that was kind of funny.

1189
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
Fascinating.

1190
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
Yep.

1191
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
Once again, I'm the odd man out.

1192
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
I'm the lone.

1193
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,240
I'm the champion.

1194
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,240
Oh my God.

1195
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,240
Majest number is the...

1196
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,240
I don't know if I should say the number, but I will say that it includes 666, just in

1197
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,240
the thing.

1198
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Is that a coincidence?

1199
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,240
What's up with that?

1200
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
That's weird.

1201
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,240
Well, now they only have to try 10 different combinations.

1202
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Wait, no.

1203
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,240
40 different combinations.

1204
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,240
No, there's...

1205
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,240
I mean, the thing is, I don't add people if I don't know them.

1206
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,240
So, you know, even if they do...

1207
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,240
Well, hang on.

1208
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,240
Surely there's more than, you know, 9,999 or I guess 10,000 people on Discord.

1209
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,240
Well, here's my logic.

1210
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,240
I mean, you're Discord...

1211
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,240
Yeah.

1212
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,240
Wait, you're right.

1213
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,240
But your Discord number is only four numbers, right?

1214
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
I think the name is like relevant somehow.

1215
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,240
Like the name is incorporated in your...

1216
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,240
The thing is, people can't really add me due to the heart and my name.

1217
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,240
Yeah, right.

1218
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,240
Oh, yeah, that too.

1219
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,240
That too.

1220
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
The purple heart protects me.

1221
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,240
Purple heart.

1222
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,240
Just like John Kerry, protected him from losing the presidential election.

1223
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,240
Oops, that didn't happen.

1224
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,240
Moving on.

1225
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,240
Sad.

1226
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,240
Listen to this.

1227
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,240
I've got five words that I was just thinking of as a result of a recent experience that

1228
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,240
I will describe briefly, and it's that magic is IRL...

1229
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,240
Oh, sorry, sorry.

1230
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,240
Music.

1231
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,240
Music is IRL magic spells.

1232
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,240
Music is a lot like love.

1233
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,240
It's all a feeling.

1234
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
It's all a feeling.

1235
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
And it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling.

1236
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
It does.

1237
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
Is that what you're saying?

1238
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,240
That's basically what I'm saying.

1239
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,240
Music is pure magic.

1240
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,240
Okay, cool Curb of Manga.

1241
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
She just uploaded it.

1242
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,240
So I was just thinking about this, and this pertains to all media.

1243
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,240
But I was just thinking about this.

1244
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,240
This is probably a really obvious observation, but I felt it very powerfully the other day

1245
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:47,240
because I've been watching with a pretty strong interest Digi's like top 100 anime openings

1246
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
that he's been doing because Digi is actually...

1247
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,240
This is one of the things that I really like to listen to Digi talk about.

1248
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Frank, I'm not that interested in like his music takes necessarily, but obviously we overlap

1249
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,240
in anime and I care about that.

1250
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:05,240
But like Digi's taste is very different from like your average like watch mojo top 10 anime

1251
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
opening, like whatever.

1252
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,240
Like I was watching, I commented on his video that just had all the openings and like the

1253
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,240
opening to, and this is the song I wanted to bring up, Gunslinger Girls is this song

1254
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,240
Light As We Land by the Delgados, which I had never heard before.

1255
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,240
I've never seen Gunslinger Girl, but like I was instantly transfixed and like, damn,

1256
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,240
that song is really dope.

1257
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:32,240
And so when Digi, he's doing like in breakups of 20 at a time, he's like talking about them

1258
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,240
each individually.

1259
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,240
And I'm really enjoying it.

1260
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,240
At least like skipping around to the ones I like because it was a lot of fun.

1261
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,240
And like when he gets to this one, this is the one I was most interested in.

1262
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:46,240
And he just talks about how like actually this song is the first track on the album

1263
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,240
Hate by the Delgados.

1264
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,240
And it's actually, it's one of it, like he loves the album.

1265
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,240
And this is actually one of his least favorite songs on the album.

1266
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,240
And so I was immediately like, well, I need to go listen to this fucking album because

1267
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,240
the song is incredible.

1268
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:06,240
But I had that most optimal experience for enjoying music, which was I was on a drive

1269
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:13,240
at night in summertime, windows down, wind in my face, cranked up this song in my ears

1270
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,240
as like I'm just looking at like the lights of the city passing by as I'm driving by.

1271
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:22,240
And this song, Light As We Land by the Delgados, go listen to it.

1272
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,240
It sounds like the soundtrack one plays while you're committing suicide.

1273
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,240
That's what it sounds like, only not in like funny like, I want to die like shit zoomer

1274
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,240
way, but like the old, you know, doomer way of like life is crushing me.

1275
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,240
Classic suicide.

1276
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:45,240
Classic suicide because it's about the pain of life not touching you.

1277
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,240
This is what I understand.

1278
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,240
Did you describe it?

1279
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:55,240
It's about how while you're floating in a happy state of mind, not focused on the bad

1280
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,240
things of life, but that the light as you land that fades as you come crashing back down

1281
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,240
to reality.

1282
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,240
Now this sounds a lot like suicide.

1283
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,240
Yes.

1284
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,240
Sorry.

1285
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,240
That's the only anime song I know.

1286
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,240
Hey, no problem.

1287
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,240
It's the only one that matters.

1288
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,240
Here's my point.

1289
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
To get back to my point, I absolutely love the song.

1290
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,240
I'm going to go listen to this album hate.

1291
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,240
I can't wait to go listen to it because if it's as good as did you seem to be implying,

1292
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,240
it's going to be incredible.

1293
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:26,240
I was listening to the song and I'm like, music is the strongest magic known to man

1294
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,240
because it just has this quality of like, I think about like the people who write music

1295
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,240
like Bach or, you know, any modern band, the Degades who made this song, they sit down

1296
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,240
and they like work on riffs and they work on notes and they work on lyrics and they

1297
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,240
work on chords and all that shit.

1298
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:48,240
And they're literally weaving a magic spell and this spell has the effect on me.

1299
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
Someone who's basically music illiterate.

1300
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,240
I know a little bit.

1301
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,240
Not very much.

1302
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,240
I play more guitar later, which has been a lot of fun as a result of Digi's thing and

1303
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
other stuff.

1304
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,240
Cool.

1305
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,240
Yeah.

1306
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,240
I've been having a great time.

1307
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,240
I was actually playing, I was practicing another song from that.

1308
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,240
What is it?

1309
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:08,240
Hit in the USA by someone I can't remember, but it's the opening theme to Beck.

1310
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,240
Mongolian chop shop or whatever.

1311
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,240
Squad.

1312
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,240
I don't know.

1313
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,240
It's a hard ass rock song and I fucking love that opening.

1314
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,240
It's dope.

1315
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,240
I have a pedal so I can sound really hardcore and overdrive and whatnot.

1316
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,240
Okay.

1317
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,240
It doesn't matter.

1318
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,240
Point was I was saying like these people, they're like witches concocting a witch's

1319
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,240
brew.

1320
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,240
They're throwing in there their eye of newt, thrown in their leg of virgin, they're throwing

1321
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,840
in their period blood of menstruating mother.

1322
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,840
I don't know.

1323
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,400
They're throwing in all kinds of weird components and the result is on the other side, people

1324
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,240
like me who don't understand music theory basically at all.

1325
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,240
And I don't know.

1326
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,240
Like we're just totally ignorant to the process.

1327
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,240
Nonetheless, it has such a powerful effect.

1328
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:54,240
It just, it's as such a, I don't know, it just makes me feel all kinds of things that

1329
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,440
I don't even understand exactly why I feel them.

1330
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,240
And this is true of like all media, but it strikes me that like music is like the most

1331
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,240
effective because you don't have to have any lyrics.

1332
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,240
Yeah.

1333
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,240
Music also is like, it can be quite manipulative, not necessarily in a bad way, but sometimes

1334
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,240
in a bad way.

1335
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,240
Yeah.

1336
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,360
And like certain scenes and let's say movies, they wouldn't be as powerful or impactful

1337
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:22,240
or like a tear-jerkingly without the music gets really underrated on us.

1338
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,480
I think a lot about Anthony Fantano once said, somebody asked him on one of his Q&A's

1339
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:33,240
like, or one of his ask, whatever, let's argue, I think something like music is overrated

1340
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:38,360
as like a, like a medium or whatever, like, I don't know, like something like video was

1341
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,200
better or like music would be nothing without video.

1342
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,200
Something like that.

1343
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:47,360
And, and he just said like, think about if you watched your favorite movie without the

1344
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,360
soundtrack.

1345
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,680
And you know, I was, I was thinking about that as I was watching like The Last Samurai,

1346
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,840
it's got a great score, Hans Zimmer and all that.

1347
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:58,240
I was just thinking if the exact same things were happening, I had all these emotions.

1348
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,760
I loved the character so much and it was so badass and it got me so invested in like the

1349
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,080
way of like this, these humble Japanese samurai just wanting to honor their way of life and

1350
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
their ancestors.

1351
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,840
I was like, I feel you guys, I feel you in a big way.

1352
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,720
But if you, if you just play that exact same movie without the soundtrack, I think it would

1353
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,760
have, I think I would have been like, I mean, fuck these guys, like time to get, you know,

1354
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,440
get with the times, your way is over idiots, gotta buy guns, gotta put down the bow and

1355
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,880
arrow, pick up a fucking gun, you're, you're idiots.

1356
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:36,520
Another really interesting thing about the music is a timely lack of music can be just

1357
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,480
as impactful as having music in certain other times.

1358
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,800
At the right time for sure.

1359
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Yeah, exactly.

1360
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,800
Absolutely true.

1361
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,440
But like, you know, if it was like lack of music throughout the whole thing, it wouldn't

1362
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,440
be as impactful.

1363
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,960
So it has to be like, like perfectly placed lack of music, I would say.

1364
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,720
It's like, I just watched, I was watching a demo, Demolition D, Twitch stream the other

1365
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,320
day and it was streaming, or Twitch or whatever, it was streaming Kill Bill Volume 1 and like,

1366
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,040
the fight against Oren Ishii after the crazy eight fight is incredible.

1367
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,880
And oh my god, that fight is so sick against Oren.

1368
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:12,760
Like this, this like Spanish Latin cover of Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood starts playing

1369
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,240
and it's the fucking sickest shit of all time.

1370
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:21,320
And I would actually, I use that exact song in Gurren Logan part two review.

1371
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,960
I use it like the hypest moment because it is like the hypest song of all time.

1372
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,960
But like, and after, at the end, when Oren finally gets like a hit on Beatrix or whatever,

1373
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,280
like the song cuts and then you just have like the two of them kind of stumbling around

1374
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,760
in silence and like this, once again, beautiful like Japanese courtyard with like the snow

1375
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,920
falling and just these two women, you know, due unto the death, but like it's dead silence.

1376
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,880
And then they just like this, the hum of the swords and whatnot.

1377
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,200
It's, I don't know, I just after this experience driving, listening to the song and just like

1378
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,960
feeling like, like why am I feeling so many powerful emotions right now, listening to

1379
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,200
the song that I don't even really understand what it's about.

1380
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,000
I was like, this is a magic spell.

1381
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,880
This is a modern day magic spell.

1382
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,600
I don't understand what's going on.

1383
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:11,360
Isn't it strange that the human body has such a reaction to music?

1384
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,240
It is strange.

1385
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,600
Because because like what?

1386
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Why do we have it?

1387
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,080
Yeah, what exactly?

1388
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,960
I understand like, for instance, like like pictures or, you know, like stories because,

1389
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,120
you know, we can relate to them and we can understand language and we can understand

1390
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:30,640
what it's like to like have emotions displayed by like text and ideas being communicated

1391
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,160
to us.

1392
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:31,360
Yeah.

1393
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,960
But why do we get ideas from something abstract as noise?

1394
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,360
Because like, I understand why something may like shock you.

1395
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,840
I like like like like a symbol may jurt you like because a loud sound noise would be

1396
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,320
evolutionary beneficial for you to like be alert at someone's coming to get you.

1397
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,960
But why are we soothed by certain things?

1398
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,640
Why are we like like brought to to feel like a triumphant music?

1399
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,360
Why can we understand the emotion of music when like those things don't

1400
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:03,280
like appear in nature or I can't imagine they have a theory.

1401
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,040
Sure.

1402
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,880
It's like, in a way, actually, it kind of goes with a with a topic I was thinking

1403
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:15,360
about bringing in about like universal sort of symbols in a way, how like a lot of people,

1404
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,640
at least in a lot of cultures, let's say red would be a color of danger or passion.

1405
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,880
You know, stop signs of red.

1406
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,120
It's a very bright color.

1407
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,160
It's the color of blood.

1408
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:31,000
It's the color of like it's so bright and a lot of poisonous creatures are

1409
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,400
brightly colored and maybe they use red.

1410
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,040
I haven't checked out how many of them use red.

1411
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:41,000
But yeah, so it's music is sort of like, you know, a sound version of that in a way

1412
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,480
because it might be sort of mimicking like sort of like a sounds or noises that

1413
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,440
like represent certain sort of emotions like how red is passionate.

1414
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,440
And scary.

1415
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,480
So you have noises, something like that.

1416
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,280
And like if you combine, let's say, blue with white, you can maybe paint

1417
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,840
some clouds in the sky and it's it looks like a bright sunny day, but you can also

1418
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,800
paint ice and it'll be cold and snowy.

1419
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,640
So music, certain sounds, you combine them together and they can create

1420
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,280
different types of moods.

1421
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,320
You know, Majaba's thinking that too.

1422
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,320
But the thing is, like you bring up the color example and like colors do exist in nature,

1423
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:16,960
obviously.

1424
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,200
So like humanity had a long time to like adjust to thinking certain

1425
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,680
things about different colors and whatnot.

1426
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,840
But like the thing is like music, as we understand it, is not something that

1427
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,920
really occurs in nature outside of like animal cries or like like the like, I

1428
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,720
don't know, the major chords.

1429
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,080
Where do they appear in nature?

1430
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,440
You know, I don't know much about course.

1431
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:43,000
Like I'm just, you know, this is just me speculating and guessing like at the

1432
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,440
moment I haven't done research about it.

1433
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,240
I have a theory, though.

1434
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:45,760
Yeah.

1435
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,480
Well, I mean, I think I think most people would probably agree.

1436
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:53,280
But it's like, I think that music, as we understand, it's easy to be like music

1437
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,640
exists now, like where did it come from?

1438
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:59,240
Like surely like something like taught it to us as humans.

1439
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,680
I just think that as the process of civilization has progressed, like music

1440
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:09,440
is literally we've discovered brain hacks that just some sounds just for

1441
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,840
basically pure coincidental reasons, some sounds just sound good to the human

1442
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,120
ear and the human brain.

1443
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,200
And like we're kind of doing revisionist history if we think that like there's

1444
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:24,000
really any explanation for why what we perceive to be music, like is the thing

1445
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,360
that sounds good or bad or whatever.

1446
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,440
I think that we just have categorized things that we basically discovered by

1447
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,840
accident, by trial and error as humanity has just progressed.

1448
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:38,000
I think music is another form of communication in a way, like a very

1449
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,280
primitive one, like how, you know, certain voices to us like sound good, like a

1450
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,960
calm voice is nice and gentle.

1451
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,440
And then if someone's yelling, then you know, that's dangerous.

1452
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,280
So music is sort of the same way.

1453
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,760
Maybe it's like to convey like a sense of danger, a sense of calmness.

1454
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,960
You know, that's true too.

1455
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,840
Like there's a reason why in like rock songs, like obviously it doesn't

1456
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,640
really inform you in terms of like chord structure, whatever, if someone's like

1457
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,320
yelling versus whispering.

1458
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,440
So I totally agree.

1459
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,840
Music is like a combination of these two things.

1460
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,120
I think like like music theory specifically, like that's the kind of

1461
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,320
thing I'm saying is like specific like note progression from note to note or

1462
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:16,880
whatever, evoking like a certain, like a minor chord sounding sad.

1463
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,480
That's not something that occurred in nature.

1464
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,040
I think that's something that we've just like figured out and then

1465
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,840
documented.

1466
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,960
And now we just, you know, we all like kind of are aware that a minor kind of

1467
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,360
sounds sad or anything like that.

1468
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,520
I think it's just music could be like a transformative thing of the sounds we

1469
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,600
actually have heard and trying to mimic.

1470
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,120
How like, I like to sing how people said like, oh, you know, they looked at a

1471
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,520
bird one time and then they decided to make a plane.

1472
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,600
So music is sort of like that.

1473
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,960
They heard a noise and they decided to sort of mimic it, but in their own

1474
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,480
different spin, spin off of that sort of noise.

1475
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,360
So something sad sounding that they sounded sad, they tried to mimic it with

1476
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,200
music or like, you know, making a noise similar to it and then integrated into

1477
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,080
music.

1478
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,600
I definitely think that's part of it.

1479
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,680
It's interesting you bring up a minor, Nick.

1480
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,960
Did you hear about a minor?

1481
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:03,840
No.

1482
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,320
He grew up.

1483
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,240
He was sexually assaulted.

1484
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,280
I don't like that.

1485
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,160
I was waiting for that.

1486
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:12,640
Kill me.

1487
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,760
No, I love puns.

1488
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,480
I was waiting for that.

1489
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:16,960
That was good.

1490
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,080
If we want to move on, I have to have a move on.

1491
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:22,240
Yeah.

1492
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,040
No, no worries.

1493
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,280
Okay.

1494
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,080
I just, I remembered this in the middle of this and I've been bursting to get it

1495
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:26,720
out.

1496
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,000
This is incredible.

1497
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,560
Okay.

1498
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:28,880
Okay.

1499
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,880
American listeners.

1500
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,120
Right.

1501
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,320
And actually, Munchie and Nate, this is true of you too.

1502
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:34,560
Oh no.

1503
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,920
American listeners.

1504
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,560
I am about, and maybe you'll know what I'm talking about, I am about to make you

1505
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,360
$125.

1506
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:44,960
Do you know what this is?

1507
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:45,760
No.

1508
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,720
I think I did hear you discussing this somewhere, but go on.

1509
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,240
American listener, you can just fucking send, okay.

1510
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,600
So there was this thing, this company Equifax leaked a bunch of data and there was a settlement.

1511
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:05,920
And like, if your data was, and like 147 million Americans were, if your data was leaked by Equifax,

1512
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,880
you are entitled to $125.

1513
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,320
You can get it.

1514
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,360
So I'll put a link in the description.

1515
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,000
If there's a link, it takes you to a thing.

1516
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,880
You just put in like your name and like part of your social security number.

1517
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,920
It will tell you like, yes, you were affected or not.

1518
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,280
And if you were, you just fill in your information and Equifax will send you a check for $125.

1519
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,160
I'll do that.

1520
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:28,960
I'll do that.

1521
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,280
I'll do that.

1522
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:29,520
I'll do that.

1523
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,320
I'll do that.

1524
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,600
I'm speaking of data leaks.

1525
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,240
There's also, you can also, if you, there's more like, if you, if you, you can say like,

1526
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,680
I mean, I doubt this would apply to anyone, but like, if you spent time like, like doing stuff,

1527
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,840
like if it costs you like labor hours, you can like apply for like some more for that.

1528
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:52,560
But like, okay, there's, there's the possibility, like if, if everyone in the world,

1529
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,800
like, like if, if everyone like files for this, there might be a run on it and like,

1530
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,440
because like the total settlement amount is only like, I think it's like $380 million.

1531
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:07,040
So if like everyone files for it, like, you know, it might, the number might go down.

1532
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:10,080
There might not be, yeah, the number might be reduced, but I don't know.

1533
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,120
Who knows if that'll happen.

1534
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,680
So yeah, a fucking link in the description.

1535
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,720
Get in there fast, I guess.

1536
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,040
Yeah.

1537
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,200
Well, I don't know if it's fast.

1538
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,200
I think it's just going to end up being like the total number of, of, of however many people

1539
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:21,920
file a claim.

1540
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,240
And I don't, and I don't know how much longer there is to do it.

1541
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:31,200
But yeah, I saw, I saw a tweet from AOC about this and I was like, huh, and I followed it up.

1542
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:36,240
And yeah, I'm fucking eagerly awaiting my $125 check and you should too.

1543
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,480
And letting me know in the comments if it, if it works.

1544
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,320
So some people, some people.

1545
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:40,800
Yeah.

1546
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,240
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator from New York.

1547
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,080
Some people might represent it.

1548
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,360
I think she's a senator.

1549
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,880
No, no, no, she's a Congresswoman.

1550
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,520
Congresswoman.

1551
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:49,920
Oh, okay.

1552
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,160
Yeah.

1553
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:50,400
Okay.

1554
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:50,960
Congresswoman.

1555
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,520
Some people might think like, oh, Nate corporate cocksucker, but I could not be more

1556
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,000
okay and totally cool with something like this.

1557
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,800
Anyone who abuses their authority or abuses their power absolutely should be held accountable.

1558
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,200
And so yeah, I'm gonna fucking do this.

1559
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:05,920
Sounds fair to me.

1560
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:12,480
I want to, I want to quickly mention or rather ask, have you got like, okay, today is 28th.

1561
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,880
Have you guys heard about like the supposed discord raid on the 27th that was supposed

1562
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,400
to happen yesterday?

1563
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:25,440
No, no, like several weeks, uh, uh, leading up to like today or yesterday, I guess, um,

1564
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,680
I keep, I kept hearing shadows and whispers.

1565
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,040
I was like, oh, there's going to be a raid.

1566
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,000
Is there's going to be a dox?

1567
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,960
There's going to be hacking.

1568
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,400
There's going to don't delete the PCP discord server, delete it right now.

1569
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,840
We have to burn the evidence.

1570
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,000
Don't, don't.

1571
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,320
Yeah.

1572
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,480
Basically just like, don't accept any friend requests.

1573
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,600
Don't, don't click any suspicious links from your friends and stuff like that.

1574
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,040
You know, everyone's just like, oh, I'm sorry.

1575
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:47,680
But you know what I got?

1576
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,240
You know what I got this morning in the PCP mail?

1577
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,200
You know what we got?

1578
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:57,600
Labs, we got two subsequent emails that were from, I looked at this, they're from a URL

1579
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,920
that's like, it's like YT, they say we are the YouTube team.

1580
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,920
YT-creator.ru, which is the Russian URL.

1581
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:14,080
And in the body, they say, um, excuse me, we have detected that your YouTube channel is

1582
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,080
uploading spam or something like that.

1583
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:22,240
Like we will take punitive actions unless you provide your name, like social security number,

1584
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,240
and password to your fucking account.

1585
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,160
They asked, it actually happened.

1586
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:26,960
You can go look at it.

1587
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,680
It's fucking in our email.

1588
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,240
So did you do it?

1589
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,120
Did you give it to them?

1590
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,000
Of course I did.

1591
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,680
Ben, I don't want to get fucking taken.

1592
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,280
Absolutely.

1593
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:33,920
Yeah, okay.

1594
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,880
Don't fuck with the Russian.

1595
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,480
No, I did not send the main thing obviously.

1596
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,600
Give them whatever they're asked for.

1597
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,200
Yeah, I've actually seen that around.

1598
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,080
Like one of the, one of my YouTubers, I watched hopeless speeches.

1599
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,600
She posted it on Twitter as well.

1600
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,440
And I was like, holy shit, it's happening.

1601
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,680
That's, it's really funny.

1602
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,280
Like I wasn't even close to attempting it.

1603
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:49,840
Oh, I'll look at this right now.

1604
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,600
This is so fucking bogey.

1605
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,240
Isn't it cute?

1606
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:52,880
It's crazy.

1607
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,320
You want to screen cap it and put it in the...

1608
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1609
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,080
Sick.

1610
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,640
Sick.

1611
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,200
Fantastic.

1612
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:57,680
That's it.

1613
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,240
It's so like poorly formatted.

1614
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,600
It doesn't look anything.

1615
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,160
Like the YouTube logo was like squished and warped.

1616
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,920
And that's why the official, official people always says like,

1617
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,880
you know, the official team will never ask for your password.

1618
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,800
We'll never ask for your password.

1619
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,560
If I hadn't been told in so many emails by YouTube previously,

1620
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,400
we will never ask for your password.

1621
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,520
I may have been more tempted to give them a password,

1622
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,080
but I wasn't even tempted because I'm a good boy.

1623
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,360
This message seems dangerous.

1624
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,080
Oh yeah, there you go.

1625
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,440
They're telling us it seems dangerous.

1626
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,040
Fucking yeah.

1627
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,480
You can see the URL in that picture too.

1628
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,680
Fucking Ruskies.

1629
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,040
There is it.

1630
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:33,840
Those sneaky...

1631
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,920
It's in the gross disgusting audio links.

1632
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,160
Oh, incredible.

1633
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,120
Yeah.

1634
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,280
So what do we do?

1635
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,160
Are we fucked?

1636
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,440
We're fucked.

1637
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,360
We're going to be terminated imminently.

1638
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,640
There's nothing to be done, I guess.

1639
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,080
We just have to accept our fate like the samurai of old.

1640
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,680
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1641
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,280
We have to lay down our arms and say something we can do.

1642
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,480
We can't fight the tide of history,

1643
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,680
aka Russian bots.

1644
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,560
Oh, speaking.

1645
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,360
That's right.

1646
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,680
Speaking of dying, press F for Ben's glass.

1647
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,000
Oh yeah.

1648
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,280
Yeah, before we started recording,

1649
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,520
I tipped over my favorite glass

1650
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,360
and it shattered on my desk,

1651
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,400
sending tea and apple cider vinegar,

1652
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,160
cascading over my desk on all my sensitive electronic equipment.

1653
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,880
We heard the crash.

1654
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,000
It was not recorded.

1655
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,120
I wish we recorded that crash.

1656
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,320
It was quite dramatic.

1657
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,920
I do too, and I realized that all of my computer shit

1658
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,440
is ergonomically designed,

1659
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,040
so that none of the tender mechanisms are on the surface.

1660
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,400
They're all lifted.

1661
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,240
Yeah, they're all held slightly above,

1662
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,480
like my microphone, my monitors, my speakers.

1663
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,640
They're all held above the water level.

1664
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,480
Ben, do the favor.

1665
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,600
That's, yeah.

1666
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,840
Red pill me on apple cider vinegar.

1667
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,960
What's the deal?

1668
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,880
Okay, I can't give you-

1669
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,600
Do I drink that?

1670
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,400
Do I chug it?

1671
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,040
Is that what I do?

1672
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,000
I mean, I wouldn't chug it.

1673
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,520
I just put some of it in like-

1674
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:51,840
That's good.

1675
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,000
I mix like-

1676
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,120
I mix like-

1677
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,000
And why do you do that?

1678
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,480
Why do you do that?

1679
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,280
I mix like lemonade, stevia,

1680
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,160
or lemon juice, stevia, some apple cider vinegar,

1681
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,680
mix it in water, add ice.

1682
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,240
It's good.

1683
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,120
For what apple cider vinegar is good on in salads?

1684
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,040
I've read that it's good for your metabolism.

1685
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,240
Okay.

1686
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,520
And also just think it tastes good in that mixture.

1687
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,920
Yeah, so that's kind of just-

1688
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,960
I drink a bunch.

1689
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,840
Okay, I'm sold.

1690
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,960
I'm sold.

1691
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,320
Yeah, I couldn't-

1692
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,120
There's probably more.

1693
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,960
That was like a cleaning product or something.

1694
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,200
I think I've used it for like athlete's foot in the past or something.

1695
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,400
Okay, it is obsessed with vinegar flavored things.

1696
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,800
Why would you use apple cider vinegar specifically?

1697
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,000
I mean, if I did, if I'm remembering correctly,

1698
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,800
I'm pretty sure I just-

1699
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,560
I did like a Google and went to like a how-to,

1700
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,080
like how to like treat athlete's foot.

1701
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,960
I think it said like soak in apple cider vinegar or apple cider vinegar.

1702
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,160
Apple cider vinegar.

1703
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,200
Whatever, you know what I'm talking about.

1704
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,400
Apple cider vinegar.

1705
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,240
Actual vinegar.

1706
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:48,720
Same shit.

1707
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,080
Yeah, it does clean stuff.

1708
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,200
Okay, I might just be wrong.

1709
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,080
I might just be wrong about that.

1710
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:52,960
But okay, fair enough.

1711
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,440
Fair enough.

1712
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,280
Yeah, I fucking-

1713
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,480
It's fucking vinegar.

1714
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,120
Go through that.

1715
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,800
I go through that apple cider vinegar,

1716
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,720
like it's something you would go through at a very rapid pace.

1717
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,000
Fantastic.

1718
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,040
If you can imagine.

1719
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,560
Do you guys, like in the America,

1720
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,560
do you have like salt and vinegar flavored chips?

1721
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1722
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,400
Oh, okay.

1723
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,440
I've never been a fan.

1724
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,560
I've never liked them.

1725
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,400
I didn't like them as a kid, but-

1726
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,640
UK has a lot of vinegar flavored things.

1727
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,320
It confused me.

1728
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,920
Animals, subhuman.

1729
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,560
Not a fan.

1730
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,360
One of the PCP heads that showed up to the RCK meetup

1731
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,200
was like, oh, you got to have

1732
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,120
fish and chips with salt and vinegar on them.

1733
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,560
You got to have it with vinegar.

1734
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,160
And I didn't-

1735
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,480
Dude, you got to have a colonectomy

1736
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,400
and a colonoscopy at the same time.

1737
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,680
You've got to do it, bro.

1738
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,120
It's a euphoric experience.

1739
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,840
Same argument.

1740
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,360
What do you guys think?

1741
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,200
About voicemails?

1742
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:51,680
Yes.

1743
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,640
What do you guys think about it?

1744
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,760
We can do them right now, if you want.

1745
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,400
Yes.

1746
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,280
I got them.

1747
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,320
Now, we don't have too many.

1748
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,000
We've got, I think four today?

1749
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,640
Four?

1750
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,360
Yeah, all right.

1751
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,640
That's a very low batch.

1752
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,800
You know, we've been getting fewer,

1753
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,480
and I think that we maybe discouraged them

1754
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,560
because I've been so harshly critical

1755
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,160
on everybody who's been calling in.

1756
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,400
Well, hopefully they're good now.

1757
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,440
I mean, these are all pretty good,

1758
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:13,920
I thought.

1759
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,600
I thought they were all quality submissions.

1760
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,560
And you know what, four?

1761
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,520
Pretty healthy number.

1762
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,560
Pretty healthy number.

1763
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,920
But I encourage everybody.

1764
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,440
Keep sending them, because I like them,

1765
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,960
and I'm happy to have as many as possible.

1766
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:23,360
I don't mind.

1767
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,240
I don't mind listening to more.

1768
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,080
Okay, but let's get to it.

1769
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,920
Oh, and a link to the Speak Pipe

1770
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,200
is down in the description.

1771
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,600
Go click on that, and send us your voicemails.

1772
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,200
If they're good, do cool things.

1773
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,480
I like cool things.

1774
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:39,120
All right, but our first one is from Polenta Meister.

1775
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,080
Polenta Meister.

1776
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,360
Yeah, it's a weird one.

1777
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,640
Okay, let's see what he has to say.

1778
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,640
You know this person?

1779
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,600
What's their reputation on the street?

1780
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,000
I mean, I like them.

1781
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,760
You like, okay, all right, fair enough.

1782
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,960
Let's see if they live up to it.

1783
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,880
All right, go.

1784
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,760
Hello, Pipe.

1785
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,280
It's your boy, Polenta Meister.

1786
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,000
I just want to tell you guys that we've recently talked

1787
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,160
about a topic that has grown near and dear to my heart

1788
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,040
at recent times.

1789
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,480
Because after going back to my country,

1790
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,280
after a period of working overseas in an office every day,

1791
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,200
I've gone back to working out and exercising my body.

1792
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,840
I gotta say, I completely forgot how good it feels.

1793
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,600
Yes, yes, true.

1794
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,960
It's really like 20 to 30 seconds into your reps.

1795
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,720
You feel like you're dying.

1796
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:30,400
I feel like you're turning into a sludge of primordial soup

1797
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:36,080
and sweat and lactic acid, but five minutes into them

1798
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,880
and you start to feel the endorphins rushing through your veins

1799
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,120
and pumping straight into your skull.

1800
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:46,080
And man, I gotta say, there is no way for me to say how good it feels

1801
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,160
other than comparing it to playing corruption of champions

1802
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:54,800
and slowly turning your avatar into a trembling mound of flesh

1803
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,040
and pieces of the giant and changing artfaces.

1804
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,120
But it's in real life and you're turning yourself from being a weakling,

1805
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:11,440
a pasty spaghetti man into a sculpted doness.

1806
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:12,400
Yes.

1807
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,000
I gotta say, guys, there's no excuses.

1808
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,800
Even you, Tom, can just build yourself a new spine and you're good to go.

1809
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,440
Yeah, Tom, quote unquote.

1810
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,320
Yeah, Tom.

1811
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,360
Get that new spine in there.

1812
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,680
Tom Cruise, maybe if you'd fucking done more reps

1813
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,600
then the Japanese wouldn't have lost the word.

1814
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,080
Maybe you'd done more reps.

1815
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,440
The samurai wouldn't have been cut down.

1816
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,080
Yeah, you'd be like five foot, you know, 10, five foot, 11,

1817
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:34,800
maybe six feet.

1818
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,720
If you'd done those spine reps, you cowered.

1819
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,120
All right, well, let's move on.

1820
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,560
I wait.

1821
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,040
Yeah, yeah.

1822
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,760
I wanted to say that I've been fucking,

1823
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,680
I've mentioned this before, I'm lifting again.

1824
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,680
I've been lifting for three weeks now and I'm fucking ripped.

1825
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,040
How many times a week do you go?

1826
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,800
Three times a week.

1827
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,280
That's good.

1828
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:53,840
That's great.

1829
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,320
Yeah.

1830
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,280
Doing starting strength.

1831
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,200
Speaking of those power cleans.

1832
01:15:59,200 --> 01:15:59,600
That's great.

1833
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,400
I should do those too.

1834
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:06,960
It brings me, it makes me literally want to cry when I think that Tom is too hurt to work out

1835
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,840
and he wants to go to the gym and he can't because by no fault of his own,

1836
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,200
his spine is just fucked and it's fucked up.

1837
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,560
I mean, I've been talking to him.

1838
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,680
I don't know if there's anything we can do.

1839
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:22,160
I told him just to let us know, but he can't even work because he's in pain.

1840
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,080
I don't know if you should even say it, but like, God, it's fucking not fair.

1841
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,520
It's not fucking fair.

1842
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,240
He was going to go to BronyCon.

1843
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,920
He wanted to go.

1844
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,200
He can't go because he's hurt.

1845
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:33,920
He can't go.

1846
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,760
Yeah, his spine is just fucked and couldn't walk around.

1847
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,400
It's not like he was even like playing B-ball hard in the court

1848
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,200
and he like broke his like, like, lol, shoot, I can't go to BronyCon.

1849
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,560
No, he didn't do anything.

1850
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,800
It's just his back is fucked for no reason.

1851
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,160
Oh, it's fucked up.

1852
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,320
Tom, thoughts and prayers, bro.

1853
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,440
Thoughts and prayers.

1854
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,400
Thoughts and prayers.

1855
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,600
Yeah, it's useless.

1856
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,960
I just wish I could help.

1857
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:53,840
Okay, whatever.

1858
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,640
Enough of that shit.

1859
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,160
Seems like seems like I don't know.

1860
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,320
I mean, I don't know if I don't want to be pessimistic, but like,

1861
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,400
it seems like it's just like gotten worse, like with for no reason.

1862
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,040
I mean, I guess Tom says, I think he says.

1863
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,600
I don't really.

1864
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,680
I should I mean, I probably shouldn't like comment on it without like talking to him about it.

1865
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,400
It's just my pressure.

1866
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,360
You're right, you're right.

1867
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,360
Maybe I'll ask him if he even wants us to include this.

1868
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,720
I just don't want to share personal info if he doesn't want us to, but I don't know, whatever.

1869
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,080
Okay.

1870
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,440
Anyway, oh, and I was going to say just specifically on working out.

1871
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,720
So I've been lazy about working out for the last couple of weeks.

1872
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,680
I think I went like two weeks ago once and I've been lazy.

1873
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:35,680
But but the good news is I have been perfect on my diet for the last like month.

1874
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,840
And I think I've lost, I've lost a steady.

1875
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,840
I can see it in my progress a solid six, seven pounds.

1876
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,520
And those those are real weight loss.

1877
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,360
That's not meme weight loss.

1878
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,520
And it's going going pretty good.

1879
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,640
I only want to lose like 25 pounds from that starting point.

1880
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,520
So once I get down there, I'm going to be going to be feeling good.

1881
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,280
But of course, the hardest thing is to gain muscle.

1882
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,720
So this is the easy part.

1883
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,800
I got to be lifting like a real boy.

1884
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,760
Let's go keto, man.

1885
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,560
Let's go keto.

1886
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,280
I'm telling you.

1887
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,120
Yeah.

1888
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,120
Wait, I don't know.

1889
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:11,280
I think this is probably fine to say oblivion fall contacted me and told me that he was grateful

1890
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,320
that I had spread the good word of keto to him.

1891
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,120
Yeah.

1892
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:19,200
He showed me before and after pictures of like the thing.

1893
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:20,640
Oh, did he?

1894
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,280
Yeah, he messaged me on discord specifically.

1895
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,800
No, no, he on Twitter.

1896
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,040
Oh, he could include that if he wants to while he's editing.

1897
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,680
Well, yeah, he showed me like before and after pictures from like February this year.

1898
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:35,520
And then like recently he lost, I think he lost like 30 or 40 pounds.

1899
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,640
It's great.

1900
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,040
Yeah.

1901
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,080
That's fantastic.

1902
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,640
I mean, assuming he wasn't already underweight, in which case that would be bad.

1903
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,480
But I assume that was not his ailment.

1904
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,520
He was a little chunky.

1905
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,800
He was a little chunky.

1906
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,680
And now he's objectively better.

1907
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:48,000
I'm sorry.

1908
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,720
Fantastic.

1909
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:48,960
Fantastic.

1910
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:49,600
I shouldn't.

1911
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,560
That's fatphobic.

1912
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,040
You know, I'll say.

1913
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,040
No, he's always beautiful on the inside.

1914
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,000
Of course.

1915
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:56,320
Of course.

1916
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:01,920
One can make a comment upon a one's outside visage and bodily structure without being

1917
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,040
judgmental of their inside.

1918
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,000
Well, he was stoked.

1919
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,840
Well, he was stoked about it.

1920
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,680
I'm currently, this will be out on the day we're recording this.

1921
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:15,840
I will almost a hundred percent be finishing my Uyagawa on Dunbaru Nankiromotaru,

1922
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,760
the anime about weightlifting.

1923
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,680
And I'm very excited about it.

1924
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:19,920
Yeah.

1925
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:20,000
Yeah.

1926
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,640
Yeah.

1927
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:20,800
Yeah.

1928
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,560
This is going to be good.

1929
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:22,880
Talk about.

1930
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,600
Did you see May's video about that?

1931
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,720
Oh, I did see it.

1932
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,440
I like skipped around through it and I thought her point was valid.

1933
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,240
I don't specifically talk about like her video because like, I mean her point is good.

1934
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,560
The thing is I'd already been thinking about that while I watched it.

1935
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,920
While I watched it.

1936
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,160
Yeah.

1937
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:43,280
I mean, would you be right to say that she's not really a fan?

1938
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:45,920
You know, it seems like.

1939
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,040
Well, to be fair, I didn't really watch the whole video.

1940
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,640
I don't remember if she said that she like liked it overall, but it seemed like the focus

1941
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:56,240
of the video was on like the like the unhealthy like body imaging or whatever.

1942
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,080
I mean, I say this is my video.

1943
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,040
That's absolutely true.

1944
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,600
Well, I mean, while it came up, it's absolutely true.

1945
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,200
She makes a pretty good point that like, she's like, oh, this girl, this girl is like,

1946
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:11,600
this main character is like a ghast that she weighs like 130 pounds.

1947
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:12,480
Okay.

1948
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,880
Well, the thing is like we need to first of all, you need to use Japanese standards,

1949
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,240
not American standards.

1950
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,440
And yeah, I have no idea what like the average woman weighs in Japan.

1951
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,880
So like an American looking at that, first of all, you're already coming at it from the right.

1952
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,840
What if the Japanese standards are unhealthy?

1953
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,960
Well, but they just, I mean, they have a different build.

1954
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,800
They have a different body type than like, I don't know, Italians or, you know, Polish people.

1955
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,240
I mean, well, okay.

1956
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,520
So we just need to know the facts.

1957
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,680
Like what's a healthy body weight for a Japanese person?

1958
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,160
I don't know.

1959
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,920
Well, who decides what's healthy?

1960
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,920
Well, what's the average fucking body weight of it?

1961
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,480
Like, let's at least have the facts before we decide.

1962
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:51,520
You can't just look at the average numbers and be like, okay, this is what's, well.

1963
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,480
Look, a doctor could tell you what's like, you know, what is healthy to unhealthy.

1964
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,720
I'm thinking there's a, maybe I'm thinking there's a, I'm thinking there's like a,

1965
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,040
there's a culture, there's a cultural aspect to it too.

1966
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,440
It's not like, we're not talking pure biology here.

1967
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,560
I mean, that's possibly true.

1968
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:13,120
But I mean, I don't know what the threshold for like, unhealthily overweight is for like,

1969
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:18,000
a Japanese woman, because 130 pounds is, I mean, it depends on like your height and,

1970
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,440
you know, a lot of things like your bone structure and, and all kinds of stuff.

1971
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,880
But I'll give you what you want.

1972
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,920
I agree that like, it does seem like Hibiki is a little bit overly concerned in terms of like,

1973
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,560
if her concern is health, but the show couldn't be clearer.

1974
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,760
Her concern is, I want to be hot to get a boyfriend.

1975
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,560
You can view that as shallow and that's perfectly fine.

1976
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,000
But this is her motivation.

1977
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,520
And that's, that's all there is to it.

1978
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:40,720
Yeah.

1979
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,560
Well, all right.

1980
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,680
Yeah, fair enough.

1981
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,280
So it is, huh?

1982
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,560
What, wait, what mage?

1983
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,720
But she's kind of already hot, isn't she?

1984
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,000
Well, okay.

1985
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,680
This goes to the other issue.

1986
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:51,920
Okay.

1987
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,840
First of all, we can, we can talk in the West.

1988
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,920
There's, you know, a increasing standard of like, we like fit girls.

1989
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,240
Sorry, I meant to say thick, thick girls.

1990
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,920
I mean, I'm personally, I'm not the biggest fan of that body type.

1991
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,360
But like, you know, I appreciate it.

1992
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,360
Like everybody else, I appreciate everybody type.

1993
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,600
But like in Japan, I don't think that is the necessary consensus.

1994
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,720
I'm sure to some degree it is.

1995
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:13,840
I don't know.

1996
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,560
I'm not Japanese.

1997
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,840
So I can't really speak to it.

1998
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,600
But, but there's another concern that ties into that.

1999
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,840
That's like another criticism that may makes.

2000
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,720
And I mean, I had thought the moment I saw the anime preview,

2001
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,560
I thought this to myself, it's that Hibiki starts the series as, you know,

2002
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,440
whatever she wants to lose weight.

2003
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:35,520
I mean, she's not, I mean, there's that, there's that one like close-up shot,

2004
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,520
like from like the bottom, like a down and up shot that like emphasizes

2005
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:45,760
how like pudgy she is at an absolutely, at the absolutely horrifying like 135 pounds.

2006
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,560
And then there's like, okay, she, she goes through the numbers and like the numbers

2007
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,280
don't make sense.

2008
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,240
I thought that, that was interesting.

2009
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,920
I, the numbers, you know what?

2010
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,200
I didn't even look at the numbers.

2011
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,440
They give her, they give her like, they give her weight, her height,

2012
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,000
her body fat percentage and a couple of other numbers.

2013
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,960
And May explains how like these numbers don't make any fucking sense.

2014
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,640
And I, and I, and I was convinced.

2015
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,560
I mean, I guess that goes to my point.

2016
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,440
That's fine.

2017
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,640
But I mean, at what point should we think, okay, well, I'll just say that it's,

2018
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,520
it's true.

2019
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,080
At the very least, I totally agree that based on like the Hibiki we see at first

2020
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,320
and the Hibiki in the manga for the most part,

2021
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,640
like just your average shot of Hibiki from the anime,

2022
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,920
she looks like a perfect idealistic anime girl.

2023
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,880
And that doesn't make sense for this show.

2024
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,880
It is simply preposterous.

2025
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,440
That's the, that's the opposite of what the show's point is.

2026
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,520
She was, she was drawing a little thicker in the manga, right?

2027
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,400
She was, but not consistently.

2028
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,800
So the manga is also not perfect in this way.

2029
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,880
It is better than the anime significantly though.

2030
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,680
So I mean, that's the stuff I talk about.

2031
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,160
I just want to, since you were talking about the show, I wanted to

2032
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,320
May's video about it.

2033
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,120
That's all fair.

2034
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,960
I just happened to see that on Twitter like two weeks ago or whatever.

2035
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,560
In terms of, you know, now I'm kind of curious.

2036
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,080
I did not analyze the numbers.

2037
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,040
Maybe I'll go back and look at that.

2038
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,160
Cause I did not even pay attention to where they made sense or not.

2039
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,720
I don't know.

2040
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,240
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

2041
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,520
Okay, anyway, big tangent over.

2042
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,440
Let's get back to our next fucking voicemail healer.

2043
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,160
We've got one from Zoomer Don.

2044
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:10,960
Zoomer Don.

2045
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,480
Okay, ready, set, go.

2046
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,480
Hello, PCP.

2047
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,440
It's Zoomer Don.

2048
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,800
No voice changer, no instrumental,

2049
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,960
no asking for relationship advice.

2050
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,400
Just a simple request here.

2051
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,040
When I am recording this, Nate's last stream was Minecraft.

2052
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,560
And man, that shit was cringe.

2053
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,120
Nate, you are going to lose subscriber.

2054
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:33,920
Oh no.

2055
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,040
But my request is for Munchy, fellow Zoomer overlord.

2056
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,600
Oh, hi.

2057
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,000
To teach this fucking boomer the ropes, man.

2058
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,360
Cause I know he wants to play with fitMC in the future,

2059
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,600
and I don't want him to embarrass himself.

2060
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,280
Nate was like, guys, what does shift cooking do?

2061
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,200
He starts shift cooking randomly.

2062
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,480
Chat, are you trolling?

2063
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,680
It's not doing anything.

2064
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,480
I did do that.

2065
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,680
You have to taste your own medicine.

2066
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,120
Oh my God.

2067
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,600
You don't know what to shift cooking?

2068
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,640
I learned.

2069
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,760
I learned what it meant.

2070
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,880
I still haven't.

2071
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,160
What does shift cooking do?

2072
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,000
It makes it automatically snap to your hot bar.

2073
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,480
Also your inventory from shifts.

2074
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,160
Yeah, it basically groups your items,

2075
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,240
and it's more efficient than clicking and dragging and stuff,

2076
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,160
which is a pain that I've been doing a lot of.

2077
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,440
So fair, fair.

2078
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,120
And also I just wanted to spell this like,

2079
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,040
Nate stays awake at night rocking back and forth,

2080
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,400
pining for the day when he can play Minecraft with fit.

2081
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,600
If only I was man enough at Minecraft to do it.

2082
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,080
I mean, sure that'd be fun.

2083
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,040
And yeah, I do.

2084
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,040
If I did, I would embarrass myself.

2085
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,280
So I'm not even interested in asking,

2086
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,640
but the narrative being paint here is incorrect, sir.

2087
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,760
You're overselling it, so relax.

2088
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,560
Now wait, you fellas, hold it.

2089
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,720
You went and oversold it.

2090
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,760
I guarantee that you've got their hat and care.

2091
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,560
Compare.

2092
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,280
Oh, that's an old one.

2093
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,560
So if that's an important ingredient,

2094
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,880
can't be added on experience quality,

2095
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,720
my friends, and quality care.

2096
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,080
Quality care.

2097
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,280
Oh, do you know what that is?

2098
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,720
There's your trivia day.

2099
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:09,360
Don't tell them.

2100
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,080
Guess, guess.

2101
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,440
So say in the comments what that is.

2102
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,720
Guess in the comments.

2103
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:13,440
Guess in the comments.

2104
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,680
How much money did you steal from?

2105
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,400
Did you ring out of the grasp of Equifax?

2106
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,680
And what is that song?

2107
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,600
I'm just like one, I'm just imagining right now,

2108
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,600
like a Nate versus Finn MC, like Minecraft challenge.

2109
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,440
Like they go toe-toe in the arena.

2110
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,240
I can't beat him at Minecraft, dude.

2111
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:35,520
I'm imagining, it will literally be like an anime fight.

2112
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,040
Finn will have his hacks on,

2113
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,200
and he'll just be speeding all around you,

2114
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:44,240
and he'll have the shadow ninjitsu models of his own self.

2115
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,400
They have shadow clones all around you.

2116
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:46,880
Okay, that's fair.

2117
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,040
You'll hopelessly try to shift click your sword

2118
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,120
into your hot bar, and then you miss,

2119
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,480
and then you throw it outside,

2120
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,240
and you drop the sword onto the ground.

2121
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:54,720
Okay, all right, that's true.

2122
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,000
Well, he fucking does the hit, the crit.

2123
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,440
That will happen, but that'll be the beginning of the arc

2124
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,120
where you face the final opponent

2125
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,720
at the beginning, you get utterly dominated.

2126
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,920
But that'll be before my like 10 month Minecraft

2127
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,880
training montage, like I did in the Pokemon race,

2128
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,280
and more successfully in the Dark Souls race,

2129
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,040
where I obtained every skill

2130
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,720
and practice every movement over and over dozens of times

2131
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,960
to obtain god-like speed and agility,

2132
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,800
and I will have set traps up

2133
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,640
to counter his cheating hacks

2134
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,520
and his god potions and whatnot, and ultimately.

2135
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,200
If you make the underdogs,

2136
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,760
it's just gonna win eventually, because underdogs always.

2137
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,800
Smash cut to like a year from now,

2138
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,800
like the rematch, fit MC, like cracks his knuckles in Minecraft,

2139
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,920
aka post, ashras, cracks knuckles, asterisks in the Minecraft.

2140
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,560
I achieved my samurai sword,

2141
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,160
mastered Bushido.

2142
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,360
He does his shadow clones, and then he says,

2143
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,640
Nani, and then he sees the nether crystal in your hands,

2144
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,080
and he's like, where'd you get that?

2145
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:57,520
And then he says, you can't teach a new dog old tricks.

2146
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,400
And he says, what?

2147
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,760
And then you blow him up,

2148
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,160
and then you have your blast resistant diamond armor on,

2149
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:05,440
you walk out unscathed from the burning inferno behind you.

2150
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,600
And I'll say, fit more like shit.

2151
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,960
That'll be my final word on the subject.

2152
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,320
And then he'll never be heard from again.

2153
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,720
Moving on, we've got a voicemail from Tyga Mike.

2154
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,720
Tyga Mike, let's see what you got.

2155
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,760
I love this guy, I don't even know him.

2156
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,480
Hello, I come to you all with a dire grievance.

2157
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:33,760
Me and my fellow voicemailers are having our vocal labor exploited

2158
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:38,160
by the disgusting host class of the PCP community.

2159
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:38,320
True.

2160
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,520
We deserve to be paid an amount equal to the ratio of time

2161
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,920
our minute and a half takes up on the show

2162
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,520
as we provided the labor of entertainment during that time.

2163
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,680
Saying it's your platform,

2164
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,960
and thus you don't have to,

2165
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,840
is like saying corporations deserve to make a profit

2166
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,880
because they own the means of production their employees work on.

2167
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,240
As 169 episodes and counting have passed

2168
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,240
without this injustice being corrected,

2169
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:06,000
it is only just that we viewers take violent action

2170
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,840
to overthrow our oppressors.

2171
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,360
Dismantle the pro capitalist podcast.

2172
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,360
Bullets for bed, news for bed, burn the mage,

2173
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:19,600
eat the munchies, guillotine gift, ground digi,

2174
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,000
wage cucks of the world, unite.

2175
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,040
Yeah, hard agree.

2176
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,640
Hard agree.

2177
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,880
Also just a little trivia.

2178
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,400
So we're like 170, almost episodes in, right?

2179
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,200
Yeah, this will be 170.

2180
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,880
This is episode 170, yeah.

2181
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:35,520
Yeah, okay.

2182
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:40,640
So but like the voicemails weren't around for 170 episodes.

2183
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:45,440
We know mage, but revisionist history is a hell of a thing.

2184
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,680
At least get your facts right before burning me.

2185
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,280
We've probably played enough voicemails

2186
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:55,200
to comprise an entire like two hour episode by now.

2187
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,560
I'd probably give you at, I suppose.

2188
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,600
Well, maybe, maybe an hour, I don't know.

2189
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,120
Well, listen guys, just be thankful that you're even on the show

2190
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,880
because we have an arms deal with guests being on the show

2191
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,560
and so you know if we're not gonna need voicemails

2192
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,080
because we're gonna have just guests lining and filling all the time for us.

2193
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,800
So why get a prerecord message when you have any guests on the show?

2194
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,800
Your guys are going the way of the samurai

2195
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,600
and I think you better hold on to your culture, you still have it.

2196
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,840
I want to acknowledge that we are indeed,

2197
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,240
we are indeed exploiting the labor of our voicemail callers.

2198
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,320
This is, we must do this.

2199
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,440
We must do this to survive in capitalism

2200
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,160
and this is why the system should be dismantled from the top.

2201
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,640
We don't have to though because we, we did it like for centuries without it.

2202
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,720
We are, we are, we are forced to.

2203
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:45,520
We are incentivized to do this.

2204
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,920
Oh no, we're servants, we're mere slaves.

2205
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,960
Oh, if only our bondage was broken.

2206
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,520
If only our bondage was broken.

2207
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,760
We have to pay, we have to, we have to

2208
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,440
fucking pay into social security

2209
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,480
and we have to fucking squeeze our viewers for content.

2210
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,240
This is the trade-off.

2211
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,360
Couldn't be more accurate, couldn't be more accurate.

2212
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,240
All right, we got one more final voicemail of the day

2213
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,480
and speaking to capitalism and corporations,

2214
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,960
AldiCorp is calling in with another message.

2215
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,160
Back to shill his Twitter.

2216
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,560
Well, let's see what he has to say.

2217
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,240
All right, go, go, go, go.

2218
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,520
What a great day for me, CEO of AldiCorp.

2219
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,520
Spending the bustling AldiCorp business center.

2220
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,120
Nothing could possibly go wrong.

2221
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,120
Let me answer that.

2222
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:33,520
Hello, CEO of AldiCorp at your service.

2223
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,520
Yes, I remember the Twitter ad from two weeks ago.

2224
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,520
What? It was cut?

2225
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,560
Oh, no, no, no.

2226
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,560
We spent all our marketing budget on it.

2227
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,720
If we can't make a return, we're in serious trouble.

2228
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,120
What are stocks?

2229
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,280
They've dropped so far, the Wall Street Computer's blue screen.

2230
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,520
We're literally paying people to take our money.

2231
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:54,960
What is that word?

2232
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,320
That's not how stocks work.

2233
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:56,880
I can't believe.

2234
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,720
Oh no, it's the PC police.

2235
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,480
They're gonna put me in voice jail, aren't they?

2236
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,320
It's all over.

2237
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,840
This company is finished.

2238
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,160
All my life's work gone to waste.

2239
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,040
I'm bankrupt.

2240
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:13,040
The rest of my days will be behind bars and debtors' prison.

2241
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,440
All for a stupid Twitter ad.

2242
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,600
Oh, what have I done?

2243
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,440
What have I done?

2244
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,440
Lock him up.

2245
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,960
You live by the Twitter ad, you die by the Twitter ad.

2246
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,240
That's all there is to it.

2247
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,240
Okay, okay, I knew what they said.

2248
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,440
Okay, you could lock him up,

2249
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,840
but it sounds like he kind of burned to death at the end there.

2250
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,000
I mean, he's on the run.

2251
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,720
It's only a matter of time.

2252
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,760
Well, we'll take his mangled corpse to the voice jail.

2253
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,120
He's an official member now.

2254
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:39,920
He's in there.

2255
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,400
Check the post in the description.

2256
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,680
He's literally there.

2257
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:47,200
Good job, I'll die of you've ruined everyone's lives,

2258
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,480
including our own.

2259
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,760
Listen though, I'll die.

2260
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,080
We should, can we privatize the PC prison system?

2261
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,640
Can we profit off of this somehow?

2262
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,560
Can we exploit their labor?

2263
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,400
I don't know about necessarily privatizing,

2264
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,840
but I'll tell you what, what we can do

2265
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,400
is just be extremely corrupt.

2266
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,720
And I'm happy to just,

2267
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:09,440
if Alda just gives us money,

2268
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,520
you know, I mean, maybe that could get him out of voice jail.

2269
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,560
I mean, that seems like a pretty good idea.

2270
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,680
We're not saying anything.

2271
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,680
I mean, it just could happen.

2272
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,680
I mean, anything could happen, you know?

2273
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,720
We're just saying.

2274
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,200
We do live in a world of possibilities.

2275
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,480
We sure do, Ben.

2276
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,280
We sure do.

2277
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:25,840
Well, I guess that's it.

2278
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,280
That's it for the voice mail.

2279
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,240
Okay, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2280
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,760
I still have one more issue

2281
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,520
about the whole burn the mage.

2282
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,680
Mame the mage sounds better, so.

2283
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,520
Mame the mage, that's much better.

2284
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,840
Okay, me and mage didn't get any,

2285
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,600
like, M alliteration for some reason.

2286
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,120
Everyone else got alliteration when we didn't.

2287
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,560
I got, we got, we got.

2288
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,400
Bullets for Ben, news for Nate.

2289
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,200
Yeah.

2290
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,000
Drown did you?

2291
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,720
Drown did you?

2292
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,000
Guilty gib.

2293
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:48,880
Guilty gib, yeah.

2294
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,440
So what the fuck, dude?

2295
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,000
You know what?

2296
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,400
Yeah, you deserved a rod in the voice jail.

2297
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,360
Fuck you.

2298
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:55,680
I got.

2299
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:56,560
What did you get, Munchie?

2300
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,440
Eat the Munchie.

2301
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,480
Eat the Munchie.

2302
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,680
How about murder Munchie?

2303
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,880
How about fucking murder Munchie?

2304
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,160
Yeah, murder, murder Munchie.

2305
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,000
Murder Munchie, name the mage.

2306
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:04,320
There we go.

2307
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:04,800
Name the mage.

2308
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,520
We fixed it for you.

2309
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,320
Yeah, that's right.

2310
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,920
And I mean, if Tom was here, we could,

2311
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,680
lethal injection, Tom.

2312
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:16,480
Yeah, there you go.

2313
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,280
Got it.

2314
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,480
He'd thank you for it anyway.

2315
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,200
He'd thank you for it.

2316
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,960
Lethal ejection, lethal aurora.

2317
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,720
Yeah, lethal injection, lethal aurora.

2318
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,360
Oh, that's pretty good.

2319
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:23,680
Yeah, yeah.

2320
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,160
That's pretty good too.

2321
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:24,960
Excellent.

2322
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,120
We made it.

2323
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,360
How about, try to think of

2324
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:28,640
what's this tea?

2325
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,320
What's a murder tea thing?

2326
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,440
Julie, there's something.

2327
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,200
OK, so this is what your demand,

2328
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,480
your demand compensation for.

2329
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,000
You're coming up to us with your

2330
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,560
fucking like child's macaroni drying,

2331
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,000
a.k.a. your voicemail.

2332
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,520
And you're saying, hey, can you put this

2333
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,360
in the museum, please?

2334
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,400
And then we have to go in here

2335
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,320
with our expert painterly brush

2336
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,560
and cure it and actually make a real

2337
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,800
official painting out of the slop

2338
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,680
that you've given us.

2339
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,440
It's only us who are stuffing.

2340
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,040
You don't see the only victim here

2341
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,160
as us right now.

2342
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:56,560
That's the only victim.

2343
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,280
Wait, I've got it.

2344
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,640
It's true, but I've got it.

2345
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:00,480
Traumatized Tom, because what they're

2346
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,320
going to do is Tom will be left alive

2347
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,320
as the figurehead of the old regime,

2348
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,680
so as to make peace with the common

2349
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,680
people who still respect their old

2350
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:08,560
overlords.

2351
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,520
That's his role.

2352
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,160
That's his role.

2353
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,280
Traumatized Tom.

2354
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,560
He's already pretty traumatized,

2355
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:13,920
but a little more couldn't hurt.

2356
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,560
Tear up Tom.

2357
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,520
Oh, that's pretty good too.

2358
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:15,760
Yeah.

2359
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:16,400
Trample.

2360
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,200
Trample Tom.

2361
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:17,840
Trample Tom.

2362
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,560
I like trample.

2363
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,120
Trample Tom.

2364
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:19,840
No, no.

2365
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,040
These are all great ideas.

2366
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,640
He's riding on the floor right now.

2367
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,680
His spine doesn't work.

2368
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:24,240
It'd be easy.

2369
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:24,880
Yeah.

2370
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,880
Oh, and undress Jess.

2371
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,480
Oh, that's, I don't know what that is.

2372
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,680
Oh, Lord.

2373
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,440
That's a winner.

2374
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,560
Oh, God.

2375
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,760
Guys, you know what we should definitely do?

2376
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,200
We should definitely incentivize

2377
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,480
people to come up with all the ways

2378
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,200
that we could die.

2379
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:39,760
That's a great idea.

2380
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,120
We should definitely laugh and joke

2381
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:41,680
about that.

2382
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:42,960
Guys, post and chat the many ways

2383
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,080
that you want to murder us.

2384
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:44,560
I think that's a good idea.

2385
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,320
Draw a fan art of us being murdered.

2386
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:46,640
Yeah.

2387
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,040
Yeah.

2388
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:47,440
That'd be great.

2389
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,520
Why is there no PCP porn yet?

2390
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,760
It makes me so fucking mad.

2391
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,720
Every single time I go on E621,

2392
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,240
there's no Nate Bestman.

2393
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,440
Like tag.

2394
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,800
Oh, it's fucking nightmare.

2395
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,840
What's wrong with you guys?

2396
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,640
That's disgusting.

2397
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,160
But also real real.

2398
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:03,200
Are we not good enough for you?

2399
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:03,760
Oh, what?

2400
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,360
Game grumps gets poly grumps,

2401
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,080
and we do get nothing.

2402
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,680
We get the scrap, we get the shit.

2403
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,960
We get the piss.

2404
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,600
That's fair.

2405
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,480
I can't wait till the,

2406
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,120
there's eventually,

2407
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,960
when the PCB dating sim comes out,

2408
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,560
there will be an expansion pack,

2409
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,280
if you know what I mean.

2410
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,800
I'm expanding just thinking about

2411
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,920
that expansion pack.

2412
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,920
You know, it's going to be.

2413
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,640
Oh, are you talking about the PCP DLC?

2414
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,480
Oh, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

2415
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,160
I can't wait.

2416
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:30,720
Hey, was there more coming from the dating sim?

2417
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,760
Yeah, they're still working on it.

2418
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:32,880
They're still working on it.

2419
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,960
Was there a date announced for that?

2420
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,080
No, I think they said like September,

2421
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,440
but I could be wrong about that.

2422
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,320
I don't know if I'm,

2423
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,320
check out at PCP Dating on Twitter

2424
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,120

2425
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:44,400
So that's where it's all at.

2426
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,600
Maybe I'll finally be in the game.

2427
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,600
I know Tom just got included.

2428
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,800
Okay, let's all go commit deceased.

2429
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:53,440
Yeah, he's right.

2430
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,240
She's right.

2431
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,360
Let's let's wrap it up, people.

2432
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,840
All right, more voicemails.

And most importantly, patreon.com slash

2437
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,800
the procrastinators.

2438
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,640
We will happily take your money.

2439
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,480
I'll die and others.

2440
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,320
One dollar, you're in the Patreon Discord.

2441
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,400
Five dollars, you get the bonus episodes.

2442
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,760
And by the time you hear this,

2443
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,800
there will be a new one.

2444
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,680
Isn't that exciting?

2445
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,840
So stay tuned.

2446
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,400
Go listen to them.

2447
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,000
There's like, I think it'll be 28.

2448
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,200
I think it'll be 28.

2449
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:24,240
And at tbcrastinators on Twitter for updates.

2450
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:27,520
Can we get a one in chat for Munchie House?

2451
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,960
Munchie House will be gone.

2452
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:29,520
Rest in peace.

2453
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,560
Press one, press those ones.

2454
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,880
And I shall record here.

2455
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:33,920
Yeah, the historical one.

2456
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,480
I hope you fucking burn it down behind you

2457
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,600
like the Elrics did.

2458
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,560
I will, I will.

2459
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,160
Oh, dramatic.

2460
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,200
A leap of trace.

2461
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,080
Don't lose your way.

2462
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,200
That's not Elric.

2463
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,120
All right, anyway, we'll see you later.

2464
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,000
See you next week, everybody.

2465
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,720
Thanks for being here.

2466
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,760
Have a good night.

2467
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:50,480
Good night.

2468
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:50,960
Good night.

2469
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,240
God bless.

2470
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,200
Thoughts and prayers.

2471
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:01,040
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2472
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:06,640
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2473
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:09,360
But I'm not working.

2474
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,000
I'm doing nothing.

2475
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,640
My dick, I'm jerking.

2476
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:17,360
Myself, I'm sucking.

2477
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,080
I am an asshole.

2478
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,720
I am a stupid.

2479
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,360
I've got a deadline.

2480
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,440
Don't want to do it.
