1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But I'm not working.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm doing nothing.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why did I'm jerking?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Myself, I'm sucking.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I am an asshole.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I am a stupid.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I got a deadline.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't want to do it.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome back.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Pro Crastinators Podcast.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's me, Munchy.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm out in the woods.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I've been straight out for a couple of days now.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The woodland creatures are my friends now.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I was on the plane and now I'm here.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Pro Crastinators Podcast is a podcast about all of my good friends here.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Where they come from all over life.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
High, low, slow, or bold.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They're all here.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They draw things.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No, they don't.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They draw things with their voice.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's what they do.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They video edit.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They're good people.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Here we go.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ben Saint.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He's last now.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's Nate Man.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hey, guys.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm the best guy ever.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Just O natural here.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Naked.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We have Tomson.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I just made a new animation.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a week old by the time you listen to this, but it's still good.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's still fresh.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Check it out.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's what that is.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's the way that you hear she comes.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hello.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am Trekin now.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There we go.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We have the digi.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How long since you've smoked?

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Less than five minutes.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He didn't.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You have to say.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What?

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You have to go.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You have to say.

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, you have to say it.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm keeping it all natural.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not into these laboratory produced chemicals.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm keeping it in nature with my sweet cannabis weed.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm smoking a fat bag of bowls here.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I was wondering how long it's going to take until someone mentions weed.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, zero minutes.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
About a minute ago.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I was waiting for everyone to say their piece.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
All right.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So here we go with fucking nature with fucking nature.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Here we go.

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh Christ.

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, my recording just stopped.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It just stopped.

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is that true?

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Really?

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It just stopped.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay.

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hold on.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's not good.

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Nature.

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Here we go.

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's nature.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
My audio is better now.

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Good job for noticing that one audience.

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Nature.

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Do not flanderize me is my first point about nature.

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We're not going to do the dictionary thing because everyone gets mad at us when we do

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
it now.

89
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's now like a taboo.

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
People don't like it for some reason.

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No one gets mad.

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We have to read this definition because it's the best definition there's ever been.

93
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
All right.

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Here we go.

95
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Urban dictionary definition.

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Nature.

97
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And erection.

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Little boy.

99
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Listen.

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Listen.

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Little boy on waking in the morning.

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Mama.

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's wrong?

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's sticking up.

106
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mother to her son.

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's okay, little man.

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's just nature.

109
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

111
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

112
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That is good.

113
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Here's how I define nature.

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I define it as the enemy.

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's the thing that we are all put on this earth to defeat and subjugate.

116
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Someday there will be none and that's when I want to live.

117
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have a complicated and sad relationship with nature.

118
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It is evil and I know in my heart of hearts that I have more negatives than I have positive,

119
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
but it's just so seductive in most of its ways.

120
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,240
It always tries to lure me to its green, vile grass, but I have to deny it access to

121
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,000
my true heart.

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You sound like a robot that's like in the middle of malfunctioning right now.

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What do you mean by that?

124
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What do you mean?

125
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So much that I can barely understand what you're saying.

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No, that's not true.

127
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You've got to calm down.

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You've got to take L.

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I have a lot to say about nature.

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I've taken my pills a lot.

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm a part of Big Pharma.

132
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We've been cutting down all the forest so that we can make more pills so that we can calm

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
your fucking nature problems.

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So if you're having a problem where nature is causing you to be hyperactive and fucking...

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Am I like literally the only one who loves nature in this podcast?

136
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, I do.

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I do.

138
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I like nature.

139
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I just realize that it's awful in every way.

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I like...

141
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay, I have a big point to say about nature.

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But here, here, let's rate nature.

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Like I want to say like six or seven.

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm going to say hard seven out of ten for nature.

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay.

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I give nature like a solid nine.

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I find cool shit outside like all the time.

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, I give a nine out of ten as well.

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Needs more purple though.

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm going to give it a...

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That is seven or eight.

152
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That is the slight eight.

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Needs more purple is the same reason I wouldn't give it a ten, incidentally.

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I'm with you on that one, Mage.

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm going to give it a solid two.

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I mean, I think it did some good things in its day,

157
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
but I think that it's been far surpassed.

158
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You know, it's been iterated upon and rendered mostly obsolete.

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm also going to give it a two.

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The only reason it even gets a two is because it spawned me and my compatriots here.

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's about all the good it's done.

162
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Nature is the final barrier holding humanity down from reaching its true potential.

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Once we surpass the limitations, nature is placed upon us like our own mortality.

164
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We will be unburdened by its primitive bullshit,

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and we can achieve greater things than we ever could before.

166
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm interested to see what Nate will say.

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I wonder what his rating is.

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You know?

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Because it would go to show from what we know about him that would be low.

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You might have expected me to say that I'm not a big fan of nature

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and that I only care about human progress and evolution

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and, you know, advancements in the scientific field,

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
but there is an aspect of nature that I quite like

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and I quite like how it affects the value of two stats,

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
usually increasing the non-HP stat by 10% and decreasing another by 10%.

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You know, like the nature of your average like, you know, a fly-gon, for example,

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
can make a big difference in whether it's turny viable or not.

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So in that respect, I find nature to be a very valuable force.

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
A lot of people criticize it for being overly complex and obtuse,

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
not making a lot of sense in terms of the Ghazam Kutzwerk of the gameplay,

181
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
but I like it. I like it still, though.

182
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Before we continue on the subject of nature,

183
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'd like to introduce a new segment really quick.

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's called, it's called Ben vs. Ben.

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, boy!

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, I like this.

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Here's a clip of Ben St. from episode like 10 or so of the PCP

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
where we're talking about probably sequels or something.

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ah, iterative works can never be as good as the original.

190
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Originality is the most important thing for a work of art to have.

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Iterations can never live up to originality.

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Fast forward, Ben St. 2018. Nature, gay.

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, you know, you're on to something there.

194
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're close to truth.

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You would have a point, except that nature is not a work of art

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
because nature was procedurally generated by an algorithm.

197
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, shit.

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So is Nuclear Throne not art?

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Is Nuclear Throne not art?

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is that what you're trying to say?

201
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, nobody made the algorithm.

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Wait, I mean, no.

203
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, God made it, you stupid idiot.

204
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Did you not read the instruction manual, a.k.a. the Quran?

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait, shit.

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay, all right.

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I've backed you on the corner now.

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Nuclear Throne is a work of art,

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
but any individual game of Nuclear Throne is not

210
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
because it was procedurally generated.

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Then where is the art if every single run is not art?

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Where is the art, then?

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's in the algorithm.

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You just said, if anything, the algorithm should be the opposite of art

215
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
because the algorithm is the part that is procedurally generated.

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I agree.

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The algorithm is not procedurally generated.

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The algorithm is static.

219
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The instances that are derived from the algorithm.

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The algorithm was crafted by a master craftsman.

221
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
God.

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, God among men.

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, there we go.

224
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We solved nature.

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, okay.

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Here's what I want to start this off with.

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Here's my big point.

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Just straight to the point.

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Use my main weapon first.

230
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I want to.

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I like nature and stuff, but I know how I can make it better,

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and here's what I want to institute across all the land.

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I want to amusement parkify nature.

234
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I like seeing trees.

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I like to breathe, and I like seeing relatively small animals,

236
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
ones that cannot pose a threat to me.

237
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Rabbit's a bit too big.

238
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I want to see maybe a snake or something with no teeth.

239
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's what I like.

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I want there to just be big sections of the nature,

241
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
forest, desert, whatever.

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Completely taken over by man

243
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and turned into nature light with all the edges smoothed

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and there's pathways everywhere.

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I want to walk into a forest on a street,

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and I want to just walk on the street.

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Have you ever been to Disneyland in the fucking...

248
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What's his name?

249
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The adventurer guy?

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The guy with whip, that part?

251
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can just walk around and you're in a jungle type place.

252
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I want to be in a jungle with roads.

253
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Aren't these called parks?

254
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm totally on your side here.

255
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's not nature enough.

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm totally on your side here

257
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
because I think all you need to do,

258
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
this is the one stop solution to solving nature

259
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and making it fucking awesome for everybody,

260
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
debug nature.

261
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, I feel it.

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And by that I mean remove the bugs.

263
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's what I meant by that.

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You just need to remove all the bugs.

265
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Nature's great.

266
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The only but someone removed is mosquitoes.

267
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No man, recently...

268
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So during the summer time,

269
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I moved into this new place up in fucking New York

270
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and there's a bunch of paths near my house,

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
really nice paths through just the wilderness basically

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that would be fun to run on every single day

273
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
if not for the fact that during the summer

274
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it's completely full of these giant flies

275
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
that love just landing on you constantly.

276
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So if you try to walk down this path,

277
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you just constantly have flies landing on you

278
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and it's so fucking maddening

279
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that you can't even walk on it

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and then in the winter it's completely covered in snow.

281
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So basically it's useless.

282
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I agree with you, though I want to have a slight compromise

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
because I love bugs.

284
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm a big bug enthusiast

285
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
but I do agree that they are sin.

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
They are what makes bad things happen.

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So here's what I want to propose.

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Reduce the population of all bugs by 75%

289
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
but increase their size by double.

290
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So you can walk into a cave somewhere

291
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and those will be huge fucking beasts.

292
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is just going to be an RPG world

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
where every high step give a fucking giant fucking bug.

294
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's what I want.

295
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I want bugs to be beasties.

296
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is how small and sneaky bugs are

297
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
so if we could annihilate that factor

298
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
it would be just less bugs

299
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
but they were all 100 times their size.

300
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That would go a long way to making me more willing to accept them.

301
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You want spiders big enough to eat you.

302
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You want spiders big enough to consume you

303
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
to get trapped in a giant spider web.

304
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
She's right.

305
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Bugs, there aren't insects.

306
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
They're still bugs.

307
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I think they are. I would consider them bugs.

308
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Bugs is cultural.

309
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Bugs is culturally just defined.

310
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If even a bunny could be considered bugs

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
then the door is wide open.

312
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The term bugs is a social construct

313
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
made by fucking hominid overlords.

314
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

315
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So what I'm saying is

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I want to get a soda in a forest.

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I want to walk through a forest.

318
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I want there to be a sidewalk on there to be ropes.

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I want to be able to walk over a ravine

320
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and be like wow what a cool ravine

321
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
but I'll still have a gun.

322
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
There might be some torches nearby.

323
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There might be some of that guided tendon.

324
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I want to be able to kill any animal

325
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that tries to defuse me.

326
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
There are places like this.

327
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is what a safari is.

328
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Like Australia or something.

329
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, but can I go to the safari two minutes from my house?

330
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Actually I can because it is a safari zoo where I live.

331
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But that doesn't count.

332
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's not true.

333
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That doesn't count.

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I want that to be every forest.

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There's places like that that they build over like a marsh

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
where you can like walk on like a bunch of bridges and shit

337
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and just be like whoa it's a marsh.

338
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Sick dude.

339
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That should just be all nature.

340
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That should just be all nature.

341
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Nature would just be better.

342
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Actually I want to say that

343
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
it's interesting you mentioned that Munchie.

344
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Like I'm imagining all of nature having paths

345
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and basically it would just mean

346
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that there was like roads everywhere.

347
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Like the whole country would just be walkable.

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So that would be fucking awesome

349
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
because I imagine like walking across country

350
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
would be fun if it weren't for the prospect of like

351
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I have to either walk on the highway

352
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
or fucking navigate.

353
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Nah man just everything's a road.

354
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And there's beautiful scenic nature around you.

355
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And then there's still

356
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
just one thing in nature.

357
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I want this to be like 95% of nature.

358
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What we're describing is just roads everywhere

359
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and like little turnways you can go.

360
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And also there should be danger zones.

361
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Like killing me fuck you Jones.

362
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like for the high ranking adventurers

363
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
there would still be caves set off

364
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
if you want to die.

365
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You want the world to be structured like an MMO.

366
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Literally that's literally what I want.

367
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I want there to be like high ranking zones

368
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
for if you get like a license if you apply at the DMV

369
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
you can get like a good boy haha rank

370
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and you can go inside these devilish caves.

371
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Those will kill you.

372
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And touching on something I think is important.

373
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I mean I like this idea for improving nature

374
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
but I think the single biggest thing

375
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
that nature is currently lacking is drops.

376
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Like there just aren't that many drops in nature.

377
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well you know the problem is that nature

378
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
actually has quite a few drops

379
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
but they're very difficult to find.

380
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They don't have enough, they haven't like

381
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the designers did not put enough like

382
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
shimmy shines on them so they stand out

383
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
in the environment.

384
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't think that nature was very well created

385
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
because the skinner box loop is not that effective

386
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
because the drops are so few and far between

387
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and they don't come randomly.

388
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
They've all been collected at this point.

389
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What is gold other than nature drops

390
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and they've all been collected

391
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and it's gone.

392
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But when was the last time you got a gold drop?

393
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I personally have never got one.

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Look what we're, the problem is right now

395
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
is we're just waiting for this zone

396
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
this planet to reset

397
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and that's when the next asteroid's going to hit

398
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
everything's going to reset.

399
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, well in the current medicaid

400
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
in the current medicaid the drops are just

401
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the drop rate is just so low that I just don't

402
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
feel engaged with the system.

403
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It depends where you're grinding though.

404
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Like if you go to like an apple orchard

405
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
in the autumn then

406
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
heck yeah.

407
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think it says

408
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Is that someone building like a farm

409
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
on their land?

410
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's literally a farm.

411
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's more like harvest materials.

412
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah but I mean

413
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
you can get tons of drops there but you have to

414
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
build the farm.

415
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You can't just wander through a random

416
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
forest and get tons of apple

417
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You can get berries.

418
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah blueberries and

419
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you can get mushrooms and stuff.

420
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You know these are all good points.

421
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I just want to say

422
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
by the way that I've got one of the best

423
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
rare drops of all time.

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm just saying is my elated Arab

425
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
gentleman who just

426
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
literally sprung from nature.

427
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's a legendary drop.

428
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh okay okay did you

429
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I wanted to say that story immediately

430
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but instead of immediately afternate

431
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
please say that story.

432
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You know what I'm going to launch you the whole thing so you should just go first.

433
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh okay okay did you.

434
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I remember the first time you told me this story

435
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I was in a fucking Skype call with your ex-girlfriend

436
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and it was the most

437
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
it made me elated.

438
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It was the most ingenious and incredible thing I've ever heard in my fucking life.

439
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It was a story arc and I still have

440
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the file of the image you sent me

441
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
ladies and gentlemen.

442
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Call the video games are dead on my computer right now.

443
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I still have it.

444
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well since I was trying to remember

445
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
where I had told this story before

446
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
it was only in a patron exclusive podcast

447
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
so I guess I could tell it here.

448
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So it's a simple story

449
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
one day I was

450
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
at some function

451
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
my mom had to go to the school and I went with her

452
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I had to walk home basically it was like a long walk

453
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
like a two hour walk

454
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and I was just like fucking I want to walk

455
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and walk and home

456
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and I'm on the side of the road

457
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
in the middle of an area where

458
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
it's just forest on the side of the road

459
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
like a 45 mile an hour road in forest

460
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and on the side of the road is this

461
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
giant cardboard cut out

462
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
of what can only be described as

463
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
an elated Arab gentleman holding a cell phone

464
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
looking like the most

465
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
most relieved.

466
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah a flip phone and he's got like the most

467
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
relieved face in the whole world

468
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
he looks like he just finally got reception

469
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
but he's like literally wearing

470
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
like a turban and shit

471
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
so I just find this cardboard cut out

472
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and it's only the top half of his body

473
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
just sitting on the side of the road

474
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and there's no possible

475
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
building it could have come from nearby

476
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
like it wasn't close enough to anything

477
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
so it had to have come out of the back

478
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
of someone's car or something

479
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
or just been thrown there

480
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
but I don't know the source because there's no

481
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
labels on it

482
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I assume it's from like a sprint store

483
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
it's a sprint on his phone

484
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
but I mean yeah

485
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I just picked it up and I took it home with me

486
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and nailed it to my wall

487
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and that's now one of my most prized presentations

488
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's incredible

489
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You can click on the link in the show notes

490
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
to see the image

491
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
we're talking about TV

492
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
oh boy

493
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Nate please I beg of you

494
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
we are at your will and we have bent our knee

495
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
please

496
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
here's what I wanted to talk about

497
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I just want to say be right back

498
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
someone's like knocking on my fucking window

499
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
alright kill that gremlin

500
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I've never heard me say fuck

501
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
that's nice

502
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I wanted to bring up

503
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I recently saw a video by a guy I quite like

504
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
on YouTube it's one of my ASMR boys

505
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
this guy named Ephemeral Rift

506
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and just listen to the name of this video

507
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
ok here's what it is

508
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
we belong in nature

509
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
in parenthesis civilization

510
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
is cancer

511
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
that is the full name of this video

512
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I hate this guy already

513
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
listen he's very woke

514
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
on a lot of issues but he is an absolute

515
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
seems super woke

516
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
he's incredibly woke

517
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
he is

518
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
he is like the biggest

519
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and narcos communist that I've like ever encountered

520
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
in my travels

521
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and it is very unfortunate

522
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
ok so this whole video

523
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you can go watch and ok you will see this video

524
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
if you go search his channel we belong in nature civilization is cancer

525
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
it will be in the show notes

526
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
there will definitely be a link in the show notes

527
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I have a gigantic comment that I left

528
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
on this video

529
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
under best guy ever

530
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
you'll be able to see it there

531
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
so he basically talks for

532
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
extended period of time

533
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
it's like an hour and a half long

534
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and that's fine

535
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
of why

536
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
human civilization has gone too far

537
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and we have strayed away from like

538
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
what he might be totally right about

539
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
look we right now

540
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
are all like lonely people

541
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
we're too capitalist

542
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
everyone cares about that

543
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
we can all agree with that name

544
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
we're all too capitalist

545
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
there are issues here

546
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
but basically his point is we should

547
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
literally all be living in nature

548
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
we should be living in like small tribes

549
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
the way that we did originally

550
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and it is his idea that we should

551
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
really go back there

552
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and he's woke man he accepts the fact

553
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
that there are problems with that

554
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
it's not going to be easy

555
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
but he thinks that is the best way to go

556
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and of course in my comment

557
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I point out

558
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
what seems to me like blisteringly obvious facts

559
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
like okay well

560
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
before we had like civilization

561
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
a lot of people died from diseases that we now have

562
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
curious for

563
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
so what about all that

564
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
do you want like all these pregnant women

565
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
to just die in childbirth

566
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
because you know

567
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
civilization he's talking about would be great

568
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
for like jaded guys like him

569
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
who are really fed up with their nine to five

570
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
jobs and this guy's a very successful youtuber

571
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
he's too fed up with being way too

572
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
wait wait wait wait wait wait

573
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Nate I need to interject here

574
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
because I have no idea what this ephemeral rift is

575
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
let me show you a screencap from the video

576
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
but go on

577
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
so he's a successful youtuber

578
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
he possibly makes his living off youtube

579
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and his solution is to get rid of

580
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
all civilization

581
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
in a cave and like

582
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
the entire way that he's

583
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
being able to broadcast this message

584
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
he's spiting

585
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
this guy looks like ben sates cartoon

586
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
avatar of himself but with a beard

587
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
let me see this

588
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
literally

589
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
oh my god

590
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
ben gets old this will just be ben

591
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
it kinda does

592
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I am interested

593
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
on ephemeral rift

594
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I am in no way trying to shit on this guy

595
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
he just looks like ben saint

596
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
with a grey beard

597
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
this will also be in the show

598
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
it's better than mine

599
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I just want to make it clear to the audience

600
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I think I'm changing my mind

601
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I think I'm going over to this guy's side

602
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I think me and him are just gonna go live in a hut somewhere

603
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I literally like ephemeral rift a lot

604
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
nobody go bully him

605
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
or say shit to him

606
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
but politely disagree if you do so

607
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
after watching the video

608
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
don't even just take my word for it

609
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
but it's an hour and a half long

610
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
this guy's sentiment

611
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
so many people put this idea

612
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
of nature

613
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and old human civilization

614
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
on such a pedestal

615
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
exactly and to me it is

616
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
clearly because guys like this

617
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I've watched this guy for years

618
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I know his full backstory

619
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
he had to work a shitty 9-5

620
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
to get himself to a place where he could support

621
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
his wife and kid

622
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
he's pretty depressed

623
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
he sees all the flaws

624
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
in modern civilization

625
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
he's very woke on all those issues

626
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
but what he's not focusing on enough

627
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
in my humble opinion

628
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
is the way that millions of people died

629
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
in extremely preventable ways

630
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
in the olden days

631
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and I do not think we're necessarily better off

632
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
just throwing away all the modern advancements

633
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
that's what I'm saying the nature metagame is broken

634
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
we had to update it

635
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
people are so obsessed

636
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
with the aesthetic

637
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and the romanticization of nature

638
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and it's like oh modern society

639
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
has all these problems we need to go back

640
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
that's the equivalent of saying

641
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
modern society has all these problems

642
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
we need to magnify them exponentially

643
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
literal romanticism

644
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
it's disgusting

645
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
we need to go forward further

646
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
we're in an incompleteness

647
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
my guys are not maturely looking

648
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
at how to deal with these issues

649
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I think we can all agree

650
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I don't think we all need to fight

651
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
hard on the side of civilization

652
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
should exist

653
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
opinion is rather extreme

654
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
but the guys like this are more

655
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
rampant than I'm comfortable with

656
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
they are more out there

657
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
you're more rampant than I'm comfortable with

658
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't think we need to

659
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
throw the baby out with the bath water

660
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and be like oh fuck nature

661
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
just because we favor civilization

662
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
but I'm not saying that

663
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm just saying that these kind of hyperbolic

664
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
extreme nature worshipers

665
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
that's not the solution either

666
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
it's not where we should be going

667
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
my understanding is

668
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
if you want to say

669
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
human civilization was a misstep

670
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
retarded but okay you can say that

671
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
if you want to propose that we go

672
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
back to nature

673
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
after having cultivated these cities

674
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
if you want to be like

675
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
practical and then say go back to nature now

676
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
that is probably the most stupid

677
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
fucking idea I've ever heard besides

678
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
being a porn manga artist in under a month

679
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that

680
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
the population is way down

681
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I never said anything like that

682
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
the population is way too high

683
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and I don't want to be one of those guys

684
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
but we've done things to this planet

685
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
that we can't really come back

686
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
from it would be weird to go back

687
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
you know what the thing is dude

688
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and try and be tribes again

689
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I don't believe

690
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
that this guy actually believes this

691
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I think he's trying to put on airs

692
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
while complaining because there's nothing

693
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
stopping anybody from just going and living

694
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
in nature you can just drop off the face

695
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
of the planet people do that

696
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
if you want to go just go do it

697
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
just go take your family and do it but he's like

698
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
no man that's these fucking commies man

699
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
they want like they need

700
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
everyone to do their shit or it's a fucking

701
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
problem no one's stopping you motherfucker

702
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
just go do it stop trying to drag

703
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
everybody else down with you oh my god it

704
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
fucking pisses me off and I disagree

705
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
with literally none of the complaints that he makes

706
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
in his video I agree with 100%

707
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
of them but the his proposed solution

708
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
is retarded is completely retarded

709
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
agreed well I I want to almost as retarded

710
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
as nature itself I want to get

711
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
on to talking about nature in a positive

712
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
way because I'm looking at the background

713
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
of this guy's video I like nature

714
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and you know did you you're the problem

715
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
you're romanticizing aesthetic that

716
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
looks pretty aesthetic is everything

717
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
if you if nature is good because

718
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
it has a good aesthetic nature is great because it is because it's like

719
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I know it's like you can see it can be like

720
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm not saying nature's good you're saying aesthetics

721
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
are good and I agree but actually

722
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
being there is awful

723
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
looking at it great

724
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
being there is shit

725
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I think the aesthetic of nature is felt 10

726
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
times stronger by being like

727
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
especially of a forest like this like

728
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
this shit when you see these in images

729
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
they all look exactly the same because every forest

730
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
is the same shit especially if you're in a forest

731
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
that's like in town it's probably

732
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
what I refer to as a septic forest

733
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
where it's basically

734
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
just a small creek that is where all

735
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
of the fucking septic tanks empty

736
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
out and then like

737
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
just a bunch of fucking trees

738
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
you know for and like a narrow probably

739
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
a narrow strip like you can't ever get deep enough

740
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
to not hear cars but that's like

741
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
most of the forest in like suburban

742
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
America and I use the high level

743
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
mob spawn because the excess of toxicity

744
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
you know yeah I used to explore

745
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
those forests all the time when I was a kid

746
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and just like play with sticks and fucking

747
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
you know pretend they were samurai

748
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
swords and cut trees

749
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
fun times you know

750
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
back before iPhones that's what

751
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
you had to do I never

752
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
had an iPhone but

753
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
the forests were

754
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
like you know I would just go

755
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
exploring with my friends and that was some of

756
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
my like most memorable times because

757
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I grew up real sheltered and like exploring

758
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
a forest was like whoa I'm on it

759
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
fucking I'm doing something away from

760
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
home I'm fucking getting out

761
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
but you know

762
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
it's like 5 feet away

763
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
it doesn't make you puke, it doesn't make you fucking cough and gag

764
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
wherever you stand you can go out there

765
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
you can fucking breathe, you can see green

766
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
occasionally you'll come across like some like creepy bug

767
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
you'll be like ew and then you'll touch it and poke it a lot

768
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
dude I mean the first time I ever went out

769
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
to the mountains and like stayed in a log cabin

770
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
out in the mountains and

771
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
heard nothing because it's just

772
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
quiet and you're just like what the fuck this is

773
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
it didn't even feel like the same earth

774
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
like I didn't know that like

775
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
reality was supposed to be quieter

776
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
nature can be very enjoyable

777
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
have you guys spent a lot of time camping

778
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
because in my youth

779
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
yeah it's miserable

780
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I actually love camping

781
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
it's just kind of a big work

782
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I want to get through my

783
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
forest aesthetics thing because here's how I

784
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
enjoy the forest camp

785
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I got into exploring as a kid just because it's fun

786
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
but later I got into black metal

787
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and like atmosphere

788
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
the same thing really

789
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
well almost all black metal is like about

790
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
how beautiful nature is

791
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and destroying human society

792
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and organized religion in particular

793
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and like paganism

794
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and shit so like

795
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
if you listen to like Agiloch all their fucking songs

796
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
are just like about fuck

797
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
like one of their songs probably the most famous

798
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
which is called

799
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
in the shadow of our pale companion

800
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
is a song

801
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
that is just about a guy wandering

802
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
in the forest having an existential crisis

803
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and like so if you're ever wandering

804
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
in the forest having an existential crisis

805
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and you put on this 14 minute Agiloch song

806
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
while you walk around it's like the most

807
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
aesthetic experience you can have

808
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
in your hometown

809
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
is this pale companion white privilege

810
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
that you need to smash

811
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think it's God

812
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
well same difference I guess

813
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I've actually

814
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
listened to

815
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I've listened to another album about

816
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
like fucking angry white men from

817
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Seattle getting angry and putting on silly

818
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
voices talking about how cool nature is

819
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
that I also did like by Kithkin

820
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
rituals, trances and exesies for humans

821
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
in the face of claps that look that up right now

822
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
actually click on the link of that that was good

823
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and I liked that that was also

824
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
fucking twinks from Seattle doing funny voices

825
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Agiloch from Portland thank you very much

826
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
so

827
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
literally this name one difference

828
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
between Seattle, Washington and Portland more again

829
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Portland is weird

830
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
so is Seattle

831
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
amount of homeless people

832
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
that is true

833
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
if I have the floor for a couple minutes

834
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
here I would like to talk

835
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
about my sixth grade camp

836
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
because my sixth grade camp

837
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
was the worst week of my entire

838
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
fucking life

839
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm just going to explain what sixth grade camp is

840
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
for the people who don't know maybe live in shit

841
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
countries like America

842
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
or you know bridge

843
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
like that disgusting

844
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
so okay sixth grade camp is you enter sixth grade

845
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and then you go on a camping trip somewhere around

846
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
the beginning of your year to

847
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
accomplish nothing really it's just fun

848
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I guess so I come there

849
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and the entire like week before

850
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm dragging it because you know I'm a

851
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
role player on the internet and I don't have time for

852
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
things like trees or bees or any sort of

853
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
bullshit like that I don't want to leave

854
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
my precious laptop and all my malware

855
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
written fucking like at least

856
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
web browsers I don't want to do that

857
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
but I'm forced I'm forced to

858
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm forced to so I have to go

859
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I get on the bus we go there and we're in the middle

860
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
of fucking nowhere

861
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and it's all fucking scary and and all

862
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
we do besides

863
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
sitting cafeterias where there's like no electricity

864
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
it's all fucking bull you know electricity

865
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
that I can use that there's it's all

866
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
horrible food it makes me fucking

867
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
sad and what we do day and

868
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
day fucking out is we hike

869
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
we hike through fucking treacherous

870
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
mountains if they're dangerous

871
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
fucking you know pathways

872
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I see I see like a bear at one point

873
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I see I see what are the dog looking things

874
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I see one of the dog looking things

875
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
cats that's where they are big cats

876
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
yeah and it's fucking

877
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
terrifying but but I came

878
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
to an epiphany of why I was there

879
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I looked around and like you know because

880
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I was a fat kid I was always behind and I was

881
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
lagging behind I needed more water than the rest of the people

882
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
so I was drinking and sweating so but

883
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I came to realization that that

884
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
around me was

885
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
pretty I liked it

886
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
but I just needed roads

887
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I needed civilization

888
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
to assist me

889
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
in observing nature

890
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I liked being out in the hot

891
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
blistering Arabian Californian

892
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
sun I like that but I wanted to do it on my own

893
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
terms and as a human

894
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
my own terms was destroying

895
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
all of the genuine sincerity of it

896
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and making it like an amusement park I needed

897
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
concession stands I needed

898
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
roads I needed fucking torches I need

899
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
tour guides if I had that

900
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
then this would be great if I

901
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
didn't have to like use my legs

902
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
well not as a not walking

903
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
if I didn't have to like jump up and like

904
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
fucking cross ravines and fucking you know

905
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
jump as far as I fucking could

906
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
then that would be great if I could just walk

907
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
places it would be perfect so

908
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
like I like nature I

909
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
like seeing the dog things

910
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I like seeing trees I like to be able to look

911
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
up mountains and be like wow that's a mountain

912
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
but I don't like being in

913
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
danger and being scared the

914
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
worst thing in fucking sixth grade camp was

915
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
like the second to last night where like we had

916
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
to like walk in the dark we didn't

917
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
we didn't hike this time we like we like

918
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
walked to a nearby museum

919
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
but this nearby museum was like like through

920
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
a bean off road

921
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
path and by road I just mean like

922
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
there's slightly a section of

923
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
this like grassland that does not have grass

924
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
on it it is just dirt it's not

925
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
an actual road it's just you know dirt

926
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and the tour guide

927
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
we had like a guy you know we were all babies

928
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
but he didn't do anything he was just like yeah there are like

929
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
snakes around here so if you see a snake well

930
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
bye and it was

931
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
terrified because it was in the dead of night

932
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
and you walk for like a fucking mile to get this

933
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
stupid museum and just look at dead things

934
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I hate dead things I want to be alive

935
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and that's why I hate dangerous things and that's why I hate nature

936
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I mean you live in California

937
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and there's a bear just on the flag

938
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
of California like

939
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
bears are real and they're just in the

940
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
woods they're out there they are

941
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
out there yeah like

942
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
they just are ready to kill yeah they'll just

943
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
come to you and murder you it happens

944
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
it happens that's not that's the state

945
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
of nature and it's awful and should be

946
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
abolished but if we had roads

947
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and torches and guns

948
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
nature would have to

949
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
bend to us yeah

950
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I don't and that's my proposal look

951
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
no no no you I think people have a lot of

952
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
human guilt and so they feel like

953
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
oh no I'm oppressing these bears uh

954
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
fuck them kill them don't care they can

955
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
die look this is what we need to understand

956
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
about nature do you remember like a few days

957
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
ago that that did you see that the

958
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
story that was going around on Twitter of

959
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
the lady who kept pulling worms out of her

960
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
eyes yeah

961
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
there was this lady who had to end up going

962
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
to the hospital because she kept pulling she felt

963
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
something wriggling around in her

964
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
eye and and she

965
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
could see it so she got

966
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
it oh and she pulled out of

967
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
your stories like that worms out

968
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
of her eyes and

969
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
they had they had to surgically remove like

970
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
12 of them from inside of her

971
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
eye and the reason it was so

972
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
fucking terrifying is because there was a parasite

973
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
that does this that before this

974
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
case we thought didn't

975
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
affect humans

976
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
oh that someone said had

977
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
some intersex of her

978
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
that is nature okay

979
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
fucking

980
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and her name was wife of undertale

981
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
yes exactly

982
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
so so so this is what

983
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
nature is nature is like

984
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
you know fucking like arachnids that

985
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
that capture things and then like

986
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
inject them with like

987
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
like fucking poison that melts their organs

988
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
from the inside out and they drink them up

989
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
this is nature

990
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
nature is fucking tornadoes

991
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
isn't that kind of cool

992
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
for a moment while we're on this topic

993
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
because I don't want to I don't want to

994
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
trail off from this topic and then be

995
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and relevant and here on this

996
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
topic so there's also like

997
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
these maggot things that eat rotten

998
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
flesh but they're used

999
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
medicinally so that to save people's

1000
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
like limbs and stuff to

1001
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
like because

1002
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
they're put on on the rotten flesh to

1003
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
eat it away and they do it so cleanly

1004
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that you don't have to like hack off the whole limb

1005
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
you just you just get rid of the rotten

1006
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
flesh and stuff so in that sense

1007
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
those sort of things help

1008
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and leeches to help in the

1009
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
back in the days and I think there's still

1010
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
parts of the world where they still use leeches

1011
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
medicinally and stuff

1012
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
nature has things about it that are useful

1013
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and and and that I wouldn't

1014
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
say that we shouldn't throw the baby out with the

1015
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
bathwater but it just

1016
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
it's not reaching its full potential on its own

1017
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
it's just so much of a waste

1018
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
also garlic is like the universal

1019
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
of antibiotic

1020
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I thought you were going to say anti-vampire

1021
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and I was just like

1022
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
you got me there mage

1023
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I want to start up a debate

1024
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
with all of you about

1025
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
the word nature and more specifically

1026
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
the word natural

1027
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I want to know where you draw the line

1028
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
between what is natural and what is unnatural

1029
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
because

1030
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
when we talk about like natural foods for instance

1031
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
like they always advertise themselves

1032
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
like oh this is natural

1033
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
which means that whatever is not this

1034
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
is not natural but like

1035
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
what is added to the so called

1036
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
unnatural version it's like it could just be

1037
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
pesticides or like

1038
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
you know something something else so

1039
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
they even

1040
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
even if you get a non GMO

1041
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
apple which GMOs

1042
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
like into that bullshit but even if you like

1043
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
you know a pure apple untouched

1044
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
if you get them today

1045
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
in the year 2018

1046
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
that is not a natural

1047
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
apple that is a man made

1048
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
construction even in its

1049
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
most basic form we have domesticated

1050
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
apples and pigs and stuff so even if you like

1051
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
get a pig and be like I want to roll around the dirt

1052
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
with a fucking pig that's not natural

1053
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
people don't do that stop so you'll contraire

1054
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
my friend I'm just curious would you say

1055
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
you lean

1056
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
more towards less things should be

1057
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
considered natural or more things should be

1058
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
considered natural because for me

1059
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I feel like I feel like

1060
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
you know people talk about for instance

1061
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
plastics and they're like

1062
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
oh that's man made

1063
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
and I'm like well no it comes from a plant

1064
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
like plastic is originally

1065
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I think when people use natural

1066
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
obviously know that

1067
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
when people use natural in that sense

1068
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
they're saying things that don't naturally like

1069
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
things that don't occur without

1070
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
having to be produced in some way

1071
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
by man

1072
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
let me say about plastics

1073
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
things about plastics though

1074
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
like if you put them on the ground

1075
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
they don't go away

1076
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and they hurt the environment so it's not natural

1077
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
in that sense like something

1078
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
it can't reproduce

1079
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
it can't continue without humans

1080
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
but yeah kind I guess

1081
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
but also like

1082
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
you have to be careful about

1083
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
what you throw away because you might think

1084
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
oh banana peel is natural and you throw it away

1085
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
oh you know it's not going to do anything

1086
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
but that's the thing if you throw it away on

1087
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
ground that doesn't naturally grow

1088
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
bananas and stuff like you know

1089
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't know in America certain parts of America

1090
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
you can't grow bananas

1091
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
it's not really good for the environment because

1092
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
the thing doesn't naturally

1093
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
occur there so it's not natural for a banana peel

1094
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
to just appear there so it's hurting

1095
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
the environment as well

1096
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
not as much as plastic though but

1097
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
you have to be careful about those things

1098
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I mean life finds a way

1099
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
you know plants will just

1100
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
plants will grow and plants would grow

1101
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
in just fields

1102
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
just littered with plastic shrapnel

1103
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
that was the only choice we've spoiled them

1104
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
we've spoiled them

1105
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
we made them soft

1106
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
there's already some sort of bacteria

1107
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
or something that does and I was reading another story

1108
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
about like intranobal there's like fungus that

1109
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
like break down radioactive material

1110
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
see they're like intranobal though

1111
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I think the problem is the reason

1112
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
the earth hasn't like adapted to our trash yet

1113
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
is we haven't given it enough

1114
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
like we got to train the earth

1115
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
we got to dump as much trash

1116
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
everywhere so that all the plants can learn how to

1117
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
take care of it

1118
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm playing the long game

1119
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I feel like only weeds would survive

1120
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
at that point

1121
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
how long have plastics even existed

1122
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
like maybe 200 years in the entire

1123
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
lifetime of the planet earth

1124
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
real quick question

1125
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
real quick nature question for you guys

1126
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
what is wrong with weeds

1127
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
why are they worse than not

1128
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
weeds

1129
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
it's just because they're not what we want

1130
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
they're hoggers for the most part

1131
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
yeah they strangle like the growth of other crops

1132
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and also it's just an aesthetic problem

1133
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
because they look different from the grass

1134
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
because like all plant like all life

1135
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
strangles out and chokes out other life

1136
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
in order to eke out its own existence

1137
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
what makes a thing a weed is

1138
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
that's nature itself

1139
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
that's the position you people are arguing for

1140
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
strangling out all around you

1141
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
is it that weeds have

1142
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
really aggressive genes

1143
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
like weeds will overpopulate

1144
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
an area and turn it

1145
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
into not good plants anymore

1146
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
yeah that's the thing like weeds

1147
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
most of the time they're not useful

1148
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
for humans and they also

1149
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
they're very aggressive and they kill

1150
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
other plants so they can repopulate

1151
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
so they're very invasive

1152
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and stuff though on that point

1153
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
dandelions can be useful in many ways

1154
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and I don't think they should be considered

1155
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
weeds necessarily though they are a bit aggressive

1156
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
according to Wikipedia

1157
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
a weed is just a plant considered

1158
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
undesirable in a particular situation

1159
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
there we go there we go that's what I'm saying

1160
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I googled

1161
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
invention of plastics to try and get

1162
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
like the date of when plastics were invented

1163
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and the first google result is

1164
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
invention of plastics by man is a crime

1165
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
alright I have a very

1166
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
whoa I have a very important

1167
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
suggestion which is that

1168
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
we all adopt weeds

1169
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
as a new racial slur

1170
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and it just applies

1171
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
no it applies to all

1172
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
races it's just

1173
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
whoever you don't want in the room at the moment

1174
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
is the weeds

1175
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
they gotta pull the weeds out of this room

1176
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
makes perfect sense

1177
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I fucking like that

1178
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I might cop a feel on that

1179
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't really know about

1180
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
the word weed for something else though

1181
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
there's too many meanings for weed now

1182
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
well the great thing about

1183
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
using weed is that you don't have to use

1184
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
any specific racial slur because it'll be

1185
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
understood like let's say you're in a room

1186
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
with your friend you're at a party

1187
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
there's a couple of Jews at your party

1188
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and you want to tell your friend

1189
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
that we need to get rid of the Jews

1190
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but you don't want the people around you to know

1191
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
what race of people you think needs to be

1192
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
removed from the party so you just say

1193
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
we need to pull the weeds and your friend

1194
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
who is also an anti-semite

1195
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
will know exactly what you're talking about

1196
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
or they can all assume that you mean

1197
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
like it's time to pull out some weed

1198
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and smoke it because

1199
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
no no you would never say weeds

1200
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
with an S if you were talking about smoking weed

1201
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
well maybe they're

1202
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
stupid no one refers to a plural

1203
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
of weed it could also be used

1204
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
for not racist attributes as well

1205
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
it could also be used for that if you wanted to

1206
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
it could be like you know if you're

1207
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
in the room with some fucking black person

1208
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
oh damn it

1209
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
never mind

1210
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
it's a lost cause

1211
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I mean what's important about the term weed

1212
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
is that it is complete well like

1213
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
it's like George Carlin said

1214
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
people say like the earth is dying

1215
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
like ah the earth is dying but no

1216
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
the earth is just an inanimate object

1217
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
full of life and what we really mean

1218
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
when we say that is we are making our environment

1219
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
uninhabitable for ourselves

1220
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
the planet's gonna be fine

1221
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
the people are fucked

1222
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
it's just a hot rock

1223
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
indeed indeed it's dumb when people

1224
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
like the earth cries out in pain no

1225
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
like it's this thing about I hate how people

1226
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
like make it all about something else

1227
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
when they're actually talking selfishly

1228
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
like I'm 100% willing to admit

1229
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I only care about the earth

1230
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
in context of like human civilization

1231
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and my own you know environment

1232
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
around me and the environment of people who I care about

1233
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
a little bit that's what matters

1234
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
that's what matters I don't care if like

1235
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
in 10 billion years

1236
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
we have all ported our civilization

1237
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
to Mars and the earth just explodes

1238
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
like well that's a shame that's too bad

1239
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
but I don't actually care at all

1240
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I would be upset

1241
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
if the earth just spontaneously

1242
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
was like gone and you know

1243
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
we were alive elsewhere on Mars

1244
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I mean it would be a bummer but I get over it

1245
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
but the point is that's not the most important thing

1246
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I wouldn't be dead

1247
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
the important thing is humans being alive

1248
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
that's what actually matters and furthering civilization

1249
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
etc etc

1250
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
that's what actually matters

1251
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
that's why ephemeral rift is a very silly boy

1252
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I can see him hiding in the

1253
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
the Martian bushes

1254
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
out in the nowhere in a Martian loincloth

1255
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
having a good time

1256
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
hey Nate, Tom, you people I know this

1257
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
like is there a way

1258
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
to make Mars green is that like a thing

1259
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
that can happen or will it always be the way it is

1260
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I mean

1261
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
we don't know how to do it

1262
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
but we want to

1263
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
but literally like could there be a way

1264
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
you'd have to introduce like

1265
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
different gases into the atmosphere

1266
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and do a bunch of other stuff

1267
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
guys, guys

1268
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
speaking about planets, have you heard about a planet that like

1269
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
it can sort of be inhabitable

1270
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
by human life but only like on a

1271
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
various sliver sort of of it

1272
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
because it doesn't rotate so one side is too hot

1273
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
the other is too cold

1274
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and there's like one slip

1275
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
that's just perfect but it's in constant

1276
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
like twilight so like

1277
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I think that the like it looks

1278
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
kind of like hell because

1279
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
awesome, Star Wars

1280
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
that's so cool

1281
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
that's my home planet

1282
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
the hot ease and the cold ease

1283
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
on the opposite sides of the planet

1284
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
that's exactly what I was going to say

1285
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
because there would be people who would go on the dark side

1286
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
of that planet no matter what

1287
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
so there would totally be a class divide

1288
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
because you know they would ship all of their fucking

1289
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
groveling street urges to the dark side

1290
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
and be like a fucking darky just came to life

1291
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
like you know what we going to fucking dark us down here

1292
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
get these fucking weeds out of here

1293
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
yeah exactly

1294
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
that would be great

1295
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
we've brushed up upon and what

1296
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
will now be the big thing we argue about

1297
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
is environmentalism

1298
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
and the planet and global warming

1299
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and Al Gore did he invent the internet

1300
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
yes or no

1301
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
probably yes

1302
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
who else would be smart enough to invent the internet

1303
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I don't know anybody

1304
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
so what

1305
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
what level of

1306
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
commitment and responsibility

1307
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
do humans have

1308
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
to take care of the planet

1309
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
do we have any responsibility

1310
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
or is it just all like we should do this for our own sake

1311
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
or do we have

1312
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
do we have anything to give back to the planet

1313
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
is there any sort of moral

1314
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
or virtuous argument that can be made

1315
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
we should take care of the bone

1316
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
like why

1317
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I mean I like earth

1318
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
it's good if we have to live here

1319
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
forever we should take care of it

1320
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
but like

1321
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
this is gonna die one way or another

1322
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
like everything else

1323
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
fuck it

1324
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
yeah

1325
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
tossing the garbage

1326
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I think it's very important

1327
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
we're not gonna be ported to Mars

1328
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
our whole civilization for a very long time

1329
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
if we make that shit happen

1330
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
so I would say it's pretty important

1331
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
that we take care of the earth

1332
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm actually pretty pro environmentalism

1333
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
but at the same time you have to consider

1334
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
it is true that you don't want your

1335
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
completely crush your

1336
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
economic development

1337
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
who here will always walk all the way

1338
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
to the trash can to throw something away

1339
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
me

1340
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I always do

1341
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I pocket my trash and I wait

1342
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
until I find a trash can

1343
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
you mean as opposed to just throwing it on the ground

1344
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I mean I just leave it all over my desk

1345
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
it makes its way to the trash

1346
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
eventually

1347
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I think you were talking about making sweet long range dunks

1348
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
of my trash

1349
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm totally doing that

1350
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I'm saying when you're out

1351
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
if you're out somewhere and you've got trash

1352
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and there's not a trash can anywhere around

1353
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
well you carry that shit around until you find a trash can

1354
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
yeah absolutely

1355
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
anyone who doesn't is a fucking asshole

1356
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
okay so everyone in here is a real good boy

1357
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
what about cigarette butts

1358
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
would you throw the I mean I don't know if anybody

1359
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
um

1360
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
you even have to consider that cigarette butts don't count in the same category

1361
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
already makes you a bad person right off the bat

1362
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'm just asking

1363
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm just asking how all of you feel

1364
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Nate or Ben would you toss a cigarette butt on the ground

1365
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I would toss a cigarette butt like on a sidewalk

1366
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I would toss it

1367
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
in like an urban area

1368
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
at least stomp on it because I

1369
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
there's nothing more than I hate

1370
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I just hate it

1371
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
when people throw down like lit cigarettes

1372
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
on the ground

1373
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and they almost stomp it out

1374
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
fire on the sidewalk

1375
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
you degenerate piece of shit smokers

1376
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
you should all fucking die

1377
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
for any of you

1378
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
straight edge boys

1379
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
straight edge brothers

1380
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I hate the fact that

1381
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I deserve to just throw my fucking cigarette butts on the ground

1382
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
like a fucking asshole

1383
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I have a special license to that

1384
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
it's okay if I live here because it's kind of small

1385
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'm saying in like urban areas

1386
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
those streets get swept

1387
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
there are sweet streepers that sweep up detritus on the streets

1388
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
so why not just throw it on the street

1389
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
if I'm a vapor

1390
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I can just smash it on the fucking ground

1391
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
and I can just go and walk away

1392
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
like that's fine

1393
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
yeah it's gonna get swept up

1394
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
who gives a shit

1395
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
because we're making the world worse

1396
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I'm not because the street sweepers are coming

1397
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
whether I do that or not

1398
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
but in the meantime

1399
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
people are gonna step on these fucking butts

1400
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and be like ew gross

1401
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
who the fuck would even notice

1402
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
who

1403
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
me every day

1404
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I walk and I see

1405
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
literally littering and it's not okay

1406
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
dirt is purely aesthetic

1407
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
it's not even real

1408
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I look for people who wouldn't litter

1409
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I hate seeing litter all over

1410
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
like fucking

1411
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
just like just carry it a little bit

1412
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
or just throw it into a bin

1413
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I hate litter so much

1414
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
it's funny because

1415
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
the reason I asked that question about the cigarette butts

1416
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
is that I will always

1417
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
go out of my way to throw a cigarette butt in a trash can

1418
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
unless there isn't a trash can

1419
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
but I am not carrying it around

1420
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
because that shit will make my pockets stink

1421
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and it gives a little fucking

1422
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
that is your problem

1423
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
that would be my suggestion

1424
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I don't smoke anymore anyway

1425
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
have a little plastic bag ready in your pocket

1426
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
you don't smoke that particular drug

1427
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
no I don't smoke tobacco cigarettes anymore

1428
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
did you

1429
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
just have a little plastic bag ready in your pocket

1430
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
for cigarette butts

1431
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
that's like a huge

1432
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
ask

1433
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
god what up

1434
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
heaven forbid

1435
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I take responsibility to my own hands

1436
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and forge my life

1437
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
to be this way

1438
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
one second ago I was like

1439
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
fuck the earth and you were all like

1440
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
okay and now I was like

1441
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
there's cigarette butts on the ground when I can't find a trash can

1442
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and everyone's like oh Hitler

1443
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
like

1444
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
you guys are fucking full of shit

1445
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm 100% consistent the earth has no long term significance

1446
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but while it's our environment

1447
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
it matters incredibly so

1448
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
this is our shit let's not fuck it up

1449
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
a cigarette butt on the sidewalk

1450
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
is not like detrimental to the earth

1451
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and the problem is that

1452
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
if you say you don't vote

1453
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and everyone says they don't vote

1454
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
then no one votes

1455
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
exactly I mean that's the same yeah

1456
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I don't care

1457
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
you got down to the obvious bin

1458
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I think they're aesthetically pleasing

1459
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
what you gonna do now

1460
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I

1461
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I will okay okay bin

1462
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
you are wrong but I will

1463
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
say that I do

1464
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
like this is a vice

1465
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
of mine but even though

1466
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
this is like a porn fantasy

1467
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
this is like a degradation fantasy

1468
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I like dirty cities

1469
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
they're pretty pleasing to look at

1470
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
if I see like a city

1471
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
a grungy looking city in a cartoon

1472
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
or a video game

1473
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
yeah I'll be like

1474
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
yeah

1475
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
if you were open like some steam coming out

1476
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
and I slip on a puddle of dirty fucking

1477
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
muckin' cum then I'll be like

1478
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
yes this is what I live for

1479
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I like to see the smokes here inside

1480
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I wanna see smoke fucking fill the skies

1481
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I wanna be there no cloud

1482
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I wanna be in factories everywhere

1483
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
here's a good rule of thumb to operate yourself by

1484
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
in these urban environments

1485
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
if with whatever you're doing

1486
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
if Rorschach walked by and saw you doing

1487
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
what you're thinking of doing

1488
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
would he beat you to death

1489
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
don't do it and that's exactly what

1490
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
using Rorschach as your moral compass

1491
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
yes

1492
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
think about that for a second

1493
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
yeah that's right

1494
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
he did nothing wrong

1495
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
okay good

1496
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
are you talking shit on Rorschach right now

1497
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
he's a fucking psycho dude

1498
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
he's a fucking psycho murderer

1499
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
it's true he was

1500
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
he was the best guy

1501
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
the best guy

1502
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
another vice of mine

1503
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
sometimes

1504
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'll say I want a amusement parkification

1505
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I want all that by the way

1506
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
hashtag a amusement parkification for nature

1507
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
occasionally

1508
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I'll still be like

1509
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
oh I'll read a creepy posse

1510
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and there'll be an evil clown man in the forest

1511
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and I'll be like why don't we just get rid of forest

1512
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
why don't we just like have

1513
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
we don't just make oxygen

1514
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
then go to the sewers my chief

1515
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
that's right

1516
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
but if we just make

1517
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
tanks of oxygen

1518
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
and just like make them respawn a lot somehow

1519
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
there would be no creepypasta

1520
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
why don't we just have

1521
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
no where to go

1522
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
those clowns will move to the sewers

1523
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
duh

1524
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
now they're closer to me

1525
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I'm fucked up

1526
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
we already have co2 spawners they're called trees

1527
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
we might as well just use them

1528
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
we need forests so we can exile freaks

1529
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
like where are we gonna send them

1530
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
what if we could have

1531
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
what if we had

1532
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
natural

1533
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
concentration camps but they were in the forest

1534
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and instead of killing them we could just be like

1535
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
okay go back to nature now

1536
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
are you a tribe now

1537
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
are you in reservations or something

1538
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
oh here's a suggestion

1539
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
install lights in the forest so it's not dark and creepy

1540
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
that's a good idea

1541
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I have no problem with that

1542
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
but look manchi we need

1543
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I want string lights just on all the trees in America

1544
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I want Christmas lights

1545
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
to line the top of forests

1546
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I want Christmas lights in jungles

1547
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
here's how we're gonna put them up

1548
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
we're just gonna have

1549
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
a bunch of fucking kids with string lights

1550
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
just run around the forest

1551
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
run between trees

1552
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
so we can get lights on them

1553
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
and get rid of kids at the same time

1554
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
two problems solved at the same time

1555
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I like it

1556
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
here's what we go we get the unitesates air force

1557
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
to get a giant net full of Christmas trees

1558
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and just air raid forests

1559
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
and just jump a fucking ton of lights

1560
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
over the top of them

1561
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
we want to utilize the native population

1562
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I've got a two word solution for this

1563
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
t-shirt cannons

1564
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
that's how we do it

1565
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
that's how we modernize t-shirt cannons

1566
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
that's how we're gonna get them

1567
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
good

1568
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
okay okay okay

1569
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I love nature

1570
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and I like it

1571
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
there we go that was my point

1572
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
well this podcast is winding down

1573
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I think

1574
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I wanted to tell

1575
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
a story about trees but it's kind of

1576
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
boring after all that discussion

1577
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
can you compress it into two sentences

1578
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
no

1579
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
well I try

1580
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
because I really

1581
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
love nature and especially love trees

1582
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
when I was a little kid I loved trees so much

1583
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
that if I accidentally

1584
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
broke a branch or took

1585
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
some leaves from it I would out loud

1586
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
say I'm sorry tree and I would

1587
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
give it a hug and I would make my friends

1588
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
do it and they would do it

1589
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
at least around me

1590
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
oh I feel so sad

1591
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
whenever I step on a snail

1592
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
oh fuck any of you

1593
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I once felt guilty for

1594
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
like a week because I had

1595
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
a snail and I

1596
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
went on a bus and I was holding the snail

1597
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
and it fell out of my hands and then

1598
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I actually raised

1599
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
my hands as pets but that's beside the point

1600
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
at this point in time of the story

1601
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
it fell out of my hands

1602
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
and some guy stepped on the snail

1603
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
and I felt so bad because

1604
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
like if I hadn't brought that snail with me

1605
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
it would still be alive and I just I just cried

1606
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I was a little kid and I cried

1607
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
you're often out of mage with snails I want that

1608
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I love snails

1609
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I had them as pets and like

1610
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I fed them a little bit of carrot and they

1611
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
freaking loved the carrot and it was really cute

1612
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
wait how big

1613
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
snails you have

1614
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
small, very small, they're garden snails basically

1615
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
how they can eat carrots

1616
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
well yeah they

1617
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
normal a little bit it was adorable

1618
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
they just a little crazy

1619
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
did you ever race them

1620
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
did you ever race the snails

1621
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
race?

1622
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
yeah race you know

1623
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
when I was a kid yeah that's what we used to do

1624
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
with other kids

1625
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
we would pick our snails and we had little snail races

1626
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
just like an undertale

1627
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
was there a big snail

1628
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
culture with the lady

1629
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
and every kid

1630
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
have their own decked out

1631
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
personalized snail

1632
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
you would put them in the arena

1633
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
the snails

1634
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
they came in very many

1635
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
different colors and stuff so

1636
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
my favorites were the pink ones

1637
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
they still are

1638
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
snails are way more diverse

1639
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
where you come from

1640
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
snail shells

1641
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
oh the shells

1642
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
okay

1643
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
around Boston there were some really

1644
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
sweet spiral shell snails

1645
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
crawling around people's gardens and stuff

1646
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
around here in Georgia all we got are slugs

1647
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
and I hate them

1648
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
they're really boring as well as being gross

1649
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
they're just long and thin

1650
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
they look like worms but they don't move

1651
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
speaking of worms I also had worms as pets at some point

1652
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I really like nature

1653
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
this is a good said way

1654
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
this is not extremely topic

1655
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
viewers this is a real thing I wanted you to do

1656
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
this was it out of my note

1657
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I have a big thing I want to say animals

1658
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
animals in nature

1659
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I love

1660
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
about grasshoppers

1661
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
another thing I used to do in my youth

1662
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm not sure if they're called crickets or grasshoppers

1663
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
they were tiny the small ones

1664
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
the small colorful ones

1665
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
grasshoppers

1666
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
crickets are black

1667
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
so there used to be this

1668
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
small field by my neighborhood

1669
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
somewhere and it had like super

1670
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
tall grass like Pokemon tall grass

1671
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
and I would sometimes

1672
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
go there during the evenings when I had nothing to do

1673
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
during the summer and there were like

1674
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
grasshoppers and stuff and I would capture them

1675
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
but you know like I wouldn't like

1676
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
capture them with both of my hands

1677
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
what I would do I would like bend

1678
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
lean over extend

1679
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
my finger to the grasshopper and usually

1680
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
it would like hop away but after like two or

1681
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
three times the grasshopper would just climb

1682
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
onto my finger on its own

1683
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
and I'd be like hello little friend and then

1684
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I would stare at it and it just had fun with it

1685
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
and once I'm done I would like

1686
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
let it hop away and that was fun

1687
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
fucking rip off its limbs one by one

1688
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
yeah

1689
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
so you feel powerful for what's in your life

1690
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I was

1691
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I once felt like a grasshopper that was like

1692
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
black and red and was fucking energy and I

1693
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
loved it and I needed it

1694
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
sadly later on I learned that

1695
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
they only lived through in the summer and I was really

1696
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
sad the next year I was like I miss my friend

1697
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I wish I had

1698
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
a fucking edgy grasshopper

1699
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I wish I had like an edgy buggy that was my companion

1700
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I would take him on adventures that's

1701
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
you lived far more than I have

1702
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
there isn't that is there that's too bad

1703
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
there should be an edgy bug in pokemon

1704
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
uh saizor

1705
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
that's kind of edgy not edgy enough though

1706
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
he's a good um

1707
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I love edgy things edgy things are the only thing I

1708
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
fucking live for that's why I like the trolls

1709
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
and homesick so they're fucking edgy and stupid

1710
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and they're violent and I like it

1711
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
people steal bugs

1712
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
ok hold on pokemon not real

1713
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
here's what are real animals

1714
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I take edgy I take

1715
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
umbraze with your hatred of animals animals

1716
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
are fucking great they are incredible

1717
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
they are a net positive 100% time

1718
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
bugs don't count cause fuck bugs but

1719
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
but big animals real big

1720
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
mammals and fish and shit I fucking

1721
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
love you know why

1722
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
because they're always terrifying

1723
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
there is not a single animal

1724
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
that does not make me shit myself

1725
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I walked around and said I see you all fucking

1726
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
dead I was gonna say you can see a bear

1727
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
slightly less scared but still extremely

1728
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
scared animals are fucking

1729
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
a beast of the land they are beast

1730
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and they are terrifying and the

1731
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
and animals come like like animals

1732
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
are like humans are

1733
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
animals we come from this land of

1734
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
beasts and disgusting awful

1735
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
scary like like cthulhu

1736
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
type monsters that are snails

1737
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
and dogs we come

1738
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
from that barbaric age and we have

1739
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
conquered we animals have

1740
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
conquered and we come civilized

1741
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
and cultured and incredible and now

1742
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
we now we control the

1743
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
beast of the land now we control the

1744
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
the weird awful

1745
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
archaic beast

1746
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
of the land and we are the masters of society

1747
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
we have done it we have conquered

1748
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
animals and that's what the beast of the land is

1749
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
whenever I walk out and see a snail I think wow we have done it

1750
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
humans have gone so far we've

1751
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
escaped the clutches of nature and we have done

1752
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
it I hate animals

1753
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
we uh you know it's fair to

1754
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
it's fair to remember it's fair to remember

1755
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
that uh we have no

1756
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
formalized contract people don't like animals

1757
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
so animals are great

1758
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
we have no contract with the animals and we

1759
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
can take them or leave them

1760
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
oh my god shut the fuck up everyone

1761
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
big memberless are good but

1762
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
shut up you need to get closer to your microphone

1763
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
you're not like quite overpoweringly

1764
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
loud am I am I

1765
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
am I cursing the microphone now

1766
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
can you hear what I'm saying right now

1767
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
stop stop stop

1768
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
we have made no accord with the beast of the

1769
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
field and so it's easy to just forget

1770
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
that they could just murder us at any time

1771
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
they do not respect us like because we are on

1772
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
dogs so much dogs have been bred to be like

1773
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
weak cowards but like uh you know

1774
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
not the fucking a pigeon

1775
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
pigeon could just fucking claw your eyes out one

1776
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
actually it doesn't give a shit

1777
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Nate it's interesting you mentioned dogs because I was

1778
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
reading about dogs and apparently there's like the

1779
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
reason we were able to domesticate dogs is

1780
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
like uh like mental condition

1781
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
or like genetic disposition

1782
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
neoteny that makes you like be friends

1783
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
with everybody and like people can get that too

1784
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
but like that's the thing we bred

1785
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
in dogs that's why dogs are so friendlies

1786
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
because we gave them all like mental condition

1787
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
what I heard was that we continually

1788
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
bred like so neoteny

1789
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
is the trait that is like when you display

1790
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
like baby like traits and so like

1791
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
dogs propensity for like cuddling

1792
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
and just like being friends with everybody

1793
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
very much comes from when they're babies

1794
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and they just like don't know any better and so

1795
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
like with with dog breeding we just continually

1796
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
bred like the friendliest of the friendliest

1797
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
dogs to like just make them the most

1798
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
you know you know domesticated and so they just

1799
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
did that forever and now just like all the dogs

1800
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
all the you know domestic dogs just like

1801
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
great it is like

1802
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
dogs I don't like the only

1803
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
dog I've had excellent prolonged experience

1804
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
with was one of my

1805
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
ex-girlfriend's dogs that just shit on the floor

1806
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
constantly and I wanted to kill it

1807
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
well that's the word that's not

1808
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
it's your owners

1809
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
before we go

1810
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
out of dog hole I just want to say

1811
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I'm going down the dog hole

1812
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
if you plan for pigeons

1813
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
is hepto-bismol I think

1814
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
doesn't that make their stomachs explode

1815
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I had pigeons

1816
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
please do not talk about this

1817
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
how do you get the pepto-bismol in their stomachs though

1818
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I've heard that when people throw rice at weddings

1819
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
that birds eat the rice

1820
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
when their stomach can kill them

1821
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I'm thinking of seagulls that if you give them pepto-bismol

1822
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
they'll like explode

1823
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I still don't know how you get it

1824
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
rats are like that like if rats drink soda it can kill them

1825
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
because they can't burp

1826
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
no animal cruelty please no

1827
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
no one's actually doing this

1828
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
these are just contingencies for if a pigeon comes

1829
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
at my fucking eyes like Nate was saying

1830
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I have ways to be a pigeon

1831
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
if a pigeon ever puts me in a self-defense

1832
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
situation you know

1833
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I will defend myself

1834
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I will legally defend myself

1835
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I'm not saying that

1836
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
like animals are pacified

1837
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
that's what I like about animals is that they're not pacified

1838
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
and they're fucking dangerous and violent

1839
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
but we as humans have the tools

1840
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
and knowledge to like

1841
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
if a pigeon just like I was just walking down the street

1842
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
a pigeon could like get a claw in

1843
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
but I have a big fist

1844
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
and also I could have a gun if I wanted to

1845
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I could carry like a spear or something

1846
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
the problem is that we let our defenses down

1847
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
and they could theoretically clawed an eye

1848
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
our stupid good boys they would not hurt you

1849
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
okay maybe like a hawk

1850
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I'm sure they wouldn't

1851
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I'm just saying animals are dangerous

1852
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
and again they are beasts

1853
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
that's what I like about animals is that they are beasts

1854
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
they're modern monsters

1855
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
contingency plan number two

1856
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
you gotta hawk

1857
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
get a glock

1858
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
you know what I'm saying

1859
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
okay guys

1860
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
listen like animals aren't

1861
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
unpredictable forces of nature or anything

1862
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
they usually give signs of their aggressive

1863
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
or they're gonna attack or something

1864
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
just like a boss

1865
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
in Dark Souls

1866
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
so you're not gonna

1867
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
get surprised by an animal

1868
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
you just have to watch for signs

1869
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
my biggest criticisms of animals

1870
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
is that they have too long of wind ups

1871
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
before their attacks

1872
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
it makes fighting them boring and uninteresting

1873
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
it's not good

1874
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
they need to work on that

1875
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I'm not saying the animals will attack me

1876
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I'm just saying that we have the power to do that

1877
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
and that makes me feel

1878
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
more confident

1879
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
touching animals

1880
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I know that I could kill them if I wanted to

1881
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I don't want to

1882
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
real question

1883
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
real question

1884
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
if you were attacked by a vicious

1885
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
do you think you could beat it

1886
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
do you think you'd live

1887
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I think it would be really hard

1888
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I think it would be really hard

1889
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
but when humans

1890
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
if you're a cornered human

1891
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
you can kill most things

1892
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
they have that badge and paper Mario

1893
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
where if you get below 5 health

1894
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
your attack expands

1895
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
that's what all humans have intrinsically

1896
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
you can do crazy shit when you're about to die

1897
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I've often wondered if a pitbull

1898
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
bit me on the arm or something

1899
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
all I could do is try to punch it in the eye

1900
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
or maybe gouge out its eyes or something

1901
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I wonder how effective that would be

1902
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I feel like if the dog was even a bit smaller

1903
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
than you that you could probably beat it

1904
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
unless it got the drop on you

1905
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
and tore your throat out or something

1906
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
it still supports behind me

1907
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I feel like they're all under

1908
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
underestimating the dog

1909
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I feel like there's a chance

1910
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
it's gonna just fucking take your arm off

1911
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
if it bites your arm

1912
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
but I also feel like if you punch it in the face

1913
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
enough times you could knock it out

1914
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
that's the question

1915
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
you'll probably lose that arm though

1916
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I definitely think the bigger

1917
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
dog gets obviously the less your chances are

1918
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
but like a pitbull, it's dangerous

1919
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I think we'll both be at low HP

1920
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
by the end of it

1921
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
but I think any human could overrun

1922
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
unless like a baby

1923
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
there was a pitbull that started attacking kids

1924
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
in my old neighborhood

1925
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
cause they're kids

1926
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
wait, the story's not over yet

1927
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
and it became

1928
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
like this legend among the cops

1929
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
the cops had to come out and fucking

1930
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
put it down

1931
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
and they shot at the dog

1932
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
and the bullets bounced off its skull

1933
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
what the fuck

1934
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
yeah dude

1935
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
should they take it down or what

1936
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
they eventually got, but you shoot at other places

1937
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
it's not as like

1938
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
they had to call in fucking cloud strife to do omnislash

1939
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
dude, what the fuck

1940
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
unbelievable

1941
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
yeah, it was fucking insane dude

1942
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
dude, someone edit please

1943
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
like this dog as Sephiroth

1944
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
in the confrontation between cloud and Sephiroth

1945
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
at the end of this

1946
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
also while you're at that edit

1947
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
just like find a gallery of guys

1948
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
that have been mauled by bears

1949
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
and just edit all their photos to have the phrase

1950
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
shoulda rolled on them

1951
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
shoulda rolled man

1952
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
shoulda rolled

1953
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I agree with you Tom

1954
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
but I think that's like all skulls

1955
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
like humans can like survive headshots to the face

1956
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
like under weird precarious conditions

1957
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
they don't bounce off though

1958
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
bullets are specifically designed

1959
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
to blow up your skull

1960
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
that's like why they were made

1961
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
no, I'm just saying like under extremely low

1962
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
like there have been people who are survived headshots

1963
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
because of the specific weird way that it happened

1964
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
people will like

1965
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
what happened to the people could happen to a human

1966
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
if people kill themselves they generally shoot

1967
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
inside the mouth up so that they

1968
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
really fuck themselves up

1969
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
what is the temple?

1970
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
yeah, that's right

1971
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I've thought a lot about this

1972
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
whether it's best to go with the inside the mouth

1973
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
or the temple approach

1974
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
what's gonna be grosser though

1975
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
cause I wanna be as least gross as possible

1976
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I've actually considered the whole shooting yourself in the heart though

1977
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
then don't use the gun

1978
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I don't want to shoot myself in the heart

1979
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
cause I'll probably feel it

1980
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I don't want to feel it

1981
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
you brain yourself

1982
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I'm pretty sure you'd

1983
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
man, I think about what it would feel like to get shot in the head all the time

1984
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
oh me too, I was doing that yesterday a bunch

1985
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
cause I was hurting from being sick

1986
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
all the time

1987
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I'm pretty sure there would be a moment there

1988
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
where you would feel it happening

1989
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
and it'd be like oh my god dude

1990
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I was really thinking about this

1991
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
time is like slowed down

1992
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and you feel each individual piece

1993
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
of the shotgun blast

1994
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
invading your brain from inside your mouth

1995
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
and you feel like up to your skull

1996
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I think about what does it feel like

1997
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
to have one's brain violently

1998
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
destroyed all the time

1999
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
what the fuck is happening

2000
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
this is what nature leads to

2001
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
too much nature leads to this kind of suicide

2002
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
overexposed your suicide

2003
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
if you hang out around trees enough

2004
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
you're going to start thinking about

2005
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
which one will hold the best

2006
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
rope the best

2007
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
that's why people kill themselves

2008
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
in alki gahara

2009
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
and in greenland

2010
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
they're always stuck at the trees

2011
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
everyone in greenland

2012
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
spends too much time in nature and not enough of civilization

2013
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
so they have the highest suicide rate in the fucking world

2014
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
last time I checked

2015
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
we need urban sprawl

2016
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
we need hip hop

2017
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
that's the most civilization you can get

2018
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
on the civilization scale hip hop is

2019
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
what a hundred percent

2020
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
hip hop is actually a peak civilization

2021
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
clearly

2022
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
that's true

2023
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I was hoping that you would be like

2024
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
explain why he doesn't like animals

2025
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
but I guess

2026
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
oh do you want that?

2027
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
unless you asked while I was on the tour

2028
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I went to pee for a while

2029
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
no he did

2030
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
anyway

2031
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I don't like animals because

2032
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
they're annoying

2033
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
they can't talk

2034
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
they're fucking boring

2035
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
they can't be negotiated with

2036
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
everything I value about humans

2037
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
is the ability to have conversations with them

2038
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
that is the main thing

2039
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
that other humans can give me

2040
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
other than physical contact

2041
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
and I don't think I would want physical contact with a person

2042
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
that I could not

2043
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
communicate with

2044
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
it doesn't have to necessarily be verbally

2045
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
text form but if I can't communicate

2046
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
with somebody I'm not going to want to

2047
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
hang out with them and

2048
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
touch them or anything

2049
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
animals just want

2050
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
things and they have no sense

2051
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
of moral obligation

2052
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
towards you

2053
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
my cat

2054
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
when I lived back at home we had a cat

2055
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
then you lived in the same house as this cat

2056
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
she fucking

2057
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
at any time of night if she wants

2058
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
something she will come make you do it

2059
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
she will pick you up

2060
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
she will meow at your door all night

2061
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
until you wake up and come do something for her

2062
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
because she doesn't care about you

2063
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
she can't comprehend your needs

2064
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
she can't make compromises

2065
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
because she cannot fathom

2066
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
yeah

2067
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
what about that

2068
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
why should you sign up

2069
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
why should you sign up for a relationship

2070
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
that is completely one sided

2071
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
that you are expected to provide for this other animal

2072
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
and this other animal is not expected to do anything

2073
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I get that you might like what they do

2074
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
it just irks me that

2075
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
what they're doing is just what they want to do

2076
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
and if that happens to please you

2077
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
then so it goes

2078
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
but they're not doing anything for your sake

2079
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
you're providing for all of their needs

2080
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
that legendary dog

2081
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
who came to visit his master in Japan

2082
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
every fucking day even after he died

2083
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Hachiko

2084
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
the most legendary dog who ever lived

2085
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I visited his statue

2086
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
he's a fucking god

2087
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
but he just wanted his master

2088
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
that's like saying obeying

2089
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
well okay

2090
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
you seem to be putting like thought

2091
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
and like responsibility over

2092
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
just like natural inclination

2093
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
like that makes it more moral

2094
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
like you are more valuable

2095
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I'm saying that I can see why that's like good

2096
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
like if a dog is naturally inclined to love you

2097
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
and you want love

2098
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I get why that's appealing

2099
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
it just bugs me that there's no

2100
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
it just bugs me that the relationship is so one sided

2101
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
but I would argue that every human

2102
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
only does what it wants to do

2103
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
yeah

2104
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
but we can guilt humans

2105
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
that's true

2106
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I think you guys are thinking about this all wrong

2107
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
animals are not humans

2108
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
they're not mint

2109
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
their function is not to have ideas

2110
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
their function is to be

2111
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
aesthetic and provide

2112
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
sometimes practical benefit to humans

2113
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
like oxes or

2114
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
dogs or some stuff

2115
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
aesthetic and provide

2116
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
like practical application

2117
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
with a dog you can train to fucking kill things

2118
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
you know if we're back in

2119
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
early times you can train to kill things

2120
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
that's a practical benefit of it

2121
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
but the main thing for me is aesthetic

2122
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I just like seeing again beasts

2123
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I like seeing dangerous monsters

2124
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
roam about and do their living

2125
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
it's terrifying

2126
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
and it fills me with like a

2127
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
gladiator lust for either

2128
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
killing it or making it kill things for me

2129
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
that's what I want from my animals

2130
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I agree that

2131
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
animals are not like

2132
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
they're not conversationalist

2133
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
but that's not what I meant to do

2134
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I don't classify them as humans

2135
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I understand the appeal of animals

2136
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I get why other people like animals

2137
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
it's just that nothing they have to offer

2138
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
really does anything for me

2139
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
because all I like to do is

2140
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
smoke weed and have long conversations

2141
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
and make videos and fuck

2142
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
and animals can't do any of those things

2143
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
well the last one

2144
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
you can't

2145
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
not legally

2146
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
in most states

2147
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I should say

2148
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
they just can't consent is all

2149
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
did we want to talk more about nature

2150
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
do we want to move into questions

2151
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
because I got some questions pulled aside

2152
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I'm feeling pretty good

2153
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
anyone want to make any closing statements here

2154
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
anyone got any final words

2155
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
hash out your reason for parkification

2156
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
sorry to say that again

2157
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
never mind it's fine

2158
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
no one say anything ever again

2159
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
mozilla fennekin asks

2160
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
now hang on did you

2161
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
is this coming from the legendary patron lounge

2162
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
oh my god

2163
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
if you patron anything to the pcp

2164
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
one dollar

2165
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
one dollar you get patron lounge

2166
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
and that's where we get all our fucking questions from

2167
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
because

2168
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
it's easy and cool

2169
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
mozilla fennekin

2170
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
asked what's the most you're willing to spend

2171
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
on a single meal

2172
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
20 dollars

2173
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
20 dollars

2174
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
unless it's like an occasion

2175
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
if it's like a festivity or a holiday

2176
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
then it'll probably be like 50 or 60

2177
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
if I want to flip

2178
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
is that for just you

2179
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
or are you paying for somebody else

2180
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
that's what I was going to ask

2181
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
you're right

2182
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
usually what I am flipping it is

2183
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
what's the most you're willing to spend

2184
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
on a meal

2185
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
for yourself and for a group

2186
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
if I was like treating a party

2187
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
and it was like a special occasion

2188
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I would probably spring

2189
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
for like up to maybe like 100 to

2190
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
150 dollars

2191
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
if it was like a real big

2192
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
an event

2193
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
if it was just for me

2194
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I would only pay more than like

2195
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
15 dollars and that's high

2196
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I would like to pay 5 dollars

2197
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
for a meal for myself at any given time

2198
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
but if I was out and being

2199
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
socially pressured and everyone else was doing it

2200
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I might be convinced to spend maybe up to like

2201
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
20

2202
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
the absolute most I could spend for myself

2203
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
is 20 dollars

2204
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I would go 20 dollars

2205
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
the absolute max I want to stay around 5

2206
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
ideally

2207
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
only social pressure can compel me

2208
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
if I was going to like

2209
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
spend money like for me

2210
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
and like a significant other or something

2211
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I have spent like 150 dollars

2212
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
before but I was not aware that it was

2213
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
going to happen and I was very disgusted by it

2214
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
and I made a point to say this is never happening

2215
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
again

2216
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I think

2217
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
again if it's an occasion

2218
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
if it's like Christmas

2219
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
but I'm the only person left alive

2220
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
because they all were too weak to

2221
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
see me through

2222
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
then I could probably go like

2223
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
50 dollars

2224
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
if I really wanted to make a big deal

2225
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
All right, Mage, what's your answer for this?

2226
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It's basically the same

2227
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
It's the same as you guys

2228
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Did you, you're the only one

2229
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
besides maybe Nate who makes a significant amount of money

2230
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
so you're about to be like I'm going to go like

2231
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
four figures deep on this shit

2232
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It's not just about how much I make

2233
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
but that I regularly spend money

2234
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
on food like that's where a lot of

2235
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
you know the money I do spend goes

2236
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
but I want to know because I know

2237
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Nate's thrown down pretty fucking hard

2238
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
on some meals because he and I

2239
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
went to a restaurant where I spent

2240
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
like 75 dollars and you spent

2241
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
something close to that

2242
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
You know what I found

2243
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I definitely, there have been times

2244
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
more recently when I'll go to

2245
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
a really nice restaurant that I've like never done in my life

2246
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
for like a year ago

2247
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
and those are pretty expensive sometimes

2248
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
that's pretty rare but what I've really found

2249
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
is just that my like sort of

2250
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
base level amount I'm willing to pay for

2251
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
a meal has just gone way up

2252
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
and like I just don't really care anymore

2253
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
For me it's kind of just like

2254
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
what do I want to eat

2255
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
you know like if I

2256
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
if I want to have a fancy dinner

2257
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
with my girlfriend

2258
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
or my fiance you know we're just going to

2259
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
go out and

2260
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
like it's going to be whatever it cost

2261
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
like for Valentine's Day we went out to

2262
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
a place next to my house

2263
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
$150 total it was great

2264
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I fucking went to Burger King for Valentine's

2265
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
and I'm happy

2266
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Oh you make me laugh

2267
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I tell you like when you

2268
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
when you actually do

2269
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I mean like I'm

2270
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
very much a stickler

2271
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I always have been like I used to be real cheap

2272
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
about going out to eat and that's why I like

2273
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
exclusively ate fast food for a real long time

2274
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
and then

2275
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
basically it's just

2276
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
if you can afford it and you're willing

2277
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
to spend the money it's like

2278
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
food does kind of follow

2279
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
like a rule of the more you pay

2280
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
the better it tastes

2281
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
it's fairly straightforward most of the time

2282
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
like that meal I had

2283
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
that was $150 like

2284
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
granted in terms of portions

2285
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
and everything no it was not at all worth it

2286
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
like if you're talking about how much

2287
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
is it worth to get full tonight

2288
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
not worth it but the food was like

2289
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I literally had never tasted something

2290
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
that tasted the way it tasted you know

2291
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
and like for me it's just that sheer

2292
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
uniqueness of experience makes it worth

2293
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
having paid for at least once

2294
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
you know obviously I'm not going to go spend

2295
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
$150 on food every night but

2296
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
you know it's nice to get to experience

2297
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
like this flavor

2298
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
palette that can't really be explored

2299
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
by anyone less than a talented chef

2300
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
you know sure well yeah

2301
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
when I went to Jack Ruby's

2302
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
steakhouse or whatever the precinct is like

2303
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
the best restaurant in Cincinnati

2304
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
like I never imagined a steak could taste

2305
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
as good as what they made there and they

2306
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
fucking did it they did I didn't even know that was a real

2307
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
thing but anyway sorry time I'm

2308
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I'm just I don't know paying for

2309
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
food is something that I try not to

2310
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
do ever and just

2311
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I mean I like food but like the

2312
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
experience of eating food is ephemeral

2313
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
you know it's fleeting and

2314
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
like once you've done it it's over and so like

2315
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
the fact that I invested money in it and now

2316
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
the money is gone and the experience

2317
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
was never going to last anyway there's a lot

2318
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
of studies that state that say that people

2319
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
ultimately find themselves more happy

2320
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
with purchases they made

2321
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
for experiences rather than possessions

2322
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
because when you have a possession around

2323
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
you'll constantly look at it and

2324
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
judge it again like I hate

2325
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
most of the crap I own in my room

2326
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
like all the shit in my back

2327
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
drops for all my videos and shit because a lot

2328
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
of this is just DVDs that I'll look at and I'll be

2329
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
like I spent like a hundred dollars on that box

2330
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
set and A I've never watched

2331
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
it and B like you know I don't even

2332
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
really like the show that much anymore because

2333
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
like you know it just sits around reminding

2334
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
me of how much money I spent on it and how

2335
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
if I had that money back I could be doing

2336
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
something different right now but if you just

2337
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
go say to again a fancy

2338
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
restaurant you have a great time all you'll

2339
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
remember about that for the rest of your life

2340
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
is I went to a fancy restaurant I had a great

2341
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
time you know like I'll never forget

2342
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
me and Nate go into that restaurant because I'd never

2343
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
been to any place like that before and like

2344
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
we were fucking getting weighted on by

2345
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
like like wind and dine the guy

2346
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
coming up pouring our fucking water for us

2347
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
and shit and we're like yeah you know

2348
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
it was sick

2349
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
how dope was that scared Italian

2350
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
at anime expo did you need

2351
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
how dope was that scared Italian who would

2352
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
like give us orange oh that guy

2353
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
it was amazing it was the best

2354
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
he was incredible he was my favorite person

2355
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I like nice food I just

2356
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I just wish I could afford it more often

2357
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
well most of what just quickly though

2358
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
the burger king has like really awesome

2359
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
milkshakes the one that's

2360
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
sure so it was not a bad deal

2361
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I quite like it and we got like

2362
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
because we had to wait a little bit we got

2363
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
like big milkshakes so

2364
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
nice most of what I actually eat

2365
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
is cans of dark red

2366
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
kidney beans like boxes of salad

2367
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
protein powder and then

2368
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
like chicken breast and broccoli salad

2369
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
yeah they've got these like plastic

2370
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
containers of salad at the Kroger

2371
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I'll just go buy that it's got a big fucking

2372
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
thing of spinach I'll just like munch on that for two days

2373
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
it's great enough about your diet

2374
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
wait what munch

2375
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
is it important what yes

2376
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
yes it is important

2377
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I want to talk

2378
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
about food more because I love food

2379
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I've been Ben you

2380
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
said that the experience of eating food is fleeting

2381
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
and I agree and this is why I hate sex

2382
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
but food is different than sex

2383
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
because food you can

2384
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
have it like you can like

2385
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
go out to a restaurant you can have it with other people

2386
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and we'll be that's we can have do the sex

2387
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
nevermind I'm saying that restaurants are good

2388
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
and I like going to restaurants I like people to talk to

2389
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
eating food and talking

2390
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
to people and the experience of being out of your house

2391
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
out in the world

2392
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
eating at a restaurant perhaps the restaurants you've

2393
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
never been to before at a new restaurant with your friends

2394
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
talking about the day you've had

2395
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
experiences you're going to have

2396
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
that is far better than ever sex you could

2397
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
ever have

2398
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
take that you pop into that 7-Eleven

2399
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
and grab your food and then you take it

2400
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
out into nature

2401
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
and eat it in the fridge

2402
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
that's how you fucking have it

2403
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
that's a good idea I think you're going to say take your 7-Eleven

2404
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
go to a fancy restaurant

2405
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
guys picnics are such a cute idea

2406
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I would lie

2407
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
you know there's like a big yard

2408
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
right on there we should have a picnic

2409
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
that's a good idea

2410
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
can we have a picnic at radcon 4

2411
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
whenever I come over

2412
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
probably maybe you can't promise

2413
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
off topic can we do radcon 4

2414
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
in england

2415
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
main shows up to radcon 4 and she's like

2416
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
so can we do another picnic like you guys did at the last one

2417
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I'm like no

2418
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
that idea is past

2419
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
yeah the moment's past it's over

2420
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
we're all about

2421
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
we're all about

2422
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
eating soilent now

2423
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
by the way

2424
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
radcon 3 arena

2425
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
is confirmed everybody

2426
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
the kickstarter is now over

2427
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
and not only is it confirmed

2428
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
but the first kickstarter tier is already

2429
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
fulfilled it's unlikely at this point

2430
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
we'll have gotten the second but maybe it will

2431
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
who knows man

2432
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
wait there's two

2433
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
it ends in like 4 days from today

2434
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
on the 21st I think

2435
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I thought there was still a lot of time left

2436
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
well whatever anyway

2437
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I mean my kickstarter

2438
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
spiked like crazy in the last couple days

2439
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
next question is from drybones

2440
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
drybones this is one of my favorite questions

2441
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
we've ever gotten on the show by the way

2442
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
would you consider yourself

2443
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
above your dad

2444
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
could you defeat him physically

2445
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
or intellectually

2446
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
not physically intellectually yes

2447
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
my dad's very strong

2448
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
very very

2449
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
very hard no

2450
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I know my dad and I does not make it okay

2451
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
that doesn't make his crimes

2452
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
any less potent

2453
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
my dad

2454
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
it is an old geezer

2455
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
but he's so fucking

2456
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
strong here's what he does

2457
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
he hikes with rocks in his backpack

2458
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and every month he adds a new

2459
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
rock to his backpack

2460
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
he's been doing this for years

2461
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
is he a fucking martial arts training

2462
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
or something like that

2463
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
he has like 30 rocks

2464
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
in his fucking bag

2465
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
do you talk to show training shit or something

2466
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
it's fucking crazy he's insane

2467
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
well that's awesome

2468
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
he's powerful but he's also a fucking idiot

2469
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I can see where you got your power from now

2470
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
yeah thank you

2471
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I feel like this question has a bit more nuance

2472
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
in my situation because

2473
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I'm his daughter

2474
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
what father want to punch his daughter

2475
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
you know

2476
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
as opposed to the father just want to punch

2477
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
your son

2478
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
hit him physically because he won't hit you

2479
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
is that what you're trying to say

2480
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
the thing is I don't want to hit him either

2481
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
so I don't know

2482
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
but you have to mate he's coming at you with a gun

2483
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
what are you gonna do

2484
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
it doesn't say anything about having to fight them

2485
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
it just says can you defeat him physically or intellectually

2486
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
okay physically

2487
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
most likely no

2488
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
no I wouldn't even though I'm taller than him

2489
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
no I'm not I'm a squish boy

2490
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
intellectually

2491
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
probably

2492
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
he's quite close minded

2493
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
he's very averse to new ideas and stuff

2494
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
so probably I could

2495
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
against new age you know beliefs

2496
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
don't let yourself be just one box

2497
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I feel like everyone's gonna do that about their parents

2498
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
because that's essentially what I was gonna say about my dad

2499
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
it's been probably as well

2500
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
my dad is a very smart man

2501
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
where are we so weak

2502
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
you could definitely beat your dad physically right

2503
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
at this point yes not for a long time though

2504
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
not for a long time

2505
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
everyone's kind of scared of their dads I think including me

2506
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
to some degree

2507
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
our dad is fires storms

2508
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
our dad is a fucking

2509
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
intellectual fortress if nothing else

2510
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
that's for sure

2511
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
well let me tell you why you've all played yourself

2512
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
on this because the question says

2513
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
could you defeat him physically

2514
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
now if I have to fight my dad

2515
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
one on one hand to hand

2516
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
no I can't beat him that nigger roads marathons

2517
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
and bench presses more than

2518
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
my body weight and I can't

2519
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
bench press more than my body well maybe

2520
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I don't know how much it's like an impressive amount

2521
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
to be able to bench press

2522
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
but anyways he's a strong man

2523
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
however could I defeat him

2524
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
physically I'm good at setting up traps

2525
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
you know

2526
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
you're gonna home alone is that

2527
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I'm good at using weapons

2528
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I'm good at fucking tricks

2529
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
version of the quest

2530
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
me and my brother Victor used to fight

2531
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
in the backyard all the time

2532
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
well you ran your marathons I practice with the block chain

2533
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
well you lived your way

2534
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
yeah exactly

2535
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
when you worked on feeble aesthetics

2536
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
well you paid as a house eye vlog

2537
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
exactly so

2538
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
me and Victor used to fight in the backyard all the time

2539
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
and Victor would be stronger than me

2540
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
but I would just like grab shit on the ground

2541
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
and throw it at him and then jump on him

2542
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
you know so I can do that to

2543
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
my dad because he fights

2544
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
so you fight dirty

2545
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
yeah exactly and Victor

2546
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
my dad probably won't fight nearly as dirty

2547
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
as I will or at least not as

2548
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
he won't think of the environment

2549
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
as much as I will I got the Jackie Chan thing going on

2550
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
you know like I'll throw

2551
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
the TV at him or something

2552
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
so

2553
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I do think I could defeat him physically

2554
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
if we if I had to

2555
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
like if it was not just oh we're like having

2556
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
a blood feud like we're

2557
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
passionately fighting to father and son

2558
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
you know if we're like if my dad's a zombie

2559
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
and I got to kill him like I can kill him

2560
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
you know if you have

2561
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
prep time you can kill your dad with prep time

2562
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
let's say he's like under

2563
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
let's say he's gone evil he's gone rogue

2564
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
and he's murdering everybody

2565
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
let's say he's become king deity

2566
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I will say that in order for me to

2567
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
find the inner strength to kill my dad

2568
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
he might have to strangle shade first

2569
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
like I might need that motive

2570
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
you know but if

2571
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
you know if someone's been strangled

2572
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
then I can probably get him

2573
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
intellectually my dad

2574
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
my dad's a smart guy but he would probably

2575
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
forfeit to be intellectually TVH

2576
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
because he thinks I'm a fucking genius

2577
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
so fair enough

2578
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
my dad would destroy me both physically

2579
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
and intellectually

2580
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
and emotionally

2581
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I've already done that to myself let's be real

2582
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
no he's like

2583
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Tommy sound like you were on the verge of tears

2584
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
when saying that

2585
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
you sound like you were about to cry

2586
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
that was not intentional but maybe that says something

2587
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
deep about myself that I'm not aware of

2588
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
it's very possible

2589
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
but no he's like he's like

2590
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
yes absolutely

2591
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
no my dad's like super built

2592
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
he's like the chief financial officer

2593
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
for Hanscom Air Force Base he manages

2594
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
multi-million dollar budgets on the daily

2595
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
so yeah

2596
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
smart guy

2597
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
strong guy

2598
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
does he even vlog?

2599
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
if only

2600
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
he had a debuff like that

2601
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
I might stand a chance but no

2602
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
he hasn't been distracted

2603
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
by the

2604
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
feudal pursuits like we all have

2605
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
so indeed

2606
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
alright here's our next question

2607
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
from horse power

2608
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I'll next one

2609
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
it says

2610
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
how do you know if you're chasing a dream

2611
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
or a dilution

2612
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
oh that's got to be somebody made a video called

2613
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
that recently who was that

2614
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
it was Fantano

2615
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
he probably said delusion

2616
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
not dilution

2617
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
that's true

2618
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I would expect so

2619
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I don't know if there is a way to

2620
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I mean

2621
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
how do you qualify

2622
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
when do you say it's a delusion

2623
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
like if you're making money off of it does that mean it's not a delusion

2624
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
but like what if it falls away

2625
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
one day is it a delusion

2626
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I think a delusion is inherently only decided

2627
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
after the fact I don't know if you can

2628
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
you have to try

2629
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
before you'll know

2630
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
as soon as you know it's a delusion

2631
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
that's what constitutes a delusion

2632
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
let's talk about the exact example that he brought up

2633
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
it's this guy, he didn't say his name but everyone was quite

2634
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
it was quite clear who he was talking about

2635
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
this guy Uncle Adams

2636
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
he's made a bunch of cringy music videos and songs in the past

2637
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
and he is now

2638
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
like he's

2639
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
he talked about how he's already sold his house

2640
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
he sold his car, he's making these vlogs or whatever

2641
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
he is like $200,000

2642
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
and dead at this point

2643
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
and he's decided he is not stopping until he has

2644
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
a big music career

2645
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
like here's what I don't understand

2646
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
about that, it's like somebody like me

2647
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
was able to just do youtube

2648
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
while having a job and not completely

2649
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
burying myself in debt

2650
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I think that is the smart path to take

2651
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
to put all your eggs in one basket

2652
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
like that seems like a mistake in my opinion

2653
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
and like to be fair

2654
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I think you just need to know if it's a sure thing

2655
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I mean I can see putting all your eggs

2656
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
in one basket if you're like

2657
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
it depends on the circumstance

2658
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I mean if you think you've got the

2659
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
masterpiece of the century

2660
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
in your mind and like if you just

2661
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
drop out of school for a year and work on it

2662
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
you're gonna fucking blow the world away with your novel

2663
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
but you really gotta think about like

2664
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
how much time is it gonna take

2665
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
you know are you actually

2666
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
capable of delivering on it

2667
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
get some opinions see how people react to it

2668
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
who would you know find someone

2669
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
who would enjoy it and show it to them

2670
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
and see if they do

2671
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
enjoy it you know

2672
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
you know the story of disney

2673
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
and snow white and how he had like

2674
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
to I think what's the word mortgage

2675
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
his house or something like that

2676
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
he put a lot of his savings and like

2677
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
basically he was like risking it all

2678
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
the cuphead developers just did that

2679
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
remortgage their houses to make cuphead

2680
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
they did that was a big blood story

2681
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I mean lots of people have done it but like

2682
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
in those cases like

2683
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
we're talking about disney

2684
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
is making a movie with some of the best animation

2685
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
quality that had ever been done

2686
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
so like there's almost guaranteed

2687
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
an audience when you know for a fact

2688
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
that you were doing something of like a technical

2689
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
level of craftsmanship above

2690
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
anything else anyone's doing and if you were doing

2691
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
that you would know you were doing it

2692
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
cause you would be able to observe everyone

2693
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
else and you know everything about their

2694
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
we hear a lot of like anecdotal stories

2695
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
about like you know successful people

2696
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
who are risking it all but like we hear about

2697
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
those examples cause they're successful

2698
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
there's like dozens and hundreds and thousands

2699
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
of people who've done the same thing and got

2700
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
totally fucked when you look

2701
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
at the cuphead development like of course

2702
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
they remortgaged their house cause the first time

2703
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
they took that game to E3 it was fucking all

2704
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
anyone was talking about so they knew they had

2705
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
a hit on their hands like they would be stupid

2706
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
or not to do it if they were passionate enough

2707
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
to finish the project you know and make sure

2708
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
it was good but that's like

2709
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
so you gotta look at it different

2710
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
you gotta you know think about risk differently

2711
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
from just oh they remortgaged their house

2712
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
they took a huge risk it's like yeah

2713
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
they took a huge risk on a sure thing you know

2714
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
so it's not really a risk at all

2715
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I just like I want to pull up how many subs

2716
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
this guy just get a feel for what success

2717
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
he's gotten at the moment he has one

2718
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
video that's got like something like

2719
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
500,000 views his youtube channel

2720
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
has about 26,000 subscribers

2721
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
like the fact of the matter is

2722
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
he is not that successful yes

2723
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I think honestly what

2724
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
this guy this man had was a dangerous

2725
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
thing is that he got a little

2726
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
too much taste of success

2727
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
and kind of addled his brains I think that's

2728
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
what ruins like most youtubers

2729
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
like I think a lot of the youtubers who

2730
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
end up only being around for a couple years

2731
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
it's cause one thing

2732
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
plays into like the algorithm just right

2733
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
or maybe even a few videos for a little while

2734
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
and like you know you just

2735
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
take off and then

2736
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
as soon as you don't have that weird

2737
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
magical foothold that like whatever youtube's

2738
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
algorithm was at that moment just happened

2739
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
to like align perfectly with your shit

2740
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
then you know you might fall off

2741
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
if your fans don't actually care about you

2742
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I watched a bunch of this guy's videos

2743
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
and he talked about how like

2744
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
when he started this vlog like yeah I was about to release a video

2745
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
you know I was really hoping

2746
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
that would be the one that blew up

2747
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
and he says like maybe it'll take like a week

2748
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
maybe it'll take a month maybe it'll take a couple months

2749
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
for me to succeed but like we're talking about a man

2750
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
building up his music career like

2751
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
from the ground floor this should not be

2752
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
an idea of like within days

2753
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I'll have made it no

2754
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I could tell just by listening to his videos

2755
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
he has a way warped sense of time

2756
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
for what he thinks this is gonna be

2757
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I watched some of the music videos like not

2758
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
good and he has people cringing

2759
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
at his videos like this is the kind of guy

2760
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
we're talking about it just it scares me

2761
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
man this is a guy I think it was a victim

2762
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
of kind of the the

2763
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
weird success I would

2764
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
call a victim he's choosing this

2765
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
he's doing well all I'm saying is that I think

2766
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
he's he's under he's experiencing some

2767
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
confirmation bias in what

2768
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
he's doing and he sees all the success people

2769
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
and he thinks if I just and you know what

2770
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
if this guy makes it everyone

2771
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
will say like oh well look at all the haters man

2772
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
he will say like look at all the haters who doubted

2773
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
me but the thing is what matters is not

2774
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
whether he succeeds or not what matters

2775
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
was the degree of risk he was willing

2776
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
to expose himself to and for some

2777
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
people they can expose themselves to a little

2778
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
risk and have it pay off great guys like me

2779
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
are extremely conservative about this kind

2780
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
of things and do not put a lot of risk into what they do

2781
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
but like I would argue

2782
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
this guy put it way too much

2783
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I'll tell you right now I consider

2784
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
myself a huge risk taker but like

2785
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
yeah not in the way

2786
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
like I only take the big risk after

2787
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
I've already got you know

2788
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
ten thousand dollars saved up

2789
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
and I'm like

2790
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
you know sure that they have to

2791
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
make sure everything's set up you know it I'm going

2792
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
to make a big leap but I'm gonna

2793
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
make sure I fucking have gauged the

2794
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
distance that I'm jumping you know like

2795
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
we say you're not as spontaneous in that way

2796
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I well you know before I

2797
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
make the leap I lick my finger

2798
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
and I hold it up and I feel the winds

2799
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
and I determine which way they're blowing

2800
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
you know then I'll make a calculated

2801
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
risk taker exactly

2802
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I think there's a lot of people who just

2803
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
are just straight up

2804
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
don't even know what they're supposed to be looking for

2805
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
they just see a hole and they think they

2806
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
can jump over it and they don't even realize

2807
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
that they don't have legs you know like

2808
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
yeah there's people like that on

2809
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
YouTube

2810
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
all right true man Munchy you wanted to do the next

2811
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
question yes yes by

2812
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
J8 the hurricane and

2813
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
the questions bar what is the PCP's

2814
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Mass Effect 3

2815
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
something so disappointing that you retroactively

2816
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
hate all the related content that comes before

2817
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
it something that we made

2818
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
or something that we feel like that

2819
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
about I think he I think

2820
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
what he meant was like what do we

2821
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
feel is the case right maybe

2822
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
John Tron historically was kind of like

2823
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I wanted to take this the way that like

2824
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
what have we created that we

2825
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
hate like that like like retroactively

2826
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
we now hate it and be like

2827
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I'm so embarrassed

2828
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
there's nothing

2829
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I've made that makes me

2830
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
hate retroactively all the

2831
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
things I've made before it I don't think

2832
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
that's what he's asking I think he means like

2833
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
but is there a piece of content that you are

2834
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
like oh I shouldn't have made that

2835
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
my fucking pony vids

2836
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
you're what

2837
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
but mage they were your foothold to

2838
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
stepping stone you know whatever

2839
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
pony vans do you say

2840
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
pony things

2841
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
are pretty successful some of them

2842
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
yeah I don't regret T-Bab at all

2843
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
yeah but now I'm

2844
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
stuck in the pony fandom

2845
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
shadow and like three or four years later

2846
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
people still like poke me

2847
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
about the pony things and I'm just like I'm done

2848
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
with this

2849
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
you definitely did not make as hard of a cut

2850
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
as the fellow guys here did

2851
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I did I made an announcement

2852
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I told people

2853
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I fucking I'm not drunk

2854
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
in what ways is this just that people ask

2855
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
you about pony because that doesn't seem like a major

2856
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
issue if they just kind of ask you about

2857
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
it people still make a keg and phantom

2858
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
fan art and I love it

2859
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
and the rest of the crew was great

2860
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
chat up to acro

2861
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
kill it as always

2862
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
fucking of arm retrieval like a veteran

2863
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
general of arm retrieval

2864
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
acro is fucking incredible

2865
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I get sometimes people just actively denying

2866
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
that I left the fandom and I'm just like

2867
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
wake up

2868
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
grab a brush and put a little makeup

2869
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
yeah

2870
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
exactly

2871
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
I definitely think I oh sorry

2872
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
maybe she can continue

2873
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I make it sound

2874
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
worse than it is actually

2875
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
some of the things

2876
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
in the pony thing

2877
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
the lethal halloween thing I'm kind of embarrassed

2878
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
by it because it's really really bad

2879
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
but people really like it

2880
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
so I'm kind of really embarrassed by it

2881
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
that's fair enough

2882
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
there's a lot of my videos I'm embarrassed

2883
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
by like

2884
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
because generally my

2885
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
writing style and taste

2886
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
evolve over time and sometimes I rewatch

2887
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
some old shit and I'm just like

2888
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
what the fuck am I talking about

2889
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
why did I make this

2890
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
why did I think this is okay

2891
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
but like most of it is stuff that

2892
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I think I appreciate

2893
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
why people would have liked it at the time

2894
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
there's very few videos that I've made that were like

2895
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
when they came out

2896
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
they were DOA and like the mario

2897
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
odyssey video I made is definitely

2898
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
one of them where like

2899
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I was just like

2900
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I don't know why I made that video

2901
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
because I knew that the only way I was going to

2902
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
convince anybody of my point is by doing

2903
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
like an in depth analytical breakdown

2904
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
a la mathematosis

2905
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
and I'm sure that when his video comes out

2906
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
he probably will

2907
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
criticize the visuals of that game because

2908
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I trust him to fucking have sense

2909
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
but um

2910
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I jumped the gun and just made something quick

2911
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
and I thought that if I open it by just being like

2912
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
yo this is a goofy video

2913
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
like people would be okay with it

2914
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
but they were not

2915
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
they're pretty rabid about that

2916
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
yeah so it was just

2917
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
it just didn't need to exist

2918
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
it was just a PR disaster

2919
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
basically like it was just me coming out

2920
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
with an unpopular opinion

2921
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
not defending it well and then just having people

2922
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
be like well we disagree

2923
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
and we hate you for having made this

2924
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
even brought this to the attention

2925
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
of the world in the first place

2926
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Gigi didn't that like fucking stupid

2927
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
vlog video have like rebuttal

2928
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
videos and like it did

2929
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
like it was like taking you down

2930
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
who the fuck cares

2931
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
dude I can't I can't believe

2932
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
this is why I don't make videos about video games

2933
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
like cause it's not worth it

2934
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
it's not something that I made

2935
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
but I guess probably the thing I'm most

2936
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
ashamed of would be a analysis

2937
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
anarchy

2938
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
being associated with that

2939
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I just watched that the other day

2940
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
in fact

2941
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
does it hold up

2942
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
is it as good as I remember

2943
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I showed it to all my offline friends

2944
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
to specifically show you

2945
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Ben I showed them

2946
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
to like be like you know that guy

2947
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I know that guy he's my friend

2948
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
jesus

2949
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
awful awful so that's the first thing they know of you

2950
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
okay well I guess that's what I deserve

2951
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Ben's part

2952
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
the silver quill quip

2953
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I remember being the only kind of funny part

2954
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
yeah I didn't read the script

2955
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I just looked at my like two lines

2956
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
and I thought alright well these aren't terrible

2957
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I'll read them and then I watched the whole video

2958
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
and it's like so it goes so

2959
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
downhill from there

2960
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
like once the actual plot gets underway it's like

2961
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
oh my god this is

2962
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
this is what we're doing no please

2963
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
oh shameful

2964
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
oh yes

2965
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
that reminds me that I

2966
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
have to do something similar for a guy's

2967
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
abridged series

2968
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
that someone just like

2969
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
messaged me like hey will you do a voice in

2970
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
my abridged series on black

2971
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
clover or whatever and I was like

2972
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
sure as long as he said there's only be a couple

2973
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
lines I'm like sure and then I get the lines

2974
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
and I am

2975
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
first of all I'll have way more than a couple lines

2976
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
and second of all my character

2977
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
is all quotes from my videos

2978
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
so

2979
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
what?

2980
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
he sent me the script

2981
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
and I didn't actually read it for a straight week

2982
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
and by the time I read it everyone else had done

2983
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
their lines so I'm like

2984
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
now I kind of feel like I have to do it

2985
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
because like I'm the only one

2986
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
holding this thing up but like I hadn't read it

2987
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
beforehand so I'm just like oh god

2988
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
yeah you fucked up a little bit

2989
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
but I should probably

2990
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
do that performance today

2991
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
cause that guy's been asking me for weeks

2992
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
and I have just been ignoring it

2993
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
there is an

2994
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
uncanny valley type situation

2995
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
for embarrassing content for me

2996
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
because like if I go back in my past

2997
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
and I read all the role plays or something

2998
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
they are hilarious they are great

2999
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
they do not even like

3000
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I cannot imagine it was like to be

3001
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
like tin and writing role plays

3002
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I can't imagine I am

3003
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
not that person so it's funny to

3004
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
like look back and be like oh wasn't this

3005
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
silly wasn't this a cringy you know funny time

3006
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
ha ha ha but the closer

3007
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
you get to being actually

3008
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
real life me and the more embarrassing it gets

3009
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
it gets to be like oh I remember

3010
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
writing that

3011
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
how many years

3012
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
before like munchie pissing on stream

3013
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
is like his worst memory

3014
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
of all his whole life no that won't

3015
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
that will never be the case

3016
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
pissing on games I can't

3017
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I can't wait for the new segment munchie vs munchie

3018
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
in like three years fucking ten

3019
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
ten years from now when he's like running

3020
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
for office cause he's become like

3021
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
really politically minded and stuff

3022
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
literally his career is ruined

3023
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
by the time he pissed on PCP

3024
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
cause like everyone has files of it

3025
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
oh god well ok ok

3026
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
if I do decide to run

3027
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
for office literally the entirety

3028
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
of like me saying this right now

3029
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
will be an embarrassment and will be the worst thing

3030
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
that I've done I just

3031
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
resigned myself to the fact that I will never

3032
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
be a politician because I just could not be

3033
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
there's just no way that I could be

3034
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
I've resigned myself to the fact that I probably can't hold

3035
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
any job anymore cause like any

3036
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
background check on me it's just gonna turn up

3037
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
like a bunch of fucking weird

3038
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
troll videos and shit like

3039
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
you'll need to be some sort of

3040
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
like social influencer or like

3041
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
a writer for a magazine like working at like

3042
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
a McDonald's or something would be like yeah

3043
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
they look that up and it's like well what the fuck is this about

3044
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
but then again hopefully it wouldn't

3045
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
come to that point

3046
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
yeah excellent I've been

3047
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
using the same name for like

3048
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
like so long now that like my entire

3049
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
history is documented

3050
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
so it's like it's like like no matter what

3051
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
like I will never be able to like escape

3052
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I don't know anyone I'm trying to do

3053
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I'm just saying that like the closer you get

3054
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
to like me right now

3055
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
like it's again like a valley

3056
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
so like if I were to go two

3057
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
years back I would probably be like

3058
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
oh god why did I say do these things

3059
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
but if I go like like five years back

3060
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I'll be like I don't even remember this

3061
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
there's no way I could

3062
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
have done this like this is not

3063
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I've seen a few things on my blog

3064
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
that I'm legit like there's like

3065
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
this is impossible there's no way I had

3066
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
this opinion that goes in the shell

3067
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
standalone complex it's the ugliest anime

3068
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
and stuff like that

3069
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
so alright nice

3070
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
question

3071
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
sandalwood asks what's the most at

3072
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
drill thing you've ever done

3073
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Ben I want to know

3074
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
you got an answer

3075
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
oh man

3076
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I bet I could think of some

3077
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
you know what

3078
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
give me a second I'll be right back

3079
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
you know Ben I'm gonna say

3080
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
okay

3081
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I feel like those things that the

3082
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
PCP have done together could fit

3083
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
into a drill tweet like the group

3084
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
shit that might be a pretty

3085
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
at drill thing I think

3086
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
the group shit was very real

3087
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
taking a group shit at BrodyCon with

3088
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
five internet people that I'm

3089
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
fucking living with now

3090
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I'm looking at I pulled up drills twitter

3091
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
here's a recent one from February 16

3092
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
so yesterday

3093
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
time to look at the moments tab

3094
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I lay down in the bathtub and a guy smears

3095
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
shit all over my chest with his ass

3096
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
while using a taser on me

3097
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
there you go yeah pretty yeah

3098
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
you know take it five man group shit

3099
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
at BrodyCon with my internet buddies

3100
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
that's a drill tweet

3101
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I agree

3102
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
whenever it comes

3103
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
to questions like this

3104
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
I almost feel like I haven't done anything with my life

3105
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
but even though

3106
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I have like a reputation for being like crazy

3107
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
they like I think

3108
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
about them so much that it's like that doesn't even

3109
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
feel weird to me I mean pissing on stream

3110
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
is pretty fucking at drill

3111
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
that's true and fucking

3112
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
walking up and down my like

3113
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
rich white like town

3114
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
like in full pizza and top hat

3115
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
pizza ones even top hat

3116
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I am a prince from Africa and I will buy out

3117
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
every small business and because I am the

3118
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I'm the owner of Microsoft that's

3119
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
pretty at drill that's very at drill

3120
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
because you brought up that exact example

3121
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
just listen to this question just as an insert

3122
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
to this larger question this is from the

3123
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
from the twitter

3124
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
hashtag askpcp everybody

3125
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
how is it that only six years ago

3126
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
munchy was a small baby boy

3127
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
swaddled in the garments of a slain Arab prince

3128
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
while baptized in the blood of 100 maidens

3129
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
sounds pretty relevant

3130
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
it's amazing to see

3131
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
my growth from your six years ago

3132
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
being a baby

3133
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
it's a shame he had to give up his claim to the throne of Dubai

3134
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
but nonetheless he's made the best of the situation

3135
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
it's a shame I had to stop being a Nigerian prince

3136
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
to do anime raps on the internet

3137
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
and then I had to you know crash the people

3138
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
because that was homeless that's a real shame

3139
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I have to imagine that Ben has

3140
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
gone off into the bathroom stripped naked

3141
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
and is just like fucking flailing himself

3142
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
with a trout right now

3143
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
which ironically enough is

3144
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
which ironically enough is pretty drill itself

3145
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
yeah

3146
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
yeah just the tweet would be like

3147
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
trying to make some shit happen

3148
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
for the podcast I'm on

3149
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
left the bathroom to beat myself with a trout

3150
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
nothing's happening

3151
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
you know something like that

3152
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
something like that

3153
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
um well well

3154
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I mean tweet drill is really all about

3155
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
his brand right

3156
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
like everything drill does

3157
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
he does for the drill brand

3158
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
and he's always wheeling and dealing

3159
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
I don't know I just

3160
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
like the only thing that comes to mind

3161
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
that's particularly drill-ish

3162
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
is like there's nothing in specific

3163
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
but there's just like

3164
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I don't know everywhere I've always lived

3165
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
people have remarked that like I just do things

3166
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
in a strange way

3167
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
and they don't know like I'll just

3168
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
assemble food in like a bizarre order

3169
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
that doesn't make any or I'll just like throw things

3170
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
together and people are like

3171
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Ben why do you do that and I'm always like

3172
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
and I'm always like I don't know why anyone doesn't

3173
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
do it this way like that's just

3174
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
my stock answer is like I don't understand

3175
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
why everyone doesn't do everything the way that I do

3176
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
which seems like kind of a drill

3177
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
that's that's a fairly drill sentiment

3178
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I guess all right I got one more

3179
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
question at zeno grade

3180
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
asks what quote do you want

3181
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
carved onto your tombstone

3182
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I was about to do this one I want

3183
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
the classic my

3184
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
my heartbeat clips the microphone that should be on my

3185
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
that's a good one especially from

3186
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
a fucking corpse

3187
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
yeah yeah exactly

3188
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I know I had an answer

3189
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I definitely I'm just thinking

3190
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
because I know I had some answers for this

3191
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
but I can't remember them right now I'm still banking

3192
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
on on me oh

3193
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
weaponized I think it's for the force

3194
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
yeah that's what

3195
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I'll weaponize

3196
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
and thickness with Jesus

3197
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
that's what I want

3198
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
maybe some questions from the cue

3199
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
my kerfuffle you know you gotta bring back

3200
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
your pass you don't even know me at all

3201
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
don't understand the meaning of my fall what my family

3202
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
would think if I ever failed at anything

3203
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
that's what I want to buy

3204
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I had to fight

3205
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
for my tombstone I'd be like

3206
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
brb respawning

3207
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
oh dude

3208
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
is she a gamer girl holy shit

3209
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
my tombstone just say the living

3210
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
mage your tombstone should just have

3211
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
like the hexadecimal code for

3212
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
purple on audit

3213
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
that's a good idea

3214
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
you know I want a QR code

3215
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
that leads to like an ARG

3216
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
that's inspired oh my god that would be so

3217
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
fucking dope yeah that's what I want

3218
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
yeah that's it

3219
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
just have a tombstone

3220
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
just says like comment subscribe

3221
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
that's how you

3222
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
you sign off from life

3223
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
that's a good one

3224
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
the idea of a posthumous ARG

3225
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
is the most appealing concept

3226
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
between the entire fucking world

3227
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
I hope

3228
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
that I still have this interest when I am in fact

3229
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
dead

3230
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
the idea of like

3231
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
doing an ARG and instead of like slender

3232
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
man it's a real life

3233
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
actual corpse that is dead

3234
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
looking up on there and wow he's dead

3235
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
ghost that is fucking dope

3236
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
you gotta figure this out you gotta start laying

3237
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
the breadcrumbs now you gotta start leaving

3238
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
clues in PCP episodes

3239
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
that's true

3240
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
the final link will be me

3241
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
we'll be a time stamp

3242
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
oh yes

3243
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
exactly incredible

3244
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
no one else have anything Ben

3245
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
what was the question

3246
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
what would you have on your tombstone

3247
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
oh god

3248
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
now I'm embarrassed because I just thought

3249
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
of a really great

3250
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
tombstone etching that I remember

3251
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I heard someone talking about

3252
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
but now I'm remembering that the person I heard

3253
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
talking about it was Danny from Game Grumps

3254
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
and I don't want to just repeat something that was said

3255
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
on Game Grumps so I'm gonna gracefully bow out

3256
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
you've given him credit now I'm just curious

3257
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
what it is we understand it's his

3258
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
it was like it was a poem

3259
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
as you are now

3260
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
so once was I as I

3261
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
am now so you shall be

3262
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
it was kind of like a passive aggressive

3263
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
little poem about like yeah I'm dead but

3264
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
fuck you

3265
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
very good

3266
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Game Grumps

3267
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Game Grumps guys

3268
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
the Game Grumps are here

3269
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
among us

3270
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
my tombstone I

3271
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
specifically want this if I

3272
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
live incredibly long

3273
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
but I want it to just be like hey hey every

3274
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
pony he left us I want to

3275
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000

3277
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
like he left us too soon

3278
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
or something like

3279
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
like life is brief or something like that

3280
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000

3296
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
