00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,480
the best guy ever. And we've got Tom Oliver. I'm here, the Pokemon master forever. That's

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,800
me. Indeed, we got Mage. I lied, I'm here again, still this year. Hello. Oh yeah, that's

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,120
right. How unfortunate. Gibbontake is right around the corner here. Oh, it's not Gibbontake,

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,240
it's me, Endless Jess. I'm back from popular demand. Oh, finally. Our shitty commenters

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:46,080
will be so happy. I'm so fucking cool. Speaking of shitty commenters, there's Ben Saint everywhere.

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:54,440
Communists, the communists. You know that song? It's a good song. I do, Neutral Milk. Good old

8
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:03,400
Neutral Milk. Did you see that Endless Jess met ICP? Yes, on Instagram. I saw that picture

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,720
of the uploaded. The man. I don't know the situation, like what leading up to it. I really

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,000
would like him to be online at all so we could talk about it, because it's really cool. Yeah,

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,400
I would love to hear the story behind that. I mean, he probably just went to a show where

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,440
they were and then, you know, they're not like A-list celebrities, so they probably mingle

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,480
a little bit. Apparently you had like a bunch of his raps on like a thing and he gave it

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,560
to them. Oh yeah, that's it. I hope they collab in an epic way. God, can you imagine the world

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,560
would implode? Because it's just too good. I still remember. I'm sure everyone remembers

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,480
this, but the legendary video, oh shit, what's the name? Violent J, the big fat one. Mike,

17
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:58,680
Mad Mike, I can't remember. Mike Matta, I think that's it. That guy did with his daughter Who's

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,360
a Furry, that video about what was like Snake Catchers or Snake Wranglers, because someone

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,440
had produced a shittily, a shittily produced fursuit that his daughter bought. I thought

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,320
Violent J was the big guy. I could be wrong. That might be Violent J. Is this a sweet bro

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,120
and hella Jeff situation where I thought sweet bro was the guy in red the whole time? Or

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,240
no, the grand mother? That was very confusing for a while. In any case, they made this video,

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm sure we can find it, where he and his daughter made a video together. His daughter

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,040
is a Furry and had it in fursuit the entire time and was talking shit about a fursuit

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,480
manufacturer who sent them a fursuit of dubious quality.

26
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,400
Yeah, I remember seeing that. That was, it was adorable. It is adorable. Don't fuck with

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,240
my daughter or he didn't say fuck. Don't fuck my daughter. It's just sort of like standing

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:00,880
up for his girl. This is really cute. I vaguely remember that. That was a while ago,

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,440
wasn't it? I mean, that was years ago that was made, but it keeps popping up recently.

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,040
That's an evergreen content for sure. My mind is very much at end of the decade, like what

31
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,680
are the pinnacle moments? What are the hinges upon which the decade turned? And I think the

32
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,600
release of that video was absolutely one of them. There was a big change in the world

33
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,680
when that happened. The Furry's and the Juggle is united and there was no stopping them

34
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,800
once they combined their forces. Indeed. The lowest dregs of society, finally combining

35
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,240
their power, becoming a force we can no longer ignore.

36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,440
Hey, watch it. Those aren't the lowest. We can go lower. We can go lower.

37
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,440
As the decade progressed, we learned that, but at the time, we thought we'd hit the

38
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,800
bottom of the barrel. Guys, please, you're worse than this. This

39
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,960
is above you. You can do worse, I believe it. So speaking of worse, are you guys feeling

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,040
much Christmas spirit yet? Are you feeling getting gifts and whatnot?

41
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,200
Oh, I haven't got anything for anyone. I'm so poor. Christmas just causes me stress.

42
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,760
I'm just like, am I a bad friend or am I a broke friend? I guess I'm going to find out too.

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,200
Why not both? Yeah, you know. I mean, once I know the rules.

44
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,920
You are an art friend, so you can do art for people instead.

45
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:25,040
Yeah. The tragic reality is, I mean, Ben and I had this agreement from a long time ago

46
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,720
that we wouldn't buy to the gifts just to cancel it out, which is fine, and I stand by.

47
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,520
But unfortunately, Michelle went ahead and bought things for Ben, so I mean, I don't

48
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,840
know if we count as one individual or not, but...

49
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,680
Fucking it all up. Yeah, she's really fucked it. Although I did buy something recent,

50
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,920
I think I might give it to Grace because I didn't realize it had already been gotten

51
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,440
for Ben, but I did find something very nice that I think would be very enjoyable for someone,

52
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,440
some lucky boy or girl out of the Crimson Street. I still want to buy a Christmas tree

53
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,760
for my apartment here. You still haven't bought one? Hurry Nate,

54
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,360
stand's running out. No, I don't believe it. Today might be the

55
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,440
day. We're going to go out shopping after we record those to do some...

56
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,120
Send pictures. Sure, sure, if we get that set up. Although,

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,560
the one thing I'm worried about is Sessho destroying it and ripping it to shreds.

58
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,720
Yeah, that's always good. We might need to buy a table or something

59
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,240
to put it on so we can't reach it. Just the other day, he somehow reached a loaf of bread

60
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,840
on a table that he is not tall enough to reach, so it must be he was dangling over the side

61
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,160
or something, and that loaf was no more when he got his hands on it, and I'll never forgive

62
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,600
him for that. Oh, I thought you meant Sessho was no more.

63
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,320
Oh, yes. As a result of his betrayal. Don't touch my bread.

64
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,760
Speaking of Christmas trees, I want to show you guys my friend's Christmas tree. She found

65
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,960
like some light bulbs, like ancient lights in her parents' house, I think, or something

66
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,080
like that, or aunt's house, and she plugged it in, and this is how her room looked.

67
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,680
Whoa, that's a powerful light. That is magecore.

68
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,040
Yeah, she said she's not going to use the lights because it blinded her, but I was like,

69
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
What a coward.

70
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,440
If only she could give it to me because I want those lights.

71
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
I like it. I like it.

72
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,560
You know, the glow is like 90% or like 99% of the Christmas spirit is just seeing things

73
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,000
illuminated by colored light rather than white light.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

75
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,240
Like I have some blue lights in the dining room, and it just changes the atmosphere so

76
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,160
much. It's like cool blue lights twinkling, twinkling.

77
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,760
I want twinkling twangly lights. I want glittery lights. I want glitter. I want, I want, I

78
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
like Christmas. It's so pretty.

79
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,800
I also love it. Driving down the street now and just seeing the Christmas lights on houses

80
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
and trees out front, it does a lot to bolster my spirit.

81
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,920
It's fairly epic.

82
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,200
My neighbors are decorating their balconies with twinkly lights, and they have put their

83
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Christmas trees on their balconies, and it's just so pretty.

84
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,560
And I'm like, Oh, look at that. Oh, a new one. Hey, better look, a new one.

85
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,520
You know, I think there's a thing. As a young man, I never understood this, but I think that,

86
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,520
like, OK, engaging in these kind of cultural activities does take more than zero effort.

87
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,400
But the benefit is that it just gives you a stat buff of intelligence and wisdom and

88
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
dexterity.

89
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Does it?

90
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Yes.

91
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
I think so.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Well, it's worth it.

93
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
It's a peer pressure buff.

94
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,000
Like, it's not like you can put up Christmas decorations any time of the year and get the

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,320
same feeling. You have to be one with many.

96
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,120
So I should expend a few bucks, get that tree, buy a couple of ornaments, set it up, and it'll

97
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,840
just make life nicer for me. I've got, it's 10 days till Christmas or so, so that's, and

98
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,640
now I'm sure we'll have it up for a while afterward. I was even thinking of there's

99
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,760
like a railing up to my apartment. I was thinking of buying a set of Christmas lights and just

100
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,000
winding it around the railing up there. Oh, I bet that'd be nice. Maybe I'll do that.

101
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,640
How much is a Christmas light set? Like less than $10? That's worth like less than $10 to

102
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,040
do something like that.

103
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,200
I don't know. I've always just used whatever lights we have from many, many years ago.

104
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,160
Oh, I remember the lights from my family Christmas tree. They haven't been used in a while, I

105
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,040
don't think, because mom always comes over to the UK. So I think for grandma, they set

106
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,640
up like a mini Christmas tree nowadays. I wonder, yeah, yeah, they give you all the,

107
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,400
you know, you know, it used to, in Lithuania at least, they used to have like, not like the

108
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,040
ornaments for the Christmas tree. They're now like round balls nowadays, but like, they

109
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,480
used to be like very different shapes. Like I remember there was like a squirrel and like

110
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,000
a pine cone and like, like a little Santa Claus, stuff like that. They're really, really

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,160
detailed and really pretty ones and really colorful ones. I'm really, I'm really sad.

112
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,280
They all standardized to just make round balls. I mean, it's easier now, but I kind of miss

113
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,360
those decorations.

114
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,800
Yeah, that's fair. My parents have got like a bunch of old fashioned, like, you know, like

115
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,160
pine cones and like gold snowflakes with glitter and ornaments, like a tiny wooden train on a

116
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,920
string, all that sort of stuff. Ye old chisel Santa Claus, back when he didn't have a computer.

117
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:19,640
We, I remember finally the setting up the Christmas tree in my house with my folks. And I'm

118
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,720
looking forward to going to going to spend a couple of days around Christmas at the fam's

119
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,920
place. It's going to be nice. I haven't seen those guys in a while. It's probably been, I

120
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,320
guess not a full year since I was last home, but, but it's good. It's always enjoyable. And for my

121
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,120
main Christmas present that I asked for my parents, I just asked guys, please just help me

122
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,960
pay for my ticket because I don't care about anything. I just want to not lose as much money

123
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,480
every month as I have been.

124
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,640
I need to justify seeing you all financially. So just pay for the trips. I don't have to be

125
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,880
burdened with coming to see you. Yeah. And plus me being there, sharing my sparkling

126
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:01,240
personality with them is the gift that they really want anyway. Exactly, mage. Well said.

127
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,880
Any, anything exciting happening around Christmas? Anybody doing anything exciting?

128
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,480
Absolutely not. Yeah. You know, I was, I was going to say like the whole Christmas spirit thing.

129
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,840
I've been feeling it less and less every year. There was a few years ago where I was like, oh,

130
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:29,160
no, I'm jaded and I'm not like giddy about the idea of stuff. But I think it's like,

131
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,200
I don't worry about that so much anymore. Like, yeah, it's just fine. It's just, it's just another

132
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,520
day, another month in the year, but it's just a little, you know, you do a little thing. It's

133
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,000
like, it's not a big deal, but I've gotten over the fact that it's no longer a big deal.

134
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,480
Yes. I feel more or less similarly. I, for me, I just like visiting my family since I don't see

135
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,680
them very often. And, and this year, this year, I'm super excited because I'm actually getting

136
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,240
like a really good gift for my, for my dad. And I'm really excited to see my dad happy

137
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,440
because my dad is very, very stoic and he did like rarely smiles or just, just like talks

138
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,560
so much or anything. So like, I want to share with us what it is. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So like,

139
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,840
so I got a new computer, but my old computer is still fine. And my dad's computer is ass. So I,

140
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:23,160
I, I, I delivered to my sister, my old computer. And before I delivered it, I, I, you know, I

141
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,120
completely wiped my computer and I installed a very, very, very legal steam not required

142
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,680
like a copy of doom because, because I think I told you before that me and my dad bonded over

143
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,080
doom when I was so, so I got him that. And yeah. And it's shipped over. And like his old computer

144
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,960
can't run any games. Like it's just so ass. Like, like the way he has, he has to turn on the computer

145
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,840
is to connect two wires together. That's how bad the computer is. This is like a fucking Apple

146
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,280
two or something. Jesus Christ. It's just, it's awful. So I'm really excited to get him like a

147
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,960
really good computer. Like, because my old computer, it was still good, but the thing is,

148
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:10,360
because I used it so much, it would sometimes crash for me. And it had some other problems

149
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,840
here and there, but I don't think my dad will face these issues. No, no, no, they will. I don't

150
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,280
think he will face those issues because he actually doesn't play that many games. All he

151
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,440
uses this computer to watch movies. And my computer is fine when I'm just watching stuff. And, you

152
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,240
know, see, yeah, I mean, just as Gib was saying, I think as you get older, we're all adults now

153
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,920
and we're running our own lives mostly. Now that we're older, it's, it's not about getting the

154
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,560
stuff anymore. Now it's just about the experience of spending time with folks, not worrying about

155
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,960
shit. And yeah, that's what I'm just happy. I'm finally able to give gifts this year.

156
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,000
That is nice. I'm prepared. Like my family was like, oh, you know what, we decided not to give

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,480
gifts. I'm like, yeah, okay, sure. And I'm sending gifts. It's like, surprise. I don't want anything

158
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,360
from them. I don't really need anything from them. I just, I just, I just want to give gifts and see

159
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,160
them happy again. You know, I don't know if you guys feel, I assume, I get the vibe that most of

160
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,520
you guys feel similarly, but like, I have a very set, I have a very select set of rules as to who

161
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,320
I'm required to give gifts to every season. And anyone outside that bubble, like all you guys,

162
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,680
you're getting nothing. I don't give a fuck. I don't care. My friends get nothing. My obligatory

163
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,520
family members, I'm forced to buy them things. And I'm almost, I almost appreciate being forced

164
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,360
to give them something because then it's like, you know, whatever, we all feel happy giving

165
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,480
gifts is nice, et cetera, et cetera. But I will, I'll, I'll never go like outside of the people I

166
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,000
have to give gifts to, which is weird. Cause like Michelle, for example, she just like gives gifts

167
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,200
to friends. And every time she bought, I'm like, this is so baffling to me that you would choose

168
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,560
to engage in commerce for no purpose other than to give that thing away to someone else.

169
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,920
Well, some people have these weird things called feelings and don't understand it at all,

170
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,520
make them do things that seem on the surface irrational, but aren't actually,

171
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:12,280
there's got to be a game being played here. She gets a dose of what's it dopamine?

172
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,400
It's a dopamine spike. Yeah. Yeah, it's also just, yeah, that's it.

173
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,920
Pretty much, pretty much. Well, it's degeneracy and I don't condone it.

174
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,920
If I had actual disposable income, I would get gifts for people.

175
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:34,360
Back in the day when I had a decent amount of money, I got my family and like some of my friends

176
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,080
like fucking stacked gifts. I'm just like, yeah, I got money. Let's do it. Let's get some actual

177
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:46,120
dope shit. And it felt like I was a God because I, I, I engendered, I engendered favors, you know,

178
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,920
subtly, subtly, because it's just like, I've done this great thing and you did not meet my level.

179
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,920
So now you feel obligated to return the favor at some point in the future.

180
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,080
That was not why I did it, but it is a convenient side effect.

181
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,720
Indeed, it is. And that is a good thing to do. But I mean, the best situation of all is when

182
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,840
you can get like a meaningful or really good gift that still isn't worth a lot of money.

183
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,920
Like I think this was actually for my dad's birthday years ago. I think it was my idea.

184
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,480
It might have been my mom's, but in any case, I think that me and like, I think Ben and Grace

185
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,240
and also my mom, maybe like split this with me. What we got was just like a ticket for my dad

186
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,000
to go to like a, like a racetrack and race like a Maserati or like a Ferrari or something.

187
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,120
And he would just like get to drive it around a track for a couple of laps or something.

188
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,280
It was like an event that like people were doing. And he was, he, he very much enjoyed that one.

189
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,040
So that, uh, like by breaking it down so that I think we all paid for a piece of this, it wasn't

190
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,280
that bad. Yeah. Me and my dad, uh, from her, uh, from his mother, uh, received one year tickets

191
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,520
to the play cats. And that was a cool experience. I really liked it. I really enjoyed it. I

192
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,280
haven't been to a play. Was that performed by me by any chance and my high school performance

193
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,720
of cats? Is that the one? No, no, it was, it was like in London or something. Yeah, I was in London.

194
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,120
It was really cool. It was great. I loved it. And I, and I, and I said, we should, we should go

195
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:14,040
again to a different place sometime. And we never went since. Dogs. Yes, dogs. The much maligned

196
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,240
sequel. Uh, yeah, but that, that, that also, because I saw the, the play now I'm sort of like

197
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,800
excited, sort of scared for that movie coming out, the cats movie. Have you? Well, I mean,

198
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,080
it looks terrible. It looks very weird. Yes. But I mean, maybe the songs are good.

199
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,640
The songs are good. They're always good, but they are the same songs from the musical that

200
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,320
we've all heard a thousand times. Memory. All alone in the moonlight. Yeah, I heard it. I've

201
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:46,120
heard that song. Enough movie. Enough. Never enough of that song. I don't want any more memories

202
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:54,120
of the song. Thank you very much. Back to Christmas though. I, yeah, I usually just give gifts to,

203
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,320
to my parents and like, maybe I draw something for my friends. If I have the time sadly this year,

204
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,640
I don't have much of a time, but it's not like they give me gifts back anyway. So, you know, it's

205
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,920
fine. I'm not obligated, but there's this one friend that I really desperately wish I could

206
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,480
give a gift. And the only gift I really want to give her is a switch, because I would buy her a

207
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,960
game, but her laptop absolutely sucks and she can't play many games on it. And we, the way we

208
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,800
met with this friend, it was, we kind of bonded over Pokemon and she, she can't get Pokemon,

209
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,240
you know, this gen Pokemon, even though she kind of wants to. And I doubt she'll get a switch

210
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,040
anytime soon or just like ever because of her income. You know, she's also like one of the,

211
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,880
like her only income is art. And she's a really good artist. She's so much, so much more talented

212
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:50,520
than I will ever be. But like, she doesn't earn enough to afford a switch or to justify a switch

213
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,360
until like it goes on sale, which will be never. So I just like, I really wish I could afford to

214
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,440
get her switch, even a switch like just something for her to play Pokemon on just just because

215
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,120
just I want her to be happy and play Pokemon. That's all I want.

216
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,520
Just a thought, is it possible to perhaps split the cost with other like-minded friends who might

217
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,360
want to invest? We don't really have, I guess we have one friend in common, but I don't think it's

218
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,200
possible. The other friend we have in common, she kind of has a family and a child and stuff,

219
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,960
so I don't really feel good about asking her to spend a lot of money on a thing.

220
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,000
Fair enough, fair enough.

221
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,280
Well, no Christmas for them, I guess. They don't get anything.

222
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,200
Fair off the hook.

223
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,600
I'm tempted to just like send her some money for her savings at least.

224
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,280
Well, that's not the worst thing in the world. You could even say like for the switch fund or

225
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,760
something. I don't know, things like that. I remember, I think a couple Christmases ago-

226
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,240
You should get her just the game and no switch.

227
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,760
Pressure her.

228
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,560
Pressure her, so enforce her to spend her own money.

229
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,360
Here's Pokemon. Wouldn't it be great if you could play it with me?

230
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,360
Yeah. Nudge, nudge, asshole.

231
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,760
Here's Pokemon to play and you see here like sewing like little dresses to put around the

232
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,160
cartridge of like Pokemon Sun and Moon, like little tea sets where she can set up her little cards.

233
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,440
Oh no, I sold my switch to buy you this Pokemon game.

234
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:16,840
No.

235
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,440
What do we do?

236
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,320
Well, all right, that's it. Christmas is canceling.

237
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,240
There's no winning, Christmas. There's just no way to succeed.

238
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,040
So what else is on people's minds? This has pretty much been dominating my thoughts as I'm

239
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,280
trying to crank out some videos and buy-

240
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,640
I'm trying not to think about it.

241
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,000
Gifts. Yeah.

242
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,480
I've been playing Slime Rancher. Thanks, Ben.

243
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,320
I also, wait, did we talk about this on the last episode?

244
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,120
No, no, I didn't. So on the stream, on the-

245
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,640
Oh, it was on Shackles for Hackles. Yeah, no, I've been playing Slime Rancher.

246
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,920
I've been getting my fucking drone set up. They're so good.

247
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,680
I got the advanced drones now.

248
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,040
Oh, that's great.

249
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,240
Like, I haven't gone for this yet.

250
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,360
Speaking of the stream though, for this Christmas, give the gift that really matters.

251
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,440
Pledge for your friend to be able to play the PCP Minecraft server for only $5 a month.

252
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,760
You could just give us a down payment of like $100 and we'll just keep that going for a while.

253
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,400
That would be-

254
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,600
How many months is that?

255
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,640
We're not going to do that, actually.

256
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,800
That is just months.

257
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,200
Pokemon or Pixelmon is really fun.

258
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,240
The stream is really fun.

259
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,520
How many, how often do we do them?

260
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,320
At least once a month.

261
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,920
Right now we're doing about once a month, but-

262
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,200
We should do twice a month. I think that'd be cool.

263
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,040
I think the community has asked and I will deliver like next year, by next year, I mean January.

264
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,520
They want to have like sort of like a champion of the server.

265
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,800
So have like a Pokemon battle and decide who's the champion.

266
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:46,120
And they get to keep the title for a week and then people can challenge them for the title.

267
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,680
And once they win, they get the title for the week and stuff.

268
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,360
That's a cool, excellent idea.

269
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,520
So I was thinking of having the tournament and during the time we're streaming,

270
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,920
so people can see the tournament if that's okay.

271
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,040
Oh, that's a great idea.

272
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,640
And I know that I hadn't seen the construction, but I know some of the people are building like

273
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,360
an Elite Force Stadium somewhere or like an Indigo Plateau for the purposes of this.

274
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,720
So that would be fucking sick.

275
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,200
Gotta go, gotta go build my team.

276
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,440
Also, also a similar title for like just PvP.

277
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,120
And I might have to build a PvP arena in the nether.

278
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,880
But yeah, so like those two titles are gonna happen on January.

279
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,200
How excited.

280
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,080
Get it here first, folks.

281
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,640
That's the perfect chance.

282
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,000
All these things you could be experiencing firsthand.

283
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,880
Give us your money.

284
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,320
For only the low, low price of $5 per month.

285
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,360
Patreon.com slash PCB Minecraft, everybody.

286
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,080
I mean, the stream was like fucking yesterday or the day before or whatever.

287
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,720
And it was a great time.

288
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,480
If you want to give us a Christmas present, give us the present of your patronage.

289
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,800
Very true.

290
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,440
Actually, I stuck around for like several hours afterwards streaming on my Twitch.

291
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,480
Just grinding out levels and leveling up my...

292
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,480
Or did you use the crewhouse?

293
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, I did.

294
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,480
That guy was all blissies.

295
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,200
So good.

296
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,800
It was amazing.

297
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,240
Oh yeah, yeah, blissies, yeah.

298
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,760
Yeah.

299
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:11,480
Speaking of which, speaking of streams and Pokemon, the official Pokemon heart gold BGE Nuzlocke

300
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,600
has begun, everybody.

301
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,760
That's all I'm just saying.

302
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,200
Oh yeah, let's get to Pokemon.

303
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,720
Let's discuss it endlessly.

304
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,040
I'm just saying that Nuzlocke is going.

305
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,920
Tuesdays and Saturdays, 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

306
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,400
It's great.

307
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,120
Name Pokemon.

308
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,000
Donate to me money.

309
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,360
I mean, what's the downside here?

310
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,640
The spirit of giving money all the time in every way possible.

311
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,760
Giving money to me.

312
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,240
Spirit of shilling, the spirit of shit.

313
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,320
You heard it.

314
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Speaking of shilling, Davoo has a new game out.

315
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,720
I don't know whether you talked about it last week.

316
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,360
Oh yeah.

317
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,200
I was amazed.

318
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,560
I think I'm going to play that on Twitch tonight.

319
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,440
It's quite a short game, but it's very brain teaser-y.

320
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,600
Sounds cool.

321
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,160
Brain teaser.

322
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,040
You know, I had one issue.

323
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,240
I was wondering if you guys had this.

324
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,240
When I first loaded up the game, by the way, what's the name of it?

325
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,040
Chamber of Hex.

326
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,680
I can't remember.

327
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,200
That's right.

328
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,000
Chamber of Hex.

329
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,520
When I was playing H.E.X., that's correct.

330
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
I had an issue with a driver.

331
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,960
I was missing something.

332
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,440
I had to download whatever, DLL or something, whatever I fixed that.

333
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,160
But then when I was playing it, I just wasn't getting any music.

334
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,880
So I just stopped.

335
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,040
I was like, I got to fix this problem before I play this game,

336
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,520
because the music is one of the major features.

337
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,400
And I couldn't do it.

338
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,240
So I just decided I'd play it later.

339
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,920
Anybody else have that issue of playing it?

340
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,240
No.

341
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,720
I don't know.

342
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,280
I haven't played it so long.

343
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,080
Just me, I guess.

344
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,240
Okay.

345
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,640
Well, in any case, I did really like it and I wanted to play more.

346
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,040
So I'm going to fix that as soon as possible and then finish it.

347
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,800
Because I got to be happy to eat it.

348
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,600
Very cool art.

349
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
I have a question.

350
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,480
It's like, you changed your profile picture to that Digimon I linked it.

351
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,360
It's always a Digimon?

352
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,240
Yeah, I really like it.

353
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,200
It was a Digimon.

354
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,720
I thought it looked like a fucking like baby form Digimon, but I wasn't sure.

355
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,520
Yeah, you say, you give me Botomon.

356
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,240
Okay.

357
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,240
You give me Botomon?

358
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,760
You give me Botomon.

359
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,680
Right now, I have it as on both my screens of my desktop wallpaper stretched to fill.

360
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,480
So it's such a big happy face looking at me at all times.

361
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,440
Digimon is sick and ironically great.

362
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,400
I'm trying to see what it digivolves into.

363
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,280
I've been playing a mobile game of Digimon, an official one.

364
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,640
Oh yeah, that came out a while, not a super long time ago, a little while ago.

365
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,800
It's considered a species of Botomon.

366
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,320
Right.

367
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,400
Before we go off on nothing, just to mention, go check out Chamber of Hicks.

368
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,040
It's free.

369
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,840
It's a video game.

370
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,400
It's good.

371
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:41,160
It's short and it's got the same as Chiaros, Skrull, music that Davoo's worked with on his

372
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,000
previous game, really good musician man as well.

373
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,200
It's good.

374
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,640
Have a fun time with it.

375
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,120
Ah, good.

376
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,200
Okay, I see Mage posted a thing about the digivolve forms, by the way.

377
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,600
But I've got to say, it looks like it can digivolve into this beautiful creature known

378
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,120
as Poncho Mon, to one of its digivolusions.

379
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,760
Amazing.

380
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,000
As far as I'm considered concerned, that's a win.

381
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,720
That's a win.

382
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,280
God.

383
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,240
Reminds me of the base character, King Tacos, from One Piece.

384
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,000
What a legendary character that guy is.

385
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,440
Digimon is so good.

386
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,800
God damn.

387
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,600
I like the idea of Digimon.

388
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,360
I like how there's no rhyme or reason between the digivolvations.

389
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,160
And it can digivolve into them.

390
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,840
I'm not a fan of that, as it happens.

391
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,560
Seems pretty arbitrary and dumb.

392
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,760
Like they're not thinking about it.

393
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,160
No, no, no.

394
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,520
But it makes sense because you see their data and you can shape data in whatever which way

395
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,600
and you can involve into very different things.

396
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,680
That's true.

397
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,360
I mean, Pokemon are also data, essentially.

398
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,800
I mean, I know in lore, yeah, sure.

399
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't even disagree that Digimon are crazy and random.

400
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,640
Basically, every Digimon's like Eevee.

401
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,240
They're just completely malleable.

402
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,560
Well, plus there's like a thing in, I forget.

403
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,520
It's like there's, with Digimon, there's like a vaccine, virus, and like data or whatever.

404
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,480
There's three main types.

405
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,800
And they can like change between them or something.

406
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,640
So there's like some kind of system for how they-

407
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,040
And they also have like elemental attacks as well.

408
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,000
So there's a bit of play between these things.

409
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,200
So sneak.

410
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,080
Has anyone played a good Digimon game in the last 10 years?

411
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,440
The DS ones are pretty good.

412
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,680
Yeah.

413
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,000
The new ones for like PS4, PS Vita.

414
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,640
Cyber Sleuth or Cyber Stalker.

415
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,600
Yeah, good things about them.

416
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,800
I've not played it.

417
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,480
They're also available on the Switch now.

418
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,000
The shows are quite well designed.

419
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,520
They're available on the Switch now.

420
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,160
So just letting you know you can-

421
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,840
Another game your friend can't play.

422
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,720
The Digimon like show series and stuff.

423
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,280
I remember watching like episode one to three because I had that on VHS and seeing some other

424
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,240
episodes on TV.

425
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,400
And then Pokemon was the obvious comparison.

426
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,600
Pokemon was so much easier to get into after the fact.

427
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,360
Because Digimon didn't have like a clear,

428
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,320
this is what the character wants and this is what he was going to try and do.

429
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,880
And then he goes and tries to do it.

430
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,400
It's just a bunch of kids who suddenly get magic powers and digital monsters and

431
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,960
they want to go back home.

432
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,840
Well, they want to go back home.

433
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,360
I mean, the whole premise of the original show is that they get transported into the digital world.

434
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,160
Isakai.

435
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,320
They get, it's yeah, it's basically an Isakai.

436
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,600
And the whole, like the thing that made Digimon difficult to watch,

437
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,160
like just kind of get into as a kid is because it was one of the few shows I was airing

438
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,360
in those time slots that had a single continuous story.

439
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:30,760
Yeah, that's it.

440
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,400
Like each episode directly continued from the last.

441
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,920
Whereas in Pokemon, it was like an episode of the week kind of thing.

442
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,480
Where it's like a simple one hour, half an hour conflict.

443
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,360
Even though it would not be difficult at all to get into Digimon, the anime,

444
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,480
I feel like this general sense of like apprehension to even thinking about it.

445
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,120
But I could easily just go watch Pokemon all over again.

446
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,120
Because that's simple.

447
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,200
I feel differently.

448
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,160
Watch Digimon, especially Tamers.

449
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,320
Tamer season three is fucking choice.

450
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
It has nothing to do with the previous two seasons,

451
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,560
it's its own self-contained story.

452
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,000
So you can just watch that.

453
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,120
It is great.

454
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,320
It is a 10 out of 10, unironically fantastic.

455
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,040
Go watch it.

456
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,880
It's sad that they completely dropped the ball with the enemies,

457
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,600
like starting with season four and downhill from there.

458
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,360
Season four was just barely tolerable, just barely.

459
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,960
And everything after that is just pants.

460
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,680
Wait, in Pokemon?

461
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,360
Digimon.

462
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,480
I heard people like Frontier, but I never watched it.

463
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,520
I've only watched the first three seasons.

464
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,720
The idea, it's a hit or miss.

465
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,920
If you like the idea of people becoming Digimon, then I guess.

466
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,880
That's why I didn't watch it.

467
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,640
Yeah.

468
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,840
I liked it when I was younger and when it was in German.

469
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,000
I recently, me and Bayer, tried to watch it like the dubbed one.

470
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,800
And we laughed about how stupid it was.

471
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,080
Like the dub was awful.

472
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,520
Everyone had like some sort of accent.

473
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:58,280
The dub of Digimon is, if you go on with the right mindset, it is such a joy.

474
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,800
Because the awful jokes that they add into the dub are incredible.

475
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,440
Incredible.

476
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,480
It is.

477
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:05,800
It is.

478
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,440
We compared some scenes.

479
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,760
There's this one scene where like Lee, the evil Digimon are sort of like coming,

480
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,120
like they're following the good people, like the main characters.

481
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,440
And they keep switching back and forth,

482
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,640
showing how like the antagonists are coming closer.

483
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,080
And like in the sub, it's kind of silent and ominous.

484
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,240
And you're just like, they're sort of getting closer.

485
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,000
But like in the dub, it's just like, there's this one guy with like a really stupid accent

486
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,920
going just a little further.

487
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,000
And then this other guy just like, shut up.

488
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,760
There's dialogue constantly.

489
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,600
It's like the guiding mantra of the dubs is like, we can't have silence ever.

490
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,560
And there's just like constant ad-libbing jokes and bad.

491
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,000
Was this a four kids production by Nathan?

492
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,800
It was not.

493
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,280
I don't remember.

494
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,760
But I think it was Saban by Saban.

495
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,320
I believe they did it possibly.

496
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,120
I could be wrong.

497
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,000
It was a good laugh, I'll say that much.

498
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,720
But like as much of a story or endearing character is like not at all.

499
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,000
One through three are good.

500
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,680
Three being the best.

501
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,800
One being the second best.

502
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,720
Two being good, but not great.

503
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,760
Go watch them.

504
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,720
Better than the rest.

505
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,280
They're good.

506
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,720
Better than the other ones.

507
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,080
Fourth one is just like just entertaining enough.

508
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,840
And the fifth one, I think it was like the one with like a lullamon.

509
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,040
Those cross wars, right?

510
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:34,040
No, that was the weird one with the different art style where the first episode is just a

511
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,440
regular guy punches a digimon in the face with his bare hands.

512
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,680
Like the fucking manliest man who ever lived.

513
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,000
There's a giant abumon who becomes his best bro.

514
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,200
That's all I remember about it.

515
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,560
Oh yeah.

516
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:45,880
Yeah.

517
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,040
Yeah.

518
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,760
That's the one.

519
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,920
I hated that one for one reason is because like there's this kid.

520
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:57,560
He grew up in the Digimon world and he has a partner that's an owl and the owl's very

521
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,160
eloquent that they had a mom fridge humon and she's also eloquent in English.

522
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,480
But he himself, in the dub at least, he himself talks like a stupid child.

523
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,200
It's just like, he just goes, I mean, oh, like you.

524
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,760
Oh, God, oh, God, you grew up around people who are eloquent.

525
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,040
Well, Digimon who are eloquent.

526
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,480
Why are you talking like this?

527
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,400
Some just have retarded brains.

528
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,320
Yeah, you know, some people just have mental problems,

529
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,560
mate.

530
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,720
You don't have to fucking drag them like that.

531
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,520
Cognitive diversity should be embraced, not criticized.

532
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,800
Diversity is our strength.

533
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Because his design is like, you know, like a wild child or whatever.

534
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,840
I guess in the dub, they thought it's like appropriate for him to talk like that.

535
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,640
But it makes no sense.

536
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,400
That's not like these dub copies work.

537
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,560
Because Nico Robin wore a cowboy hat in her first appearance,

538
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,440
they just gave her like a Southern Belle voice actor

539
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,800
for like her entire four kids dub lifetime.

540
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,200
And it was, I mean, it was so, it's kind of charming actually.

541
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,160
But like, that's not, just because she's wearing a cowboy hat.

542
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,400
Well, hang on.

543
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,760
She's not actually a cowboy.

544
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,480
How do you know that that isn't what Elder intended?

545
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,240
I guess I don't give, you know what?

546
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,160
Got him.

547
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,760
I'd like to think that it was, maybe she had like a weird like Osaka accent

548
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,480
or however the fuck those jabs do that shit over there.

549
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,640
Can you tell that in written dialogue?

550
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,920
Probably, probably, I don't know.

551
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,920
Anyway, yes.

552
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,400
It's, I mean, there'll be like a guy who's like wearing one of those Russian hats

553
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,480
who they just give like a Russian accent to,

554
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,000
even though it's just like a character.

555
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,560
I don't know.

556
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,160
Is Osaka like, like it's usually depicted in dubs as like a Texas accent

557
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,600
to like differentiate it from normal voice actor accents

558
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,280
from normal America or whatever.

559
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,520
Is it?

560
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,640
It's Osaka, Texas.

561
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,840
Well, like what does it actually sound like?

562
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,200
Is it like, that's gonna be a major gomenasai for me?

563
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
Well, like is that how they actually talk?

564
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,800
There's no easy translation in English or anything,

565
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,200
but they are, I think the gist is that they are thought to talk

566
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,960
in a more like lackadaisical way, which is somewhat analogous to like the Texas drawl.

567
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,960
Like they have different ways of saying things.

568
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,160
And it is to the south, like Kyoto and...

569
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,840
Oh, Hayao Kazai, my ass.

570
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,720
Osaka to the south.

571
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,000
So I guess it kind of works.

572
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,080
I mean, I mean, I love Osaka, the character from Ozamangadayo

573
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,680
with her silly like Southern accent.

574
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,960
It is extremely adorable.

575
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,280
So it totally works as like a correlate, but is it 100% accurate?

576
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,360
I mean, no, no, no, it is not.

577
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,480
It could be.

578
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,000
But that's one of those like a dub adaptation things that I actually appreciate.

579
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,160
They're putting some thought into how to adapt it.

580
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,840
I guess really it's a localization question as to how to capture the spirit

581
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,800
of like a character who whose trait is that they talk weird

582
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,200
compared to the other Japanese contemporaries

583
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,720
and giving them the Osaka dialect converted to Texas shit.

584
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,000
Makes sense.

585
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,400
Makes sense.

586
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,760
Osaka from...

587
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,320
What a great show.

588
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,720
I like, yeah.

589
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,520
Ozamangadayo.

590
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,800
We did, I think, yeah, we did do a Chibi Baka's episode,

591
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,840
me and Munchy on Ozamangadayo.

592
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,040
Munchy hated it.

593
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,760
I liked it.

594
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,520
He hated it.

595
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,640
Did he, did you guys watch the dub?

596
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,240
I think I watched the dub.

597
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,880
I don't remember, actually.

598
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,360
I usually try to watch one or the other just to see,

599
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,840
like on the first episode, which is better.

600
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,000
We should do more of those fucking Chibi Baka's.

601
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,280
I have one recorded when Munchy came over, but I haven't edited it yet.

602
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,080
We watched Akira and we were like, what the fuck?

603
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,200
Oh, well, that's a great one.

604
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,960
People would love to hear your thoughts, I think.

605
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,240
Akira's pretty dope.

606
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,040
Akira's pretty dope, but I've, I don't know,

607
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,320
I've been recording lots of like little things here and there and being like,

608
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,960
but why would I put it out?

609
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,720
Why would I make anything?

610
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,960
Why would I make a video on this day and age?

611
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,480
I mean, you know, I think...

612
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,520
It gives just like, you know what?

613
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,400
I'm not sorry I haven't made a video in a while.

614
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,920
Proceeds to not make videos.

615
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,680
And literally, I'm not sorry.

616
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,160
The effort that go into editing it and putting it out, it's like,

617
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,360
you know what?

618
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,720
I'm just happy that I did it.

619
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,520
I don't really care.

620
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,120
You know, I get that.

621
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,720
That sounds like you have a healthy relationship to content creation.

622
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,920
You can't do that on this day and age.

623
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Well, not if he's not getting it out any...

624
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,840
I mean, I think that releasing it is an important component of creating content.

625
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,800
Well, I mean, creating content.

626
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,960
I have like recorded the footage.

627
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,800
I would need to edit it and put it into a thing and see that it's okay.

628
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,360
So there's a hurt.

629
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,480
So there's something to do.

630
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,280
Okay, fair enough.

631
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,000
Right, you're absolutely right about that.

632
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,120
But I would encourage you that the good news is,

633
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,280
because you've self-avowedly not...

634
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,040
You're not a video man at this juncture in time or whatever.

635
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,400
There's very low expectation.

636
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,000
So anything you do release is just a bonus for everybody, including me.

637
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,200
So I'd very much like to see it.

638
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,160
I mean, yeah, it's a bonus.

639
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,080
I'm still waiting for Kingdom Hearts 2.

640
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,080
G-R-P-J, when?

641
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,240
When will it be released to the world?

642
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,680
I don't know, maybe never.

643
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,480
Probably never.

644
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,760
When Kingdom Hearts 4 comes out.

645
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,160
Alas.

646
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,920
Ooh, that'll be fun.

647
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,240
The thing though is like, I feel like putting...

648
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,520
Due to just the nature of what everyone else experiences on YouTube with other YouTubers,

649
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,160
is if anybody takes a break, whether they've completely retired

650
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,240
or they're just having a few days off,

651
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,320
there's this expectation of when they come back, it's got to be big.

652
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,600
It's got to be a big thing.

653
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,120
So that it's not like a limp sort of like, back onto the platform.

654
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,680
Like they've been waiting for years and then like if I...

655
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,160
Like the other day or the other week, or just whenever,

656
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,400
I upload something onto the Gibbentech channel

657
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,320
and it's just some like four second, four minute, silly thing.

658
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,760
I can't help but feel in the back of my mind that somebody's like,

659
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,080
yeah, like they see that they forgot about me because I hadn't been doing anything

660
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,240
and then they're reminded of me and it's not interesting.

661
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,400
And they're just sort of like, what a shame.

662
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,760
On that similar vein though, so one, you may have heard of him,

663
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,520
Digi Brony MLP uploaded a new video today

664
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,840
that is top 50 TV anime of the decade, one of two.

665
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,800
And upon watch, I watched the whole thing, I gotta say,

666
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,440
I loved that video because it was so quintessential,

667
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,440
like it's the best stuff Digi makes, things like this basically.

668
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,840
It's like none of this bullshit face cam,

669
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,320
get that content bullshit out of my face.

670
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,120
You're part of quarantine.

671
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,320
It's just I want the edited Anna cat's trash, don't watch it.

672
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,960
Each has their place, but this was like prime Digi,

673
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,920
just the reason that people subscribed to him years ago

674
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,720
and it just feels right, like exactly what...

675
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,280
Like I mean, just not to show you Digi, I love you,

676
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,880
but just looking at his channel, he's got like his last videos on the channel,

677
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,840
some art so far, it's a whirling dervish, a Pansu party podcasting over PSB, fine.

678
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,920
This retarded worst video I've ever seen,

679
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,040
the wife is the little sister, where he was obviously just high

680
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,480
and not thinking clearly, because I could explain to you in two seconds

681
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,920
why the wife is not the little sister Digi.

682
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,120
I just saw that thumbnail, I just let out a deep sigh

683
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,240
and then moved on with my life.

684
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,800
And then like this music review thing that I had some interest in,

685
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,680
but I'm not a big music guy for his strange ways here we come,

686
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,040
wherever the fuck that was.

687
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,000
And then this like classic Digi Bro video,

688
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,640
and like I just feel in myself like, ah, at last, relief,

689
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,720
the thing I've been looking for is here.

690
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,920
And that really makes me reflect on like my own content.

691
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,880
I was about to say Nate, I can't wait to feel that way

692
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,520
when my perception of this turned on myself.

693
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,320
I'm still waiting.

694
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,880
People didn't sign up when they signed up,

695
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,160
when they first subscribed or whatever,

696
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,360
for Mia Maffova or Weagawa or any other, even the Smash videos.

697
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,160
They didn't sign up for those.

698
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,160
They signed up for best enemy ever,

699
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,320
Ghost, the Gurrenlogging and Ghost in the Shell

700
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,080
and maybe Galco to some degree.

701
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,120
And God, it just, it really makes me think like,

702
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,120
I really should be giving people like as fast as possible

703
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,440
the stuff they really want, which is part of the plan of course,

704
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,760
but not fast enough for my taste.

705
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,640
Well, it's weird, right?

706
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,120
Because you feel like you have to do like weekly content

707
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,760
or just like keep the algorithm fed.

708
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,280
But then at the same time, it's like you, Nate, the person,

709
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,840
are doing weekly podcasts here.

710
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,000
You're doing weekly content on content.

711
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,960
It's like, why can't your channel just be some tentpole pieces

712
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,160
that you can promote from other sources?

713
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,520
Well, I mean, I gotta tell you, Tom,

714
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,760
that's really where my mind is heading these days,

715
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,640
but that seems like the reasonable way to go.

716
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,440
I don't know.

717
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,520
Yeah, the way it's always felt is like, for you and for Digi,

718
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,800
they have, you both have your big tightly written

719
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,080
analytical pieces that are really in-depth and great.

720
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,160
And Digi is just good at analysis generally,

721
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,240
so he can make a list, but he does the scripts well

722
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,440
and he doesn't quick.

723
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,120
And so something like this sort of list

724
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,760
is very exhaustive and very well-informed

725
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,040
and it's really useful and cool.

726
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,200
I bet he loved making it too, just watching it.

727
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,040
So like it's good.

728
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,360
Like I've seen some things I'd never seen anywhere else,

729
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,720
even on Digi's channel.

730
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,080
I was like, huh, that's interesting.

731
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,160
Yeah, and it's almost like for us as viewers,

732
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,960
we get kind of the most out of these videos out of anything.

733
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,640
And then there's like the second tier of goodness of content

734
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,320
where you've got the We Agua and Digi has vlogs

735
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,120
of various description where he rambles on about a topic

736
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,400
and you also ramble on with talking points in your heads,

737
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,840
but it's not as tight and it's not as edited or impactful.

738
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,760
It's pretty good.

739
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,080
Nobody really would complain that a video like that

740
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,600
is coming out all the time.

741
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,760
It's just sort of like in the back of your mind,

742
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,280
you're wishing for something else, something more intense.

743
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,920
There's some, you know, I know Digi.

744
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,360
Digi goes to a lot of, he'll explain a lot of this stuff.

745
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,200
He'll rationalize these things.

746
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,400
And I love the guy, I do it too about We Aguas and whatnot,

747
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,840
but there's just something.

748
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,400
There's something that's just part of this edited,

749
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,600
I don't know, like in our cases,

750
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,160
like these anime discussion things with like a script

751
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,240
and fancier editing and music in the background.

752
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,160
The fancy editing is less important

753
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,680
than the tightly written scripts.

754
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,600
And because usually when you're writing a script,

755
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,760
you come up to like, you get to the part where you're saying things,

756
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,720
writing things down that you would say just off the cuff

757
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,960
and then you realize, well, this bit's less interesting.

758
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,120
I can cut that and then I can go more in depth

759
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,800
into this more interesting thing.

760
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,720
And then it sort of naturally becomes

761
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,640
a more interesting video through that process.

762
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,200
So like, when I made the Konosuba,

763
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,800
like the YMS ripoff video I made on my channel recently,

764
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,120
I mean, yeah, I mean, even you, Gib, who's,

765
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,840
I mean, you're not much of an anime guy necessarily

766
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,760
compared to some of the other folks,

767
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,200
but you really enjoy that.

768
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,640
And when I was making that, I was really trying to embrace,

769
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,000
honestly, the Digi example of when I made a script

770
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,800
and then I was like, okay, I know this would be better

771
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,160
if it was shorter.

772
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,960
So I'm going to really dig deep and try to cut things.

773
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,960
It was the first video I've really tried to cut content from

774
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,120
in a way just to make it cleaner and better.

775
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,680
And even I was shocked, I still got complaints

776
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,240
that it was still too long and like wasting people's time,

777
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,840
even though I put so much work.

778
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,440
I guess I'm not perfect at this yet

779
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,360
about cutting unnecessary stuff,

780
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,800
but it's like eight minutes long.

781
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,640
I thought the whole thing was pretty great.

782
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,560
And just like, if that's all the videos on my channel,

783
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,880
I just feel like if I replaced Weagua's with things like that,

784
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,520
just everybody would be happier, including me.

785
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,480
I don't know, it took more time to make.

786
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
And it's, I mean, yeah, you're absolutely right.

787
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,640
I mean, I don't, we don't have to go on this

788
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,640
for too much longer, but like the new year's coming,

789
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,640
I'm feeling like it might be a time for a fresh start

790
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,760
on what I've been doing.

791
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,200
I've been trying what I've been doing for a while.

792
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,840
So I don't know, we'll see what happens.

793
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,800
If you're interested at all in Nate's channel,

794
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,400
known as Best Guy Ever on YouTube.com, maybe you've heard of it.

795
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,040
This has been a public service announcement.

796
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,640
The content channel that you and Digi do

797
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,360
is also feels like secondary content.

798
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,120
Like it's, it's good filler background noise,

799
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,320
but like it's not, you wouldn't go to that

800
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,000
and then discover Digi bro or Nate the best man you would.

801
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,920
Yes, I agree.

802
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,680
Although, you know, one of the conceits

803
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,040
behind the channel was that like,

804
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,680
Actually, maybe you would because it is more relevant anime.

805
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,320
So I don't know.

806
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,600
Yeah, see, that's the one strength I think it has

807
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,080
that like Digi and I, both of this thing where I don't know,

808
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,200
we were like, we talked to Victor, here's what I was going to say,

809
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,040
that like there was a conversation Digi told me about

810
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,720
with Victor and I think about this a lot

811
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,320
as inspiration for content.

812
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,040
And it's that like Victor told Digi that like he begs him to make

813
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,120
like fast videos about currently airing seasonal anime

814
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,360
because Victor just wants to hear about them

815
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,440
and because no one besides like Jeff and his contemporaries

816
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,680
are making those videos about those shows,

817
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,120
that's who he goes to watch.

818
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,080
And I think content is a few rungs in terms of like quality beneath,

819
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,560
like frankly, like, you know, a mother's basement scripted edited video.

820
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,680
You know, I don't hate Jeff or anything.

821
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,600
The type 10 content on YouTube came up with Digi bro first.

822
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,720
And then some strange thing called content media,

823
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,000
which is not content.

824
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,920
So I mean, to be fair, the channel is only like a month and a half old,

825
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,000
you know, it's still, it's still getting its legs.

826
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,440
It is a baby.

827
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,920
And actually even the content that's on there is basically like an alpha

828
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,520
or like a beta version of the content that we one day hope to have,

829
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,240
that'd be more like red letter media-esque on the channel.

830
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,400
So, you know, right now I think we're, I mean,

831
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,040
me and Digi already know we can talk about pretty much anything for a while.

832
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,360
We're both have the gift of gab and whatnot.

833
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,040
So hopefully we'll make some money, be able to finance some,

834
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,800
some upgraded equipment and whatnot, do this thing in person, possibly,

835
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,920
at some point, at some point.

836
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,680
The biggest episodes at the moment are

837
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,720
cautious hero and Pokemon Sword and Shield does it suck.

838
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,440
Like 11, 12 and 13 in K views each.

839
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,600
Which interestingly-

840
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,080
Martin's a good thumbnail choice for anything, you know.

841
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,560
Indeed.

842
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,840
Gotta get those fucking genders.

843
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,120
This must be a coincidence that those are like the most popular things

844
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,320
that we discussed.

845
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,520
That's probably just random.

846
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,320
Well, Pokemon, I feel like that's way more popular in general than anime.

847
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,840
So that would get more attention.

848
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,240
Well, that's true.

849
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,480
That breaks outside the little anime bubble.

850
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,760
I have no idea what cautious hero, how that caught on.

851
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,920
It's just a popular isekai.

852
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,440
Yeah, it's a currently airing-

853
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,000
It's a quality show.

854
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,720
Okay.

855
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,480
I thought Beastars was huge, but the-

856
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,520
I think it's kind of launched away in-

857
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,840
Well, you know, I guess I know nothing because I don't,

858
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,360
I don't like any of these circles.

859
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,920
I think the people who like it just really like it.

860
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,360
So I think they're just loud on social media.

861
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,560
I sort of get that feeling too.

862
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,440
And it is really good.

863
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,800
I know because I'm one of them.

864
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,880
Watch Beastars, you fucking peasants.

865
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,600
Yes, it's good.

866
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,320
Yes, yes.

867
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,640
But I mean, mostly me and Digi have been talking about the most popular shows.

868
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,120
Everything that we've watched, I think is worth people watching.

869
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,360
That we talked about on content so far, if they've got the time to burn.

870
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,200
Probably Beastars, Blade of the Immortal and Cautious Hero are the best ones.

871
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:34,760
I am curious, as someone who's been observing content, as from the very beginning,

872
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:41,320
what was the decision or the thought behind doing every four episodes

873
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,920
instead of doing a weekly show where you just covered all the stuff?

874
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,640
Would it just-

875
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,120
Time saving?

876
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,680
That's a very-

877
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,520
Like this weekend animatic reasoning.

878
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,120
I mean, it's kind of a middle ground between-

879
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,240
First of all, we wanted to do like two episodes a week.

880
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,960
Because we're not prepared to spend all our time on this as it exists right now,

881
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,920
for the paltry amount it's earning as it is.

882
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,520
We wanted a middle ground between reviewing every episode as it comes out,

883
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,760
which is the way that Digi and I traditionally had done our Aromanga Sensei

884
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,720
and our Rick and Morty stuff and those kinds of shows.

885
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,080
And not also having to wait until the end of a season to talk about anything at all.

886
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,600
So it was Digi's idea, but I think it works out pretty well

887
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,840
that it's just- it's a decent chunk of the show.

888
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,920
It's not that we- we can avoid the semi-pitfall of like,

889
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,040
when you discuss just one episode of a show at a time,

890
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,080
you could be like very critical and very nitpicky about like,

891
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,320
oh, this episode didn't make me feel happy in my pants as I wanted to,

892
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,880
because the girls weren't sexy enough.

893
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,800
This episode, well, Nate, that's because next episode, they're extremely sexy.

894
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,040
So that's what you have to wait for.

895
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,640
So, you know, it just- that's part of it I think at least for me as to why.

896
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,880
I was interested because like, you're doing the four-episode block thing,

897
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,920
but then you're also doing the potty cast, which is every chapter.

898
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:01,960
So you're-

899
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,320
Well, that's a separate venture, you know.

900
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:08,680
Digi's no one-piece expert, so that's- that exists to serve a particular demographic.

901
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,560
I mean, plus like, potty cast exists to serve exactly one thing,

902
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:20,040
which is the one-piece manga, whereas contents for whatever is due of discussion at that particular time.

903
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,240
If there was like a really hype one-piece arc, if Digi was read up to it,

904
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,120
we probably would talk about it like on content or something,

905
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,280
but I don't think he'll be catching up any time soon.

906
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:29,960
Probably not.

907
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,960
So there you go, that's- that's my thoughts.

908
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,760
And if Digi ever wanted to show up to one of these episodes, he could tell you about it too.

909
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,640
Yeah, Digi also roasted-

910
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,240
Has been not in the chat or online to- to talk with anyone ever.

911
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,320
He has been busy.

912
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,200
I just would like to know what Digi and Jesse are up to.

913
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,480
I know more about what Davoo's doing right now.

914
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,240
I mean, I could tell you, Digi's just busy with getting his videos for the end of the year and-

915
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,720
I suppose.

916
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,840
I mean, yeah, talk at content and stuff.

917
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,520
It's just sort of like, yeah, he is my friend, I wouldn't like to see him.

918
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,480
Yeah, understandable.

919
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,360
If you add him, he'll just probably show up eventually.

920
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,320
He's a hard man to read.

921
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,280
I'll slap him.

922
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,720
I'll attack him.

923
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:18,040
He has said before that like the only Discord groups he's in, like, is like the PCP and like maybe one of two others,

924
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,000
like, I guess the content, the one that he and I have, and that's it, because he only gives a shit.

925
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Those of us in this group have to say to him on Discord.

926
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,360
So if you added me, probably.

927
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:28,840
Yeah.

928
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:34,520
Although I did add him yesterday demanding his W9 forum for tax purposes in the PCP,

929
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:42,280
which he has not gotten to me after six months, and we need it from him, you, Ben, and Jesse as well, who actually did respond.

930
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,360
I thought, okay, the last time we talked about it, you were like,

931
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:51,240
well, actually, maybe I have, maybe I messed it up. Don't worry about it. I'll tell you about it later.

932
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,080
Okay, that's absolutely true. You are correct, but I couldn't figure it out.

933
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,680
Later is now, and now I need it.

934
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,880
So now it has become later.

935
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,200
Ben, Ben, you sedated right now. What's going on?

936
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,240
Did you roll out of bed?

937
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:06,040
I am pretty hungover, so I'm not technically sedated, but I wish I was.

938
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,080
You might as well be.

939
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,960
Did you get Big Drunk on the RCK stream?

940
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,640
I got Big Drunk on the RCK stream.

941
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,440
I got, well, I got Fairly Drunk on the RCK stream, but it was nothing compared to what was to come later.

942
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,120
How many doors did you knock on this week?

943
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,040
Is this the new Ben segment, the weekly inebriation where each week?

944
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,120
What substance will Ben abuse this week?

945
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,120
Actually, we did. Me and one of my roommates did go across the street and knock on the door,

946
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,560
but it was at an appropriate time this time because there was a party going on,

947
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,760
and we were like, let's go over there and bring some alcohol and just be like,

948
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,520
hey, what's up? Let's hang out. But they didn't answer.

949
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,080
Oh, that's cool.

950
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,880
Wait, so the party was going on inside?

951
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,480
We could hear, there was stuff going on.

952
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,160
We went and knocked on the door to see if they wanted to, I don't know,

953
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,600
let us in on it or whatever.

954
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,880
Yeah, sure.

955
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,600
That's good.

956
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,640
But it was upstairs and the door was downstairs, so maybe they just genuinely didn't hear it.

957
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,360
And we just...

958
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,640
Should have thrown rocks at the window.

959
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,720
Should have thrown bricks through the window.

960
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,000
I've got, we had some.

961
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,600
I got two.

962
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,480
Indeed.

963
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,200
I locked myself, well, me and my other roommate, a different roommate,

964
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:21,640
locked ourselves on the porch the other day and because the handle to the door is broken,

965
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,720
the handle came off and I accidentally left the handle inside and then he closed the door

966
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,320
without realizing I had left it there.

967
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,240
So what I tried to do...

968
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,560
So you weren't like trapped outside, you were trapped in this space of the porch.

969
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,760
I was on this porch.

970
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah.

971
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,040
So what I tried, yeah, specifically on this porch, couldn't leave it.

972
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:42,600
So I tried to take two bricks and put them around the like door handle like bit,

973
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,760
like the bit sticking out of the handle is supposed to attach to and turn.

974
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,560
I tried using bricks to like squeeze the handle or squeeze the knob,

975
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,120
what's what remained of the knob and like turn it.

976
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,120
And guess what, it didn't work.

977
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,600
Any luck.

978
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,680
We just had to bang on the door for a really loud and make everyone upset.

979
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,920
And they rubbed them together, started a fire.

980
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,200
Smokescreen burned the house down and escaped.

981
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,240
But I managed to avoid putting them through the window to get back in.

982
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,680
So that's a win for me.

983
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,160
That's good.

984
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,680
I mean, that's what I've been up to.

985
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,400
That's my week.

986
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,200
That's a hell of a take.

987
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,240
A hell of a story.

988
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,120
A hell of a time.

989
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,160
All slime and punishment is almost done.

990
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,160
Just like it's been almost done for years now.

991
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,080
Oh yeah, that's true.

992
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,400
How exciting.

993
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,640
Maybe another two dozen images left to go or something like that.

994
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,640
And then I've been thinking about the epilogue.

995
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,000
I don't want to say too much about it,

996
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,480
but I've been considering various forms that the epilogue might take.

997
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,320
And it might get pretty ambitious with it.

998
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:45,720
We'll see.

999
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,680
That's not the climax.

1000
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,760
The climax I know is going to be a video.

1001
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,760
The epilogue will be something else.

1002
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,320
You can get some ghost writers to fanfic write the epilogue just like Homestuck.

1003
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,440
Yeah, get the Lord of Ghostwriters in there.

1004
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,600
Lord of Ghostwriters.

1005
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,080
Mix it up.

1006
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,200
Hey, what's the status of the Kickstarter?

1007
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,800
I want my damn comics and pins.

1008
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:16,920
Well, a bunch of people are still working on their chapters,

1009
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,360
and a couple people haven't even gotten their scripts from me yet.

1010
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,000
Oh, here's a question.

1011
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,160
I was just curious.

1012
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,960
Will the digital copies of the updated stuff like that be available,

1013
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,120
or will I have to wait for a physical copy?

1014
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:32,920
I don't care either way.

1015
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,800
I'm just curious if it'll be available online before the end.

1016
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,440
At some point, yes, but not for a while.

1017
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:39,800
Okay.

1018
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,440
All right, Gib, explain yourself now.

1019
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,000
Okay.

1020
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,320
Why are you delaying and fucking this up for everyone?

1021
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,520
I mean, I have had the script for a few weeks.

1022
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,000
I was busy doing other things and had a cold, and I just was lazy.

1023
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,600
For the beginning of December,

1024
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,360
I just was lazy playing video game.

1025
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,000
But I finished the video game.

1026
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,600
Singular video game.

1027
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,080
Yeah, literally.

1028
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,680
I beat the entire video game, and now I'm serious,

1029
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,120
and I opened up Photoshop today, and I was sketching the page,

1030
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,760
and I hated it, and I was not sure how to do it.

1031
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,000
It was just one of those annoying things,

1032
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,600
where I know the size of the page.

1033
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,680
It's about the panels and the order they come in,

1034
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,480
life to write, you know, normal Western comic ideals.

1035
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,920
And I'm trying to fit, like, it's just a lot of thinking.

1036
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,760
The panel layout is the most difficult part of any comic.

1037
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,800
Drawing it is easy.

1038
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,680
Once you know where the panels are, what shape they are,

1039
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,920
and where the speech bubbles go, then everything's great,

1040
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,280
and then you can just line it and draw it, and it's easy.

1041
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,400
But...

1042
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,880
Panel layout is a whole art in and of itself.

1043
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,440
And when you read a fucking sick manga,

1044
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,360
where the panel layout just blows your mind,

1045
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,040
you're like, how did they come up with this?

1046
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:56,520
Yeah.

1047
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,240
The way I do it, which is not the right way to do it,

1048
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,960
is I draw a rectangle, and I draw what's in the rectangle,

1049
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,840
and then I realize, well, I think, okay,

1050
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,760
so this takes up this much of the page,

1051
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,240
there's this much to the right of it left,

1052
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,720
so I can put one panel there, and then underneath it...

1053
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,400
Do not thumbnail your pages first.

1054
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,360
You don't thumbnail your pages first.

1055
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,680
What does thumbnail mean?

1056
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,040
It's like when you do a tiny little sketch version of it,

1057
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,800
really loosely, just kind of lay it out

1058
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,760
before you start doing...

1059
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,120
I mean, that's kind of what I am doing.

1060
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,800
Like, I'm not drawing the finished panels,

1061
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,440
I'm just sort of drawing boxes and seeing...

1062
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,400
Like, I want this action to be going from left to right.

1063
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,320
He's holding a thing, he goes this way,

1064
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,520
we need to zoom in on this, zoom in on that,

1065
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,200
and then, oh, turn the page,

1066
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,440
and then we see the next thing on the next page,

1067
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,800
that's when you see the next thing.

1068
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,680
I thought you meant you were just like,

1069
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,640
you just did one panel at a time, like final art,

1070
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,920
and I'm like, you brave motherfucker, that's some crazy shit.

1071
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,360
That's the stupidest thing you could ever do.

1072
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,200
Right, which is why I was like, damn.

1073
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,840
I'm just stuck on this, I've got one page sort of good,

1074
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,680
and I'm trying to figure out the second page,

1075
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,160
and it's just not clicking, I don't really...

1076
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,400
And when something's not clicking,

1077
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,360
it's very easy to do your text returns, or, you know...

1078
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,200
That's the real reason why I'm doing it, sure.

1079
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,560
I can relate, I can relate.

1080
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,680
I mean, what I like to do is,

1081
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,680
I like to bust open my favorite comics,

1082
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,440
and read them intentionally,

1083
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,200
and pay attention to the panel layouts a bit.

1084
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,720
And then I kind of put them under my paper,

1085
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,840
and trace over them,

1086
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,120
and I just get really good results with that.

1087
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,040
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

1088
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,000
I think one thing I always have difficulty with

1089
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,880
is understanding how small I can draw something.

1090
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,880
Like, when I see a panel, I think,

1091
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,720
okay, the face has to go in this panel,

1092
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,480
and I make it fill the panel,

1093
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,880
but you don't have to do that,

1094
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,280
and you also don't have to have the full face in the panel.

1095
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,480
You could have it really zoomed in.

1096
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,080
It's just a lot of...

1097
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,040
That's true.

1098
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,040
It's a lot of decisions that I'm not good at making yet.

1099
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:55,880
Do you have that...

1100
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,400
I don't know much about comics or anything,

1101
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,080
but I have read a lot of One Piece.

1102
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,680
One Piece is a big inspiration,

1103
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,680
because those panels are very simple,

1104
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,280
but the things in them are great, and very rarely...

1105
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,960
I've collected the group shot that you made the thumbnail

1106
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,760
of the body cast.

1107
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,400
Yeah, I'm just curious.

1108
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,080
I don't know if you've ever seen this,

1109
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,360
but I'm going to link something for you,

1110
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,480
because I use this all the time,

1111
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,520
and I was making comics.

1112
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,800
It's the Wally Woods 22 comic panels that always work.

1113
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,840
It's pretty cool.

1114
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,560
Oh, that sounds useful.

1115
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,080
It's just like a reference of different kinds of comic panels

1116
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,120
and way to lay things out

1117
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,080
that just gets the nog and jog,

1118
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,120
and you can start thinking about it.

1119
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,320
It's pretty cool.

1120
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,920
I'll have a look right now.

1121
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,080
So, on this front, Ben, are there any other holdouts,

1122
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,760
any other moral degenerates

1123
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,520
who we should perhaps throw, you know,

1124
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,920
who we should either kink shame

1125
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,680
or throw bricks through windows of

1126
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,680
to spur them along on their quest?

1127
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:59,000
The only one who is done is Cheezy.

1128
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,480
Munchy's working on his.

1129
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,240
Hippo's working on his,

1130
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,640
and then I haven't fucking done anything

1131
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,720
for Jade Murrow or Nexus Mania.

1132
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,080
Or am I forgetting someone?

1133
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,120
In Kazzy, I haven't given her the script either.

1134
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:14,760
I'll fucking...

1135
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,320
I don't want to talk about it.

1136
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,360
No, talk about it.

1137
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:21,480
Leave me alone.

1138
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:21,960
Leave me alone, you boys.

1139
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,560
Are you a Kickstarter hell right now?

1140
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,240
You're a Kickstarter purgatory burning away your sins.

1141
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,760
Dude, writing is easy.

1142
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,400
That's where I am, yeah.

1143
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,160
You just imagine that you are the character,

1144
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,240
and then you say the most embarrassing things possible,

1145
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,200
and then you write it down.

1146
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,720
That's right.

1147
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,280
That's right.

1148
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,920
Just for...

1149
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,240
Yeah.

1150
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,280
I always assumed the Vapors was just a biography, so...

1151
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,960
Just remember, it's supposed to be bad.

1152
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,320
I just got to do what I do with Slime and Punishment,

1153
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,320
and think this is supposed to be bad,

1154
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,080
and it would be off-brand if it were good.

1155
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,360
Oh, that's very helpful there.

1156
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,360
That's not healthy reverse psychology.

1157
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,080
That's the secret.

1158
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,440
That's the secret right there.

1159
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,400
I assume you guys are similarly,

1160
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,000
but I spend a lot of time,

1161
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,800
or maybe I don't spend a lot of time directly thinking about it,

1162
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:19,320
but I really feel imposed upon in a helpful way by the rules.

1163
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,440
Like, my existence and the things I do change

1164
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,360
based on whatever I perceive the rules of the game to be at that time.

1165
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,080
It's like, right now, it's like, I need to make videos,

1166
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,120
got to make a weekly Weagua video or something,

1167
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,360
but if I formally change...

1168
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,640
If I make an announcement

1169
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,520
that I'm changing the rules of the game now,

1170
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,800
then I feel perfect permission to do things,

1171
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,560
or I don't know, do whatever.

1172
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,160
But if I don't announce it,

1173
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,480
I feel like the eyes of the public enforcing those rules upon me,

1174
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,280
and it's...

1175
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,880
I don't know, maybe this is more of a normal thing.

1176
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,560
It's just people have expectations,

1177
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,200
and then you live up to them or not.

1178
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,320
I used to feel like that.

1179
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,520
Now I feel the opposite.

1180
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,960
I feel like the best way to do things

1181
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,440
is just to subtly make changes,

1182
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,000
and just do it by degree so nobody notices,

1183
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,600
because I feel like if you make an announcement saying

1184
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,160
you're changing,

1185
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,000
you're just going to generate controversy in the backlight.

1186
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,520
Because we know people don't like change.

1187
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,480
They don't want to hear about it.

1188
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:09,640
Exactly.

1189
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,800
If you just do it, then it'll probably go over better.

1190
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,080
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

1191
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,280
You just got to do it subtly,

1192
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,520
and before they know it, that's the new normal,

1193
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,920
and they're just like, you've conditioned them subconsciously

1194
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,920
without anyone realizing it's happening.

1195
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,640
I definitely agree that that's a better way to do it,

1196
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,160
although the one thing is that if...

1197
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,680
Let's just say, for example,

1198
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:31,720
you have a Patreon with very clear, explicit deliverables

1199
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,320
that you are expected to deliver,

1200
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,360
and if you were to want to change that in some capacity,

1201
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,840
it seems like the only honest thing to do is to inspect.

1202
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,360
I'm going to change my Patreon.

1203
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,200
I'm going to start delivering nothing.

1204
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:42,840
How do you...

1205
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,520
Yes.

1206
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,080
Yeah.

1207
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,640
Well, I feel like...

1208
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,440
I'm still sad that...

1209
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,640
I feel like if you...

1210
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,040
You can talk openly to your patrons,

1211
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,320
because they're the ones who are the most hardcore.

1212
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,480
So whatever you do, they're there for...

1213
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,000
You're going to be in your court,

1214
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,520
unless you royally fuck up.

1215
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,400
Although literally...

1216
01:00:59,400 --> 01:00:59,880
I would say,

1217
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,440
Include and deliver nothing.

1218
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,640
Communicate with your patrons,

1219
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,160
because I talk to my patrons.

1220
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,520
Every week I do a Patreon podcast,

1221
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,840
and whenever I have any thoughts

1222
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,080
about my creative process or things I want to change,

1223
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,040
I'll talk to them,

1224
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,480
because they're the ones who are actually paying for it.

1225
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,360
As far as I'm concerned,

1226
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,720
they're the board of the directors.

1227
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,760
And so I'll keep them in the know,

1228
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,840
but the public can just get what they get.

1229
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,560
They don't need to know.

1230
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,200
They don't need to know.

1231
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,280
Because I feel like the public are the ones

1232
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,400
that are on the fence about you,

1233
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,720
and they're the ones that will bitch the most about anything.

1234
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,360
So I'm just like,

1235
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,840
well, I might as well just keep controversy to the minimum,

1236
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,680
just do what I want to do,

1237
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,800
and deal with,

1238
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,240
put out fires as they come,

1239
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,080
as opposed to lighting the match myself.

1240
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,080
That makes a lot of sense.

1241
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,200
Yeah, that's a good point.

1242
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:40,840
That's a good point.

1243
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:43,960
And I was going to say,

1244
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,160
I'm still disappointed that Ben's idea of the Ben St.

1245
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,920
is creating a Patreon,

1246
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,000
and that idea of just support me

1247
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,680
as I create this Patreon page.

1248
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,600
This Patreon is my magnum opus.

1249
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,760
This will be my legacy.

1250
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,560
Help me create.

1251
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,840
Help me create the greatest Patreon of all time.

1252
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,600
It was just too big brain of an idea.

1253
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,040
It was too smart for the people to latch on to.

1254
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,080
They couldn't comprehend the magic.

1255
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:05,880
Before it's time, unfortunately,

1256
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,960
Jake Paul will get around to it like in 2022,

1257
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,400
and it'll do gang clusters,

1258
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,760
and then we'll all be able to sue.

1259
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,720
And it'll be big.

1260
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,760
They'll call him a genius.

1261
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,400
They'll call him a genius.

1262
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,840
Oh, it's like Tesla.

1263
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,520
It's like the world couldn't handle Tesla

1264
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,720
making more than one world-changing idea at a time.

1265
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,520
It was too big.

1266
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,320
The Vapors, the champion,

1267
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,080
these were already too advanced.

1268
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,120
He was already celebrated,

1269
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,640
but when he attempted to do this,

1270
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,920
it was just a bridge too far.

1271
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,880
The people couldn't handle it.

1272
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,040
As he exposed capitalism

1273
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,560
for the farce that it truly is.

1274
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,760
It could have been great if only.

1275
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,960
Man, it was such a golden idea.

1276
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,320
I don't understand how it didn't take off.

1277
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,040
It's bizarre.

1278
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,320
It just needed better marketing.

1279
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:47,720
That's all it needed.

1280
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,440
Incomprehensible.

1281
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,320
Yeah, yeah.

1282
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,600
It word of mouth.

1283
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,240
If I just got,

1284
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,800
if I could just have gotten one Super Bowl ad

1285
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,760
for my Patreon,

1286
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,680
it would have been different.

1287
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,320
Like when Patreon was relatively new,

1288
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,000
like one dude created like a Patreon,

1289
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,200
like he asked for like $5 to like make a lasagna,

1290
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,640
to like buy, and he ended up making like tens of thousands of dollars

1291
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,840
because people just thought it was funny.

1292
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,480
Potatoes.

1293
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:11,640
No.

1294
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,280
And it wasn't Patreon, it was like Kickstarter.

1295
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,560
It was Kickstarter, yeah.

1296
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,160
Okay, a similar idea though,

1297
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,640
but yes, fair point, fair point.

1298
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,520
Well, Ben should have started a Patreon for potato salad.

1299
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,200
Clearly, that was the missing ingredient.

1300
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:26,840
It's not Keto though.

1301
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,280
Maybe this would have gone over better.

1302
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,680
But people didn't think of it as a recurring donation.

1303
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,560
They thought of it as like,

1304
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,920
what if you made a Kickstarter,

1305
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,240
Ben State is creating a Kickstarter,

1306
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,680
which is this Kickstarter.

1307
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,080
You know, please help me support me in mine.

1308
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,440
Oh, so for the Vapors Volume 3,

1309
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,920
you're going to have a Patreon to fund the Kickstarter

1310
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,720
for the Vapors.

1311
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,040
Then we're going to have the Indiegogo

1312
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,480
to fund the Patreon creation,

1313
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,600
to fund the Kickstarter.

1314
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,320
We're just going to go like multiple levels deep.

1315
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,440
Going to go deep, yeah.

1316
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

1317
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,520
Well, boys and girls,

1318
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,360
I'm ready to go to the voicemails if you are.

1319
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,280
Boys and girls, boys and girls lined up.

1320
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:04,920
I know.

1321
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,360
We don't have to, we don't have to now.

1322
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,360
Much like Nate's content,

1323
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,360
maybe we should just trim the fat and...

1324
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:12,920
Maybe, maybe.

1325
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,720
I mean, it's going to,

1326
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,840
like people are going to hear this

1327
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,320
on the 22nd, I think.

1328
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,800
No, no, no, no, no, 20th.

1329
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,520
No, the 20th.

1330
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:20,920
Yeah, 20th.

1331
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,720
That's right, 20th.

1332
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,760
But this will be the last episode

1333
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,360
before Christmas, everybody.

1334
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,560
Maybe they have shit to do.

1335
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,240
So...

1336
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,920
So yeah, we'll assume they're busy.

1337
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,480
It's okay though,

1338
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,280
because we've got,

1339
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,280
we've got some choice of voicemails lined up today.

1340
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,360
Yeah, they might actually take two hours.

1341
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,720
Won't waste too much of your time.

1342
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,320
You can go back to your families eventually,

1343
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:37,960
I guess.

1344
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,400
You want to do that, gross.

1345
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,200
Precisely, precisely.

1346
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:43,640
Ah, shit.

1347
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,520
Where the fuck did I put the SoundCloud link?

1348
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,080
Okay, there it is.

1349
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,640
Found it, found it.

1350
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,400
All right, all right.

1351
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,440
Let me pull up the...

1352
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,760
Okay, sounds like we're all fine with going to the voicemails.

1353
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,800
Yeah, okay.

1354
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,480
All right, so let me just preface it

1355
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,560
by saying, of course, ladies and gentlemen,

1356
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,320
go click the link down below

1357
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,160
and leave us your voicemails,

1358
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,760
which we will be delighted to hear

1359
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,800
and to separate the wheat from the chaff.

1360
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,520
And if they are good,

1361
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,400
if they are quality,

1362
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,360
if they are supremely glorious,

1363
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,960
we will play them on the show

1364
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,960
as we do as you're about to hear.

1365
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,120
So, okay, we've got our first one here.

1366
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,680
This is from Centerpoint.

1367
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,120
And it's called...

1368
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,040
Oh, actually, it's untitled from Centerpoint.

1369
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,480
Let's just get us started off

1370
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,360
in the right direction

1371
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,120
with whatever he has to say.

1372
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,320
Take it away, CP.

1373
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,560
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1374
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,440
There is just one thing I need

1375
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,040
And I don't care about the Riddler

1376
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,240
Or the weird ass dating sim

1377
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,440
I don't need to wait for Radcon

1378
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,720
Non-existent quick draw streams

1379
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,680
My craft stuff won't make me happy

1380
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,040
Or bonus apps on Christmas Day

1381
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,240
I just want for you to know

1382
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,440
Should've happened a long ago

1383
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,560
Make my wish come true

1384
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,760
All I want for Christmas is...

1385
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,920
Then, huckstable, to join the PCB already.

1386
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,360
Damn it.

1387
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,840
Why don't we have a pie, Pels?

1388
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,120
Why doesn't this guy have one?

1389
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,520
Yeah, he deserves it more than us.

1390
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,240
I mean, great work, Centerpoint.

1391
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,760
Zend's a great guy.

1392
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,400
What can I say?

1393
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,120
Maybe we'll make your Christmas wish come true.

1394
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:36,680
Who can say?

1395
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,000
All right, never.

1396
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,720
No, fuck that guy.

1397
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,840
No, fuck that guy.

1398
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,560
No, he's can't.

1399
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,840
We're canceling each other.

1400
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,560
That's all there is to it.

1401
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,080
That's my plan for the holidays.

1402
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,040
All right, let's move on.

1403
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:50,840
We've got another one.

1404
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,560
Oh, this is called Yes, I Am Sick.

1405
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,480
That's Why My Voice Sucks.

1406
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,280
Let's see if the prophecy is true.

1407
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:00,680
Hey, fuckheads.

1408
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,120
I'm asking for a dick tip.

1409
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,680
So, as soon as you have spent the past couple of months

1410
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,040
bashing in the Chad lifestyle,

1411
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,440
getting confident and charismatic in the whole shebang,

1412
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,720
and has realized how shitty every single person on this earth is,

1413
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,520
how exactly do I go about finding the coveted GF?

1414
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,640
But what I understand,

1415
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,680
all you guys found your significant others by making content

1416
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,160
but as someone who is both a high school sophomore

1417
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,360
and has absolutely no creative energies whatsoever,

1418
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,080
where exactly do I go to seek out my fellow autists?

1419
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,600
All my communities are great and all,

1420
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,200
but I'd hate to find the apple of my eye

1421
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,760
just to find out that she lives in fucking Wyoming or something.

1422
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,320
You're in fucking school, dude.

1423
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,240
That's where you fucking do it, you nerd.

1424
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,080
You go to school with a group of your peers.

1425
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,280
Yeah.

1426
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:42,760
I mean, that's the answer.

1427
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,480
That's the answer.

1428
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,800
That's the basket to draw from.

1429
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,200
I mean, okay, he's saying like I don't have...

1430
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,120
He wants like a gamer girlfriend, you know?

1431
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,640
He wants like a fellow interested...

1432
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,280
You said that?

1433
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,200
He said something like that.

1434
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,360
He said he wanted a fellow autist.

1435
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,040
Right.

1436
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,680
There you go.

1437
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,720
So he's looking for...

1438
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,800
Maybe he goes to school with a bunch of Stacey's,

1439
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,680
a bunch of Veronica's.

1440
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,800
We'll just go to Anime Club with Carl Ackersenville and his brother.

1441
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,040
True.

1442
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,360
I mean, okay, look, he says the thing in here

1443
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,400
about like, you guys will guide it through making content.

1444
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,120
Okay, okay.

1445
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,200
It's the wrong lens to think that like,

1446
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,240
oh, the PCB made a podcast and got girlfriends.

1447
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,920
I mean, for some of us, that's true.

1448
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,880
For me, that is true.

1449
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,760
But like, it's not that simple.

1450
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:28,120
It's what did I actually do in order to like get a girlfriend?

1451
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,000
I did whatever the fuck I wanted to do.

1452
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,040
I slowly acquired skills at it over years,

1453
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,160
and I encountered various people while doing so.

1454
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,880
So it's not about being a content creator.

1455
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,160
It's about doing stuff that you want to do

1456
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,120
and like being open to meeting people while doing so.

1457
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,120
It's about having some skill that is impressive.

1458
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,880
It doesn't have to be a podcast.

1459
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,760
Even if that skill...

1460
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,440
I would even argue that doing a podcast

1461
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,200
is probably on the lower end of the bell curve

1462
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:58,920
in terms of impressive skills.

1463
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,280
It's one of the worst ways.

1464
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,120
It's the opposite of what you should do.

1465
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,280
Because exactly as you said, it's like,

1466
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,720
oh, you'll meet a girl from like a million,

1467
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,080
my girlfriend was from Hawaii.

1468
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,400
We had to like date for a while and then decide to move.

1469
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,040
So like that was, you know, like ideally,

1470
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,360
the thing to do is meet people around you.

1471
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,760
This whole idea of meeting people online from far away

1472
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,800
is so retarded.

1473
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,680
Leave the house and go talk to people in real life.

1474
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,720
That first of all,

1475
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,960
that's how you meet people directly around you.

1476
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,480
So you don't have to do all that bullshit.

1477
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:29,160
And it's how you like acquire socialization skills anyway.

1478
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,440
So it's just obviously, okay, you're in school,

1479
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,240
like nut up and talk to the girls in your class.

1480
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,920
Because this other thing he says about like,

1481
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,440
ah, I want to meet a gamer girl.

1482
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,600
I want to meet a girl who's like me.

1483
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,080
Like they're probably our girls in your school,

1484
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,080
in your class who, oh my God,

1485
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,640
could you imagine a girl liking anime,

1486
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,480
but not talking about it excessively

1487
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,040
or like wearing anime shirts to school every day.

1488
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,880
So like you have to kind of get to know her first

1489
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,240
in order to find that out.

1490
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,760
No, it could possibly be true.

1491
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,200
So, you know, just like talk to people

1492
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,880
and meet them and get to know them.

1493
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,720
Talk to people and improve yourself

1494
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,160
in whatever way you can.

1495
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,720
Just go up to all the girls in the school and say,

1496
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,920
hey, do you like anime?

1497
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,720
Unironically, yes, unironically.

1498
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,080
Or pull the Spider-Man, put the hand on shoulder,

1499
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,520
sexual assault and say, hey, that's the way.

1500
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,440
It worked for, it worked for-

1501
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,200
This is not related to anything,

1502
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,600
but I just, for the first time,

1503
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,000
I've seen what Vivzi Pop looks like.

1504
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,880
Just, I don't know what she looks like.

1505
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,600
She looks like exact, she is the,

1506
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,760
the platonic ideal of a white girl who fucks dogs.

1507
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,080
What?

1508
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,680
She looks exactly like that.

1509
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,960
I need proof.

1510
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,000
If you don't remember who this is, everybody.

1511
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,280
That's a big claim, Ben.

1512
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:50,840
The big claim.

1513
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,200
She may have been a hotel.

1514
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,720
Yes, yes, yes.

1515
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,520
Other things too.

1516
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,160
Among other things.

1517
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,200
Ben, I'm waiting for this image.

1518
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,080
Law and animation.

1519
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,920
I guess I'll screenshot it.

1520
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,760
Yes, please do.

1521
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,280
We will pause and wait for this update.

1522
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,400
Here we go.

1523
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,080
There she is.

1524
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,360
Yeah.

1525
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,160
Yeah, you know.

1526
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,400
You can picture it, right?

1527
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,120
I sure can.

1528
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,480
Absolutely.

1529
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,400
No, just think about it.

1530
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,960
Just really rattle that one around in the old brain dome.

1531
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,040
Speaking of Vivzi Pop, right before the podcast,

1532
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,600
she was tweeting, had a big tweet thread about complaining

1533
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,960
about how people give her shit.

1534
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,040
Vivzi Pop, stop.

1535
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,720
Stop publicly acknowledging it.

1536
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,840
It just makes it worse.

1537
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,720
You're just drawing attention to yourself.

1538
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,480
It kind of makes you look like a fucking idiot.

1539
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,440
Tweets like that are a lightning rod for controversy.

1540
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,960
Just don't acknowledge it.

1541
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,760
I know it feels good to have people by the thousands

1542
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,760
flooding your replies saying how good you are.

1543
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,400
But your long term, you're just making the problem worse.

1544
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,840
Please just make more content

1545
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,560
and focus on the people who resonate with it.

1546
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,480
You're absolutely right, Tom.

1547
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,360
Although it's the wrong thing.

1548
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,800
I mean, she said in there,

1549
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,440
I don't usually talk about personal stuff on her Twitter.

1550
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,560
I don't know if I totally believe that.

1551
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,040
Seems like she talks about some personal stuff on there

1552
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:04,840
pretty frequently.

1553
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,640
But, I mean, oh my God, I saw, okay,

1554
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,680
you know what, I won't even get into it.

1555
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:15,400
But I understand the desire to vent

1556
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,920
on a social media platform

1557
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,240
where people can respond to you in real time.

1558
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,560
My God, what a technological wonderland we live in.

1559
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,800
But it's-

1560
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,240
You don't vent in public.

1561
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,280
Vent to your friends.

1562
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,120
Vent in your discord with your friends.

1563
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,400
You are correct.

1564
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:29,960
I saw-

1565
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,560
Keep it out of the public eye.

1566
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,800
I saw Patricia Taksin on Twitter just being like,

1567
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,320
guys, I'm so depressed.

1568
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,440
I hate myself.

1569
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,160
And I just was like, ugh, bad luck.

1570
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,200
You know, I just-

1571
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,000
On a larger scale, this like depression meme-

1572
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,640
Love, love, love her stuff, like her videos.

1573
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,480
But I saw that Twitter and I was like, man,

1574
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,600
I almost want to say like, please stop.

1575
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,720
But I feel like it would be perceived as an attack

1576
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,840
and I don't want to be that guy.

1577
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,640
It would.

1578
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,520
It certainly would.

1579
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,520
You need to leave that to the meme boys.

1580
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,200
I mean, the person making a tweet like that

1581
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,680
is clearly already in a troubled headspace

1582
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,360
and so they're probably not the most open

1583
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,520
to constructive criticism at that point.

1584
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,320
Yeah, exactly.

1585
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:09,960
Yeah.

1586
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,400
But you know, the thing is not to be an asshole about it,

1587
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,040
but like, isn't this just a cry for attention

1588
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:16,360
at the end of the day?

1589
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,720
Well, that's the whole thing, right?

1590
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,360
Is that like that?

1591
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,960
Because even if it's not,

1592
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,960
even if you're legitimately just frustrated

1593
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,640
and trying to just like vent,

1594
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,080
people, the people who you are complaining about

1595
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,040
will see that tweet as a plea for attention

1596
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,680
and double down on their negative opinion of you.

1597
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,840
So you're doing yourself no favors.

1598
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,640
This is why you got to play things close to the chest, people.

1599
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,840
Don't let them know what you're thinking.

1600
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,880
Don't let them feel, I mean, see.

1601
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,520
Don't let them see that you are sad.

1602
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:49,880
Talk less, smile more, don't let them know

1603
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,400
what you're against or what you're full of.

1604
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,400
I was literally going to say Aaron Burr

1605
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,040
is the good role model for these things.

1606
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,640
Oh, don't let them see.

1607
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,720
Oh, you know, just about Visipop in general, though.

1608
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,120
You know, I haven't been following it too much,

1609
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,880
but it sounds like with Hasman Hotel,

1610
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,040
if I understand it correctly,

1611
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,440
I think she's getting shit on mostly from people

1612
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,760
who like find her jokes like distasteful

1613
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,520
or not politically correct.

1614
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,320
Is that true?

1615
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,160
That is some of that, yeah.

1616
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:17,800
Isn't that true?

1617
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,920
There's a lot of people

1618
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,880
trashing her for her past since, so to speak,

1619
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,160
but like she's apologized for those, I think, and she made up.

1620
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,920
Don't apologize, you don't owe me an apology.

1621
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,400
Sometimes you do things that should be apologized for.

1622
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,040
Well, if she doesn't stand by her statements anymore,

1623
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,120
like those statements were made like seven years ago

1624
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,400
and she says that she doesn't stand by them anymore,

1625
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,200
so I don't know why people keep giving her shit.

1626
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,440
She used to say, stay strong, sister.

1627
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:48,280
I don't like potatoes and all the potato fags came out.

1628
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,240
The problem.

1629
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,760
All the Irish were real pissed at that one.

1630
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,040
Visipop is at the point now where she is popular enough

1631
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:58,120
that people are gonna take pride in punching up at her.

1632
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,840
This controversy is never going to go away.

1633
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,200
You are never going to be forgiven

1634
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,360
by this contingent and this kind of person.

1635
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,200
So just stop acknowledging it.

1636
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,520
You're big enough now that you have a huge amount of people

1637
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,720
who genuinely like your work.

1638
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,240
Focus on that.

1639
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,200
There is no reason to get bogged down in minor controversy.

1640
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,640
You're absolutely right.

1641
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,520
When you get to a certain point, you'll always have haters.

1642
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,800
This will never stop being a thing

1643
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,160
and you can't apologize it away or whatever.

1644
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,800
I haven't followed her career very closely,

1645
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,560
but it seems like what the release of Has been,

1646
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,800
she kind of was like, again, to give her credit,

1647
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:32,840
I know she worked really hard on it,

1648
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,160
but it's like a poor guy who wins the lottery

1649
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,440
and is suddenly rich and is now surrounded by people

1650
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,520
who want a piece or want to tear him down.

1651
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,520
I mean, this isn't her first big project.

1652
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,280
I mean, it's the biggest project she's done,

1653
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,640
but it's not the first thing she's done

1654
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,640
that's garnered a lot of attention.

1655
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:51,480
Like back in 2013, 2014, that Kesha animation she did,

1656
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,120
did gangbusters, had millions of views.

1657
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:58,040
So she's no stranger to a successful project.

1658
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,320
I see.

1659
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,200
Well, you know what?

1660
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,800
On that front, it might be more of maybe

1661
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,800
a semi-cultural divide sort of thing,

1662
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,320
because not to get into the issue or anything.

1663
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,040
Here's my thing.

1664
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,160
Just not to cut you off,

1665
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,960
but I think the problem is that we already know

1666
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:10,920
that this is a personal project for her.

1667
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,000
50 million views on that thing.

1668
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,640
Holy shit.

1669
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:13,880
Yeah.

1670
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,160
Holy shit.

1671
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,560
But the thing is this has her OCs in it,

1672
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,160
this is her personal project.

1673
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:24,360
So I'm sure every detraction stings a lot more than like,

1674
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,680
oh, you didn't like my Kesha animation, whatever.

1675
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:31,160
Clearly, this is a much more like a personal stemming

1676
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,520
from the heart kind of thing,

1677
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,560
but that doesn't change the fact

1678
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,000
that you're still doing yourself no favors

1679
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,960
by complaining about it.

1680
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,760
You're pragmatically speaking, you're absolutely right.

1681
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,240
But it just reminds me of like, for example,

1682
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,520
and again, not to open up the can of worms,

1683
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,360
I just want to say that on the substance of the issue,

1684
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:50,040
like when Vic Minyana was having his court case

1685
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,920
and was being called a predator and all those things,

1686
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,600
again, I don't care if it's true or not, not the issue.

1687
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:59,480
But the point is that when the depositions were happening

1688
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,400
and they asked Vic, the thing is,

1689
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,160
Vic had made no public statements whatsoever

1690
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,640
about all these accusations that he was like,

1691
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,760
I mean, some people called him a pedophile, a rapist,

1692
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,400
and even though those things are definitely exaggerated,

1693
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:17,960
but it was the fact that he's definitely over 50.

1694
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,400
He's of an older generation.

1695
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,640
His approach was like, I'm just not going to talk about it.

1696
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,080
Like, I will talk to my lawyer.

1697
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,920
I'll let them sort this thing out.

1698
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,400
Whereas nowadays, I think with our generation

1699
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,880
and beyond and stuff, our instinct is like,

1700
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,960
I'm just going to go to Twitter and get the people on my side.

1701
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,360
Yeah, and I just don't think that's always the best move.

1702
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,560
Yeah, but there's really no winning

1703
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,040
because a lot of people say, oh,

1704
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,720
then this person kept silent.

1705
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,840
Why would you be silent?

1706
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:45,880
Sounds suspicious.

1707
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,480
Well, that's exactly my point.

1708
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,360
Well, that's my entire point.

1709
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,520
That's what Pro Jarrod did, and it worked out for him.

1710
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,600
Eventually, with his...

1711
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,920
Yeah, I mean, for a while, everyone was like,

1712
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,440
oh, he's not saying anything.

1713
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,800
He's guilty of non-crimes.

1714
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,280
He had a statement, but then people ripped it apart

1715
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,720
and he didn't follow it up.

1716
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,320
He made a pretty shit statement.

1717
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,600
Yeah, but he just...

1718
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,000
That's true.

1719
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,240
He talked to his lawyer.

1720
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,640
He literally said, with style and brakes,

1721
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,760
you don't give yourself any rope to hang yourself with.

1722
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,000
He literally said in that statement,

1723
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,040
I hope, first, to exit this marriage with style and grace,

1724
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,080
which is a funky, a lanky con quote,

1725
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,520
which I assume was unintentional.

1726
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,360
I don't think he said style and grace.

1727
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,080
I'm telling you, Ben, he said style and grace.

1728
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,520
That's the word to use.

1729
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,160
No, he did not say style and grace.

1730
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,360
That's insanity.

1731
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:34,920
It's impossible.

1732
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,880
Someone verified.

1733
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,680
Someone in the comments will tell us who's wrong, who's right.

1734
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,000
And to think, we got onto the full tangent

1735
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,640
by acknowledging style and flair, just like the nanny.

1736
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,800
Not like lanky con at all.

1737
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,000
Very distinct.

1738
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,520
And to think that we got onto this whole tangent

1739
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,960
by acknowledging the reality

1740
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,720
that Vizipop does, in fact, fuck dogs.

1741
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,200
Yeah, well, you know.

1742
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:54,840
Fascinating.

1743
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:55,800
It's a fascinating term.

1744
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,520
Just look at her.

1745
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,960
You know she can see it in her eyes.

1746
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,240
You know, bro.

1747
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,280
That's so nice.

1748
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,360
You can see it in her eyes and in her...

1749
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,400
Yes, it's not a value judgment.

1750
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,280
It's neutral.

1751
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,920
It's not bad or good that Vizipop obviously

1752
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,000
is a white girl who fucks Donna.

1753
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,400
All cultures are equally beautiful.

1754
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,360
It's just a fact.

1755
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:15,320
All right.

1756
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,960
Well, anyway, let's move on to our next voicemail, shall we?

1757
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,400
This one is from...

1758
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,040
Let me see.

1759
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,720
Oh, it's a Coomers Rise Up is our title.

1760
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,200
Let's hear what they have to say for themselves.

1761
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:26,760
Go.

1762
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,440
There was this guy last week talking

1763
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,360
about how he has so much willpower

1764
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,360
because he did know not November.

1765
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,480
Well, I was a proud Coomer.

1766
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,720
I just want to say that I have coomed

1767
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,400
every fucking day of my life

1768
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,160
because I'm not a little bitch.

1769
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,680
I have so much willpower

1770
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,560
that I'm constantly cooming nonstop.

1771
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,600
I have a hashtag not never, never

1772
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,440
because I'm never not nutty.

1773
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,840
You're a little bitch and a little bitch.

1774
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:53,320
And as Endless Jess would say, a little bitch.

1775
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,160
He would say that.

1776
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:55,320
He would.

1777
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:57,960
Well...

1778
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,400
You do your people a service.

1779
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,040
What do we make of this?

1780
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,000
With your advocacy.

1781
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:02,840
Makes sense to me.

1782
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,720
I'm convinced.

1783
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,520
You can support.

1784
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,400
I guess.

1785
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:05,960
Yeah.

1786
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:06,680
Hard support.

1787
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,280
It's, it's...

1788
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:08,680
Coomer's...

1789
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,440
Proud of, proud of your boy.

1790
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,480
I'm so proud of my Coomer boy.

1791
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:15,720
All right.

1792
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,560
Well, obviously he's won us all over.

1793
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,400
Voice Grail, we'll come back to that later.

1794
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:19,720
All right.

1795
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:23,320
Let's go to our next one, which is the Muppet Hater.

1796
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:23,560
Right.

1797
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:23,800
Okay.

1798
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,560
The Muppet Hater is calling in.

1799
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,240
What do you have to say?

1800
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:27,880
Let's find out.

1801
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,520
Brothers, I have one question to ask you.

1802
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,400
When you guide your thumbs down the queues

1803
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,080
of your selection of YouTube videos

1804
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,680
that you can spend your time watching

1805
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,040
in the most skillful and masterful and expert way possible.

1806
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:42,280
Right.

1807
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:42,760
Right.

1808
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,160
That's it.

1809
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:48,040
How do we keep falling for Arlo fucking videos?

1810
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,320
How many times am I going to let this blue motherfucker tell me

1811
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,800
that I want more Paper Mario?

1812
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,080
When ain't no more Paper Mario coming down the fucking pipeline

1813
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,360
and tell me how he's won.

1814
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:04,280
But Pikmin 4, when ain't no goddamn Pikmin 4

1815
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,480
in a billion years.

1816
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,840
How long are we going to put up with this bullshit?

1817
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,520
It's been since 2013.

1818
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:14,200
How long are we going to let this blue puppet dictate our lives?

1819
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,400
Rise up.

1820
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,120
Get away with it.

1821
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:16,840
Rise up.

1822
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,920
Well, listen, the problem, the problem is you hit the three buttons,

1823
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,480
the three dots, and then say, don't recommend this channel.

1824
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,680
And then it goes away.

1825
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,800
Arlo, it's the only way.

1826
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,000
Arlo called me a great Keto pizza crust recipe.

1827
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:29,960
So I can't hate it.

1828
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:30,680
I can't hate him.

1829
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,280
It's I can't do it.

1830
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,960
Well, I have no choice but to stand.

1831
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:45,800
You know, I think I might just figure out how to make a puppet puppet of my own.

1832
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,840
But Red Man.

1833
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:50,760
So Red Man will fight Arlo as being the red guy.

1834
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,080
And he'll be like, oh, I like video games.

1835
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:53,720
Duh.

1836
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,080
Fuck you, idiot.

1837
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,920
I hate video games.

1838
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,760
I unironically endorse this opinion.

1839
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,560
Can you please make a YouTube channel for Red Man?

1840
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,120
Red Man has to review video games.

1841
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,520
Red Man has a channel where he reviews video games.

1842
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,280
He reviewed Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu.

1843
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,080
Remember that?

1844
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,120
Oh, yeah.

1845
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:12,600
Oh my god.

1846
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,720
Can you get the link to that?

1847
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,680
Because I forget about that.

1848
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,440
I think I type in Red Man into Google.

1849
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:29,560
Can Red Man review the classic Showa Tokusatsu series called Red Man?

1850
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,080
Um.

1851
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,360
That does sound like a winner.

1852
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:32,920
Yeah, maybe.

1853
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:38,440
Wait, there is a channel called Red Man who has a video called Pokemon Facts,

1854
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:43,080
OSM Fact Galaxy, Red Fact One, Factor Red Man.

1855
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,760
How many fucking facts?

1856
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,360
I don't know what that is, but that sounds awesome as well.

1857
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:49,640
Link that back.

1858
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,520
Guys, look at this.

1859
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,080
What the fuck is this?

1860
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,280
This is incredible.

1861
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,960
Okay, I love this.

1862
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,400
Post the damn.

1863
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,440
Okay, here it is.

1864
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,000
Like Pokemon, like actually watch this.

1865
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,760
Actually watch this fucking video.

1866
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,520
Holy shit.

1867
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,000
Oh god.

1868
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,840
Oh, that's not English.

1869
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:09,400
Not a fan.

1870
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,040
Definitely not.

1871
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,640
Oh my god.

1872
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,360
I got a collab.

1873
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,560
We got a collab, by the way.

1874
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,680
You have to collab.

1875
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,800
This is this is Red Red Man reviews Pokemon Let's Go.

1876
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,320
Okay.

1877
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:19,800
Excellent.

1878
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,480
That legendary icon I haven't seen in so long.

1879
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,480
I forgot about this.

1880
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,560
These facts do not have anything to do with Pokemon, by the way.

1881
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,840
Why is there a guy with a pin stuck in his collar,

1882
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,920
like pointing directly at his jugular vein?

1883
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:35,960
What is the fact?

1884
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:36,920
Why are these red facts?

1885
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,520
Is this like a blood fact or something?

1886
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:39,800
What is this?

1887
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:40,280
Oh god.

1888
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,400
This makes me so happy.

1889
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:43,880
Okay.

1890
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,280
Okay, please collab the two Red Men.

1891
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,200
I don't appreciate it very much.

1892
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,560
Sorry, I've never made a video.

1893
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:57,240
All right, go watch these incredible videos, everybody.

1894
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:57,880
Red Man's so funny.

1895
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,680
You won't regret it.

1896
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,320
Is he just gradually getting wide?

1897
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,400
It's the simple things.

1898
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,720
All right, let's next voicemail.

1899
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,040
Let's go.

1900
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:12,760
We got a couple more.

1901
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,560
All right, guys, I'm proud to announce that people at home watch.

1902
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,800
I mean, definitely watch Red Reviews,

1903
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:24,440
but also please watch Red Facts with Pokemon Facts with Red Man,

1904
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,920
Red Fact 1, OSM Fact Galaxy.

1905
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,160
Wait, wait, look at the description.

1906
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,960
Red Man, some sort of Arabic or whatever.

1907
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,440
Welcome to Red Man Channel, also Red Man here.

1908
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,880
Red Scribe here.

1909
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,760
You got to Red Scribe, everybody.

1910
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,960
Everyone at Red Scribe, and he links to a channel that does not exist.

1911
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,320
Damn.

1912
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:51,160
This was posted like a month ago.

1913
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,280
This is like new.

1914
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,800
Oh my god, is it based on the lore?

1915
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,520
Is it based?

1916
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,520
Oh, it's based on the lore.

1917
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,120
It's based for no doubt.

1918
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,160
Oh, it has one like?

1919
01:24:59,160 --> 01:24:59,720
Well, guess what?

1920
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,000
Now it's got two, baby.

1921
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,720
Let's see how high we can get that.

1922
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,120
Let's encourage him to make more.

1923
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,360
All right, voicemail.

1924
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,320
As I was saying, I'm happy to announce the end of an arc, guys.

1925
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,680
It is the voicemail god final voicemail.

1926
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:18,760
At long last, we can wrap this up and move on with our lives.

1927
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,440
Let's hear what he has to say.

1928
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:20,760
Go.

1929
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:21,880
Hey, what's up, PCP?

1930
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,640
It's your voicemail god here to explain myself.

1931
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,920
So basically the whole premise of this thing,

1932
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,200
it wasn't just to randomly, oh, guess who I am?

1933
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,440
I was supposed to give you hints each week.

1934
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,720
That was the plan, at least.

1935
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,320
Maybe you guys forgot or whatever.

1936
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:37,720
It's fine.

1937
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,600
Doesn't matter.

1938
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,400
Anyways, by the time you listen to this,

1939
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,080
Nate will know who the voicemail god is.

1940
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,080
So I figured I would get the cat out of the bag.

1941
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,520
Voicemail god is me.

1942
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,920
It's Sean, S-E-A-N.

1943
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,080
Nate, obviously, I think you know me by now.

1944
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,280
Of course, everyone's favorite.

1945
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,360
Ben, I always show up to your screens

1946
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,680
and ask how today's episode of PCP was.

1947
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,000
And maybe you can hit the bell.

1948
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,720
What a revelation.

1949
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:02,440
I know this guy.

1950
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:03,960
You know, pretty epic.

1951
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:04,200
Yeah.

1952
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,680
Anyways, I figured.

1953
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,160
See, that's the thing.

1954
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:07,400
He's a viewer.

1955
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,560
What better way to send this shit out?

1956
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,600
A real viewer?

1957
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:15,320
I'm all my voicemails over the past 23 episodes.

1958
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:15,800
Sounds good.

1959
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,280
So, I hope you're ready.

1960
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,960
Here we go.

1961
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,560
On Ironic Gang, we guide the OG.

Dictator Nate.

1971
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,160
How the fuck you pronounce?

1972
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,280
PCP Shoutout, Cup and Master.

1973
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:30,680
Pick the number.

1974
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,560
Pression on it, Shrager.

1975
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,400
On Ironic Gang, we guide part one, part two.

1976
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,200

1977

Part one slash two.

1983

Fate Chip.

1984
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:40,760
Calling on Ben St.

1985
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,480

01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,120
Eager of voicemail god redemption.

1988
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,800
And hopefully this voicemail.

1989
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,200
Thank you, guys.

1990
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,040
Thank you.

1991
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:50,600
Thank you.

1992
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:51,560
You're welcome.

1993
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:51,960
Thank you.

1994
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,800
That's a lot of voicemails.

1995
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,560
That's a lot of voicemails.

1996
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,280
He did it.

1997
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:02,040
That's a lot of great memories made over these 23 weeks.

1998
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,440
It's sad to see the finale, but everyone, I'm happy to announce.

1999
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,400
By donating.

2000
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,680
Oh, Ben, you didn't see it.

2001
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,360
Yesterday, there was an intense bidding war in the Nuzlocke for the name of my rival,

2002
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,040
the Ben St. Socialism Boys.

2003
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,240
We're going hard to try to get the rival named Ben St.

2004
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,320
But alas, capitalism went out.

2005
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:27,960
By donating over 100 of his own dollars, the voicemail god has become the rival in the heart gold.

2006
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:28,840
Fuck you, buddy.

2007
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:29,960
He went ham, man.

2008
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,120
He's so gay.

2009
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,440
That's fucking gay as hell.

2010
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,200
And I'm not going to take it anymore.

2011
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,440
Oh, but you'll be happy to know, Ben, that because you were the next donation down,

2012
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:42,760
Ben St. has become a lowly hoot-hoot who will almost surely be boxed instantly.

2013
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:46,600
That's so bad and dumb, and it would have been way better for me to be the rival.

2014
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,880
And I hate you, Sean.

2015
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,960
Don't ever fucking come around here anymore.

2016
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,120
Don't underestimate hoot-hoots, though.

2017
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,880
They can, like, hypnosis.

2018
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,080
They can toot-toot.

2019
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:55,640
That's true.

2020
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,920
Oh, they can, dude, every time.

2021
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,360
Yeah, he can hypnosis.

2022
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:02,600
Dude, have Ben St. the hoot-hoot use hypnosis to fucking cheese your way through every battle.

2023
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:03,720
Perhaps I will.

2024
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,560
Just keep doing it until he dies.

2025
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,440
Just go hard.

2026
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,040
That's okay.

2027
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:12,120
We've got the endorsement, kill Ben St. the hoot-hoot understood.

2028
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:12,520
We'll do.

2029
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,960
Do not switch him out under any circumstances.

2030
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:18,440
Let me see.

2031
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,800
We've got another one here.

2032
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,640
Ah, this one's in keeping with the season as well.

2033
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:25,640
This is a very procrastinated Christmas.

2034
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,440
Oh, I'm excited.

2035
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,800
Okay, and go.

2036
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,160
It's 2018 Christmas.

2037
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:35,000
Okay, before I start, Ben, you're going to have to leave the room.

2038
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,040
Trust me on this.

2039
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:36,920
It's for your own good.

2040
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,720
Should I actually?

2041
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,520
Of course.

2042
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,320
Uh, no.

2043
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,120
Okay.

2044
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,560
Pretend that you did.

2045
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,640
Okay, guys, Christmas is right around the corner,

2046
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,400
and we all got to talk about Ben's gift.

2047
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:49,720
So what's going to happen is tomorrow we're going to do the Communist Revolution.

2048
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:54,360
We're going to keep it way on the down low so Ben doesn't find out.

2049
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,800
And then on Christmas morning, we'll be doing our usual Christmas tradition,

2050
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:03,320
you know, watching End of A. Vangelion and our PJs and drinking our eggnog flavor fuel,

2051
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,560
keto cinnamon rolls.

2052
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,040
This time when the song is playing,

2053
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,960
well, I'll turn to Ben and did you say,

2054
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,960
hey, Ben, you know what else came tumbling down over the weekend?

2055
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,080
And Ben'll be all confused and go like, what?

2056
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,200
And then Nate, smiling big, will say,

2057
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,200
capitalism, bro.

2058
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,280
Merry Christmas.

2059
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,200
Merry Christmas, Ben's saying.

2060
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:26,920
Shade of black.

2061
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,560
Hey, Ben, you're good to come back in now.

2062
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,880
God bless us.

2063
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,240
Okay, well then later, guys.

2064
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,720
Let's make this a good one.

2065
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,560
Happy holidays.

2066
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,760
Happy Christmas.

2067
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,200
Happy Kwanzaa.

2068
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,600
I won't tell anyone that I heard it all.

2069
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,280
I'm just going to be sitting there on Christmas morning.

2070
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:51,080
I'm just going to be like smugly looking at the chimney like, oh yeah, I totally don't know.

2071
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,320
There's an extra present waiting for me.

2072
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:57,320
It's the fucking end of fight club out the window right now.

2073
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:02,280
I was going to say, yeah, we open the door and the financial institutions are collapsing one by one.

2074
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,800
What a wonderful, heartwarming time that'll be.

2075
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,160
I can't wait for Karl Marx to come down our chimney in his traditional red.

2076
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,200
Oh, it's going to be beautiful.

2077
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,520
Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much what it would be like.

2078
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,400
That's pretty much it.

2079
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:17,560
Sweet Communist, the Communist daughter.

2080
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,080
Who knew that Santa Claus was Karl Marx the whole time?

2081
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,720
I suspected it, but I never had the courage.

2082
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:26,520
We all in our hearts, we knew all along.

2083
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,600
He does take from no one and gives to everyone.

2084
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,320
According to their needs.

2085
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,600
According to their $1,000 dividend.

2086
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,680
Yeah, yeah, according to Yum.

2087
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:44,280
All right, I would like to start a potential new segment of the PCP.

2088
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,320
This is a trial run.

2089
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:45,560
Okay.

2090
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:50,840
It's called the cool drawing that I post on Twitter this week.

2091
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:51,880
Okay.

2092
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:52,440
Oh, good.

2093
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,000
Yeah.

2094
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,240
Sure.

2095
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:54,680
Sure.

2096
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,320
Oh, I saw this.

2097
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:55,960
I like this.

2098
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,080
It was looking excellent.

2099
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,800
Pump is particularly aesthetic and I dig it.

2100
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:00,040
Yes.

2101
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,800
Oh, I like the last one.

2102
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,960
What's the Cowboy's name, the girl?

2103
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:04,520
Clarissa.

2104
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:05,800
Clarissa.

2105
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,280
She's going to explain it all via bullets.

2106
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,240
That's going to be great.

2107
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,120
What's the last one?

2108
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,960
Oh, that's a dead guy.

2109
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:14,840
My favorite.

2110
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,680
It gives me like Samurai Jack vibes.

2111
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,720
I like it.

2112
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,640
Yeah, he's very much one of those kinds.

2113
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,680
His leg looks a lot like that.

2114
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,680
I was just sort of doodling and it was like,

2115
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,400
hey, you know what?

2116
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,440
I can doodle now.

2117
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:27,080
It's like a skill I have and it's good.

2118
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,760
Hmm.

2119
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:31,480
I mentioned pump is very vulnerable to that rain.

2120
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,920
So keep that hood on, sis.

2121
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,080
Don't want to die yet again.

2122
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,240
An alley-oop with that football.

2123
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,360
She's going to alley-oop that.

2124
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,720
Definitely for the touchdown.

2125
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,160
Can't wait.

2126
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:41,880
Can't wait.

2127
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,400
It looks like a big smile, but I know it's not.

2128
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,800
It's like it's the thing with the helmet, right?

2129
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,720
Oh, it's like a weird big smile with big thick lips.

2130
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,000
Oh, don't make me think about that.

2131
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,320
Don't make me consider that possibility.

2132
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,640
All right, next voicemail.

2133
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,200
I thought that was the end of the voicemails.

2134
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,880
I was going to do the segment afterwards.

2135
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,720
We have two more as it happens.

2136
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,360
This one is, what is this?

2137
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:06,760
Oh, okay.

2138
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:10,280
So this guy, this is the true chronicles of an American hero.

2139
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,480
And this is a good one.

2140
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,880
He had left three, but I thought this was the best one,

2141
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:14,840
episode one.

2142
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,040
And you could leave one next time,

2143
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,880
but three in a row would be too many for one episode.

2144
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,840
So feel free to leave more, but only one this time.

2145
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:24,360
Okay, two chronicles of an American hero, episode one, commence.

2146
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:26,920
It's Friday night.

2147
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,880
I'm chilling upstairs in my man cave

2148
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,280
as the red-pilled mctaug icon I am.

2149
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,880
Listening to my favorite group of sexy twinks

2150
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,600
talking their alt-right podcast, the PCP.

2151
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:44,840
Suddenly I hear a noise, like the screams of two Palestinian

2152
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:48,200
children as Gal Gadot stands over their broken thoughts.

2153
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:53,000
I zoom down the stairs and find a masked man

2154
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,440
dressed somewhere in between a pimp and a civil war reenactor

2155
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:57,960
led pipe in hand.

2156
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:00,360
He's broken through my door and is coming for me,

2157
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,840
but I have a trick up my sleeve.

2158
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,600
I pull out my trusty slap bracelet.

2159
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,960
I keep in my underwear at all times and slice open his neck,

2160
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:10,600
the blood covering the entire neighborhood.

2161
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,880
While I'm going through his wallet after I absorbed his experience

2162
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,120
points of cocaine, I find his address.

2163
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,760
I put those crack perk points in the stealth

2164
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,480
and bomb over to his house where his mom is waiting.

2165
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,760
She tries to seduce me when she sees my striking masculine form,

2166
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,120
but I say the gamer word of power in the entire house

2167
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,720
is wiped out of existence.

2168
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,920
Reduce the rubble that smells like a mixture of sweat and broccoli,

2169
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,200
because then I return home and finish my podcast

2170
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,760
like a true American hero.

2171
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:41,400
All right.

2172
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:44,200
A true text of heroism.

2173
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,520
And that's America in a nutshell.

2174
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,880
That's a way to go, dude.

2175
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,040
That's a proud of your boy.

2176
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,000
The only thing that would have made that better

2177
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,160
is if he donated to the patron.com slash PCP,

2178
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,280
I mean, the procrastination.

2179
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,600
Hey, once that American podcast is done,

2180
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,120
why not sit back with some good old fashioned Minecraft?

2181
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,840
Indeed, patron.com slash PCP Minecraft, everybody.

2182
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,600
We can accommodate that need.

2183
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,320
Naturally, naturally.

2184
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,680
Well, leave more because that was great,

2185
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:15,960
but make them good or I will not play them.

2186
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,440
Okay, anyway, we've got one more.

2187
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,080
Now, okay.

2188
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,160
Now, this may sound redundant to everybody.

2189
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,760
So this is from a guy named Tom.

2190
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,400
This is from Tom.

2191
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,360
That's pretty redundant.

2192
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,000
I don't think we need another one.

2193
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:25,960
It's pretty redundant.

2194
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,000
Yeah, one's enough.

2195
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:31,640
So this is a longer than normal voicemail that was sent to me.

2196
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:35,320
He actually sent a link through the speak pipe.

2197
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:39,720
The email address or his name was a link to the full file.

2198
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,920
So you can do that too, by the way.

2199
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:45,000
It actually worked out well, but it's several minutes long.

2200
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,680
And I'll stop it short if you want,

2201
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:49,240
but I'm happy to play the full thing if everybody likes it.

2202
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,400
So if we wanted to stop it, just let me know and I'll cut it off.

2203
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,000
But I think you'll enjoy it.

2204
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,120
So here we go.

2205
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:54,920
This is from Tom.

2206
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,400
Merry Christmas, everyone.

2207
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,840
Hey, procrastinators, this is Tom.

2208
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,320
There's been something I've been meaning to get off my chest

2209
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:02,760
for quite some time now.

2210
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,520
So I think it's about time I say it.

2211
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,640
And the only way I know how,

2212
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:09,400
through Vocaloid Parody Song, enjoy.

2213
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:10,680
Yes.

2214
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:15,880
Oh, I want to sit down and relax.

2215
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:20,040
I'll put on the PZP.

2216
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:23,640
I don't want to hear that bullshit.

2217
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,840
That face be on MTV.

2218
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,440
There is just one problem though.

2219
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,480
There's one member with no soul.

2220
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:40,120
I think we all know who the one I hate is.

2221
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:46,680
No, I thought I was going to say that.

2222
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:50,680
No, no more.

2223
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:13,320
Best guy's brother is Van Saint.

2224
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:17,000
Horror images of a man.

2225
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,440
These are just some serfless flaws.

2226
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:23,880
I can't just move past them all.

2227
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:26,680
He's worse than Jeff Lou.

2228
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:32,680
He's the same thing as J.W. Lou.

2229
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,400
All right, there's more.

2230
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:44,440
Let me tell you all the ways that Van Saint is a little bitch.

2231
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:51,080
Every PZP episode is his personal sales pitch.

2232
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:54,680
I know, but he first all makes sick J's.

2233
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,880
He is worse than the third drive.

2234
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:04,360
You only hear his stupid bitching through his shitty USB.

2235
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:09,320
He is worse than the third drive.

2236
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:13,320
Oh, my God.

2237
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,320
This is the whole song.

2238
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:31,320
It's the whole song.

2239
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:39,320
And we'll bring the apocalypse.

2240
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:43,320
It was a clear hello cost.

2241
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,120
Humanity ever lost.

2242
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:48,120
Ben's not who he seems to be.

2243
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:50,120
He's eight and secretly.

2244
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:54,120
Before he evolves, someone kill him quickly.

2245
01:37:54,120 --> 01:38:00,120
Antichrist is not slain while he looks like a man child.

2246
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:04,120
He will be too late for us all.

2247
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:10,120
Our innocent defile his patriotism.

2248
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:14,120
To wake his evil with him.

2249
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:18,120
The end doesn't involve you.

2250
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:22,120
Kill Ben Saint before me.

2251
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,120
Yes, yes.

2252
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:28,120
He kills you.

2253
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:34,120
Kill Ben Saint before he kills you.

2254
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:42,120
Best guy, kill Ben Saint before he kills you.

2255
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:48,120
Jesse, kill Ben Saint before he kills you.

2256
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:58,120
Kill Ben Saint before he kills you.

2257
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,120
More, more, more, more.

2258
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:02,120
I can't get enough.

2259
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,120
All right.

2260
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:06,120
We're fading.

2261
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:12,120
Wow, I'm feeling the holiday spirit now.

2262
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:16,120
Tom, why was that so epic?

2263
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:18,120
It sounded more flatter than I was.

2264
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,120
How did they do that?

2265
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:22,120
He made it with a Vocaloid or something.

2266
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,120
That sounded so good.

2267
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,120
Vocaloid, not like a Utau or Utau.

2268
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,120
He said a Vocaloid.

2269
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,120
By the way, this guy's name is Tom.

2270
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:34,120
He asked us to kindly link his YouTube channel with 117 subs.

2271
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:36,120
I watch, he makes memes.

2272
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,120
He is a funny guy.

2273
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:40,120
Go check this guy out, link in the description or something.

2274
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:42,120
Incredible.

2275
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,120
He put so much work into that.

2276
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:48,120
Is that song a video? Can I like tweet that or something?

2277
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,120
It actually, I looked, it's not a video on his channel,

2278
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,120
but you should make a video out of it, Tom,

2279
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,120
as soon as you hear this.

2280
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,120
So we can put it in the description.

2281
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:00,120
Why does Ben have two songs of high quality about him now?

2282
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,120
It's so bad.

2283
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,120
What is it about Ben that inspires such creativity?

2284
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:06,120
It's the rage.

2285
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,120
It's the fierce hatred.

2286
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:12,120
It's, you know, I'm a divisive figure, right?

2287
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:16,120
Everyone's got to have a take on Ben saying.

2288
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,120
You'd rather, what is it?

2289
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:22,120
It's better to be hated than not to be remembered at all, you know?

2290
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:24,120
Something like that.

2291
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,120
That's what I'm going for.

2292
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:30,120
And also, I said, that's two parodies of Mariah Carey's

2293
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:33,120
All I Want for Christmas, this very fucking episode,

2294
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,120
but it is the quintessential Christmas song,

2295
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,120
and Christmas is in a few short days,

2296
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,120
so I guess we'll leave it at that.

2297
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,120
Next PCP that people will be hearing.

2298
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,120
Not the one we will be hearing, but people will be hearing,

2299
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,120
will be the last PCP of the year.

2300
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,120
Yes, yes.

2301
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,120
I will not be present, sadly, for real this time.

2302
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,120
Oh, okay.

2303
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,120
Tickets are bought.

2304
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,120
I will not be present.

2305
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:58,120
But yeah, so people who are going to send in voicemails,

2306
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:01,120
just know your voicemail will be on the last PCP of the year,

2307
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,120
so make it good.

2308
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,120
Make it amazing.

2309
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,120
Make it all Mariah Carey parodies.

2310
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,120
And you know what?

2311
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:11,120
This is actually very useful.

2312
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,120
Okay, so it's hard for people,

2313
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,120
like a couple people actually center point,

2314
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,120
send me his on-disc or whatever, don't do that.

2315
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,120
Put a link to it on SpeakPipe,

2316
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:22,120
like from a SoundCloud,

2317
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,120
or you can put the URL exactly the way Tom did.

2318
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,120
He's pioneering new smart things.

2319
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,120
His actual voicemail was like a,

2320
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:30,120
hey, just Nate, so you know this is a link,

2321
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,120
so you can click on this link and get the audio.

2322
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:34,120
Like that works perfectly. Do that.

2323
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:36,120
That was convenient and easy to do.

2324
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:38,120
It was great. It was great.

2325
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,120
So keep the quality coming everybody.

2326
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,120
Incredible work Tom, incredible work every center point.

2327
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:44,120
We appreciate your song as well.

2328
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:46,120
Everybody else, good stuff.

2329
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:48,120
Quality voicemails today.

2330
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,120
I was enjoying most of them.

2331
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,120
And so SpeakPipe, link down below

2332
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,120
to leave your voicemails.

2333
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:56,120
And of course, yeah, yeah.

2334
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,120
All those Mariah Carey, all that one for Christmases,

2335
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,120
reminds me of this one video,

2336
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:04,120
which I would have linked in the show notes

2337
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,120
for people to listen to,

2338
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,120
a TF2 parody of all I want for Christmas.

2339
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,120
And it's really funny.

2340
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,120
I listen to it every year.

2341
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,120
I hear it.

2342
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:17,120
I'm going to play this for the fam on Christmas Day

2343
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:19,120
as we all jam out.

2344
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,120
Oh, this is great. I love it.

2345
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,120
So there you go, everybody. Get in the Christmas spirit.

2346
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:24,120
I am.

2347
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:26,120
I'm going for sure.

2348
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:29,120
Or your holiday denomination of choice,

2349
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,120
whatever it may be.

2350
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,120
Right, why not begin the true giving spirit

2351
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,120

There's 32, 33 will be out pretty soon.

2356
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,120
We already know what's going to be recording it soon.

No, just give us more money.

2362

That's really the long and short of it.

2363

Play Minecraft with us, patreon.com.spz

2365
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,120
Alright, thanks for being here, everybody.

2366
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:05,120
See you after Christmas.

2367
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,120
Have a great week, have a great time,

2368
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:09,120
and have fun.

2369
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:11,120
And don't kill me before I kill you, everyone.

You better do it, like the song says.

01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:17,120
Bye!
