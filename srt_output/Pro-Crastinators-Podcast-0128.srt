00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Hello everybody and welcome to another fantastic, amazing, jammed,

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:38,240
impact, scandal-ridden episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am Tom Oliver, introing

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:45,400
the episode today, and with us we have the master of disaster himself, Munchy J. Trump.

4
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,720
This is a true anecdote. Every single time I open up Audacity Recorded PCP, I'm like

5
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,840
today, like I'm kind of low energy, I don't really want to, you know, like I don't really

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,280
want to be crazy, I don't want to scream or anything. I'm just going to take this PCP

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,880
chill and it's going to be a chill PCP. And then whenever the intro, whenever Nate's

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,080
like welcome to the PCP, I just get that fucking fire in me. I just have to ruin the episode

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,560
with my interjections. The low energy of Gibb seeps out of you and the high energy of Trump

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:21,120
seeps in. Yes, yes, yes. And on that note, please clap for Nate. Please clap. I need that

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:30,920
validation. We got Ben St with us as well. Hey guys, hey guys, sorry I haven't been on

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,320
a PCP in a while. I've been really busy with life stuff. Sorry if my voice sounds weird.

13
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,320
I'm kind of sick. That's actually true. I woke up today with a terribly sore throat.

14
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,440
I know it's going to get worse. I'm sipping on some hot tea, hot tea featuring apple cider

15
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,840
vinegar with quote the mother, which is a very spooky thing for an apple cider vinegar

16
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,920
bottle to say. The mother is apparently some kind of set of organic compounds that are filtered

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,560
out in the non organic in like the non raw. The translation we never got. Yeah, yeah. Instead

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,520
it was distilled and shoved into apple cider vinegar. That reminds me of that movie with

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Jay Lawrence, mother, you know, the one she looks so hard. Oh, I'm sorry. Dwayne the

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,240
Rock Johnson. How was that? I hear it was the worst movie ever. No, no, no, I know I

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,400
watched it. It was great. They had the guns in the movie. There's a whole first person

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,320
sequence at the end. That sounds kind of cool, like a hardcore Henry style sequence. Yeah,

23
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,320
but like 10 years before that. Weird to have it like in an otherwise non first person movie.

24
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,400
No, it's like at the end and if you're watching the movie and you're like, oh, but where's the

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,400
video game? Then you see like, Oh, there it is. Like the very end. They finally like the very

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,360
end of this two hour movie. They finally give you what you've been waiting for and make you feel

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
like you're playing a video game. You know what they missed? You know, we didn't get with that.

28
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,400
We didn't get doom the movie the game. I would write. It's just it's just a modified wad of doom

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,440
like the original, but they replaced doom guys face with a pixelated version of the Rock's face.

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,360
Yeah. This is what every like the movie of the game thing is. It's just like it's a third person,

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,520
like almost collectifon, but like linear. Like a weird mesh of genres that don't compliment one

32
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,280
other very well. It's terrible. So I'm just imagining like this really like super saturated,

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,240
like chibi doom guy running around collecting jiggy pieces for only for the Game Boy Advance.

34
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,120
Doom guy Kazooie, the greatest platformer ever.

35
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,240
There's a series of Sam on Game Boy Advance. Yeah, it looks fucked as hell. It looks very

36
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,760
interesting. You know, I just happened to watch a slight update to my life. I actually have watched

37
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,960
a couple AVGN episodes recently. I'm changing my life in a positive way. And like, I'd seen like

38
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,200
one, but never was into the guy or had like, I know it's weird. It's weird. But I'd watch some of

39
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,720
a YouTube or not been into AVGN. I was into John Tron that I just like got into the game late.

40
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,360
I think yeah, like I think I was probably in like college when AVGN started getting big and I just

41
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,360
kind of missed the boat on it. I went back like maybe a year or two ago and marathoned a lot of

42
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,640
it just sort of on the playlist and I feel that coming for me one of these days. Sorry. But I was

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,200
just saying that there's a he did a Tomb Raider episode and there's a port of Tomb Raider one for

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,520
the Engage, the original PS1 game, which is fucking sick. I remember that was coming out that like

45
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,400
blew my mind that they could put that on a phone. It was crazy. It's a full fucking game. It is a

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,200
full game. Like portrait because the Engage screen was a portrait screen resolution and had like a

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,680
shitty little D pad. And apparently to get the game in this is fascinating. Okay, if you want to

48
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,080
put in a new game and you're fucking Engage, you pop off the back, take out the battery, put in like

49
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,680
the SD card behind the battery, put the battery back in, close it, and then you're ready to game.

50
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,720
That's because you're playing you're playing the bullshit taco Engage. You need to get the Engage

51
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,200
QD, the remaster version that's better. They redesigned it. It's sick. Is it really sick? Are

52
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,200
you lying to our audience? No, it's fucking shit. It's an Engage and I unironically want to own on

53
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,520
one day. But yeah, you know, do you know how you took phone calls on the original Engage? You had

54
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,560
to hold it on the side. So you had to like hold it like it's basically like if you had an iPhone

55
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,920
and like you put the edge with the buttons up to your ear to talk to it. That's how you talked on

56
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,040
an Engage. It was ridiculous. It was the worst thing of all time. And I want one horribly badly.

57
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,880
Speaking of SD cards, I just bought I just bought on a total whim. I bought Omega Ruby about

58
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,400
Pokemon Omega Ruby. Steve's got some choice words to say about that game. Yeah, I think the whole

59
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,760
world's in choice things to say that. How do you like that battle frontier? How are you enjoying it?

60
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,000
I haven't actually used it yet. I haven't actually played any of it. It's a joke. There's a battle

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,800
frontier isn't in it. Oh, I almost fell for it. I almost said, oh, yeah, it's pretty good. It's got

62
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:10,120
some problems. You know, it's flawed, but it's a pretty good. No, I don't know. Shut up. I hear

63
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,040
it's not good is what I hear. Is that true, ladies and gentlemen? I mean, I've heard people say

64
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,760
that it's the best. Like, I have seen people. Okay, maybe it was just a joke, but it seemed like

65
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:29,000
on 4chan, like on Oh, that's a joke. That's a joke. That's a real joke. Is it really? Okay. No,

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,680
yeah, it's not well loved. They absolutely hate that game. They think it's the worst. Do people

67
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,600
prefer like the actual Gen three games to the Omega remix? Yeah, they prefer. I fucked up. Yeah. Yeah,

68
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,600
whatever. You I think you literally have fell for a meme. I think you saw one thread that was like,

69
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,800
dude, why can't we go back to Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire? You read the title and then all the

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,720
replies saying that that game of shit and you're like, you know what, like, I just read it. This was

71
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,920
like a couple years ago. I think I just read a thread of people being like, what's the best gen

72
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,440
and like a lot of people were in there saying Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire. So I just thought, huh, I

73
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,760
guess those are pretty popular. Zoomers left and right, love and Omega, whatever. Alpha, whatever.

74
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,480
They need to be killed. We need to call the also we have to stop human progress. Do you remember

75
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,880
when you get like to like this, the sixth gym, like you just get to the second part of the game,

76
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,200
and then out of nowhere, like not in the original game, just like out of nowhere. Laudiasse shows up

77
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,240
and it's like, Hey, do you want to capture me? Oh God. Yeah, I know that that happens and it makes

78
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:40,280
me mad. Is that the one where someone just gives you a Lucario to that's not that's in gen six. Okay,

79
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:51,000
no, I meant X and Y. Yeah, that's in Lucario on that. And X and Y. You know, okay, okay, that's the

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,840
one I skipped. But the real is someone gives you an egg that has real in it. So I feel it's

81
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,560
slightly better at least work to get a sort of I guess like, I don't know. Yeah, like, didn't they

82
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,080
give you an EV egg in the original game in gen one, right? Gen one doesn't have eggs. It doesn't. No,

83
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,560
there's no eggs in gen one. There's no breeding. I know there's no breeding. Whenever you get it,

84
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,040
you get an EV from somebody if you go in like the back. Oh, they give you an EV egg and sun and

85
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,080
moon. What are we talking about? Isn't there like graffiti in one of the buildings where you can get

86
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,600
the EV egg? I think if you like clicking on the walls and you can read like someone was here. Is

87
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,080
that true? Yeah, like a meme program? Like the bloods were here, like the crypts were here.

88
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Oh, how could I forget about that? The blood reds and the crypt blues, the legendary rivalry. Hey,

89
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,680
all this talk of Pokemon's getting me really anxious. Let me take a long sip of my off brand

90
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,880
LaCroix here and just relax for a second. Oh, my God, Nate, I just come up with some totally

91
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,680
organic natural conversation star point based on you drinking that LaCroix. Like just like you

92
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,000
drinking that drink and maybe think of a totally organic thing to say currently busly like continue.

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,040
There's a lawsuit against LaCroix. It's happening. It can't be. No. So tell me the deets. What's

94
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,960
that? Is it about cancer? Does it cause cancer? Is that something? Everything does. Okay, okay. Yes,

95
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,360
but but more like it will kill you. Like not like like in a cancer. Can I just point out? Can I just

96
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,960
point out what the fuck? No, it has been so bizarre to see these from zero to a hundred like spread

97
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,840
of LaCroix over the last like year or two. I no idea how that happened or even why anyone buys it,

98
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:43,760
including me. Why do you buy it? It's slightly it's slightly more pleasant than just drinking water

99
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,640
slightly worse. And then the other thing is the convenience of just grabbing a can of something

100
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,600
I agree 100% that is the only reason I buy it is because I'm conditioned to like can drinks. Yeah. And

101
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,480
this is just a way of weaning myself off like the poison that is the first time I ever had it. What

102
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,720
was it? Ben's house in Atlanta and I drank it and and and he was like, what do you think? And I was

103
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:16,280
like, I okay. I don't really like it's okay. Nobody likes LaCroix. I have I have negative

104
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,920
associations with LaCroix. But mostly I just like I like soda better. And like, I don't think

105
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:30,840
soda is poison. Tom like it has flavor. It's not keto, though. Isn't it poison? Oh, God,

106
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,440
this is my fucking pet peeve. People don't fucking understand what diet soda is. Oh my God,

107
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:43,120
they're everywhere. They're everywhere. Infecting society. It's so simple. I want to know sugar

108
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:51,800
in diet soda. Is it not real soda or something? How is it not real soda? It's it's like gay. What

109
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,960
Nate would say if it's you can't have diet and soda at the same time. It's not what it is. It

110
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,800
not made of like so like sugar derivatives that just yeah. Yeah, sure. But that doesn't count

111
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:12,920
because you don't digest them. I mean, I guess so. No, no, no, I guess so. There's no fucking

112
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:20,520
gray hair here. Well, okay, I mean, okay, if I have if I have like a four piece puzzle, and I

113
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,240
remove one of the pieces, I still have the three pieces, can I really say this isn't the puzzle

114
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:33,320
anymore? That's an insane thing. That's the word. I don't I don't deny what you're saying at all. It

115
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,720
is 100% true that diet soda is fine. But like, if I had this right, is this like a big thing that

116
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,720
happens all the time? If I raised my son to be in the military, my beautiful baby boy, I cut off

117
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,960
his legs, would he not be my son anymore? Ben, why are you taking this position, Ben? What's wrong

118
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:59,840
with you monster? It's like, it's like, I don't know. It's like if people thought that like,

119
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,720
there really were like little people in the in the television. And you're just like, and you're

120
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,680
like, no, you see, it's just an image, right? Like, it's just an image projected on the screen. And

121
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,280
people are like, and people are like, yeah, I guess you're right. But but but you know, it's kind

122
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:27,000
of like, it's kind of like there's little people in the television, right? Like, no, you're an idiot.

123
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,160
Okay, look, all that really matters is so so just consuming this in any way interfere with the

124
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,520
whole point of ketosis and the whole keto. Some people don't play well with certain artificial

125
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,320
sweeteners. So for some people, it might yeah, Tom was asking me about heavy cream before the

126
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,840
stream. But but for some people, artificial sweeteners aren't good for keto, but it depends on the

127
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,520
person. And in general, yeah, they're fine. As like, I think keto is becoming Ben's equivalent to

128
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,600
holocaust.

129
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,840
No, this is my anger is not it's not a keto thing. It's just like munchy.

130
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,800
It's that old keto rage. You're not innocent. You're not innocent. Because like, I talked to I

131
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,920
talked to you and and Kazi about like soda and you both did like a thing that was like, I don't

132
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,920
know if you're still doing it. But you were like, yeah, we're both cutting out soda, because like

133
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,480
soda, you know, is bad for you because of sugar. And I'm like, what about diet soda doesn't have

134
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,240
any sugar? And you both are like, yeah, but it's still soda. Like there's still kind of little

135
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,440
people in the television. So the only reason I don't want to drink diet soda is because I don't

136
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,960
like the way that it tastes like universally. Okay, well, that's a whole that's all right. That's

137
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,080
a whole other can of worms. And I don't understand people that think the diet soda tastes bad.

138
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,560
But I know that that's like taste like that's just up to an individual. So I can't argue with

139
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,280
that. I don't understand it. But I can't argue with nothing but water and juice for years. And

140
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,400
then like, like Michelle turned me on to La Croix, we've been getting that for a little while,

141
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,440
you know, La Croix variants or whatever. And like, I feel like it is a gateway to soda. Like

142
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,080
because I'm drinking these, I'm way more likely. But it's like, it's like vaping, right? Like, yeah,

143
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,720
you could argue that vaping is like a gateway to smoking. But you can also say that like if you

144
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,840
smoke, like drink soda, and you can vape instead. And maybe it has like none of the negative, maybe

145
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,240
you can replace the one bad thing with this less bad thing that doesn't have the negative side

146
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,560
effects. Go that way. It's all about your perspective. But if you're already straight edge,

147
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,360
then like why even entertain any of these? Vaping could be a gateway to smoking. Why

148
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,440
could I change the drinking calories life? Yeah. Vaping could be a gateway to smoking. I would

149
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,960
never drink a calorie except for heavy cream. But vaping could also be a gateway to quitting,

150
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,800
depending on which way you look at. Well, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, like, okay, for a smoker,

151
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,400
getting into vaping could definitely be a step in the right direction. Exactly. To like a healthier

152
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,920
life. You guys in your fuel, I want the post food life to be like calories or individual,

153
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,480
like Cheerios. And each Cheerio is one calorie. And you just count them out. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

154
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,760
And you count them out exactly 2000 different mornings. Yeah. And then I can divide each meal

155
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,800
by 10. So it's easy to multiply and slash or divide. So my breakfast could be like 100 calories.

156
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,200
I do have my fuel right with me right now, as a matter of fact, incidentally. I'm on my second

157
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,880
up. I restocked recently, by the way. So I've got two more bags fresh, ready to go, feeling good.

158
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,680
We actually returned to the LeCroy lawsuit. I just want to chill. I just want to chill for some

159
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,880
of the free advertising for tea. If you are like wanting to get out the soda life, I highly recommend

160
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,120
tea is tea is the best food. It is the talking about like, I'm drinking tea right now. As I said,

161
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:43,840
tea with apple cider vinegar with the mother is great. I was right the whole time. He tea is

162
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,920
the best. There was prep work, though, that a lot of people are too. Oh, no, very little,

163
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,600
very like like a 10 minutes, you know, you can take like, you can do this is what me and my

164
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,880
housemates do. We have like a big like a big mason jar, like a gallon mason jar. And we put

165
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,440
tea bags in it and you can put it in the fridge and let it steep. And like by the next day,

166
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,760
you'll have like cold brew tea. And you can make and you don't have to like spend any time.

167
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,360
The danger there is oversteeping. Because if you oversteep, it gets really bitter.

168
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,480
What I do is I have a David's tea seeper and I can just it's a super simple,

169
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,360
like streamlined ice. I actually enjoy ice tea more. I actually enjoy my tea cold more often.

170
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,920
I'm just drinking hot today because of my throat. Yeah, I almost only. I mean, what I would do when

171
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,400
I wanted to make like ice tea or iced coffee, because like back at my other house, we had

172
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,160
we had one of those water like coolers, but it had hot and cold water. You had balls. So what

173
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,680
you would do is you would just take the hot water, you'd steep the tea in that really quickly,

174
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,280
and then you just mix that with the cold water and then we get iced really quickly.

175
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:57,520
I want to tell my my first my first interaction with LaCroix. Nate, do you remember Alex,

176
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,600
our cousin Alex's wedding? You were there. Yeah, a nightmare. I don't think I was there,

177
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,520
but I remember you weren't. Oh, I was there. I hated it. It was horrible. Okay, I believe you.

178
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,160
But they had, but they had LaCroix. I'd never seen LaCroix before, but they had LaCroix.

179
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,320
And, you know, I think something was going on. I was like kind of over in a building. I was going

180
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,920
out to like go back to the tent that everyone was fucking around in or whatever. And I, I grabbed

181
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,600
a LaCroix thinking that because it has like a fruit flavor, right? It says like, oh, you know,

182
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,880
pear or whatever. And I was like, okay, in the factory where LaCroix is canned, like elsewhere,

183
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,040
in like a separate section, they're like processing fruit. Like that's how they make LaCroix. Yeah,

184
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,360
yeah. So, you know, I started drinking it and I'm like, well, God, because I am expecting something

185
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,280
sweet and like pear flavor, but it's only it's something that's just sort of smells like a pear,

186
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,120
but it doesn't taste like anything. Why that was what I was about to bring up next. How can

187
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,440
something that smells as good as LaCroix tastes so disappointing? Yeah, like it's a fucking trap.

188
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,960
So I went. So I went to the, this was pre keto, obviously, I went to the bar, like there was an

189
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,440
open bar, but it had been like abandoned because like, you know, the like dinner was about to start.

190
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,160
And I just went behind the bar. It was an outdoor thing. And I just grabbed some grenadine and like

191
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,960
just poured some grenadine into it to try and sweeten it. Someone thought I was trying to spike

192
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,360
my drink, but I was like, no, I'm just trying to make this LaCroix taste like real. So drink,

193
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,240
huh? Like a problem? Like, were they like, Hey, don't spike. No, they love, no, no, they laugh.

194
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,320
They're like, huh, trying to get trying to get wasted. I was like, no, just just kind of doesn't

195
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,280
taste very good. It is a wedding where people do drink, but okay, whatever. Yeah, no, no,

196
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,000
they weren't criticizing me. They were just like, haha, this guy is about drinking. It was like,

197
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,120
you and me, buddy.

198
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,400
Yep. So that's it. Best smelling LaCroix, best smelling LaCroix passion fruit. The LaCroix

199
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,440
lawsuit is that LaCroix is sparkling water and people are saying that that is false

200
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,920
advertisement because it says that LaCroix is a natural drink. It is advertised as a

201
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,520
natural drink. They're saying that sparkling water is not natural.

202
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,360
The carbonation is artificially added.

203
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,480
Yes. But we're talking about natural ingredients.

204
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,960
They're saying to carbonate it, they have to use pesticides and stuff like that.

205
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,160
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the whole thing. There's like a chemical from like

206
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,400
cockroach insecticide that they use in LaCroix and people are really upset about it.

207
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,360
Okay. Now, I'll be happy to hear people out and see if this lawsuit goes forward. But like,

208
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,160
for example, there's also probably like, you know, carbon in like some like poison and then like,

209
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,560
hey, there's also carbon in the stuff that we eat every day. That's fucked up, dude. It's the

210
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,200
same shit that's in poison. You know, so like. I don't think the claim is that it's poisonous.

211
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,080
I think the claim is that it's artificial. This sounds like somebody in California

212
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,960
really just wants some money. That sounds like somebody in California really just thinks GMOs

213
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,120
are real. Yeah, this is my mom. My mom is the one with this lawsuit.

214
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,600
I gotta tell, there's like some of the stuff I don't want to say, but okay, like I'll just say

215
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,960
that like I have stories of people I know that like, for example, they work in like the food

216
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,840
industry and like there are people who come up and say like, does this have GMOs and they'll be

217
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,920
like, no, um, has it touched anything that had GMOs? And if the answer is maybe or yes, they're

218
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,520
like, well, then I'm not going to consume that. No, thank you, sir. Like even even being in proximity

219
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,600
to things like, do they have people know what a GMO is? They clearly do not poison you guys.

220
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,320
Is there's genetically modified GMOs in it? There's literally no reason.

221
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,840
Like, like, like, what do they think is going to happen? Like if you touch something that's

222
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:51,200
genetically modified, your genes get modified. Like, I think people, I think GMO just equals bad.

223
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Is it like, is it like an ethical thing? Like, they just don't think we should be fucking with

224
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,480
nature. I shouldn't eat literally anything because there's literally nothing that we eat that we have

225
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,440
not genetically bred to be. What kind of person like would would not want to eat something that

226
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,640
had touched GMO on, like, ethical grounds as opposed to like, it seems like a health one to

227
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:20,880
be doing. My mom, my mom is this person, 100%. She is full stop like everything that is bad about

228
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,360
like that mentality. And you know what, even if in 50 years or 20 years or 10 years, one year,

229
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,000
whatever, if we prove that all GMOs are literally evil poison that are killing us 20 years early,

230
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,560
they still give no credit to the people freaking out about GMOs because they have no reason to

231
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,520
believe that. There's no way they could have actually known. They're just right by accident.

232
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,240
So I'm protecting myself from, told you so. I actually tried to talk to my mom about this because

233
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,840
she's super anti-GMO. And I was like, like, I was explaining to her that, you know, like, like,

234
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,320
this is nothing new. Humans do this sort of thing all the time. We're just doing it faster now. It's

235
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,040
the only distinction. And she just had, like, no response. But she just did like, well, like,

236
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,080
there's still little people in the TV like, yeah, sure. Like, it's still cancer.

237
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,280
Her soul, her soul retreated. Her soul faded from her eyes into the back of her skull that she just

238
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:23,520
heard, all around me are familiar faces. Yeah. That's what they do. That's, I don't know. It's

239
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,120
all a bunch of bullshit. Anyway. Do you think that LaCroix is false advertising? Do you think

240
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,560
that they deserve to be sued? I mean, if they're using, I mean, I don't know, what's the criteria

241
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,520
of naturalness? Like, what exactly does it mean? I'm going to go to Urban Dictionary and find out

242
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,040
right now. This will help. This will be very helpful. I'm sure the people on Urban Dictionary are big

243
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,920
LaCroix drinkers. I'm sure they are too. I'm sure that's actually true. Probably because they're big

244
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,200
lemurs. And it's kind of their big millennials. All right. I googled the proper terms,

245
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,440
all right, natural. Okay, this is now we don't want the noun one adjective.

246
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,160
Okay, no, that's not it either. Breasts that don't have implants. No, that's not it. I mean,

247
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,160
that is true. God damn it. These are all fucking nouns. Okay, no. Oh, does that mean that fake boobs

248
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:16,160
are GMOs? Yeah, exactly what it means. That and nothing. Okay, here we go. Number six down is

249
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:23,360
relevant. One, to be free of any superficial artificial media or society created additives.

250
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,280
Are we really using the Urban Dictionary definition to try and figure out, to try and like

251
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,880
decide this court case? What higher authority is there, Ben? To decide this court case against

252
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,240
against LaCroix? So you're like at the courtroom, the judge is like, hold on, before we proceed,

253
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,920
we must assess our definitions. And he pulls out his tiny little spectacles. The defense

254
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,760
Urban Dictionary defines it as, yeah. The prosecution calls for a sidebar. And like,

255
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,840
oh, it takes out their smartphone and shows this Urban Dictionary page. Well, you know,

256
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,160
the thing is, I pulled up the Google Dictionary one just now. The thing, there probably is a

257
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:09,360
very specific codified food, what's the food and drug administration, like definition of what

258
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,800
natural means. Like, for example, if you want to say that you have whole wheat, then like in your,

259
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,040
in your bread or whatever, if you make your bread company, you can have, as long as there's any

260
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,840
amount of whole wheat, it could be 99%, like white bread stuff, and then 1% whole wheat,

261
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,880
and you can get away with that. But specifically, the label of 100% whole wheat, which you should

262
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,440
always buy, ladies and gentlemen, buy the way, because that is better for you. Look for 100%

263
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,760
whole wheat. If it doesn't say 100%, it's probably 99% bullshit. That's just like filler.

264
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,640
Every time I think about the FDA, the only thing I can think about is this old Onion article,

265
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:58,560
that's like FDA and N, hold on, N, T, like the T, A, R, something.

266
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,640
It just matters. It's the food and drug administration and the like tobacco alcohol

267
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,920
and firearms administration, like get together to throw a rad party, and like the food and drug

268
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,200
administration, like we had tons of food and drugs, but nothing to smoke, drink, or fire.

269
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,920
So we got together with the Tobacco Alcohol and Firearms Association, and just,

270
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,320
and just threw a rager, and it was a great idea. Yeah. It's like the association of bad decisions.

271
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,880
And you combine them. I mean, if you're the smoking alcohol and firearms,

272
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,960
so yeah, just like nothing but bad calls all around.

273
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,520
There's the FDA, like it's the food and drug. So I imagine drugs are things like pharmaceuticals

274
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,320
and stuff. Is that like like hard drugs or something? Are they? No, dang dong. It's

275
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,080
that's like, they're the people that decide when like clinical testing has reached sufficient

276
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,040
like levels that like a drug is like sellable in stores. I just wonder if it was also under the

277
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,440
jurisdiction. No, because no, wait, like illegal drugs? Like no, they're illegal. Of course,

278
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,720
a government regulator doesn't have to regulate. Maybe they were the body chart of deciding what

279
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,560
should be illegal and what shouldn't. I mean, I don't know. Maybe they're involved in it. Maybe.

280
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,800
Well, there you go. All right. Well, we've said it in the Croy question. Yeah. Are they guilty or not guilty?

281
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,960
Absolutely guilty. Absolutely guilty. Absolutely guilty. Absolutely guilty.

282
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,200
The Croy is a crime against humanity as it stands. So even if, yeah, they're guilty of that,

283
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,960
hey, hey, speaking of groceries, I'm just going to gripe. I'm just going to gripe for a minute.

284
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,920
I've been trying to order my goddamn groceries. Like a couple of weeks ago, I ordered some groceries

285
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:47,680
on the internet. Instacart was the app I was using. Okay. And you know, it charges like a

286
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,200
little surcharge for the delivery, but like whatever it's really it saves me like two hours.

287
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,720
So it's great. Yeah. So I was trying to use it. And then today I go in and it's like a card

288
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,560
declined. And I'm like, well, I don't know why that would be because I just used my card yesterday

289
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,680
at a store and it worked fine. So I tried to pay with Google Pay instead, which did it. I put the

290
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:13,760
same card in Google Pay accepted my card. I hit send. And it's like, and it's like, internet

291
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,160
doesn't work. The internet obviously works because I'm using the app in the first place, like internet

292
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,120
seems to not be connected. It's totally connected. Instacart just won't fucking let me buy

293
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,520
groceries from it. I'm hungry. Damn it. I want my fucking walnuts. Hashtag let Ben eat.

294
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,320
Walnuts are expensive, dude. Holy shit. They're not as expensive as Brazil nuts,

295
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,200
which I was eating a lot of because they're very low carb. However, they're also very high in

296
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,560
selenium. And if you eat more like two Brazil nuts have your day's supply of selenium. What is

297
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,760
I was eating by the handful. So like hitting like thousands and thousands of my daily value

298
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,040
of selenium, which causes like brittle fingernails and probably death. I don't know.

299
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,320
This fancy steak dinner, dude, that's expensive. It's not as expensive as facial reconstruction

300
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:10,240
surgery. That's not that expensive. I don't know. For nuts, they're fine. I love and I just love nuts.

301
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,560
You know, I don't want to try especially ligmen nuts. Get it? What? I said, I love nuts, especially

302
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:30,960
ligma. What's Bofa? What's up dog, Ben? What is up dog? As the PCP turns into people clamoring to

303
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,640
be the next person to be post noun. Here's the newest post now that I'm going to introduce. I am

304
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,880
post groceries, because I have no need for groceries, because my entire life is now revolving

305
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,040
around Hello Fresh, which I have become a devote follower of. I don't tell me about it.

306
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,280
No, that's what I'm going to come right out and say before you. That's stupid. That's

307
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,440
fucking stupid. Why is that stupid? Why is that stupid? Okay, Hello Fresh, it's like buying groceries,

308
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,200
but they only deliver you as much as you need for exactly one meal at a time and they cost 10

309
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,800
times as much. That's Hello Fresh. Okay, they do not cost 10 times as much. And why would I need that

310
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,560
over flow? Why would I want more? I don't know. You fucking buy and bulk to save fucking money. You

311
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,760
don't, oh, they'll send you like, oh, they'll send you like two beef patties and one fucking mango

312
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,600
to make chutney out of. And that's what you get for like an entire day's worth of food with Hello

313
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,200
Fresh. Bullshit. That's all you need to make the meal that they have made. Yeah, you're one meal for

314
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,080
one day, which you get like three times a week. So you can eat three times a week on Hello Fresh.

315
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,200
You know, I, and it's great. It's a great time. I'm thoroughly enjoying it. My lifestyle has been

316
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,480
crippled by my inability to make time to go get groceries or eat. I want to use some of this

317
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,320
technology to solve this problem in myself. It may use Instacart. Instacart's really good when it

318
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,120
works. I've been thinking about doing Postmates. I don't know if that works. I don't know. I've

319
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,120
never heard of it, but I do it. Okay. Well, before you go on Nate, the reason I defend Hello

320
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,000
Fresh is small, like sample size. Yeah, tell me about it. It makes it super. Well, do you know

321
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,840
anything about Hello Fresh? You know what it is? Nothing. I want to be educated. Okay. Okay. Hello

322
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,360
Fresh is a service where you can pay like per, I think it's per week and they send you meals every

323
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,000
week and it sends you like recipes that they have made. It's like Hello Fresh official recipes

324
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,920
for these really great dishes and they send you literally everything in the recipe. Are you sponsored

325
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,000
by Hello Fresh? If not, why not? They send you the exact ingredients you need in the exact amounts

326
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,680
you need for a specific recipe for a dinner for like two or whatever. Yes. And it's great because

327
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,760
then you have the exact amount of things that you need. So cooking is super easy. And this

328
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,400
sounds good. This is like my gateway into cooking things is because that's what I want. I want

329
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,320
that so bad. I'm sick of being a failure. Okay, Nate, check out this shit. It is designed so that

330
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,560
every meal like like every single thing is 30 minutes to 40 minutes to make all total like like

331
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:03,040
Oh my god, 30 minutes? And at these low low prices? I can't afford not to. They're delicious.

332
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,720
Everything I've made has been fucking the cream to cream. It's been fantastic. I've been

333
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,880
doing everything. And not only am I getting to be able to cook, I mean, I'm taking off the train

334
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,720
wheels. I'm ready to cook things that aren't on recipe. I've been holding my skills to like do

335
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,680
things at once. I'm connecting with my mom. I do it with my mom. It's family bonding. All your

336
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:31,280
problems. Yeah, nothing is nothing is nothing in this world is less post food than what the

337
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,640
fuck. I don't even remember. What are we talking about? Hello fresh? Hello fresh is the least

338
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,720
post food thing ever. Why would I want to be? I am anti post food. I am anti post food. I'm

339
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,600
just coming out right here and saying no, listen, stupid. You'd buy just buy buy the

340
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,960
fucking bear is sent by the fucking basic building blocks of food and eat them in the amounts that

341
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,760
you need to survive. And don't even worry about anything else. Oh, great. I can put some I'll

342
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:03,040
have some fucking I'll braise these red onions to put on my on my my stupid, you know, a black

343
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:10,560
Angus, you know, bird patty with some some some some smoke out because when you want to eat foods,

344
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,440
you want to taste the food that you put the work. No, you want to taste the food. Literally,

345
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,800
who fucking cares? Everyone put the post food group cares about what they're putting in their

346
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,680
body. And this is the only reason the food is a cultural institution. The only reason it's

347
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,840
so that you can trick idiots into thinking you have a skill by putting it together like oh,

348
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,760
I looked at this recipe on Google and now it tastes really great. You can't do it. You couldn't

349
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,080
do it. So whether that's important, you know, I think I looked up exactly how to put this onion

350
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,240
on top of this cheese on top of this lettuce. So I have the perfect burger five minutes later.

351
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,120
It's destroyed and it's worthless. It's a totally ephemeral, pointless experience that adds nothing

352
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,880
of value to the world. Your life is full. Life is full of the value is cooking it in it of itself.

353
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,840
That is an inherent skill and waste my fucking time with someone else. Then the point of the meal

354
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,920
is not only arranging, arranging bits and pieces, arranging bits and pieces into a cultural

355
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,720
institution of unethically optimal. We've made all these different recipes now, these different

356
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,800
flavors. We've honed the craft of eating. This is part of our civilization. It's part of society.

357
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,840
We've evolved the business way. We've perfected this part of our biology. You don't even know

358
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,320
shit. No, no. Oh my god, shut up. It's a cultural and tribal endeavor. You are stuck in the past,

359
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,320
Munchie. You're a hardcore conservative. I am a liberal hero post food and we all need to evolve

360
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,400
past these pathetic, weak human desires for things that taste good and just get down with the...

361
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Thank you. Thank you. I can rest easy knowing that the millenials, the simple, the simpleton

362
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,760
millenials are not in your favor and there are the HelloFresh subscriptions every single day.

363
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,960
I can rest easy. Me, CEO of HelloFresh, Munchie J.Fresh. You don't have Digi or Gib to defend your

364
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,840
weak team here. You're up against the full post food boys here at the spot. I want to say, I want

365
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:20,160
to say, I think that HelloFresh embodies the absolute worst attitudes of the 30-year-old boomer

366
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:29,520
and the intellectually laziest, least good segment of the millennial population.

367
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,920
The people that are getting HelloFresh, these are cowards who are, they are like, they are working

368
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:42,320
their nine to five selling beads on Etsy and thinking that that makes them artists. These are

369
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,240
people... Dirty poor, they're doing dirty poor. They're just mixing some paints together into a cup

370
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:56,560
and it's pouring onto a can. No, these are white picket fence motherfuckers. These are white picket

371
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,240
fence, you know, married with two and a half children, pieces of shit that are getting HelloFresh

372
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,160
and Munchie, I think you need to stop this. Okay, okay, like everything that you just said is

373
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,840
retarded. If you're coming home from work, then it's like, oh, I'm not going to do anything with

374
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,480
my, I'm just going to watch TV. But with this, you're cooking something, you're learning a skill,

375
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,520
you can do it with your family. And okay, okay, I literally, like for the first like five meals

376
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,920
in HelloFresh, here's what I did. I got downstairs, I was with my mom, and for the entire family,

377
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,200
we cooked a beautiful, delicious meal. Together, we were talking the entire time I was working with

378
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,280
my mom. I don't talk to my mom like outside of this. I was using that time to not only connect

379
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,920
with my mom, make a delicious dish for the entire family to enjoy. And then we all sat down and ate

380
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,200
dinner together. You could have been playing video games. You could have been playing video games.

381
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,800
Well, yeah. It sounds like the act of preparing a meal could be replaced with anything else.

382
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,040
I mean, but why would you want to be? Because you also get to eat at the end.

383
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,600
Yeah, but it's not, yeah, but it's delicious meal at the end, which is the biggest bonus of all.

384
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,240
Okay, I know that this is like a me problem that doesn't apply to most people, but you have no fine

385
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,640
con- with HelloFresh or something like that, you have no fine control over what ingredients go into

386
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,680
your food. You don't have control over what kind of- I think that's why people like it though.

387
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,560
What kind of macro nutrient profile you're eating. With me, with my, I can just fucking,

388
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,960
I'll just like drink like a quarter, I'll just drink like a quart of heavy cream or a pint of

389
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,480
heavy cream, and I'll eat like a piece of sausage for dinner. This HelloFresh even drop off

390
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,240
quarts and heavy cream. And celery and peanut butter for dessert, and I get the exact nutrients

391
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,040
that I want, and it's up to me, and I don't give a shit. Oh, okay, okay. Well, we'll say this. I

392
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,440
will say that HelloFresh is definitely like a training wheel situation. Yes, that's what I was

393
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,280
going to say. There's a long term, like I'm always going to be using HelloFresh for the rest of my

394
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,040
life. That's what I was going to say, Ben, that I feel like this could be a stepping stone for me to

395
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,320
possibly learn how to not be such a complete terrible human being when it comes to handling my

396
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,720
food situation. But it's definitely a way to open your eyes and be able to realize, oh, cooking

397
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,400
isn't that hard, you know, like the cleanup isn't that bad. It's really not a problem for me to

398
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,720
be able to cook every day. Like Tom, Tom, I know I am a post food boy. I want to be post food. Yeah,

399
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,360
how can you be post food and this at the same time? I'll tell you how. Because Nate's on the

400
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,880
edge, and he realized the errors of his way, so he just wants to see me. No, I haven't realized the

401
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,560
errors of the ways, but the thing is I have human flaws, and I sometimes crave food. We're not going

402
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:27,360
to get stuck if you just curb your entire brain power. This is how my life goes. This is how my

403
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,080
life goes day to day. That's what I'm getting right now. Okay, sure. I wake up in the morning.

404
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,760
I'll get a heel, and I'll do that. And then like it's later in the day. And then I'm like, well,

405
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,840
I've got no groceries around because I'm a lazy piece of shit who doesn't like plan ahead with

406
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,640
this stuff. What am I going to do? I'll tell you what I do. I fire up Grubhub or I fire up what's

407
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,160
it called? I get some fucking Chinese food. I know it is bad, and I want to stop it. Go back to the

408
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,600
fridge, you get another heel, and you realize that you've conquered your human weakness. I want to

409
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:04,240
do that, but I just like my hunger overrides my desire for fuel. Nate, try not to eat. Hold

410
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,840
down your finger on the Grubhub app, drag it to the trash, and never make this mistake again.

411
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,360
You can't. You just want to just know. Just know that you can not eat, and it will not harm you.

412
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:21,360
Intermittent fasting. Go OMAD, all right? You get your fuel, and then that's your one meal a day,

413
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,680
and you're done. You've completely destroyed your human weakness. Okay, maybe I should get into some

414
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,240
of this stuff and actually try it out and see if I can. Nate, when your beautiful son, top of the

415
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,200
class, comes up to you every night, and he's like, Father, Father, I'm hungry, and I'm sorry if you

416
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,760
haven't fed me in three days. Are you going to give him a drink of fuel? Are you going to pour some

417
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,840
fuel into his head and say, Here, drink this. No, you're going to give him a dinner. You're going to

418
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,720
give him a dinner, Nate. The only thing that's passing through your lip is the words of the Lord.

419
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,120
Now, hook up your fucking IV drip of fuel, and feed yourself your fucking weak post-food child.

420
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:05,760
That's what I'm going to say. I'll give him his daily ration of omega-3 pills and caffeine.

421
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,920
That's right. That's what it's going to be. It's going to be a beautiful future,

422
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,040
Munchie, and your kind will be gone. You'll be long gone. I hope so. I'm ready to die on this hill.

423
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,840
I do mean die. Well, with Ben's plan of just stopping eating, I mean that's... Okay, okay,

424
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,800
I mean it's not permanent plan. Contrary to what you may believe, I actually completely agree with

425
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Ben, and if you choose to stop eating for a week, that's fine. Go ahead. Look, people are like,

426
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,600
oh, you're fashion for three or four days. That's so dangerous. Kyle, come on, dude.

427
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,680
You need to eat. Oh, you're going to... What? I don't know. Do I die? I'm going to...

428
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,760
Ball. Who cares? I don't know. I don't know. I know they had my best interest at heart.

429
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,040
But a lot of people in my discord were like, worried for me, and I did not understand why.

430
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,960
I mean, what's going to happen? What's going to happen? Just consider their life experience,

431
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,440
eating like several times a day every day their entire life, and they've heard about people starving

432
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,120
to death, and you know, I thought of the same source of death. I too have heard about people

433
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,000
starving to death. It's like a virus. If you've heard about someone starving to death, then you

434
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,680
will starve to death. I've heard rumors that if you don't eat, you might die if you go long enough.

435
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,240
I did the fucking research. I looked into it. Has anyone ever tested this theory?

436
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,920
I think not. How long does it take to die if you don't eat? The answer is like a month or more.

437
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,960
I just drive by, you know, like skinny African starving children. I'm just like,

438
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,080
these guys are living the life, man. These guys, they've got it figured out.

439
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,640
They're fucking keto. I bet if they peed on a keto strip, it'd be a dark purple.

440
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,960
Oh my god. Wait, would it be cheater? Which is in our new society. That's how we judge class.

441
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,840
That's how dark your keto is. We've come full circle because purple was the color of royalty,

442
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,800
and now we've come back. That's right. That's right. It's all connected in the great circle of life.

443
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,400
Would it be cheaper to, instead of giving like three meals a day to African children,

444
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,800
we give them fuel supplements. We give fuel to African children. That's kind of the thing.

445
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,320
Fuel supplements that they need. That's one of the like things that like fuel,

446
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,080
and like things like it might salt, possibly, if they could, you know. Do they market it?

447
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,840
It has like so many cute food shortages. Fuel's got to be some like some overpriced

448
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,720
fucking like nutrition sports supplement. Oh, it absolutely is. I mean, yeah. Yeah.

449
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:35,200
But like the way they're selling it is not like a world hunger solution. No, no, they're selling

450
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,800
us a convenience. The reason they say that is because like for all the fucking soy boys who

451
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,960
want to get on that shit, it makes them feel better about buying it. I guess so. Like you're

452
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,000
not, it's totally marketing bullshit. I don't buy it for a second. I mean, if they could theoretically

453
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,400
get the price really down low and they were able to like get all the you know, theoretically,

454
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,800
but right now they're doing nothing to help that at all. Yeah, like like Soylent was the same promise.

455
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,280
I'm sure we're gonna go to Ethiopia and be like, do you want to pay $60 for two bags of dust? Here

456
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,560
you go. Isn't there some like, isn't there some like rice, some like highly nutritious GMO rice

457
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,640
that is meant as like a world hunger solution? I believe that is a thing that I've heard of.

458
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,640
I've definitely heard something about it from India, I want to say, but I don't remember.

459
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,440
It's never gonna go anywhere though, because it's GMO and we have retarded people.

460
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,560
How dare we help those fucking starving African children. If we allowed GMOs to go

461
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,880
further, then we would probably be in like a utopia right now. Can you imagine like all the

462
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,040
crazy shit people would be able to do and like like weird DNA parts of animals to make foods for

463
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,520
foods and have all the creatures we need. Think of how much closer to Starfleet we'd be if we had

464
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:46,800
GMOs and stem cells just going full throttle. It'd be good, it'd be good. Yeah, pro stem cells.

465
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,800
The world does suck. So many aborted babies go to waste every year and we need to end this,

466
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,520
we need to end this waste. Yeah, we gotta use them. They've got those delicious little stem cells.

467
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,120
Less babies, more fucking biohacking, that's what I want. Less babies, more rabies, please.

468
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,840
More rabies, please, he says, holding down his hands.

469
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,400
So all right, well man, that was a raucous event, good. I think we all need to cool down after

470
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:19,600
that. So LaCroix is guilty, right? LaCroix, yeah. We are the judge's jury for the executioner here

471
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:26,160
on the piece. I've been doing Inktober and it's great. It's an absolutely great hashtag.

472
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,960
Where's day three, Munchy? Where's day three? Oh, I'm doing that right after this. I have the

473
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,120
entire sketch on it. It's like right in front of me, like as we speak. But it's already day seven.

474
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,000
I know it's already day seven, but... Yeah, I skipped it. I skipped it.

475
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,840
You've been posting one every day, but like this one from day three just was so complicated or

476
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,800
something that it was... I don't mean to get... Okay, we'll be up by the time that you hear this,

477
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,880
obviously, viewer. It's not going to be crazy, but I just wanted to do it,

478
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,680
Jessus, because it has somewhat sentimental value to me. Yeah, okay, sure. I can't wait to see sands

479
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,760
and the undertale. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't wait to see the first Munchy porn that you'll ever see.

480
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh my god. Oh my god. All right, team now ladies. Get in there. Okay, people who are like,

481
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,920
oh, what Inktober? Don't you mean digitaltober? Haha, hashtag protest, hashtag digital art is just

482
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,720
as good as traditional art. There's like an alternate hashtag that's like, I don't know. I've

483
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,880
seen people use like spook, spooky, there's like, there's like alternate hashtags that don't imply

484
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,760
ink. And yeah, it totally gets away from, from what Inktober is. So, Inktober is supposed to be

485
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:44,800
specifically an analog. They feel so attacked that people are just like drawing traditionally.

486
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,520
They feel so like under pressure, like someone just in their own home is like making a drawing with

487
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,680
pencils and paper. Don't you know that digital art is real art too? Why are you attacking me like

488
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,040
the violence against their art form really? I think it's just because they want to participate,

489
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,600
but they don't want to like actually pull out pencils and paper. Dude, okay, it doesn't matter.

490
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:11,120
It's not a matter if it like that digital art isn't real art. It's not about having a diverse set of

491
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,960
scales. I mean, I agree. I do whatever I'm just playing devil's advocate. But no, like if Ink,

492
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,600
because like I was under the impression for a while that Inktober was just, just drawing like

493
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,360
black and white with ink, whether it was digital or not, because so many people I saw was doing it

494
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,280
digitally. But then I found out, no, it's supposed to be pen and ink, because like, that's kind of

495
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,960
badass. Like it makes more sense at that point to be a thing. Maybe the reason they're so upset

496
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,600
about this was because when they were a child, there's no control Z in real life and they can't

497
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,560
function without it anymore. They were a young child. These goddamn Zoomers don't know how to draw

498
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,840
with a pen. Yeah, they're walking home from just an average day of Inktober and, you know, holding

499
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:55,120
hands with their parents, you know, who had just been doing some digital drawing that day and still

500
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,480
were using the hashtag Inktober. And then that damn... They've been doing some digital drawing in

501
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:05,200
divorce court. Yes. And then that goddamn hardcore Inktober came out and murdered both their parents

502
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:12,080
and then they became, you know, Batman. It's like, you know, over their body like, no, they were one

503
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:21,600
day from divorce. I was one day away from two Christmases. So close. Listen, I'm not saying

504
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,040
that like I enjoy traditional drawing quite the opposite. It's like a huge pain in the ass from

505
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,480
stuff to finish. I feel the same way. But it's important to have those skills. It's important

506
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,400
to be able to work in whatever medium that you're given, because that will improve your art skills

507
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,640
just across the board. I don't even care so much about that. Like, I feel like you should just do

508
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,000
whatever works for you because like at the end of like it's good if you want to like kind of like

509
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,520
jerk yourself off about like I can do all these harder things. But at the end of the day, the

510
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,720
people who are going to consume the art, they don't care how it's made. They care what the actual

511
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,720
result is. You know what I mean? I don't think you need to do to know how to do traditional,

512
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:05,040
but it can't hurt, right? I just think the conceit of the event is to draw traditionally.

513
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,840
Don't be a fucking faggot and try and intrude on that. Just like if it's supposed to be a

514
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:15,120
traditional drawing thing, do it. If you want us to say like, I don't even have as much of a big

515
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,440
deal with these alternative hashtags. If you just say I want to draw, do a 30-day drawing

516
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,080
challenge this month, but I don't want to do a tober, and you make something else, that's fine too.

517
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,680
I think I'm gonna do like a challenge soon. I don't know. I really, really want to do like a 30-day

518
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:36,880
like page a day challenge. Like soon. Yeah, good. So that I yeah, and it's gonna be really hard.

519
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,400
But I'm not going to do it now, because I don't want it. It's not an Inktober thing,

520
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,080
and it's not supposed to be. So yeah, I will. You know what? Speaking of Inktober,

521
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,080
I want to give a shout out to Nexus Mania, who's doing a four-panel comic for Inktober.

522
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,920
It's fucking great so far. It is really good. I like it. It is really good. 10 out of 10, great

523
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:59,200
shit. I love Nexus Mania's art style. I've only really seen his digi art, but I like how stuff is

524
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,080
put in everything. Hey, I've got. I am games drawing. They did. Oh my god. That I am games was

525
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,320
so good. I've got a rant. You showed me that yesterday. Yeah, I have a specific rant about

526
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,680
Nexus Mania, now that he's come up. Whenever I am games. Nexus Mania, I've got a big problem with

527
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:22,640
you, and this is what it is. I do. It's that you are so good at art, and yet you waste your time

528
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:29,200
making fan art for people like me, people like Tom and Digi. Why are you doing? You should be

529
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,640
using this time. Tom's like abort, abort. No, no, no. Not even, not even at all. I think,

530
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,760
I think this is, this is a good strategy. And let me explain why. Because like what are you

531
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,960
drawing? Like Markiplier or like PewDiePie or someone who matters, you know? Agreed. No, Nate,

532
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,280
you fool. That's like trying to stream Fortnite. It's too saturated. You can't break into the

533
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,760
market. You've got to do something with lesser appeal. He's got this four-panel comic that he's

534
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,560
promoting right now that he's doing for Inktober, which is fucking great. But then he did the

535
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,200
I Am Games thing, and that got like a hundred something likes, that's what brings the people

536
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,960
in. But what does that translate to for the man? Like, what does he get out of this at the end of

537
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,400
the day? It's probably like a five to ten percent retention rate, but like everything's a five

538
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,000
percent retention rate. Nate, what it gets him is that we're talking about him right now. Exactly.

539
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,760
It's a good strategy. Oh, he's going to get a ton of shit from this, which he deserves. This is

540
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,400
how it works. Yeah, he's going to get a lot of shit. He's going to get a whole bunch of hate. Oh,

541
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,480
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Straight to his fucking face. Hey, hey, see you in the car. And then I'm

542
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,160
going to bite bite him because he drew my face, and that's all I care about. Look,

543
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,000
he's a really great artist, and I quite like his stuff. Yeah, that's great. Nexus is unbelievably

544
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,920
good. It doesn't make sense to me. And like, I just, I am constantly astounded that he wastes his

545
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:47,280
time drawing like things of like me and my drugs. Oh, how disgusting. Oh, wait, did he do the one

546
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,680
of you fighting the girl? Yeah, he did that fucking Inktober of me fighting Cynthia, which was

547
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,360
awesome. Yeah, that's him too. Yeah. It's too good, Nexus. I don't deserve it. Hey, what's the name

548
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:02,480
of your fucking Super? What's the name of your fucking Gastrodon? Oh, Doon Koon. Doon Koon the

549
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,240
Gastrodon. Yeah, Doon Koon. We had a Doon Koon in the Pokemon XD Nuzlocke. He was a Clay doll. I

550
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:16,320
think he died. Doon Koon is by like the, he is the God of my run. That and a TTOMZ, the Gyarados.

551
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,920
They always are my two Titans, my two avatars. It's great. I always want to say that like even

552
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,800
really talented artists do fan art like Oda did fucking one or Dragon Ball Z fan art back in the

553
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:36,000
day. It's fun and they enjoy it. And there's nothing wrong with fan art. There's nothing wrong

554
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,240
with fan art as long as you don't have higher aspirations and you're ignoring them to do fan

555
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:47,280
art. That's exactly right. Yeah, as long as it's not, yeah, like you shouldn't, if you want to do,

556
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:54,080
fan art should be a subsidy of what you're trying to do to use as a promotion tool and not take

557
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,280
over your life. Like I ideally, I'd like to do one piece of fan art a month just to continue

558
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,320
perpetuating my brand and have it seep out into the greater zeitgeist of the industry. I actually

559
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,280
haven't done fan art in a long time and I probably should because it is like an important thing for

560
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,160
Yeah, it's a good thing for getting seen but also it's just like it's fun to do and also it's

561
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,800
Yeah, I mean I like it. Like all the fan art I've ever done was stuff that I wanted to do and liked

562
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,600
doing it. Exactly. In the vein of it being good for like promotion, I think it's good even in a

563
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,080
really abstract sense in the way that like if you're drawing fan for something then you like the

564
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,240
property that you're doing the fan art of. And if other people like that, they'll probably like

565
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,240
your art as well because there's probably some sort of like- And also it's a good exercise because

566
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,080
you're drawing something you probably haven't drawn before especially if you're knee deep in a

567
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,880
personal project you're doing the same things over and over again. It gets you to do something

568
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,400
different, breaks it up. My real point was just that like if Nexus or anybody like on their spare

569
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,400
time just wants to like relax and do like a drawing that you know if you're really good it's

570
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,720
going to be really good of something just because you like it a lot, of course that's fine. I just

571
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:05,760
wouldn't want anyone to waste their valuable time on little old me. On you. I agree. That's

572
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,920
literally what I'm saying. The point is less best guy ever fan art, more I am games fan art.

573
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:19,520
Confirm from Nate himself. Tom, what are you now? Like who's like like if we want to say best guy

574
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:26,400
ever then we say best guy ever. What do we call you? Worst guy ever. Worst guy ever. Number one result

575
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,160
on Google image. Confirm. Oh, I guess we call you Polystation 2. I guess that's what we call you.

576
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,040
I don't just- Tom Oliver, it's fine. That's just my name. That's yeah. I've taken the Green Rangers

577
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:44,080
mantle. Someday when I get rich I will buy a show accurate cosplay of the Green Ranger and

578
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,120
go around with it. It'll be fucking sick. You don't have to get a little more jacked first.

579
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,240
Well, that's that's why I'm going to the gym. They pad those out. They pad those suits out,

580
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:59,680
but yeah. Hey, can I tell a story? Yeah, sure. I do I do have something I want to bring up but

581
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,160
I will do it. It was relevant. This is totally irrelevant. Mine is completely a left turn as

582
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:12,000
well so go for it. God damn it. Help. Yeah, I don't have much time. I got to get it out.

583
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,200
Okay, so I would have told this on the last PCP but I wasn't on it. So like two weeks ago

584
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:24,240
I was walking through Harvard Square and I was like waiting what? Harvard Square is cool dude.

585
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,640
Big mistake. Don't go there. Yeah, okay. All right, so I was like headed towards the

586
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:35,280
I was around like the subway entrance and there was a guy right there was like a bald you know

587
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,720
20-something guy kicking kicking around a soccer ball kind of near the subway entrance and he says

588
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,960
hey as I walk by and I'm like hey all right so and I hear him like talk I think a police officer

589
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,720
walks by and like they chit chat or something like he's like he's talking to people right he's

590
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,800
just saying hi to like everyone and then I go and I do whatever it was I was doing I don't know

591
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,440
and like I walk back that way because I'm going to the train and he's says hi to me again he's

592
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:10,560
like hi I'm like a quick and I'm like hey and he's like want to play with me and I'm like well

593
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,440
no I got a train to catch and he's like okay uh do you want my card uh do you want to follow me on

594
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:27,760
Facebook uh and I'm like uh I'll take your card and he's like okay like I got a card I also got

595
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,920
you know like uh I also got a little like like print out here of like my latest uh like blog

596
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,760
entries and I'm like a print out and I'm like and I'm like you know what I'll take that don't

597
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,280
give me the card give me the full one give me like the full pamphlet I want to I want to I want to

598
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,320
read more and he's like okay here you go and I'm like thanks I'll read it on the train so I did

599
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,120
right uh so I don't know I'm just gonna I'm gonna start reading I won't read the whole thing but

600
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:56,800
let me just I'll just try and pick out what's in ready for this uh is it okay to say like real human

601
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,360
beings names on the show just do what would they rhyme with I mean I mean this is a guy who's looking

602
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,160
to self-promote so I think it's okay I guess I mean you're doing him a favor technically right like

603
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,680
this is okay I'm doing it I'm doing okay I'm doing it don't make fun of the train guy fans of the

604
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:18,000
PCB don't make fun of the train guys listen listen I'm not even making fun of him I I think he's

605
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:26,240
complex right okay I think he's value I think that I think that a lot of him I think that there's

606
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,640
a lot to recommend him all right I'm not being ironic I just want to say right off the bat like

607
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,040
this seems like a ridiculous thing to do but him handing you a pamphlet of his paper bloods is now

608
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:41,120
putting him in front of potentially almost 20,000 people right he's he lucked out he lucked out with

609
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:49,920
me that's um all right the saga of Jeff continues dot dot dot my recent trip to Mexico Cuba and Canada

610
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,360
my name around my name jeffrey thomas ferrell facebook

611
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:04,240

612
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,360
to facebook things which I assume have like the same the same information and videos and stuff

613
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,960
part one mexico first I went to mexico mexico city specifically my flight from boston was on

614
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:24,640
may 11th 2018 there was a layover in dallas I used air b&b for lodging I got a room for about

615
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:30,480
ten dollars a night in venustiano caranza right near the airport some of the places I frequented

616
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:39,600
were the park on caye oriente 172 and caye oriente 168 mercado moctezuma white and black coffee

617
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:48,160
and herbal life club nutricional on nte 33 what did I do in mexico well first I concentrated on

618
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,600
learning spanish I taught english for free to various people in mercado moctezuma dude you know

619
00:56:53,600 --> 00:57:00,160
he just walked up to people and said like do you want to learn english friend uh yeah wait yeah

620
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,280
yeah I used to see this guy's not a qualified teacher in any way so he was probably just like

621
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,600
he walks up to someone and says hello and they're like uh like I don't I don't you might that seems

622
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:15,040
to be his go-to strategy in general I mean listen I don't want to I don't want to input if this is

623
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:21,600
interesting I'll keep reading but like or should I just should I just like cut out snippets yeah I

624
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:27,280
guess snippets I don't yeah okay okay um later on I started playing soccer in the local park I

625
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,120
would most of the play teenagers but sometimes I would play with kids and adults they would often

626
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:36,000
cheer me on and call me quote gringo what they call white people from the US I don't think it's

627
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,600
I don't think it's what they're trying to cheer you on I don't think that's like oh like oh gringo

628
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:45,840

632
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,040
codes clearly yeah I played chess with people in mexico but I played soccer more often it was easier

633
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,880
and more convenient to hop into soccer games and try and convince people to play me in chess

634
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,040
I did however play some chess in the airport and with people in some of the stores apparently this

635
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,320
guy like apparently he's tried to like make money by like challenging people to later on in here he

636
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:22,000
talks about how like he wants to like bet money for for on chess games with people but Americans

637
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,880
or Bostonians specifically just aren't willing to bet more than like a dollar at a time okay uh

638
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:32,240
oh yeah using blah blah blah blah okay something about Cuba I think this is already on dude can

644
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:05,600
we're gonna get silly we might we might poke a little bit fun I want that to translate and then

645
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,400

647
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:28,240
.ferrell.9699 okay all right .9699 toward the end of my stay in Mexico I I moved into a five

648
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:33,520
dollar a night room in a different house this house was very close to the other house I stayed at

649
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:39,440
unlike the first location I was allowed to invite guests to my room at will here I brought Mexican

650
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:48,560
women back to my room and played them in chess haha is that a euphemism perhaps he

651
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:53,840
he I like to imagine that that he like actually did do that and and he was like he was like I mean

652
00:59:53,840 --> 01:00:00,240
I pass it off I was only more than it was yeah no I think well here he continues yeah speaking

653
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,840
speaking of women on average the women in Mexico City are more flirtatious than women in Boston

654
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,760
I suspect it is because gringos are highly sought after there don't get me wrong a lot of women

655
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,600
don't get me wrong a lot of women I hung out with were just friends the thing was I was clearly

656
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,880
getting much more attention in Mexico City than Boston now here I am sitting in both in the Boston

657
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:31,600
area 26 and single haha haha I like that that's a right that that's a real right my friend I like

658
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:39,040
I like that part a lot um I was in Mexico City I'm skipping ahead a little bit uh one culture

659
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,000
difference is smoking is more popular here than in Boston for example no one in my family smokes

660
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,680
I was in Mexico City for about three months and I learned the bulk of my Spanish there

661
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:54,160
by the end of my stay I could say much more than keres hugar ad adres conmigo which I'm pretty

662
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,760
sure means do you want to play chess with me um he he lot he says that he lost weight quickly in

663
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:05,280
Mexico even though he was eating the same amount I bought a few shirts in Mexico City like the Mario

664
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,320
shirt and a duff one I also made a ton of friends there to the degree it felt necessary to write

665
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,160
many of my facebook posts in Spanish my facebook page is by this is getting a little tedious what

666

703
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,240
no I'm talking about the guy you met that's jeff fucking jeff yeah oh the train I mean I would

704
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:05,040
consider him the soccer guy oh he was soccer guy he was I mean yeah he was hanging out near a subway

705
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,800
entrance but he was his most dramatic features are just kicking a soccer ball um that's his character

706
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,120
design he can't see with that he can't see the soccer ball else the silhouette doesn't convey

707
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,360
there is uh there is one I want to leave I want to read the postlude so at the very end he links to

708
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:26,960
some you know links to um you know he says he's moved he's back in America he's living in his

709
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,720
family's house with like the rest of his family um he says uh a few days after returning to

710
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:37,680
deadam for the first time in my life I'm noticing some gray hairs which is quite unusual giving my age

711
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:43,120
26 and heredity it's not that unusual uh the people here also don't appreciate my soccer playing as

712
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,720
much as in other countries some people are quite nice though and they take videos when I request

713
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:53,120
them my plans I'm looking for quick cash I could get yeah I could get a formal job same brother same

714
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:59,280
aren't we all I could get a formal job but that takes more time so I'm considering these options

715
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,040
in order of preference one panhandling while juggling my soccer ball in downtown Boston

716
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,760
Chinatown or Harvard I think you thought about me so apparently he went with that one yeah apparently

717
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,000
he went with that one yeah two playing chess for money in Harvard Square the people in Harvard

718
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,440
Square often make very small wagers over games they play five dollars less I I kind of want to go back

719
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,880
because like I think he's got a schedule of times he'll be there go back dude I might go back or like

720
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,520
maybe challenge him to a chess game like literally do it literally do it wait yeah is there any

721
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:34,160
reason why we can't go to Boston when we're in person get him and take him back to your apartment

722
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:39,040
to record rfck is there any reason why we can't do that I mean he'd have to consent to it that's

723
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,960
that's the only hurdle I can see a hurdle right there but you know we have ways of getting around

724
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,680
that Jeff I know you're listening to this let's make this my people talk to your people Jeff we'll

725
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:54,000
get this going and then and then three freelance programming work on craigslist or a similar site

726
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,960
I've done this a couple times but the gigs are hard to come by program for uh yeah he apparently he

727
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,520
saved up money for travel by working a programming job and he mentioned this earlier in the thing but

728
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:08,160
I skipped it and therefore teaching Spanish the problem with this is that my Spanish is quite

729
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:14,800
bad compared to native speakers why I feel damn this this cursive fate why why couldn't I just speak

730
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:21,040
fluent Spanish and I feel uncomfortable teaching something I'm bad at well imagine that unlike

731
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:28,560
other people and you did school teachers stop you yeah all right so that's Jeff so that's Jeff

732
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:35,760
Pharrell uh an oddball vagrant that I met in a legend Jeff I mean this unironically he sounds

733
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,840
fascinating I wanted yeah yeah okay yeah and they're on the Grayson no it just imagine it just

734
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:46,640
and that starts us out at like a train station yeah well I mean it takes all like imagine just

735
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:52,240
like flying to Mexico and like hanging out in the fucking like town square kicking like juggling

736
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:57,440
a soccer ball like meeting like kids and adults and stuff and like playing them and women and luring

737
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,680
them back to your house to play chess with you yeah yeah yeah sounds like you know scold them I mean

738
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:10,320
I mean the the way that he the way that he was just like hi like at me twice like right yeah like

739
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,240
two times I passed him and both times he was just like hi and the second time he was just like want

740
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:20,160
to play with me like this I don't know you know okay you know what it's gonna sound like it's gonna

741
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,920
sound like an insult to say that he seems like a little autistic or a little off or something but I

742
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:30,320
don't mean it in a bad way it seems like this is this is like missing that's what this is he's not

743
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:34,640
in tune with his inhibitions like normal people would be like scared or worried if you do that in

744
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:39,440
public this seems like this guy just doesn't give a fuck and he just wants to go out he is a respectable

745
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:46,080
thing yeah yeah yeah have you guys heard the theory that we're surrounded by NPC characters in our

746
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:51,360
lives and that a lot of people around us don't have souls because there was a there was a set number

747
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:56,480
of souls in the universe and you see we just keep expanding the human population and so not everybody

748
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:01,760
has one you know there's one soul it's the same soul reincarnated across time and every individual

749
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:08,960
transubstantiation I invented it Nate give me I have somewhat related to this I've I've

750
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:14,320
along because like there's always that that uh that theory that like we're in a simulation

751
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:20,000
and all that shit yeah yeah right and so like even before I heard about this like NPC thing I always

752
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,800
wondered about the simulation because there are many times that I'll just be out and about and I

753
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,200
will notice like people just randomly walking around that seem to have almost identical faces to

754
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:33,680
people I've seen before and it feels like the random character generator is like starting to loop

755
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:40,240
it's like terrifying yeah so often I will see someone and think okay I said this to a friend

756
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:44,960
the other day and they laughed at me because in a way it's obvious I said lots of people look like a

757
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:50,400
combination of two other people which was sure was dumb because everyone has two parents that

758
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,240
they're a combination of but that's not what I mean fair enough I mean that all the time I'll see

759
01:09:54,240 --> 01:10:00,000
someone was like oh that looks like you know you know my friend my friend Tom and my friend John

760
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,800
that looks like a combination of you know if anyone looks happy and and so and so or something or

761
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,360
that looks like well my instincts tell me about that which is probably true is that we kind of

762
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,760
pick out features that are recognizable and the people that we know in our lives I'm sure it's

763
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,240
it's like that I mean because like we're humans are great at patterns so I'm sure yeah we just

764
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:22,720
ascribe that to it but it just it feels weird to just be out and about and being seeing like someone

765
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:28,320
who's clearly not that person that looks almost identical but like here they are in a completely

766
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:34,320
different scenario and situation and it's just like oh god oh god I'm starting to see NPCs repeat

767
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:41,680
themselves this is this is pretty fucked up and it's terrifying ever since I saw the Truman show

768
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,320
I've always been afraid that like I'm in the Truman show but like a virtual reality version

769
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:52,400
that's way more like intense and like sure yeah yeah and it's just like made me and like it's like

770
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:58,560
oh god everything's a lie and and ever since I saw that movie it's always in the back of my mind

771
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,360
and uh it's not even that I think like I'm that important it's just like a terrifying thing to

772
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,880
me to think like this whole thing's a joke and everyone's watching me all the time okay I'm about

773
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:15,120
to speak in really cynical like vocabulary but I do not mean it in like a mean sort of way

774
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:21,440
whenever I see those sort of people like like like soccer guy I always think like I realized too late

775
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,800
that it would be fun to not like mess with him but I would describe as like mine him to be able to

776
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:34,000
like talk to him and like exhaust his dialogue options yeah yeah yeah yeah like like like like

777
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,360
like a quest person and I want to I realized too late that I what I should be doing instead of just

778
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:43,440
saying like oh like no like no things just you know and walking away or instead of just like you know

779
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,440
like someone looks like it means like hey I have a dollar I'm like uh yeah okay and then what's the

780
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:52,080
what is it I should talk to him what's that what's that alt rfc k it's the pissy baby something

781
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,880
fucker fappers right I feel like that's the pissy baby route just be like yeah no I gotta go

782
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,200
I can't stay as opposed to the rowdy fucker who'd get in there dude and make a best friend

783
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:05,280
yeah it's like it's like a pissy baby fapper fuckers there's also the adult baby diaper lover yeah

784
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,080
hey does my mic sound weird because my my computer just made a weird noise at me and now I'm

785
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:15,920
worried you sound fine to me right I sound fine yeah okay then yeah it's okay yeah it looks it looks

786
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,800
alright okay it's not only a matter of me like not wanting to it's just a matter of like oh wait

787
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,640
fuck that was one of the people that I can do that too it's like you can't do that to just like

788
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,640
everyone it's not like when if you someone says hi to you it's gonna be a normal person like

789
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,960
if someone's got a guitar and they're asking for money they might have a story they might just be

790
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,560
like a cynical you know just like oh you're trying to make a quick buck you know by lying to people

791
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,720
or whatever but I think I think there's a very good chance that people like that like street

792
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:47,040
performers are like fucked up weirdos not in a bad way clearly just they're just fucked up weirdos

793
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:52,080
and it would be fun to talk to them and I just it's a real issue like if you see somebody like

794
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,480
that they clearly have a story yeah and there's so many opportunities that you're passing up

795
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,720
by not investing this guy's definitely got a story it's like it's like a massive like what what

796
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:06,320
compelled him what compelled him to travel to Mexico Cuba and I forget what the third one is and

797
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:11,520
juggle his soccer ball in a public square it's it's what compels him to do it even now what what's

798
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,200
his deal like how did you get from like a normal human upbringing to this it's it's it's it's just

799
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,480
you know you know exactly we're the ones all stuck in the box and he's the one thinking outside

800
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:26,720
I would agree it completely that's why I was like no fuck don't give me your card give me your full

801
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:31,920
fucking printout yeah yeah I want the full story he's clearly much more free than we are yeah I mean

802
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,080
that's true well for a while it seems like he's run out of money and now he's moved back home

803
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,280
another plane but he's his spirit is still free he can always get another program a job somewhere

804
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:49,520
I'm sure yeah right yeah well what a fascinating experience to hand out your blog entries printed

805
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,320
out in public like this is going to return on investment you know doing that if he gets on

806
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,720
that's what I wonder I wonder if he thinks I like I wonder if this has any like monetary return for

807
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:06,480
him or if he thinks it's going to or if it's just a social show well yeah yeah he's gonna make bank

808
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,160
off of that yeah it's good it's gonna be it's gonna get that sick we're gonna pay him an exposure

809
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:14,720
and then he's gonna get tons of fun not to draw a particularly unfavorable comparison on purpose

810
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:20,240
but like this does sound fairly similar to the like need gf sign that chris chan would hold up and

811
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:26,400
kind of you know well only only vagus sessions no but well I wouldn't say it's malicious it's just

812
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,800
creepy like that I'm not even trying to say he's creepy I just mean it well well chris was being

813
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,040
creepy holding up a sign that's like come and talk to me if you want to be my girlfriend like I

814
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:40,080
don't know it's so creepy though I think it's not gonna work obviously uh yeah I think it's just

815
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,200
such a social it's not malicious it's not bad it's not evil but yeah it's it's icky and it's like

816
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:50,000
what what I mean what are you doing yeah that that's fair this guy I just I don't know I don't

817
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,960
know what the end goal is here I wonder I wonder if it's just like it's like just very raw and

818
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,520
honest it's just like I want to share this stuff that's why I put it on Facebook and now I'm bringing

819
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,720
it out into like the real world you know I'm sharing my Facebook post in the meat yeah I have a I have

820
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:11,760
a crazy crazy theory maybe he just wants to make friends because friends are good I'm staying

821
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:17,040
in valuable and increase the worth of your life maybe that's why I thought of the question can you

822
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:25,360
imagine because someone like chan would want friends but no cuz because yeah we have a sign

823
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,640
like advertising himself like for friendship you know with a girl but still same no me it's not

824
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,120
the same at all totally different totally different alright this is what this is literally

825
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:40,560
out of no no no no no no no no no he's out he's out no he's out he's not the same as

826
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,480
fucking with a girlfriend this is why it's different I don't get it this is why it's

827
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:50,080
It's different because with Chris Chan. He's saying he's like imposing like you become my girlfriend

828
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:56,080
What what this guy's doing? He's just putting himself out there. Yeah letting you come to him. It's totally different

829
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,780
But but he's just doing that too. He's letting you come to him

830
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:04,540
No, because because Christian is starting with an ass. He's saying like be my girlfriend

831
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:09,580
Yeah, I was saying like be my friend. He's just saying hey, I would say that I want to play soccer

832
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:17,160
I would say that the implication of Chris's sign is that anything less than a romantic connection is

833
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:21,700
Unwanted and unwelcome sure okay, but like this guy. I'm sure this guy

834
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:25,240
I'm sure if this guy got a girlfriend from doing what he's doing. That would be fine

835
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:30,540
I'm sure if he had sex with a lady. Yeah, or whatever wink or better yet

836
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:35,020
Play chess that would that would be fine. Yeah, or playing chess in his hotel room

837
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:41,640
This guy is like just looking for any kind of interaction. It's sort of as little as like taking a piece of paper to like maybe

838
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,800
I'm being on a podcast. Maybe it's just maybe there's no business goal here

839
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:51,480
Maybe it's just as simple as go out there, you know panhandling because he says panhandling in the thing

840
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:55,760
Yeah, go out there, you know have a hat like if people want to give you money to juggle

841
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:03,020
So it's the soccer ball meet people and be social and you know reap the benefits that come with that

842
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:08,740
Generally seems totally fine. Whatever they may be. I want to move this from joke to reality

843
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:14,440
Literally, can we like if we see him in a harper's grave cuz I'm sure we would go there anyway regardless

844
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,480
Let's really get him in our an RFC camp. So there's no reason not to let's I really

845
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,020
Really doubt that he's gonna be down to come

846
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,840
Like hey do you like me on a blog? Do you want to be on a let's play with us? I

847
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,480
Don't think that would I think I think he's the kind of guy that would go for that

848
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,320
I guess I guess we could ask

849
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,800
Let's ask I don't see it. I don't see it working say is yes, and then murder you

850
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,880
Cuz he's probably got plans

851
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:51,200
He's got big plans. Okay. I think he's the type of person who would have a free calendar and be down to not only just come on

852
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,360
This let's play for fun, but also to like push his

853
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,880
He says he needs a permit

854
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,620
I think that he's got a permit and he's probably got a plan

855
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:05,740
He's gonna be there from such-and-such time to such-and-such time

856
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:14,540
When he's free, I don't know maybe maybe I think we should ask I think we should definitely ask him can't hurt

857
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:19,220
This might be the adult baby diaper that we don't I don't see it working out

858
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:21,920
I don't see it working out. I'd be surprised if we can

859
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:28,820
If nothing else you should just do something for rowdy fuckers on the spot right there

860
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,840
I

861
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:36,440
Seems to like he seems to like strangers taking videos of him. I mean there you go

862
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:40,620
We could just record ourselves playing. Oh, they will be a let's play of soccer. We can just we need to stop

863
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:44,600
Let's play. Oh, let's just let's play time to talk, you know

864
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,700
Yeah, all right. All right guys the only way this will fail if he sees not there

865
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:51,200
We will get some sort of RBCK content if he's there even if it's just us record

866
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:55,660
Yeah, I think he's got a schedule

867
01:18:56,420 --> 01:19:03,720
Maybe or you can just message him on Facebook. That's true. We have this contact. Oh god. We could do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

868
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:08,340
What's his Facebook? I've got a link. I'll post it later. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've got you

869
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:17,440
So that's so that's Jeff that's Jeff the soccer guy. Yeah, what what a what a legend

870
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:23,040
What what a what a what a sick dude coming soon to a podcast near you. I sure hope so

871
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:29,040
I wait with baited breath. That would be pretty that'd be pretty neat. That would be pretty fucking neat. Well team

872
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,920
What do you say? We just transition to questions now? I feel like we've really done a bunch of good shit here and

873
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,720
I don't know high note. Yeah. Yeah

874
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,820
That's a good idea. All right. All right sick. Let me uh

875
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:45,000
He's not up there at the pantheon of the likes of like Colt Corona and

876
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,880
I don't know. He's a great PCP character. That's right. He's going to be the wrong one real quick. If he's on the RFCK

877
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,880
He's going to be in the next round

878
01:19:54,360 --> 01:20:01,520
I mean, can we give him a soccer ball or something? Maybe. Yeah. All right. All right. Soccer guy soccer guy's soccer outfit

879
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:06,800
I don't know or what is it? It's uh, so everybody voice mails. Here we go

880
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,280
Oh, I didn't ask for questions in the in the lounge. I'll do that right now. Oh, yeah, I do it

881
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,840
You know what we're skipping Twitter this week. Fuck you people pity questions are dead

882
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:20,840
No, okay. Yeah, we have a boy have a better way. Yeah, you know what?

883
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,400
I am out of pity this week just because I forgot so sorry everybody

884
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,720
But I didn't tell you that there'd be any questions. So you haven't lost anything. All right. There you go

885
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:31,800
I feel like I feel like audio questions carry us like pretty far

886
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:38,360
We've got quite a few things that say like just literally stop doing the text questions and we could definitely possibly

887
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:45,880
Yeah, I mean, I've been thinking that maybe they're just like this is just a better way. Yeah, let's just

888
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,280
Let's just cancel it. Let's cancel text questions. Why don't you go cancel that?

889
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,160
Okay, okay, I'm literally going to say actually never mind literally. I'm typing it to canceled

890
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:04,440
All right, I'm sure I'm doing it hang on where can our viewers go to ask us an audio question

891
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,400
They can go to speak pipe comm slash

892
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:12,000
PCP voicemail, right? Correct. Yeah, that's the one. That's where you go people

893
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
All right

894
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,720
Shit everyone's freaking out now that we're never doing again

895
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,760
Who cares if they got a question they can ask it in speak pipe

896
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,200
Okay, here I go. All right. Here we go first question

897
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:31,880
We got to check in of course with with one spar on his continuing quest to do something very true

898
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:36,280
Yeah, I feel like I'm out of out of touch with the saga. Yeah

899
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:43,600
He was like he was arrested by the police last episode. I think because he was trying to get in starbucks time stamps

900
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,960
Oh, yeah, that's right. He was kicked out of Starbucks as he was using the public Wi-Fi

901
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:53,720
The whole quest is one spot to get all the time stamps if every time we've mentioned Starfleet

902
01:21:53,720 --> 01:22:00,720
Yeah on this podcast which one spot that yeah, we have we haven't we did have a reference to Starfleet in this episode

903
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,800
That's rich did offhand. I don't know if that counts. So that's what uh, so

904
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,960
That last week he got a he got arrested at Starbucks before he was at an insane asylum

905
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:14,840
Yeah, he's just he's like bleeding out the eyes and they took him to a regular hospital and that's how he escaped

906
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,760
He just needs those time stamps man. This is very we don't know why he needs them yet

907
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,960
It is no no the mystery about that. All right. Let's let's let's go to the let's go to the thing

908
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,920
All right, let's see what you got once bar late late honest friend

909
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:38,560
Those guys who were cops they had some red shirts on I broke my legs and they threw me woods

910
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:43,000
But that's not the worst part. That's like the document. There's like there's like almost no time stamps

911
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Oh, man, I'm really discouraged right now

912
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:53,480
In fact, if I if I got even one piece of constructive criticism no matter how valid it would break my will to live for sure

913
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,480
I

914
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:03,880
The PCP I'm gonna play real quick. Okay one spot the number of Google search results is not a data point

915
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,880
I

916
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:26,760
Putting actual effort into his question that's a one-spot one-spot weekly set the bar too high for any of the rest of you

917
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,480
Please help this man with his time stamp shit

918
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,520
Where's like post in the comments one spar like where they can?

919
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:36,320
I don't know where this document is with the updates. I assume it's on somewhere

920
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,720
I guess we could put it in the show notes. Yeah, we maybe we should

921
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,880
Yeah, all right. Well anyway, let's move along here. We've got another one here from

922
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:54,120
Tomaso Choco Choco another favorite Ohio Ohio to you Choco. Let's let's see what you have to say years ago

923
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,040
I was at a slumber party

924
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:59,880
My friend said hey, we got cinematics. Let's stay up late and watch porn

925
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:05,080
I said, all right, so we stayed up late and we started watching the porn now

926
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:09,680
I was the channel god. I hope this isn't going because I think it's second and work half the time

927
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,480
So while I was sitting there

928
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,000
I heard my friends like arguing for a bit and then it got weirdly quiet

929
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,720
So I was like, all right, what the fuck's going on?

930
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:23,480
So I turn around and my friend's mouth is an inch away from my other friend's dick

931
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:30,840
And as soon as his lips touch that dick come just shoots into his mouth and you start screaming and

932
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,080
Crying and everything we're trying to get him to shut the fuck up

933
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,760
but through the commotion we got caught and

934
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,360
he had to swallow the cum because

935
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:48,960
Because his dad is a pastor. Can you imagine a worse thing to see what was in his mouth? Oh

936
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
What was the gayest thing you've ever experienced?

937
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,480
This voicemail

938
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,360
I've never uh-huh

939
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:07,920
Experienced anything anywhere close to that gay, you know not not and I never will knock on wood

940
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,520
Yeah, let's let's pray for that

941
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,960
I mean there is that story that I've told before about how me and my buddy John college roommates

942
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,920
You're just both lying in bed, you know across from each other. Yeah. Yeah, look

943
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,160
I know it's that look we're in two separate beds across the room

944
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,880
What was it?

945
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:29,760
John just says to me hey like it like we're both, you know tucked in ready to go to sleep

946
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,720
He's just like hey, dude my dick's out right now. He had like under the blankets

947
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:37,440
He had taken out his dick and I just say oh you do it. I'm gonna do it, too

948
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:41,720
I yelled to him across the room and he's like no don't do it. We'll be gay and by the time

949
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:45,020
I got mine out luckily his was was tucked away safely so we weren't

950
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:50,220
Narrowly avoided being gay a happy ending

951
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,780
Anybody else

952
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,820
I don't think I've ever been gay

953
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:05,100
Everyone thought I was gay, but I didn't actually I mean I mean I mean I was gay in the sense that I was a faggot

954
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,100
But I don't know if I was gay

955
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:14,180
Yeah, I guess I guess I guess the only kind of gay thing I've experienced is what I was telling Ben when he was over

956
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:22,580
We were getting Wendy's was that uh that I I'm on tinder. Yeah, and and since since I am bisexual or as I call it part-time gay

957
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:27,380
I found out you're a you're a you're a fair-weather faggot

958
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:31,180
Agreed agreed

959
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:37,940
That one for sure. That's a good one. So so I've just found out that I'm either I think gay guys are just much more desperate

960
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:42,180
Because I'm much more popular with gay and then with women men in general desperate for sure

961
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:46,220
Men I mean men are just more. I mean I'm desperate. That's why I'm on tender fair enough

962
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:51,940
Yeah, like men are just willing to fuck way more easier than I mean men men just men just are men are more proactive men are

963
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:57,980
Expect men have to initiate the conversation almost all the time. Yeah, it's very sense make sense. Yeah. Well, all right

964
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:02,260
You're well on your way. Yeah, and I guess that carries over to the gay sphere as well

965
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:10,040
Let's see. Okay, so here's another message. Oh, yeah, I think the gayest thing I've ever experienced was one time

966
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:13,680
I was like, I don't even know what I was doing. I was just hanging out behind my my middle school

967
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,600
And someone came up to me and said so like you're gay, right?

968
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:22,720
You're gay. Just wanted to make sure like you're gay, right? Wait, was this a man saying this? Yeah, this is another man

969
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,720
And I was like no

970
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:34,020
And then they was like, okay cool, and then he went away I in high school

971
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,420
There was a girl who wanted to date me

972
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:40,500
Yeah, and I didn't and and we went on a date to the mall and I didn't really like her

973
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:47,320
She asked if she could kiss me and I said no well and yeah, and I wasn't feeling it and

974
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:56,420
She tried to she's she you know she utterly devastated me my reputation by spreading the the heinous rumor that I was gay

975
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:00,060
It didn't stick at all and it meant nothing

976
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:06,380
You know, I found it mildly amusing that an attempt made was was made

977
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:09,580
Yeah, I feel I doesn't go anywhere

978
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:16,980
I almost sort of see why she might think that if she thinks that she's attractive and it doesn't make you know

979
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,660
Yeah, it's like oh he must be gay. Maybe it wasn't delicious really. I don't know

980
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,620
I mean you're spreading a rumor

981
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:26,700
I mean even if you think even if you think it's well even if you think it's true

982
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:32,820
If like you're going around being like oh that guy that was a way to protect her ego like she could have just said immediately

983
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:38,020
When you said no, it's like oh is it I mean nobody had to know nobody had to know that this has maybe I mean

984
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:41,380
Maybe she told her friends, right? That's all you know. Oh, you know, he's gay

985
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:45,140
It's he must just be gay or else he would have and then the chatterboxes begin and then

986
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:52,740
Oh, yeah girl. Oh, he's oh, he's definitely gay. There's no other reason why he would have snubbed you like that. Oh, yeah

987
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:56,140
Yeah, well, okay. Well, he's fucking gay. Yeah, and he's a denny's a jerk, too

988
01:28:57,020 --> 01:29:00,660
Yes, yes, yeah, also he did try to rape me that was

989
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,860
Well, that was true. That one was true

990
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:10,460
I guess he thought that it was a guy or something because like yeah, he tried to rape me still so I don't know what's going on there

991
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:16,300
Excellent. Oh, there was that like I guess this was also pretty gay

992
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:20,460
There was just that one time that someone comes out. I didn't have gay sex. I forgot about that girl

993
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,620
Well, yeah, Nate that see that girl over there

994
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:27,060
She wants to date you and I just sit there say okay, and then do nothing. I did nothing

995
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:33,200
I didn't exactly reject my mind. Did nothing kind of reminds me of the girl in only yesterday

996
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:39,220
I mean like the girls the girls march up to her in lockstep and they announce like so and so has a crush on you

997
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:41,860
They run away. She's like

998
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:44,220
Okay, oh dear

999
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:49,940
I don't know, you know women. It's like it's different. I guess because there's like different standards for this stuff

1000
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:54,960
I don't know whatever because it's different for girls. Everything's apparently all right

1001
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,580
Let's play another one is here's one from ironclad argument. Let's uh

1002
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:06,780
Is this guy's name? So I'm listening to the podcast and I hear did you come out with this like ironclad argument?

1003
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:10,860
Name drop. Why do I have to be smart? What's the benefit?

1004
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:19,180
Right, why do I need to know things you're so smart did you but I don't know where everyone turns his back on them

1005
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,540
and starts saying

1006
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,380
Cuz it's cuz it's good to be smart

1007
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:32,980
You know, it's a good way to have arguments and truly know things

1008
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:38,860
Not be smart and continue to ask ask why instead of answer the question

1009
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:42,940
Did you what the fuck kind of argument is that? Oh my god? I got a fucking hemorrhoid

1010
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,580
Yeah, all right, so so

1011
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:53,260
Did you was arguing as he does that like was this last episode?

1012
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:57,940
Okay, okay, I can't remember why something something we were talking about

1013
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:01,220
Did you was saying you don't need to read books because you can just

1014
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:06,620
The argument against was like books give you more context you can understand the idea is better

1015
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:10,180
Yeah, did you is like if I know what the idea is why do I have to understand it?

1016
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:13,100
Why do I need to be smart? I'm just another one of those stupid things

1017
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:16,620
You just have to push under the rug and be like I guess I could still be his friend

1018
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:24,140
I guess so great if it's so great to not be smart if being smart is so bad then why then

1019
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:30,740
Mr. Ironclad did you say that the idea that you should be smart is dumb

1020
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:36,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought that was sarcasm. I thought he was

1021
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:43,700
Yeah, yeah, okay, so I'm his master plan right

1022
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,500
I'll be smart enough to follow that but yes, I'll explain it for you

1023
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,980
Here's one

1024
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:53,620
Digi's Digi's an idiot. There we go

1025
01:31:54,340 --> 01:32:00,940
The comments from the last episode as they appear currently and in my present may not be for your present viewer

1026
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:07,620
But they're basically all just WTF the PCP is good now question mark and also did you what the fuck are you talking about?

1027
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,420
To comments that we get. Oh, yeah

1028
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:17,140
You know what you know, it's great. You know, it's great about the setup like cuz we we the episodes go up on Fridays, right?

1029
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,000
Yeah, that's right. That's right

1030
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,280
That means that like people will listen to it on Friday then right after that they can go to the

1031
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:28,020
Whatever I forget the site, but the one where you send your email or your audio mail

1032
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:32,820
Yeah, yeah, like you can send it like right after you listen and then we record the next episode like a day after that

1033
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,820
Yeah, yeah, right

1034
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:41,820
Yeah, yeah, it's almost like that was intended so we could get back shortly before we record I see I see well

1035
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,820
I'm sure that no one I know

1036
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:50,020
Here's another message from our good friend at DeVry University

1037
01:32:51,740 --> 01:33:00,100
What do you got no you hit this is please discuss the fetishization of autism. Oh

1038
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:02,020
Oh

1039
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:03,260
Yeah, that's it

1040
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:08,980
That's the whole time. I want to say shout out shout out to shout out to John Boyce on YouTube

1041
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:14,940
He's got a video about the history of the highest scoring basketball game ever I think

1042
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:21,460
And it features one of the teams involved was the DeVry University basketball team

1043
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:28,380
Which almost doesn't really exist but sort of but does just enough does that they technically did take part in

1044
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:33,540
Technically the highest scoring basketball game of all time does DeVry University even still exist at all

1045
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:39,780
I think so I believe it does. Yeah, and it and some of its campuses might even have a basketball team

1046
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,900
I don't know what DeVry University is. Is this like a 1980s?

1047
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:48,980
No, they're a no it was like one of those for-profit colleges and they advertise on TV

1048
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:57,540
If you want to be like you guys you want to design video games come to DeVry University, you know one of those guys

1049
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:01,420
Yeah, yeah, I think the reason I don't think they exist anymore is I just don't watch TV

1050
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:04,620
So I haven't seen an ad for DeVry in literally years. Yeah

1051
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:11,580
See then to watch TV after like obviously not and be on the air and being able to have ad block on and just

1052
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:16,020
Yeah, whatever you want. It is cancer. It's like strapping. It's like strapping

1053
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,860
you know how the thing in

1054
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:23,460
In the Fantastic Four of Fantastic Four fame he is the thing where he's made of rocks

1055
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:26,580
But there's also an effect where like because he's being turned to stone

1056
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:31,340
It has an effect on his mind and it's hard for him to think and it like slows down his thoughts admit

1057
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:34,660
Which is kind of fucked up and like watching TV has that effect on me

1058
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:40,280
Like my brain morphs and becomes solid and can't like it smooths out the wrinkles you guys all those wrinkles

1059
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:44,300
Smooth write the fuck out. What a shame. Yeah, that's what it does

1060
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:50,820
I mean, I haven't turned on a television just to watch like broadcast or net or cable television and yeah

1061
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:52,620
I can't even remember. I don't I don't even remember

1062
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,620
My mom's watching TV so

1063
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:02,580
It'll be interesting to see what like it's like for like our kids when they're like like what are they gonna grow up?

1064
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:07,900
Consuming media with will they be on YouTube? Will they be on Netflix? They'll be on Twitch watching their favorite

1065
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:15,580
They'll be watching their dad stream

1066
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:21,300
Dragon Warrior monsters yeah tonight on twitch.tv slash st. Comics with an X

1067
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:32,420
Well to answer the question the fetishization of autism is that like when you've got like a really dumb anime girl with like really big tits

1068
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:38,940
Is that I think what he means is the idea that autism is now seen as like as like a

1069
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:42,680
pseudo good thing or potentially a good thing or like like

1070
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:50,620
That gives people superpowers in certain contexts. You know who's into this. You know who's way into that did you?

1071
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:58,900
I thought he was referring specifically to digi and I think did you said that he talked about it on like a pub crawl or something

1072
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:02,900
I'm kind of glad the digi's not here because I don't want to hear his answer to this question

1073
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:11,620
Fuck that I mean, I don't know like I think digi is not wrong that like it could be like it's useful

1074
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:24,180
Like did you just uses the autism as a synonym for new types from Gundam so anytime you hear autism just

1075
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,980
Have very few similarities between

1076
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:40,980
Autism have their strengths, you know, they have things that they're hyper focused on and drives them to to you know to great knowledge

1077
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:48,580
Okay, not to be I'm not trying to get overly

1078
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:53,820
Critical whatever like I feel like if you asked like the mother of an autistic child like hey

1079
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:59,140
What do you think about like your kid having autism? I don't think they'd be so positive. I don't think you like no

1080
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:01,140
I think it would depend. I mean

1081
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,220
Yeah, well here's the thing dude

1082
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:08,780
Millennials can have kids now and millennials like if you're like a super progressive leftist millennial

1083
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:11,220
You bet that they're not gonna say anything bad about it

1084
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:18,260
Okay, that's somewhat of a warp perception because I think even baby boomers would be like my son

1085
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:23,140
What what do you like autism isn't that bad my son my son can do anything that another another boy can do

1086
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:27,140
Yeah, you know, he's not he's he's just you know, he's a little different. He learns a little differently

1087
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:34,900
You know, he's very smart. They do believe that I'm sure I agree with you that it must be some part of some people's minds

1088
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:39,140
But who are you to say that that is how they all think? No one at all. No one at all

1089
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:42,500
Yeah, that's that's owned that's fair owned

1090
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:48,980
Um, I don't know. We've got we've got a lot of people in this chat that are just sitting on the sidelines

1091
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:54,020
It's just waiting for the mouse to be fed. That's true. That's that's fine including the rhythm bot. What do you have to say for yourself?

1092
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,980
Yeah, they just waddle on up to the trough here and just

1093
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,420
I don't know. I just want to say about this thing. I feel like

1094
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:07,820
The way we talk about autism is just extremely uninformed. Am I wrong there?

1095
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:17,300
No, of course, so and you know what? I bet not to be you know, I bet we have a fair number of autistic people listening right now

1096
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:19,940
Yeah, let us know what you think about this fetishization

1097
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:21,940
That would be interesting because like I always feel like

1098
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:26,180
The the whole like autism joke is like very much like done intentionally

1099
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:31,700
Yeah, and it's just for the the giggles right and like no one should be taking it seriously

1100
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:36,900
That's very true. I wonder if Digi takes it seriously. You have any expertise. Let us know ladies and gentlemen

1101
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:41,540
Oh, yeah, all right. Let's see. We got here's another one. Oh boy. I think I know where this is going

1102
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:44,020
This is from how many more do we have? I've got six more

1103
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:50,100
Okay, yeah, that's reasonable. We've got dentist defender. Let's uh, let's see what he's got to say

1104
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:55,940
I know that digi's not going to be here because the podcast never works the way that it should

1105
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:05,140
But the idea that brushing your teeth is not necessary is just so smooth brain

1106
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:13,780
I'm really screaming in the car when I heard digi talk about this. So he's only focused on cavities

1107
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:18,260
Essentially, well, there's so many other aspects of your teeth that you need to protect

1108
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:22,340
If your enamel gets thin boy, you're gonna get fucked up

1109
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:28,100
There's so many things that brushing helps with and like if you have your wisdom teeth in like you got to clean those

1110
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:31,460
And let me recommend boys flossing is a must

1111
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:37,620
Well, that's it. It's getting long and I just I I was screaming screaming and in my car

1112
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:45,300
Please stop this man. I was digi was digi. He was again. Yeah, he sure was. Yeah, he was. Yeah

1113
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:49,940
Well, okay, we have a dentist listening to our podcast, but well, this makes a dentist defender

1114
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,820
Maybe we cannot we cannot we all agree that he's wrong. Oh, yeah

1115
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:58,900
I I mean, there's people here in this chat. I mean, I mean, I don't take great care of my teeth

1116
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:04,180
I'm sure Nate takes really good care of his teeth. I try all across the range of spectrum here. We can all agree that

1117
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:09,220
Yeah, I would assume that I probably take only slightly better care of my teeth than digi

1118
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:14,020
But I'm a hundred percent able to confirm and like admit that it's a terrible decision

1119
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:19,540
And I'm a worse person. Yeah. Well, if I if I don't brush my teeth, I know that I'm doing something wrong

1120
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:24,340
It's a mistake. I think digi would agree. I want to speak on his defense because this is not here

1121
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:29,540
It's just like the things that we care about that are helped by us brushing our teeth

1122
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:35,460
Could those just be things digi does not care about and therefore there's no objective standard

1123
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:42,900
Well, no, no, you heard him talking last episode. I'm very convinced that digi is not educated on what will happen to your teeth

1124
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,580
That's unreasonable

1125
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:51,220
Like maybe maybe maybe if we looked into it, right? Yeah, maybe if we looked into it, we would find

1126
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:56,260
That not brushing your teeth does not, you know, it does not have certain effects on

1127
01:40:57,140 --> 01:41:02,340
But like there's so many things that yeah, this guy's right like like like worn enamel and and stuff

1128
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,740
And gingivitis and shit, you know got clean your gums, you know

1129
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:10,180
Yeah, your gums gingivitis your gums, you know, you can get fucking you can fucking rot your teeth roots and need a root canal

1130
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:11,460
like there's

1131
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:12,660
there's

1132
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:16,340
Well, ben did you just oh, I know I know there's a point wasn't like just neglect your teeth

1133
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:21,940
He was his real point was like and this guy was just refuting him that like if you just don't consume sugar

1134
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:24,260
That like solves most of the issue

1135
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:25,780
Uh

1136
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:31,700
That was his major pretty sure that's totally wrong and stupid. I don't know. Uh, well, I think I don't know enough to say one way or the other

1137
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:37,300
But it sounds more wrong than right that would affect that that that sounds like some bull that sounds like some bullshit

1138
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:42,180
Childhood like parents saying oh, don't eat sugar. It'll rot your teeth like grown up

1139
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:44,420
I

1140
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:49,700
That's not the be all end all like like thing that has to do with teeth health

1141
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:54,340
That's not the only thing that matters. It might be the biggest one. I mean, I don't know. I have no idea

1142
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:58,660
I have no idea. I don't think I don't really think back in the middle ages

1143
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:02,500
There was not a whole ton of sugar for the peasants and I don't think they had perfect teeth

1144
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:06,020
Just throwing that one out there

1145
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:07,300
Fair point

1146
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:11,940
But I will say that when sugar did was introduced in like, you know, like like late renaissance

1147
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:18,980
They did have really bad teeth sugar is bad for your teeth, but not so bad. Fair enough. Fair enough. It is the be all end all

1148
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:24,740
That's all I'm saying. All right. Let's let's move on or next one here. This is from uh, keep it going. She pollution. She pollution

1149
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,140
That sounds like someone else go

1150
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:32,820
Hey guys, so I followed Ben Sain's advice and started fasting. My goal was reach a week, but sadly

1151
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:35,460
Uh, a few hours ago. I ate something

1152
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:38,420
I really hate myself now actually like

1153
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,500
Yeah, I think you too. It tastes good

1154
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:41,620
so

1155
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:45,380
Yeah, I mean, I guess I can still be proud of myself for reaching for

1156
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:47,140
three

1157
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:49,540
Yeah, it's three hours without eating food

1158
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:57,380
There it is. Please let me know if you have any advice so I can reach a week and it's not um

1159
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:04,020
To the other members my question is what will you have a hard time not doing for a week that isn't a basic human need

1160
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:05,860
or sexual

1161
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,860
Okay, my yeah, what do you got my?

1162
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:15,220
My advice you made it to three. Well, can you count to uh seven times 24 is 140 is one

1163
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,940
16 can you count to 168?

1164
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:21,060
Just make it to 168 and then and then you'll have done it do that

1165
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:27,380
Hourly add one to that and then just do it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean don't eat until you hit 168 practical advice

1166
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:30,980
He should probably take like vitamins and water lots of water. Maybe

1167
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:36,740
Yeah, yeah, you keep like drinking water like you just fill up your gut. You don't feel like eating

1168
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:42,900
Take a multivitamin. You know drink drink tea drink drink tea. Yeah, apple cider vinegar

1169
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:47,300
As caffeine it tastes great zero calories

1170
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:53,700
Tea is beautiful caffeine has so little I mean tea has so little caffeine that might have you always say that

1171
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:59,060
I don't feel it. I don't I feel the caffeine rush and I drink caffeine. I'm desensitized do it

1172
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:04,500
Speaking of caffeine. I remember when we were young. I remember one time you bought like a powdered keg

1173
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:10,820
Not like a bottle of powdered caffeine or something. Was that am I remembering that right? Is that a real thing? Was it creatine?

1174
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:16,020
I thought it was fucking literally caffeine and I don't remember buying powdered caffeine

1175
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:21,300
I'm pretty sure like like caffeine is lethal if you eat it straight. I mean, that's why I was concerned at the time

1176
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:26,020
I mean actually my housemate had like a bag of like I probably wasn't straight

1177
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:29,140
But it was a bag of powder and I would take like a little scoop of like

1178
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:33,860
A tiny like a core like an eighth of a teaspoon or something and I would like dissolve it in my in my

1179
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:38,020
Some of the time dude the first time I ever had a five-hour energy

1180
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:41,140
I felt like I was the elephant's foot from Chernobyl

1181
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:47,220
I felt like like like like the acid was going through my throat and infecting all my body from the inside out

1182
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:52,420
And I was turning into like a small blob of like radioactive energy and that like all my friends were going to have to build like an

1183
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:57,700
Iron cast around me to keep the power in because I was like I was like I was like turning to like a black hole

1184
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:00,180
I was going to like exactly one by one

1185
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:07,140
Minecraft dot block and once I reached maximum capacity. I was just explode out in all directions in fact all around that's why I felt

1186
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:09,540
I'm drinking one sip of a five-hour energy

1187
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:15,460
Uh, I've never had I've literally never had a five-hour energy. I don't know if I'm having this

1188
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,340
Okay, okay

1189
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:20,580
The most distinct thing about fire energy is that you'll get super hot and you feel like you're on fire

1190
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:25,540
You feel like you are in acid and on fire. Yeah, that sounds awful. Yeah, it's really awful

1191
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:28,740
It's really like crazy. Those be vitamins. Well, fuck. Yeah

1192
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:32,660
Does anyone have an answer for this um like things that you could go

1193
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:36,660
For a week without doing sexual or food or something

1194
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:42,820
I mean video games. I guess like I really like video games though. I pretty regularly can go for a week without playing them though

1195
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:46,100
It would really be hard for me to not go on the internet at all. Yeah

1196
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:52,580
The internet oh social media in general would be a tough one. Yeah, which is relevant because it's funny. Michelle

1197
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:58,660
Just got fucking banned from twitter and it's really fucking up. Yeah. Yeah big big champ big champ came after that's right

1198
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:04,500
That's right. Yeah, and uh, yeah, they they came after her oils. She was she was trying to spread the word to protect us all

1199
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:08,260
She's trying to she's trying to protect the power oils and they fucking they closed her down

1200
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:11,700
Hopefully she'll be back in a couple days though. Hopefully

1201
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,860
Michelle's really funny on twitter by the way, you know, there was another message

1202
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:21,220
I didn't want to play because it was overly personal, but somebody out there just said how funny michelle was

1203
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:25,940
On twitter and i'm not gonna get into it, but they also said someone else was not real funny

1204
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:30,100
Which is why I didn't want to play it. Um, but yeah, you're you're you're beloved michelle

1209
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:55,700
clab

1210
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:57,700
if you got

1211
01:46:58,180 --> 01:47:00,180
Hello

1212
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:01,540
I'm a big

1213
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:04,900
Nate fan the only kind of fan that is

1214
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:12,580
Ashley appropriate. Yeah, and I'm wondering when is Nate gonna start the third right of the pcp so we can

1215
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,820
purge all these

1216
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:16,820
dream levels. Yeah. Yeah, fuck

1217
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:20,260
utilitarian

1218
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:22,420
ideals going on here because

1219
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:29,860
Without Nate constantly speaking about starfleet. I my soul my bean has been crushed

1220
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:33,780
And I don't know what to do anymore. I have something important. So, um

1221
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:38,020
Yeah, I'm 17. I have no direction. I need Nate to tell me

1222
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:45,780
And uh, the dreams are not good despite what everyone tells you. Uh, stop also, um

1223
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:49,300
Voice smells are much better than the stupid

1224
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:55,300
Uh, twitter shit. Uh, never do that again. Thank you. Uh, good night

1225
01:47:55,860 --> 01:48:00,580
Perfect vertical slice of a terrible stupid question

1226
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:03,460
Uh for that the pcp

1227
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,260
It has every everything bad about it

1228
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:13,780
As long as I continue to hold a supreme authority over the voicemails. My people will have their voice

1229
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:21,140
As long as you allow in the 17 year olds with no direction who want to just pair everything that you say and claim that's philosophy

1230
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:27,300
I just feel like this is how a cult starts with like aimless 17 year olds who will just you know, they want to they want to hear a

1231
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:30,260
Voice of a of strength and direction in their lives

1232
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:36,180
Clab you and me buddy. Nobody have to settle with you. Why does this person think that he's the only one that didn't like the dreams

1233
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:41,220
Nobody like like the dreams everyone in the comments was like don't let anyone talk about their dreams again

1234
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:46,580
This isn't a point specifically about the dreams. I think this guy is talking about like in the there there's been in the discord

1235
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:52,740
Uh thing there's been people being like hashtag let mage dream and then I've just come in saying like no dreams are banned

1236
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,900
No dreams of any kind pure raw

1237
01:48:55,700 --> 01:49:01,140
Materialism like I think that's what he's talking about and and shit. Yeah. Yeah, I see. All right fair enough

1238
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:03,380
So so good on you clab. Uh, you're a good man

1239
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:08,180

Passionate speech

1243
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:26,900
I really find best guy ever is passion inspirational and it's inspired me to make my own youtube channel

01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:31,620
Where I will be discussing my favorite anime. Uh, just like my hero

1245

01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:42,100
I plan to trample him and leave him in the dust do as I say not as I do

1247
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:46,900
And I know and I know that he would do the same for me. So no hard feelings buster

01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,940
Thanks for thanks for taking my call and have a nice day

1249
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:52,740
Hashtag racism

1250
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:58,660
Hashtag a future for white children. Uh, all right moving on. Uh, this was one from uh,

1251
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:02,180
Okay, this is a weird. I think it's a polish name. It's like

1252
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:05,380
simon with szy mo n

1253
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:06,900
with

1254
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,100
new ski

1255
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,300
size

1256
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:12,980
Simon with new ski. All right. Let's see what he's got. That doesn't sound right

1257
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:18,820
I don't even know why I'm here. I can't even speak english properly

1258
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:22,900
I'm from some shitty eastern european country

1259
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:25,540
fuck

1260
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:32,100
Well, okay, what I'm trying to settle down is hearing mage talking fluent english despite not being a native speaker

1261
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:33,780
It's very

1262
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:35,220
motivating

1263
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:40,100
And I think I developed my vocabulary and listening comprehension skills

1264
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:42,580
Thanks to the pcp

1265
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:50,100
Thanks. Okay. Okay. Good job mage mage mage says don't play voicemails that are just questions

1266
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:56,180
People who send them are basically cheating and it's kind of redundant because you know, you have

1267
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,660
Not anymore. Not anymore. Yeah for that

1268
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:03,380
Okay, duly noted. Okay. Okay mage says that her mage says that her

1269
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:07,860
Knowledge of english that her like ability to learn english was like her best subject in school

1270
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:11,780
And like she says that she's just like real just took to it really really, uh

1271
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:17,300
Fast. I I want to guess. I'm going to ask you. Are you

1272
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,140
Austrian

1273
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:25,460
I want to know are you ash or some country around that area? Please respond. I'm based on his name

1274
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:31,140
I'm guessing he's polish because like his name matches the polish, uh, like ski at the end. Oh, what was it?

1275
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:35,700
Yeah, it's yeah, he's probably was new ski something like that. Okay, uh, oh wait

1276
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:42,740
W's or v's in polish, right? So it's vizniewski. No, that's not right. I don't know whatever and I think yeah, okay

1277
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:50,340
So that's he'd probably polish or or I don't know ukrainian. Yeah. Okay. Uh, anyway, uh, what was this question?

1278
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:54,420
He didn't have a quote. Well, no, what do you say? Oh, well his like point was that like he was saying he was

1279
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:58,100
Oh, but he's saying that non-question. Yeah, non-question

1280
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:01,460
voicemails shouldn't be said because it's redundant

1281
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:06,500
Uh, but now it's not a problem because I guess we've just killed text questions

1282
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:13,140
I want to say stick with learning english and I also want to say similarly that I love you

1283
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:20,260
You you live in europe and I love you and I respect you and and like hashtag god

1284
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:24,180
I wish that were me munchie. You're one of these fucking americans who's like, oh my god

1285
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:28,020
If only you lived in europe, I'd have so much culture and personality and I'd actually have a yeah

1286
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:30,820
Why don't you go vote for obama? You fucking lived hard

1287
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:33,780
a globalist piece of shit

1288
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:42,260
Okay, I want to go to a country to experience what the country is like and its specific culture

1289
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:47,140
How embarrassing america is the only culture you need to know about boy. So get used to it

1290
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:49,620
You should visit other countries

1291
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:53,380
But like if you lived in another country, then there wouldn't be anything special. I got a plan

1292
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:55,620
I got a plan for you munchie. That's not true at all because I

1293
01:52:55,780 --> 01:53:02,020
I've grown up in america. I've grown up in america. So no, no, no my what I mean is if you had lived your whole life in like

1294
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:06,820
Like if you were if I don't let's say this guy's polish. There's nothing. There's nothing cool about being

1295
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:12,500
Sorry, wizniewski. There's nothing cool about being polish because it's just a country like any other country

1296
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:17,700
Well, okay, I argue that there's cool things about being polish in the same way that there's cool things about being america

1297
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:21,940
You guys are just reading anti american sentiments for no reason to what I'm saying

1298
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:28,980
I'm saying that you seem to you seem to be jealous that he lives somewhere other than america and I'm like

1299
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:33,700
Nowhere, it's cool. I'm I'm not saying that america is bad in any way

1300
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:39,300
I know you're not saying that I appreciate the culture from which from whence this guy has crawled out stop

1301
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:46,980
Fetishizing foreigners munchie cease it immediately. That's you stop sexualizing. It's you. He's a good man. He doesn't you don't know

1302
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:53,140
You cast an elsewhere friend. You don't know anything about his culture. Why do you respect it? Yeah?

1303
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:59,860
I don't know. Okay. I don't know. I I literally okay. I don't know what country. He's from but I do exactly

1304
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:05,220
I like the general history from that that that from eastern europe

1305
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:07,860
I like I like the sort of things that have occurred there

1306
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:12,340
I think that they're interesting and I enjoy the history from whence he has crawled out from

1307
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:17,700
I wonder if any poll would be offended for you to lump all of eastern europe in together into one thing

1308
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:20,420
You'd be like, oh, it's all you know, I like the general things

1309
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:23,540
They're all the same

1310
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:39,220
Apparently people in what we call eastern europe do not like that turn really they don't like being lumped together as quote eastern europe

1311
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:41,220
Hashtag munchie is racist

1312
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:44,100
But I've also got a plan. I've got a plan for you munchie. Here it is

1313
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:48,100
You're such an absolute unit such an absolute massive lad

1314
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:55,300
Then why don't you individually secede from the union and go be a individual member state of the united of the european union

1315
01:54:55,300 --> 01:55:00,660
Just go like float out in the ocean and just attach yourself to the you know the the big octopus tentacles

1316
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:06,340
Go join all it all i'm hearing right now. Yeah is you like something else and that's a problem

1317
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:11,380
Like where you are now that's like you you just can't like anything else if you like another thing

1318
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:14,980
That means you pride that above literally every other like nation on earth

1319
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:19,780
Okay, I will say I will say that I think that you have a little bit of grass is greener going on

1320
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:24,740
I think a little bit of that. I I don't think america is bad in any way

1321
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:32,420
But I've said I said nothing about america being even you're like, oh, oh you grew you grew up in some you grew up in poll

1322
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:34,500
Oh, that's so cool. Like that's

1323
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:43,460
Why is it bad to say? Oh, that's an interesting situation that you have come from an interesting situation

1324
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:52,500
Literally everyone in the world has an interesting situation then because they grew up in x country

1325
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:59,860
Yes, that is true. Yeah, I know everyone's boring everyone's life is boring and dumb and I don't care

1326
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:05,620
Um, I'm saying is that I'm period and I'm deeply in a romantic love

1327
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:11,380
With all things history and european and I think it's nice when we get to have a fan

1328
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:14,180
That's not from america because that's the majority of east

1329
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:21,060
We've got a lot of fans from we've done a lot of like south american fans and european fans. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's

1330
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:27,700
I shout out lat american pcb fans of their day and everyone's like oh like uno uno uno uno. Thank you, manci

1331
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:33,780
Thank you very much. Listen manci. We tried multiculturalism. It didn't work. We're shutting it down. We're ending this once and for all

1332
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:37,940
It's over. Yeah, okay. That's all right. Let's do it. Okay. I'm like a true bloomer

1333
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:42,980
Like i'm julie says i'm just like attacked on the senate floor and i'm just being like like gang mob friend

1334
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:48,820
Because I said that I like hearing right now. I like europe. That's that was my crime here that I liked europe

1335
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:53,780
Yeah, I bet you also like uh, you know, and I also like fascism and communism too much

1336
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:56,180
I bet you also hate capitalism. Don't you?

1337
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:00,660
Uh, speaking of capitalism, we got another call from a dank wizard

1338
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:05,620
Phone and in from eastern europe to use the racist term. All right, here we go. What do you got?

1339
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:09,380
Hey, nate. It's your boy. Uh a dank wizard. Good to see you

1340
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:12,340
I'm the dude who sent you those kingdom hearts cards a while back

1341
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:16,260
Oh, yeah, you didn't open all of them. You fucking piece of shit. Where the fuck did you?

1342
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:18,660
What did you do with them? What the fuck did you do with them?

1343
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:20,900
They're I want to know what the fuck you do if you

1344
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:26,020
Actually, yeah, I think I did because those things go for a shit tone on ebay. God damn it

1345
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:28,020
You only open like

1346
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:33,860
I think you had like three or four more you can open it like six packs or something and you know, I

1347
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:39,300
I appreciate that you even who would think these are valuable. They're shitty knockoff kingdom hearts trading cards

1348
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:42,820
I was just wondering if you were gonna ever like open up again like on a video

1349
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:48,100
I can't believe you would throw that away. I can't believe that. I open like three and they suck also

1350
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:52,740
I totally relate to you with that blanky story in the last episode man

1351
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:58,020
Like me and you all yeah exact same experience with the blanky like I would shove that shit up my nose too

1352
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:00,260
Like the only different thing is I would like hell. Yeah

1353
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:05,060
Feel between hell. Yeah, there was really fucking weird and gross

1354
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:11,620
For some reason insanely gratifying really fucking weird, but uh, I have a stroke

1355
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:22,260
I remember blanky very clearly and I but I I had no idea you were selling

1356
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:25,940
Okay, all right the whole shoving it up my nose thing's a bit blown out of proportion

1357
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:31,620
Like I did that sometimes. I don't let's forget. I was like five at the time. So let's not be too hard

1358
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:38,500
Yeah, last last episode I think I told the like, you know, maybe it was more than one episode ago

1359
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:41,380
I don't remember. I don't remember. I'm using my mind. It could have been too

1360
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:48,580
Wait, was that not on the bonus episode? Which by the way, you can get access to at pc at pay at patreon.com slash

1361
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:56,100
Uh, god, what's the procrastinator? The procrastinators this month, uh, the bonus episode we reviewed. It's a film cast

1362
01:58:56,180 --> 01:59:01,940
We reviewed classic film the ant boy. Indeed. So if you want to hear our thoughts on that check that out

1363
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:07,700
Toss us some coins. Listen a dank wizard. Uh, I apologize. I definitely threw those away

1364
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:13,220
I had no idea that they meant anything to anyone and uh, I don't regret it either

1365
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:17,300
Wait, what were they? What kind of cards? They were kingdom hearts trading cards an apparent dude

1366
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:22,100
I don't believe that they're valuable. How much could they pass? Look you see you send anything to me

1367
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:28,420
It goes into a black hole where you have no control over what happens to it after that point and everyone needs to know that going in

1368
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:29,940
um

1369
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:35,380
So, you know, I appreciate you sending stuff and I would hope that you would be not discouraged from doing it again

1370
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:40,420
If you were so inclined, but uh, like like what am I gonna do fucking open up a bunch of packs and be like, oh

1371
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:43,940
Yeah, I recognize heartless and nobody's and so yeah, dude, um

1372
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:49,940
Like like three three kingdom hearts original booster packs go for like 25 bucks

1373
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:55,460
So that's too little money for me to worry about like selling them on ebay. That's too much work

1374
01:59:55,540 --> 01:59:57,940
That's a lot more than I expected about single cards though

1375
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:00,900
If the packs are worth my the single cards are probably worth more

1376
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:04,340
If we're talking about like I mean yeah, it's like the rare ones probably

1377
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:07,940
Exactly. That's where the real money's at magic the gathering or even yugio

1378
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:10,740
I have some context as like what's a good card?

1379
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:15,300
What's a bad card and to like know and like I can get excited when I open them. I have no

1380
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:19,540
Ground like I'm not grounded to know what's a good pull. What's a bad pull?

1381
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:24,500
So it's totally boring to open those packs. It's just like, uh, yes things from kingdom hearts

Look, I'm sorry dank wizard. You obviously are into it. I apologize as a non player

1389
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:10,820
I had no grounding. He didn't know what I got and just assumed they were worthless. So my bad

1390
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:16,420
All right, we got one more voicemail here. This is from a mozilla fennekin long time

1391
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:23,060
Yep, yeah, let's uh, let's see what he's got for it. I know that person as a ben saint patron. That's how I know him

1392
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:25,140
He's a patron of yeah, too. I think

1393
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:30,500
Which pokemon would be the best podcaster? He was uh, he was in one nuzlocke. Oh

1394
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:35,460
Hang on which pokemon to be the best podcaster cast for him

1395
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,900
Wait

1396
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:43,700
Oh, it's a joke. Oh, it's a joke you guys

1397
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:46,900
Oh, how unfortunate

1398
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:51,060
Well

1399
02:01:53,940 --> 02:02:00,420
Yeah, they both got cast their names come on down to neo milwaukee. Yeah, but which but which form of oh, uh, I love that

1400
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:06,180
So in new Los Angeles city, you can see this line you can see economy crumble

1401
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:13,540
No, that song sucks

1402
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:16,500
All right, it's actually pretty good. Okay. I can't believe

1403
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:22,100
Okay, that's such a cold reception. I got such a cold. I don't know why I don't know. I have no idea how

1404
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:27,860
Why for me by the way, we're talking about ratty fuckers cop killer stuff at the moment bear with us for a second

1405
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:34,500
This was from the uh from the flag slash national anthem slash tourism video content. I'll tell you why munchie

1406
02:02:34,740 --> 02:02:41,380
Uh, that's rich dot tv slash ratty flickers cop killer. That song was fairly verbose and I couldn't

1407
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:47,220
I don't know. I couldn't like get into it at first and the melody wasn't particularly memorable

1408
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:53,780
Uh, I don't know. Okay. I liked it and I think it is a good and suitable anthem for the city

1409
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:58,980
I don't think it's sixon's best. Well, you know what it is. It is his best work, but I do like it

1410
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:03,940
I don't like that song whatever like it doesn't have like a memorable like crazy hook or anything

1411
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:09,300
But the thing is I liked the rat. I liked the rap more. I liked sixon's rap more, but it was less of an anthem

1412
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:12,500
Uh, fucking what is it? I was gonna say the thing is like a j schoops

1413
02:03:12,980 --> 02:03:18,420
Like I I think of so much more fondly and then I'm just like I'm not saying it's like a million times better anything

1414
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:23,460
Even though it is uh, but what I'm saying is uh, like I I listened to that a bunch and like

1415
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:25,780
Listened to it a bunch and got way into it

1416
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:30,180
And that was cool. Uh, whereas I like didn't do that with sixon. So like

1417
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:36,100
Okay, I like that sixon's was like a real anthem, but also had rfc k stuff in it

1418
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:39,220
I feel like that was it was a nice touch to have that's sort of like yeah

1419
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:44,420
Like our world it is a national anthem that you could hear but had in this war calling cards

1420
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:46,740
There's the best thing it was the

1421
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:52,660
Tom you gotta join rfc k you gotta join so god listen. No, it's it's common digi

1422
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:57,540
I want to fucking punch both of you and your stupid faces. You're so dumb. You're so fucking dumb

1423
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:59,860
You can't even fucking beat mega man 11

1424
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:10,980
Well, I would have okay, I had to go to sleep. Um, it's just you just listen to what we're saying. We're speaking plain english

1425
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:14,340
We're talking about uh, uh, there's a there's a fucking city

1426
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:19,700
It's full of slime and we had a contest to pick the national anthem and we fucking run

1427
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:22,740
That's it. There's how hard is this to understand?

1428
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:26,740
Like people just don't get so much about it. I understand linguistically what you're saying

1429
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:32,180
But because I'm not actively participating the context is not there therefore. It means nothing to me

1430
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:36,500
It takes a while to understand what's going on. This is why me and digi both said

1431
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:42,260
Ben please make a pcp university slash style video on

1432
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:44,820
Whoa, whoa

1433
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:49,940
It would be a joint one if anything. No because ben was here when we asked it, okay

1434
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:53,780
I've just I mean, I've just got the I've got the necessary charisma

1435
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:55,460
Oh

1436
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:59,620
That's something a killer would say so that's that's a brazen lie that a killer would say

1437
02:05:00,820 --> 02:05:06,740
Um lying right through his fucking shoddy teeth. All right. Well, that's it for questions and uh,

1438
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:10,820
Okay, just just one more quick thing. I know I know it's going on about rfck

1439
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:18,340
But like I I've literally written a new like text channel that is like the text that you are set into if you join the server

1440
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:22,980
From any of the links now, so no matter what whenever you join the server you go to this channel

1441
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:27,220
Much easier, but I don't but I don't actually find much you need a video. I don't actually

1442
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:31,940
No, I said it. I made it so that the only invite link is going to that channel

1443
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:36,660
Does it do you do you get a little like response blurb? That's like you have arrived at the juvenile detention center

1444
02:05:36,820 --> 02:05:40,740
No, me and me and me and john me and jubo. We're talking about that much. That's great ben. That's great

1445
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:46,020
What you need is a video an introductory. Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're right. I don't disagree

1446
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:49,940
But I'm saying is we need a what is endless war kind of like how to play

1447
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:56,740
What is I'm saying is that if you join the server then you can tell with like literally less than one minute of reading

1448
02:05:56,980 --> 02:06:01,860
Exactly what is going on in everything you need to play the game the secondary thing that made me

1449
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:09,220
Hesitant as ben has said it took like it's going to take like at least an hour a day of like effort to keep up with this

1450
02:06:09,220 --> 02:06:11,220
Shit, and I don't I guess

1451
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:18,820
All you know like all I know what we're saying just read that blurb and then you know the basic what's happening

1452
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:22,340
I think you can you could give it as much or as little as you want, right?

1453
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:28,500
You can engage with it as much or as little as you want and you know, but you won't get that respect until you really come in

1454
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:31,140
I was just saying that since we nerfed sparring

1455
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:37,140
It's not like Nate you were you were sparring. I was just sparring ben, but now I've been completely fucked by

1456
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:41,460
But that wasn't that hard to do because you could just kind of pop look at your phone every 10 minutes or so

1457
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:46,260
Pop off a scar and then it was great. I missed it so much. Yeah, but it was but it was too it was too good

1458
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:52,100
In fact, it's so sparring was you were literally you were literally the only one. Yeah, literally the only one

1459
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:54,420
The only one who matters I am the ultimate

1460
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:58,820
All right, I am the slimecorp delegate and I will be treated with respect god damn it

1461
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:01,460
Well, then how come you got fucking iced by fat yoshi?

1462
02:07:01,460 --> 02:07:05,140
Fat yoshi is a piece of shit coward who didn't have the balls to follow me to the mind

1463
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:07,940
He's never done a day of work in his fucking life that fat

1464
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:14,100
Okay, okay, you you are in a possibility. Let's end this let's end this but you slipped you slipped dude. All right, right

1465
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:16,500
He's right. We'll settle this another day. All right
