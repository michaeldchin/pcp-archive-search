00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Do-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,960
Hi, everyone! Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,720
Hey, it's just me. It's just Ben here.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,720
And I'm here making a protest bonus episode.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,480
Not a bonus episode, but some extra, extra content.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,800
PCP, extra credit.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,760
It's protest. I object. I object, sir.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,720
To the last episode,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:38,320
Tom and Gibb did a great job, did a bang-up job, loved the episode, 10 out of 10 quality content.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,520
However, I was thrown into a blind fury that so few of the voicemails will listen to.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:56,120
I believe in egalitarianism, I believe in voicemail anarchy, I believe that all voicemails, even the shittiest voicemails,

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,720
deserve a chance to prove themselves in the marketplace of ideas.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:09,120
And so here, now, for you, I'm gonna make a stand.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm gonna stand against tyranny, I'm gonna stand against exclusion, I'm gonna stand against the PCP oligarchs that run everything,

15
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
the fat cats that are trying to keep the little guy down.

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:31,420
I'm here, what you want to say, I want to hear it, and that's what we're gonna do today.

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,320
And I apologize in advance.

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,220
So, without further ado.

19
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,920
Wait, where did my notes?

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,320
Where's my notes?

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,520
There they are.

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Without further ado, let's get into it, shall we?

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,220
Now two episodes ago, the last episode, the last voicemail was from Darren the Red.

24
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,220
So the next one we got is from, it's from someone called

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,340
Listen to this, ooh-ooh, and there's a huge,

26
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,780
there's a link, there's a link.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,340
Anyway, let's hear the voicemail.

28
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,580
Please enjoy this extended rating

29
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,200
of a tweet thread directed to Ben Sinked.

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,420
Oh, I know what this is, I know what this is.

31
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,340
This is the, this is the, this is that, that, that.

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,220
The hate thread, the hate thread I received on Twitter.

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,060
It's another extended read.

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,460
All right, I'll put the link in the description.

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,740
This is the second dramatic reading

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,180
of that legendary tweet thread that I have heard,

37
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,260
but it never gets old.

38
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,900
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,700
Next up, we've got Salad Boys.

40
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,260
Hey, what's your favorite salad?

41
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,500
Grrr.

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,580
Okay, you know what?

43
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,580
Just today I invented a new salad, a hamburger salad.

44
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,860
I'll tell you the recipe right now.

45
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,100
You put lettuce in your bowl, right?

46
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,900
That's garnish, whatever.

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,860
And then you cook, you cook your brown beef in a pot,

48
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,700
and then you throw in chopped cauliflower, steam it,

49
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,580
steam it till it's soft, leave it hot, crack eggs into it.

50
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,540
Just crack eggs into it, leave it in the pot covered.

51
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,780
15 minutes or so, the eggs will steam,

52
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,540
they will, they will cook in there.

53
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
The yolks will still be runny, that's what you want.

54
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,140
Chop it up, mash it up, mix it up, switch it around.

55
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,060
Salt, pepper, mozzarella.

56
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,740
Swirl it around, becomes kind of like a mush.

57
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,940
That's what you want, kind of a jumble.

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,220
Scoop it into the bowl on top of the lettuce.

59
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,180
Ketchup and mustard on top.

60
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,220
This is apparently controversial.

61
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,260
Some people don't believe in ketchup and mustard on burgers.

62
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,460
I think that's frankly un-American.

63
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,140
Garnish with a pickle, spear, obviously, no slices.

64
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,820
And there you go, a hamburger salad.

65
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,980
For me, you boy, Ben St, enjoy, it's low carb.

66
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,940
Cut out the ketchup if you're really concerned about sugar.

67
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,540
So that's my new favorite salad, and I'm so glad

68
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,020
I got the opportunity to tell you all about it.

69
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,420
Next up, we've got the big C question.

70
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,940
Let's hear it.

71
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,580
Okay, so I got a quick salad question here.

72
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,740
You know, whenever you're eating a salad,

73
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,780
do you ever add croutons on, like, everyone's into croutons?

74
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,620
It's nachito.

75
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,980
Except for me, it seems.

76
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,940
So like, what's the deal?

77
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,460
What's the appeal of croutons?

78
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,660
And if you do, what's the best quality of croutons?

79
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,220
And why do you like it?

80
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,060
Thank you.

81
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,620
I like croutons.

82
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,820
They're just like garlic bread, but hard and crunchy.

83
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,660
That's the appeal.

84
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,980
It's very obvious, but I don't need them anymore

85
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,100
because they're nachito.

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,580
Thanks for calling in.

87
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,780
Next up, we've got fruit burp.

88
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,740
Here we go.

89
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,060
Progressioners, what's your favorite fruit

90
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,660
to have for fruit salad, my dudes?

91
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,700
Fuck fruit salad.

92
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,220
I don't know.

93
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,740
Pineapple, I guess?

94
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,540
I don't know.

95
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,100
Pineapple.

96
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,340
Next one, we've got brobroni.

97
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,740
Here it comes, coming at ya.

98
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,100
So Jenny Nicholson recently put out a video

99
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,100
looking at the history of bronies and bronicon.

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,020
And as someone who isn't that into the whole brony thing,

101
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,540
I thought it was a pretty interesting deep dive

102
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,340
into the subculture.

103
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,420
Since y'all have a past in that,

104
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,740
I just want to know what your reactions to it were

105
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,020
and if you had any dissenting opinions

106
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,900
against what she said.

107
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,180
Thanks.

108
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,580
Hearing Jenny, I watched the video.

109
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,580
I really enjoyed it.

110
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,180
Hearing Jenny talk about bronicon,

111
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,260
in brony, ponydom in general,

112
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,400
and the last bronycon in specific,

113
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,260
throat's dry, I got some seltzer.

114
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,860
I got some sparkling water.

115
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,420
Delightful.

116
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,420
Hearing Jenny talk about that was like,

117
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
was like reminiscing about the good old days

118
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,300
with a friend, you know, you just,

119
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,340
Munchy didn't like it,

120
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,220
because Munchy said that he thought it was very surface

121
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,100
level, like duh, everyone knows that.

122
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,300
And like, yes, I did already know everything she had to say.

123
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,220
So in the sense, I agree.

124
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,540
But I think that's really dumb.

125
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,580
And I disagree, I thought it was really fun.

126
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,140
It's like when you get together with someone,

127
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,620
you go, hey, remember that, remember that,

128
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,860
you reminisce about the good old days

129
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,180
and you just have a good time,

130
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,700
just sort of bouncing these ideas around.

131
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,980
Just hearing them, just repeat them for old times sake

132
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,020
because it's fun.

133
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,340
That's what I liked about it.

134
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,260
And it was great.

135
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,380
I loved it.

136
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,380
I thought she was a little weird about like the,

137
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,220
she seemed a little judgy,

138
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,020
not just about like the, like,

139
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,820
she mentions like having like fillies on pillows

140
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,500
and like, I get that.

141
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,020
I don't know if I like that so much,

142
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,540
but like, she seemed a little judgy

143
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,700
just about like porn in general,

144
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,500
which like, I don't know,

145
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,540
get over yourself, like everyone jerks off to everything.

146
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,820
Like it's, why are you acting like it's weird?

147
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,660
I don't know.

148
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,740
I don't understand that part.

149
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,860
But other than that, everything about like,

150
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,660
you know, when she talks about like some outsized egos

151
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,060
from people who were not famous,

152
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,460
the other like 20, 360 days of the year,

153
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,100
but then they get like weird rock star complexes at,

154
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,020
I was like, yes, I want 100%.

155
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,100
That was me a little bit, maybe just a little bit.

156
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,980
I mean, I wasn't, I don't think I was a dick about it,

157
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,460
but like, I know that feeling.

158
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,700
Like, I knew people, I saw people being like that

159
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
and to a little bit, I was that.

160
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,220
And it's just like, how silly,

161
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,420
how silly of a time to look back upon and reflect.

162
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
So those are my thoughts about that.

163
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,220
Next one, next one is from The Jocker Threat,

164
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,660
which they did, Tom and Hippo did, listen to,

165
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,380
good on them, good job, credit where credits do.

166
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,780
Next one is called I'm Ben Saint,

167
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,140
and there's a YouTube video attached, so let's hear it.

168
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,960
I'm Ben Saint.

169
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,600
Okay.

170
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,640
All right.

171
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,480
Let's check, let's check this video out.

172
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,700
This is a certified,

173
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,720
oh it's a,

174
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,040
I'm Ben Saint.

175
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,820
It's a song.

176
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,660
I'm Ben Saint, oh I'm Ben Saint.

177
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,300
I'm Ben Saint, oh I'm Ben Saint.

178
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,220
I'm Ben Saint, oh I'm Ben Saint.

179
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,180
I'm Ben Saint, Oh I'm Ben Saint.

180
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,700
The lyrics are,

181
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,620
yo, bitch I'm Ben Saint over and over again.

182
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Oh, no, there's lyrics. There's lyrics. There's gunshots. Okay, I'm not gonna listen to this

183
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:14,660
whole thing right now. Link in the description. Go listen to Starman's, I'm Ben St, featuring

184
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:25,260
Simon. Dab. It's a banger. The screenshot is, what is this aspect ratio? It's in square

185
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:33,860
aspect ratio. Why? But it's me eating PCP killer pills, which I appreciate. It's true.

186
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:42,860
It's true. Killed it, baby. Next one. Daydream Honeybee. Let's see what you bring with the

187
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
table.

188
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,340
It has been brought to my attention that in addition to committing the capital sin that

189
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:55,100
is crustless key to pizza, Ben St, whom you might know for having dug himself into

190
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,780
a hole where what personality he had that made him unique and defined has what interested

191
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:05,380
until it become indistinguishable from the cultic ideologues he now parrots and promotes

192
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:13,500
has been wasting perfectly functional nitroglycerin components on candies. I naturally hope that

193
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:21,220
is ashamed of himself, but I'd like to know at the very least if those chemicals haven't

194
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:30,340
been wasted in vain. So tell us, Ben St, when was the last time you had an original thought,

195
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:36,540
Ben St? I thought that, oh excuse me, I'm still reading Ash of Empires' excellent thread.

196
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:47,540
Anyways, the people want to know, where them gamys any good? Answer, Ben St.

197
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:56,860
You know, I made a, the other day, I was cooking it, I was cooking gelatin, right? I put all

198
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,940
this, right? Because, alright, to make gelatin with no lumps, you got to have like a high

199
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,340
ratio of gelatin to water, right? I have found that I can get away with maybe like one tablespoon

200
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:17,620
of gelatin in a quarter of a cup of water. And I can only do that by using like a wide

201
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,860
pan and putting the water in the wide pan and then sprinkling the gelatin on like over

202
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,540
the very top to get to the maximum surface area. Because the key to smooth gelatin is

203
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,420
you have to let all the granules hydrate. They must be spread out through the water,

204
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,180
they must have contact with the water in order to hydrate. And if they're clumped up together

205
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,500
or you dump it in one spoonful, it's going to clump, it's going to be hard and chewy,

206
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,340
it's going to make lumps, it's going to be bad. You have to get it smooth. And so that's

207
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:49,540
the best ratio I can get, but it's still not enough. If you do that, it is still too watery

208
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,820
and your gummies will come out too wet. So I had to do that and then cook it down. I

209
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,940
cooked it down to about two thirds of that level. It started at six cups, cooked it down

210
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,380
to four cups. Honestly, I think maybe I should have taken a little further, but that's what

211
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:09,180
I did. And then I used the last of my previous Jell-O that I had done. I had made a big batch

212
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,780
of it and kept chunks of it for heating up later. I used the last of it and the last

213
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:21,180
of the isomaltooligosaccharide syrup that I had cooked down to a cooking temperature

214
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:28,700
of 120 degrees Celsius, which at which point it becomes dense enough, it's dehydrated enough

215
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,940
that at room temperature, it becomes hard. You have to heat it up for it to become liquid

216
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,380
so that you can pour it and work with it. So you heat that up, you heat the gelatin

217
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,380
up, you mix it together and mix it together. And I put in the last of my mango flavoring

218
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,700
and blah, blah, blah. And it turned out this batch came out a little fucked up because

219
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,900
I did not put enough gelatin in. It was too syrupy. It's too stretchy, but also it like

220
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:57,020
froze on the inside. So it's like, it's too stretchy and gooey. It's not gummy-ish enough.

221
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,500
It's not solid enough or chewy enough, but it's also got these like hard lumps on the

222
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:08,300
inside. It's not gelatin clumps. It's like the syrup. It's like chunks of the hardened

223
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,500
syrup as though it were room temperature. It didn't mix into the gelatin well enough.

224
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,260
The flavor is like overpowering. I put the last of the mango in so I just kind of dumped

225
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,740
the rest in and it was too much. It's too strong. It's overpowering. It's unpleasant.

226
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,020
So that was the last batch I made and I'm not willing to throw them away. So I've just

227
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,060
kind of been like having one every like eat like part of it and try to avoid the hard bits

228
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,260
like, okay, I like the tanginess. Even if the flavor is a little weird. So I've been working

229
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,020
my way through that. I have another batch of the cooked down gelatin in the fridge. I made

230
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:46,020
a lot of it, but I still have to cook down more of the syrup because at like normal temperature,

231
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,100
the concentration I have it mixed at right now is unworkable. I have to cook it down.

232
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,140
It's very important that the final product not be too wet or it's just like bleh. So

233
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,380
this last batch was not great, but I have had good batch. I've had a couple of really

234
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:10,540
good batches lately actually. So yes, I guess, yes, question mark is the answer. Lamal.

235
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,340
Next one was from smear, which they listened to on the episode. So I'll skip that for now.

236
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,500
Forever. Look, next one is from Woo Woo. Here we go.

237
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Hello, a PCP. I was wondering, what, do you like, do you like pineapple in your salad?

238
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:41,820
I already said yes. I already said pineapple was my favorite fruit in a fruit salad. You

239
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:51,660
know what, you know what, you know, let me, I like, if I'm in the right mood, sometimes

240
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,940
a fruit salad has like cherries in it, not like maraschino cherries, not like the ones

241
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:01,260
in the soup, but like the fresh ones, a little dark red ones. I might, I like those because

242
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,580
like you can like pick them up and eat them and they still taste like a cherry. They don't

243
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,060
have that in a fruit salad. You know, I take it back. It's not pineapple because pineapple

244
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,620
absorbs the flavor of all the other. I don't like it. I don't like it in a fruit salad.

245
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,100
It all, each of the fruits absorb one another's flavors. I hate that. And pineapple is guilty

246
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,900
of that. So pineapple might be one of my favorite fruits of the fruits among the fruit salad,

247
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,140
but in a fruit salad, loses its individuality and I don't like it as much. So I'm going

248
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,780
to amend my quest, I'm going to amend my answer to cherries, but only the fresh kind, not

249
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:37,780
the soggy kind. Next one, the tea question. We need to address the elephant in the room,

250
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,980
the tea question, the tiny Timmy question. This guy submit so many goddamn voice mails

251
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:51,100
every week and everyone agrees that they're shit. How is he not in the voice jail by now?

252
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,940
Look, I know I'm not one to point fingers, but Jesus Christ man, he submits like 10 fucking

253
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,620
voice mails a week and now that they're democratized and they're all being played, it's fucking

254
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,620
hell. I've exacerbated the problem. I don't remember which ones are Timmy and which ones

255
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,940
are not. I'm actually pretty bad at distinguishing voices. So for my part, most of the time I

256
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:21,940
probably don't even realize when I'm playing a Timmy voicemail. So, I don't know. Whoops.

257
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:31,420
Next one, BGE monthly cast. What's that? Hey guys, don't want to turn this into the fucking

258
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,180
Nate podcast or anything, but just because you guys mentioned it last episode, yeah,

259
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,180
Nate does have a patron only podcast that he does, but what do you know? What's today?

260
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,680
August 1st, and he didn't release one in July. What do you know?

261
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Okay, thanks for the update, my man. Next one's Margar, already played it. Skipped

262
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,420
it. Next one, Dirty Hippie with a clean butthole. Let's see what that's all about.

263
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:15,420
So I was like hanging out with my fellow dudes or whatever and like while they were taking

264
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:23,420
turns eating on my asshole, I was like, why do they call it getting your salad tossed?

265
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,420
And I was like, what kind of salad would my asshole be? I don't know, bro, but what kind

266
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:36,420
of salad would your asshole be? It would be a fruit salad because I am gay. It would

267
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,920
be a hamburger cauliflower salad because it just would be, I don't know, that's just

268
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,920
how God made me. Thanks for your input. Next one, please God you stupid fucks.

269
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,920
This is a criticism of the PCP. Every single fucking episode, someone believes a sarcastic

270
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,920
voicemail like, I'm a person with dumb opinions, I believe this in every single time, without

271
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,920
fail. Someone's like, man, why does this person believe this dumb thing? These aren't text

272
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,920
messages, you can hear tone, you can hear the tone of my voice right now. You can hear

273
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,920
the tone of their voice, you can hear them going like, I believe that communism is bad.

274
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,920
And then Ben's like, communism isn't bad. Like Jesus Christ, this person is agreeing with

275
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,920
you, please, please God, okay, that's all. I don't just feel bad, feel bad about yourselves.

276
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Thank you.

277
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Okay, thank you. I will take it under advisement. I apologize for everything. What do you think

278
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:54,920
everyone? Do we not pick up on social cues? Okay, next one is from crack and I know they

279
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,920
played this one on the episode, but I have, I have reason to believe that there's more

280
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
to this one. So I'm going to play it again for context.

281
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Hey Ben, did you see all the tweets about UFOs being real?

282
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
No.

283
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,920
It's really funny how everybody was saying Space Jam was real when they canceled the

284
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,920
NBA for the virus and now aliens are just real. You're an astronomer, retired space

285
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,920
counselor. I know you're on top of it. Just thinking about you.

286
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,920
I, I don't know about aliens being real. I didn't see anyone saying Space Jam was real

287
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:35,920
when the NBA was canceled. But these concepts are not so outlandish that I cannot close

288
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,920
my eyes and visualize and see them as though, as though they're coming true before my eyes.

289
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Okay, I can see it now. I understand. I can infer context. Okay, got it.

290
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Next one, Mickey Mouse.

291
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Hey Ben, we're in a real dilly of a pickle here down at Walt Disney World. Our gas

292
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,920
members are dropping like flies to the coronavirus and we got a big game coming up.

293
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Lace up the basketball shoes your mom gave you and get down here to Orlando, Florida.

294
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,920
We need to beat these monsters. Lace them up, Ben, or you'll have to dribble again.

295
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,920
I don't believe that I don't believe Mickey took place in, I don't believe Mickey or any

296
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,920
other Disney characters took part in the battle against the monstars. Neither, they're not,

297
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,920
I don't remember the name from the movie. They certainly weren't in Charles Barkley

298
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Shut Up and Jam Guy Den. I think you perhaps might be thinking of Who Framed Roger Rabbit,

299
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,920
which as we all know is the prequel to Space Jam, took place before the Disney apartheid

300
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,920
that saw all the Disney characters shunted off into the ghetto, which is why they don't

301
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:54,920
appear in Space Jam. I don't know. That's it. So where in the timeline, where in the

302
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,920
timeline of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Space Jam, Charles Barkley Shut Up and Jam Guy

303
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Den? Could this voice, I don't know, probably, you know what? Write me a fucking, write me

304
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,920
a two and a half page short story about it at me on Twitter and I'll read it. Someone

305
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,920
explain this shit to me. It doesn't make any sense. Where's the historicity? Where's the

306
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:26,920
verisimilitude? Next up, Ben S. Who could this be? Let's find out.

307
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Listen here, Ben, Saint. Facts don't care about your feelings. But I do. How you doing, man?

308
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:43,920
How's it going, how's it going? Hope you're doing well.

309
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Yeah, thanks. I'm just mad on Twitter, man. Just mad on Twitter at people like you.

310
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Okay, great. Next one is from, wait, they listen, this was Simon's I Don't Like Salad. After

311
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,920
all these fucking salad posts. Everyone fucking salad posting in the voicemail this week. What

312
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:12,920
is some kind of virus? It's as though some kind of virus we're spreading among people

313
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:20,920
that makes them think about salad or something. I'm not sure what to make of it. Next one

314
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,920
is called Yeah. You know, there's something reassuring about the fact that Nate will most

315
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,920
likely, likely die before you. Knowing that he will have to face his death in his own cowardly

316
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:40,920
pathetic way. I do, I do. A truly sense of curse of curry.

317
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Who's going to die? Did you say Nate was going to die? Did you say Iowa? Speak up.

318
00:22:49,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Your message was muddled. Terrible. Bad, bad job. Next one, your eating preferences.

319
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Alright, you fucks. Do you prefer eating salad on a plate or in a bowl? And double question.

320
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:18,920
When you're eating salad, do you prefer a fork with long prongs or short prongs? We

321
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:29,920
need to know. Um, all my forks have the same prong length. I never think about prong length.

322
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:37,920
I don't know. I have no idea. Um, who the fuck would eat salad on a plate? I guess like

323
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,920
that's awful. Imagine trying to eat salad on a plate. I, I don't have bowls big enough

324
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:50,920
to make salads that, that do it for me. Like I, the biggest bowls that I have are these

325
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,920
like, kind of, they're sort of like long-ish bowls, like you might serve soup in. And like

326
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,920
they just don't hold that much salad. So when I make a salad, which I do a lot lately,

327
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:12,920
um, just, just spring mix, Caesar dressing, grated Parmesan cheese, baby. No, I don't

328
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,920
even mix it in a bowl. I mix it in like the biggest tupperware I have. Like a big, maybe

329
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,920
like, you know, I have a big, I don't know how big it is. It's like maybe like nine inches

330
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,920
by nine inches square and kind of deep. I don't know. It's, it's, I mix it in that because

331
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,920
I just need the biggest vessel because I need to fucking mix it all. I need to mix all the

332
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
leaves up because they're not packed that tightly. I have to, I have to toss them around.

333
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,920
You got to toss them around. And if the bowl isn't big, if there's not excess volume, they're

334
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,920
going to fucking come out the sides and I have to clean it up. And that's stupid. No, no,

335
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,920
no, no, no. Big bowl, deep bowl, no plate. Give me a, give me a freaking break. Why don't

336
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:58,920
you? Um, next one, weird Al Yankovic. Hmm. Although they spelled it Yankovic, but whatever.

337
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,920
All right. What's, what's up? Hey, it's me. Weird Al Yankovic. And I got a pirate lead

338
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:10,920
from Ben's song from the last episode. It sounds just like him. I believe in the Quran and the

339
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:21,920
people of Iran. Please join us. Okay. Thanks for, thanks for parodying my dream song to make

340
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:30,920
out Islam. That's, it's, it's pretty edgy. That's pretty edgy for compared to your usual content.

341
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Mr. Weird Al Sir. But I, you got to take chances sometimes. You know what? You got to speak truth

342
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:45,920
to power. Appreciate it. Next one. They listened to Why Munchy Why. So we're, we're there. We've

343
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,920
arrived. The last one that was skipped over last time was called left. Actually, I think

344
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,920
maybe that this one was not posted by the time last episode was, but we skipped it and

345
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,920
thought we did and didn't read it. So I'm going to read it anyway. It's called leftism

346
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:05,920
in my PCP returns probably a week late again. So let's hear that. Yeah, this is the guy

347
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:12,920
that left the voicemail where I not so subtly through shade at Nate because I think he needs

348
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,920
to read another book. Right. I still think that, but I want to apologize because I left that

349
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:25,920
expecting Nate to not be there to defend himself and that's, that's not cool. And also

350
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,920
I am clarifying that I was talking about the conversation that Ben and Digi were having

351
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,920
on the episode where they were together before Gib came in and not the episode where Ben was

352
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,920
just rambling on his own because I don't think Ben talked about politics when he was just

353
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:51,920
by himself. Not really. I'm not going to go back and double check that though. So maybe

354
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,920
I'm wrong. I don't know. Thanks for everything. All you guys do, including the ones that I

355
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:06,920
not so subtly make fun of. Yeah. I shit. I don't remember. Right. This person wrote

356
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,920
in or called in another voicemail called leftism in my PCP. And I'm sorry to say, but I don't

357
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,920
remember off the top of my head what you said in that one about Nate or anything else for

358
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,920
that matter. But if, but if, oh wait, I see it. I'm not going to listen to it. Whatever.

359
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Maybe you, the viewer, remember that voicemail and you can draw in for some context and glean

360
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,920
something about what this person's intended message. As for me, I'm too stupid and that's

361
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:44,920
going to do it for this extra special edition of PCP extra credits. Ben listens to every

362
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:52,920
voicemail in protest. Um, that's so the next time, the next time you fat cats, the next

363
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,920
time you fucking bourgeois PCP members want to go and, and, and, you know, ruin, destroy

364
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,920
post office, you know, a gerrymander against, against, uh, against voicemail on a gerrymander,

365
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,920
the voicemails want to do some voter suppression against our beautiful Colin, Colin fans. I'm

366
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:21,920
here then saying the people's champion to lift up the marginalized, downtrodden, disenfranchised

367
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:30,920
PCP listeners, um, so that everyone can make fun of them and their shitty voicemails equally.

368
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Thank you for listening. Good day, sir. And madam.
