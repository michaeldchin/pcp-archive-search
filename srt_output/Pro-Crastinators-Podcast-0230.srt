00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Welcome everybody to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're here, we're

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,760
back, we're listening to, we're doing the corporate thing and listening to audience feedback.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,720
Oh, PCP, why don't you get a guest? God, it's so boring listening to the same three people

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,160
over and over again. Why don't you get Cybershow on the podcast? He's like, he's a fan, just

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,760
came back, made some good videos, he's a good boy. And we were just like, God, imagine

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,720
listening to the viewers, imagine giving them what they want. So here's Cybershow, everybody.

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,080
I gotta say, they asked me to join them on this episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,800
and I told them no, I will absolutely not do that, that sounds horrible. I'm no interest

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,120
in doing that and I hate all your fans and don't listen to your fans, whatever you do.

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,800
And then I said, that's so such a coincidence, we feel the exact same way, that's why we

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
get along so well.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,560
Anyways, we got along, we started talking about how much we all hate the PCP fans for a few

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,440
hours and then like, eventually I agreed to come on the show.

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,640
Yeah, I mean, everybody can talk about how much they hate the PCP in the comments, but

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,360
nobody hates it more than we do.

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,080
I was going to do a bit, I was going to do a bit where I started crunching on some chips

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,440
and I was going to say, hey, welcome to the crunch cast, but I'm too, I feel too sick,

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,960
I feel too ill, I can't bring myself to do it. I can't bring myself to put anything in

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
my mouth.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,920
Yeah, I think Ben's dying, I don't know what's going on, but he's dying guys.

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,960
I broke Keto this weekend and I went out and I splurged and I was like, you know what,

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,120
if I'm off Keto, I might as well eat some carbs that I like, so I've been eating, I

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,440
eat Dunkin Donuts, I eat Doritos and I don't know man, one or two of those things must

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
not have agreed with me.

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
We're too old to have fun.

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
I'm going to die.

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Without food.

28
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
I'm going to die right here.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,160
It just doesn't work like that anymore.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,000
Every time I have Doritos, I feel good for about 10 minutes and I feel bad for about

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,280
10 hours and it really is the worst thing of all time.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,040
Once you hit, everyone's like, oh, your 30s are your best years.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
No, no, no, no, no.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,720
As soon as you hit 30, it's your life's basically over, you're no longer living.

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,920
You've just begun the 50 year process of dying when you hit 30.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,800
They just contain all the same.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
They say this to Cybershell on the verge of 30 himself.

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm sure you're really looking forward to it now.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,200
Yeah, I turn 30 next month in October and I'm not looking forward to it at all.

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I know.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Party, this last month.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,120
This is the last, this is the last month of my life I get to be happy and enjoy things

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,920
before my body just gets destroyed by itself.

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,640
I can still remember what it's like to eat fast food in Doritos.

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,760
I remember eating fast food Doritos and feeling happy and they just made me feel

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,840
happy and good and I didn't die like a party pack from Taco Bell and just like not missing

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
a beat.

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,880
The idea of eating 12 tacos was like, it wasn't funny to me.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,680
It was just like, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm going to do that.

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,440
Now I look at a party pack and I feel like I'm dying.

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
It's the worst.

53
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,200
I actually, I seriously actually am considering going and making myself vomit because it's

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
like that serious.

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,000
The feeling when you want to vomit, but you can't vomit.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's the worst feeling.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,920
That's so much worse than actually vomiting feels good because then it's like done.

58
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,760
I mean, doesn't feel good to do it, but it feels like such old people right now talking

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,120
about how good it feels to vomit.

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,400
But like, can we just, can we pause and can we appreciate?

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,320
I love it when I have a smooth bowel movement, but just Ben, can we just appreciate for a

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,680
second viewers, listeners that we have the virgin Nate who won't come on the podcast

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,040
for months because he just doesn't feel like it.

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,000
Then we have the Chad Ben who's like wants to make himself puke because he feels so bad,

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,760
but is still on the show anyways.

66
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm just saying credit where credit is due to hell or high water.

67
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,000
People thought I was joking, but no, I'm Ben is actually like on the verge of death right

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
now.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,640
We might have to delete this episode because he could die during it.

70
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,600
That would be, no, I want, I want to die.

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,880
I want to die on air or die on recording, not to get like super dark about it, but it

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,000
would be so like, think about how legendary it would be to like die in the middle of like

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the live performance.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,880
Like I'm not saying I want him to like imagine if Kanye West was like right in the middle

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,360
of the Super Bowl halftime show.

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
He just pulled out a gun and like blew his brains out.

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,080
Everybody would be talking about that for the rest of all time.

78
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
I don't know.

79
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
I'm just saying hypothetically.

80
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Don't tempt me.

81
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,960
It's like that episode of boondocks where he's like, I got shot.

82
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,480
He's like, no, I got shot for real because he gets shot singing the song.

83
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
I got shot.

84
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
What a classic.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,800
What a classic early 2000s reference that our audience is too young to remember.

86
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,760
Classic interpretation of the boy you cried wolf.

87
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,280
And yes, our audience, your audience, I should say, I'm sure the average age is around 12

88
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
years old.

89
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
So they don't even know what adult swim is, let alone the boondocks.

90
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
They certainly act like it.

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,680
They're all, they're all at home wearing their no Nate, no watch shirts.

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,840
They're new, newly available.

93
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,960
We got the no Nate, no watch and the no Nate.

94
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Yes.

95
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Watch you get to choose your team.

96
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Choose your side.

97
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Pick a side.

98
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,480
How will history remember you?

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
This is the time.

100
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,160
This is when legends are made up on the tea spring.

101
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,960
I've been going crazy on tea spring lately.

102
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Every week.

103
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
We got new shirts.

104
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
It's so easy.

105
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Yeah.

106
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Just to make things.

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
No one will ever buy.

108
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Haha.

109
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
I actually did it.

110
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Dog.

111
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Dog.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,680
Everybody bought an I have COVID shirt.

113
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Oh my God.

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
Do you think they actually have COVID and that's why they bought it?

115
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
No, I don't.

116
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,960
That would make too much sense to actually do that.

117
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,160
That wouldn't be me me enough to actually broadcast the fact you have COVID with an

118
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
appropriate t-shirt.

119
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,400
It would be misunderstanding the purpose of the shirt, but I do think that if you're

120
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,960
listening to the show and you do get COVID, you probably should buy the shirt.

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:06,160
It would be pretty not epic of you to have COVID and be a PCP listener and not buy the

122
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
shirt.

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,560
It would be the ethically responsible thing to do to let your community people around

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
you.

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
I think it would be doing your part for society too.

126
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Yeah.

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Absolutely.

128
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,560
We live in an age where you can just go online and make a t-shirt.

129
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,120
People in the middle ages, peasants, they all wanted their own customized, personalized

130
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,040
t-shirts, but they couldn't have them.

131
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,360
They just take it for granted nowadays, I think.

132
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,160
They wanted their, you know, I have the bubonic plague shirt, but there was no way to make

133
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
them back in the day.

134
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,480
Now we can do that.

135
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,720
They had to like stitch their shirts together out of hay and papyrus or whatever they had

136
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,080
back in the middle ages.

137
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
God.

138
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,320
They didn't have screen printing.

139
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,680
They didn't have digital monsters.

140
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,200
They barely even knew about the concept of slime.

141
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
They didn't even heard of slime.

142
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,480
They couldn't even process it in their pee little pee brains, and they certainly didn't

143
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,280
know how to use text commands.

144
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,920
Simon, how do you feel about Digimon?

145
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
You mean digital monsters?

146
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I mean digital.

147
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,840
I'm referring to the digital monsters, yes.

148
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Digimon?

149
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,320
I love Digimon.

150
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,720
I always thought that childhood drama of like Digimon is just a Pokemon rip off and then

151
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
all the kids are like, no, you don't understand.

152
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,200
Look at the Japanese release dates.

153
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
It's not, it's not true.

154
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,320
And then they're all, I mean, I can still vividly like relive all of those arguments

155
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,360
every time I hear the word Digimon.

156
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,760
Have we, have we talked on the show about getting the Digivices for a potential Radcon

157
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
5?

158
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,560
We have, because that was from a voicemail.

159
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,440
Okay, it was from a voicemail.

160
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Oh man.

161
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,080
I just, I watched, did I already talk about, I went and I watched some, some like, some

162
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,440
YouTuber who is specifically a Digimon YouTuber.

163
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,000
He does like product reviews.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh of course.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,160
He's, he's got like 500 subs, but he puts out like tons of videos.

166
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
You know.

167
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
It's amazing.

168
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,560
Dude, I love, I love those people who have like 100 subs and they put out videos every

169
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
single day.

170
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,200
Those guys are the backbone of YouTube.

171
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
They really are.

172
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Yeah.

173
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,880
I don't have a spec for them, but I have someone who has like millions of subscribers and

174
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
makes garbage.

175
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,880
You know, they're doing it for the passion.

176
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,280
I want to shout this guy out because he has got, he is like in it.

177
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,040
He's got like, like banner art of himself with his favorite Digimon and, and stuff like

178
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
that.

179
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,840
Digimon, how would, how would I find that specific guy?

180
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,440
Just go to your history if you were watching videos, they're probably in your history.

181
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,880
I was, but this was like a couple of weeks ago.

182
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,480
Well, we got to scroll for a little bit.

183
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Shout out to Elecmon.

184
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
That was always a Digimon.

185
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,440
I wanted to be my partner back in the day.

186
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
I thought his design was really cool.

187
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
I liked them.

188
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,920
I liked, I liked the, I liked a couple of the, I didn't like any of the small versions,

189
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,840
but there were a few of the ultimates that I liked.

190
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,120
I liked the, I liked Megacaboo Terrimon a lot.

191
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
He was pretty beast.

192
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,040
I liked, I liked Lily, Lilymon, I thought was, was cool in a totally different way.

193
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,480
Garudamon.

194
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,680
Garudamon was maybe my favorite.

195
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,640
I liked its beak.

196
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
Garudamon was pretty dope.

198
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,080
Do you ever see Hercules Caboo Terrimon, the mega form that was never in the show?

199
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,520
No, he's even bigger.

200
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,720
He's all gold and had big, giant fucking horns.

201
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
Super cool.

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm really bad at remembering their names, but I always love that big fucking cactus.

203
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,640
I don't know why, I just like cactuses.

204
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,040
Yeah.

205
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,200
Togamon was this shirt.

206
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,040
Super cool.

207
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,400
Yeah, absolute badass.

208
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,960
You know, something about Digimon, it didn't like, like it didn't like viscerally frighten

209
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,360
me as a kid, but like the idea that like a little weird blob could turn into this like

210
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,440
gigantic angel creature.

211
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,880
It was so different from Pokemon, which was like, you know, Charmeleon was like a little

212
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,920
slightly bigger, slightly different Charmander.

213
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,320
You never knew what the fuck was going to happen with Digimon.

214
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,360
That shit was wild.

215
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,440
It really was so much more creative than Pokemon, just in terms of just like whatever drugs

216
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,720
they're around, they came up with the character designs were insane.

217
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,720
Yeah, you know, the weirdest thing in the world is happening to me right now.

218
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,960
I'm going, I'm on YouTube and I when I go to YouTube, it goes to like YouTube.com

219
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,440
slash app underscore shell, question mark, courage underscore shell equals one.

220
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,760
And then it just keeps refreshing itself over and over again.

221
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
I YouTube is having a refresh loop.

222
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,320
Yeah, that's peculiar.

223
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,200
What's going on here?

224
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
OK, no, it's fine.

225
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,320
No, it's fine. It's fine.

226
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
I fixed it. I fixed it.

227
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
I don't know. That was very scary.

228
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,640
That was very scary.

229
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,880
I don't like it on my computer, just since I don't understand.

230
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,280
I'm still looking for this guy because he has like he I was so charmed

231
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,320
by his by his tiny little channel.

232
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
You can always tell when like it's a YouTuber that's just doing it

233
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
for the love of the game.

234
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,440
You know, they really like they really aren't doing it for fame.

235
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,920
You know, you can really tell there's people that just like they don't.

236
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,520
They wouldn't care if no one watched it.

237
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
I guess they would probably want someone to watch their videos,

238
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,160
but they don't need like a million subs.

239
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,440
They're happy with like a hundred views, you know, they're either.

240
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,720
I found it super.

241
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,040
His name is his name is Digital Dream, and he has two point six case of.

242
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,320
Oh, OK. So not quite as few as I that's that's still some hustle.

243
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,160
That's impossible right there.

244
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,360
You got, you know, that's when you know someone's either like super

245
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,760
passionate or super autistic and that they're just keep going.

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,080
He seems perfectly, perfectly like normal in his videos, not to be not to be.

247
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,560
What's the word?

248
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,520
Neurotypical centric or anything, but he seems like a perfectly reasonable fellow

249
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,400
who just reads, you know, he's got his room full of Digimon toys

250
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,000
and Digimon posters and stuff and like every fucking couple of days

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,560
he puts in a new video reviewing a new if he has a room.

252
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Digimon product, which I'm shocked you're even still coming out.

253
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,560
Well, the thing is like a lot of those old Digimon things are worth

254
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,040
stupid money at this point because they're so hard to find now.

255
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,920
So if he has a room full of stuff, it's probably worth like thousands and thousands of dollars.

256
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,960
Oh, my God, he got it.

257
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,200
He got it two weeks ago.

258
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
He got a new tattoo.

259
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,360
He got a new Digimon tattoo. Oh, my God, that's based as fuck.

260
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,760
It's a do you want to guess?

261
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,280
Oh, God, I don't have no concept context for this guy.

262
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,080
So I have no idea.

263
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,000
There's so many choices. Yeah, how would you even know?

264
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,520
It's it's Graymon. Fuck.

265
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,880
Yeah, the classic is I think is I think his favorite is the Graymon.

266
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,200
I mean, that's like if you started watching with the original series,

267
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,080
you got to love I'll go.

268
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,880
I wish I could clown on this guy, but it's it's actually not that bad of a tattoo.

269
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,680
It's pretty cool.

270
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,840
Yeah, it's fine.

271
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,520
It could be the worst.

272
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,280
It's just a while to me that like it's just a for a Digimon tattoo.

273
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,720
I mean, I don't know how much of a pussy magnet is going to be.

274
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,320
It's got a little intro drawing of him and Gilman. Fuck.

275
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,080
Yeah. Oh, oh, we filmed at the film.

276
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm doing it. Yeah, Gilman.

277
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
That one.

278
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,880
The the one in this icon from series two from series three.

279
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,680
Oh, OK. Whatever.

280
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,160
Yeah, that was such a cool fucking concept for a show.

281
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,920
Man, season three of Digimon was so good.

282
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,040
I don't ironically incredible.

283
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,800
I stopped watching it when they changed the main cast.

284
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,560
No, well, they changed the main cast like every season.

285
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,800
But like season three was so cool because like they frayed.

286
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,320
The concept of the show was that like the characters existed in our reality,

287
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,800
where Digimon was a show and a card game and stuff.

288
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,800
But then like it was still real.

289
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,560
That's pretty meta for a show back then.

290
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,360
I got to say, you see that kind of thing nowadays.

291
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,520
But I'm pretty sure one of the people who was involved

292
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,160
in Evangelion wrote the show because the show gets super dark

293
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,560
and fucked up and weird and insane and like Digimon straight up like die.

294
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,480
Like one of their characters like partner Digimon just dies.

295
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,120
It's fucking sick. It's a 10 out of 10.

296
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
That's what I wanted season two to be.

297
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,160
Watch Tamers. Tamers is so good.

298
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I love it.

299
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,320
And like they change the evolution animations from like just like,

300
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,800
you know how in the olden's just kind of spin around and then get bigger.

301
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,240
In this one, like they turn into like like wireframes

302
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,640
and their skin gets ripped off as they like slowly like change.

303
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,000
It's like an animorphic sort of thing.

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,480
It's so fucking based.

305
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,560
Tamers is the shit fucked up as the animorphs transformations.

306
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,000
Is as close as you can get on Fox Kids in 2002 or whenever the fuck this came out.

307
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,280
It was super cool. Super kid.

308
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Tamers is a classic. It's a legend. It's amazing.

309
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,920
Are there are there still new Digimon things?

310
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,080
I mean, I feel like they're currently airing right now.

311
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,720
A kind of like spiritual successor to the original Digimon adventure.

312
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,760
It's like a retelling and like augmentation of the original storyline.

313
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,240
I've only watched the first couple of episodes.

314
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
They stopped airing it.

315
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,280
Yeah, I guess I guess this year or maybe last year they reissued some old.

316
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,160
I guess as I learned from Digital Dream,

317
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,760
you're not supposed to call them Digivices because they're not Digivices.

318
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,280
They are, you know, V pets or virtual pets is the word for the like the toy version.

319
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,680
Yeah, they take care of the original V pets.

320
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,360
They made some Digivices in the US that were kind of just like pendulum games

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,720
that didn't have like the pet raising part of it, which I had a bunch of those to some unrelated.

322
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,440
I don't know. What did you do with them then?

323
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,200
They just like you just like clip them on your belt or whatever.

324
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,480
And you walked around with them and then you just they just go through like these little levels.

325
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,160
The levels were divided up into steps.

326
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,480
So every time you took a step, your little Digimon walked through this level

327
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,320
and you would just fight other things that showed up and it was just like kind of a game

328
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,280
where you just fight other Digimon that at the end of every level,

329
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,600
there was a boss and if you beat the boss, you move on to the next level

330
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,040
and kind of followed the progression from the television series.

331
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,760
Kind of like a V pet slash Poke Walker sort of thing.

332
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,080
Yeah, it was like a Poke Walker like 10 years before the Poke Walker came out.

333
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,200
Yeah, I was going to say once again, Digimon does it before Pokemon.

334
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,800
Look, Digimon is objectively better than Pokemon.

335
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
Fight me. It's true. It's just cooler.

336
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,600
It's the show is better. The lore is more ridiculous.

337
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,480
You have one where a little a little cat turns into an angel,

338
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,440
which then turns into a dragon and you're just like, that doesn't make any sense.

339
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,160
But it's am I am I crazy or would Digimon lore make for a pretty good lecture?

340
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,920
Oh, it would be incredible. Yeah, OK.

341
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,680
That's what I'm thinking. That's the first thing I thought of

342
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
when I saw fucking mega evolutions of Pokemon was just like,

343
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,840
they they're never going to stop ripping off Digimon and they're never going to stop.

344
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,320
And they're going to keep getting away with it, too.

345
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,560
Oh, now they warped. Did you evolve? OK, I get it.

346
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,560
You fucking hacks work in a tent.

347
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,640
And that was like from season one where they unlocked their mega forms.

348
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,560
They had Wargreymon and Metal Guru Ruman.

349
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,400
I can't believe I still remember all of this,

350
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,080
but I watched these shows so much as a kid.

351
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,400
I could like I could do a lecture on Digimon right now, I bet.

352
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,040
Well, but I won't take the time for that.

353
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,320
Take the floor while I go and throw up.

354
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,040
Are you seriously going to puke?

355
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,840
No, probably not.

356
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,480
But I wish I could. I wish I would.

357
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
I did throw up on Friday.

358
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
I did wake up in the little bit of vomit.

359
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,880
Well, I mean, it's I just we've all been there.

360
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,400
It's just a Friday night for Ben saying, you know, I needed,

361
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,520
you know, my sheets needed to change anyway.

362
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,840
So it's fine.

363
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,840
Abhorrent.

364
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,760
The only the only time I've ever puked from drinking too much

365
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,120
was the first day of Radcon four.

366
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,880
I mean, that first stream.

367
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,080
I forgot that you did.

368
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,600
I remember that I did.

369
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
It was a nightmare.

370
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,600
I very rarely throw up from from drinking,

371
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
but I guess once in a while it happens.

372
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,040
And this I'm usually just one of those days.

373
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm just usually in charge of my own drinking

374
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
and I'll stop way before that.

375
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,880
But when you have people paying for you to keep taking shots,

376
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,480
you can't stop and you go past your limit and you die.

377
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,080
It was pretty legendary, though.

378
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,000
It was it was a great time.

379
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,880
It was totally worth vomiting.

380
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,120
The first day I'm there, I'm just like, this sets the tone.

381
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,640
It did. It was a perfect tone setter.

382
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

383
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,360
Speaking of lectures, it's not the same, but the cyber shell.

384
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,840
I I had not I had not really seen your channel before,

385
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,720
but someone someone told us there's people.

386
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,520
A couple of people said, like, hey, this guy,

387
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,560
cyber shell has been away from the YouTube from the YouTubes.

388
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,560
And he's just he's just came back.

389
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,320
And apparently, he is or was a PCP head at some point.

390
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,600
And I was hearing about it because people were saying,

391
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,440
Ben, he mentioned your Tales of the Troll lecture in a video,

392
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,800
a Tales of the Troll video.

393
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,440
And I saw a bump. Indeed, I did. I saw a bump in views.

394
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
I probably made.

395
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,040
I probably made about like 80 or $90 just an ad revenue

396
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,920
from the fact that you mentioned my videos.

397
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,120
I saw a bump in views and ad revenue for for a while.

398
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,360
I might still be in it.

399
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,800
I haven't checked it a little while.

400
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
So that was pretty cool.

401
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,040
I'm very glad you approve of that,

402
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,480
because I was really this close to just cutting that part out

403
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,560
because I felt bad because my I basically told people don't watch the video.

404
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,920
I said, read the comic.

405
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,120
Don't go watch this lecture,

406
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,240
even though it's ostensibly aimed at people who haven't

407
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,520
don't know anything about Tales of the Troll.

408
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,040
But I do think it is a very good video.

409
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,000
I just, you know, I'm not like I don't hate spoilers.

410
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
You can watch the lecture and then read it and it would still be fun.

411
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,720
But then I still felt compelled.

412
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,000
I should also mention the son of two lecture, which is the opposite,

413
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,120
which I do think is you should watch the lecture and then read it

414
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
because it's too it's too much to just try and read it.

415
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,960
I agree with what you were saying.

416
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,160
Yeah, it's the lecture is just like fully spoilers for Tales of the Troll.

417
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,760
In it, yeah.

418
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,000
And like the son of two, it's it's like, yeah, you need that extra context.

419
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,520
Tales of the Troll that's, you know, you, yeah, you should probably just read it

420
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,920
yourself first, because it's not even that long as someone who is in the audience

421
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,960
for the fucking Tales of the Troll lecture.

422
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,840
I think even in the video, you can tell I go from like casually

423
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,240
dismissing this idea to becoming incredibly invested by like the halfway point

424
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,440
in the fucking narrative of Tales gets trolled and how it's just from the plot

425
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
summary, just from the order of events, you can tell it's going to be a good story.

426
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
But I mean, there is something to say about

427
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,360
Laserbot's presentation of the whole thing.

428
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,480
But yeah, it was I really, really enjoyed watching the lecture because I love

429
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,720
seeing people's reaction to Tales gets trolled and I love showing it to people.

430
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,680
So it was it was a real treat seeing like a live reaction to just every absurd

431
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,160
plot point in that entire thing.

432
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,640
I had not seen the the new pages.

433
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,840
I think you showed some of them in your video.

434
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, see, that was another reason I wanted to make the video, which is again,

435
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,360
I do like your lecture, but when you did the lecture, it was in full on hiatus mode.

436
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,480
And then I it's back up again with new pages.

437
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
But I don't know how many people like how how do people like how are people?

438
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,080
Who's going to know about who's going to know to check that?

439
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,480
You know what I mean? I heard that it had started coming out again.

440
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,680
I can't believe it's like it's like done.

441
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,000
It's like drawn by someone else, but it's canon.

442
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,080
It's so weird. Yeah, it's it is.

443
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,480
OK, so it's so jarring, like, especially if you're just reading it,

444
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,400
like you're not even expecting that it's so jarring, the change in art styles.

445
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,480
But like it's one of those things where it's really cool because it's just for a fight scene.

446
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,800
Like it's it's legitimately great art.

447
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,920
It's just so different from Laserbot's aesthetic that it's it's strange.

448
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,800
But good news is that Laserbot is going to come back and start drawing again.

449
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,160
And then it's going to be like he does everything that's not a super complicated

450
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,080
fight scene, and then he's got the guys to do the fight scenes, the chapter 23 team.

451
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,720
You did you talk to Laserbot at all?

452
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,800
I have not talked to Laserbot.

453
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,280
I've talked to the tales gets trolled dot org admin and some of the other people

454
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,560
in that like area I haven't actually I know he commented on your video,

455
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,160
which I thought was really cool, and that made me interested in doing it, too.

456
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,680
He did. And I talked to him on Facebook a little bit.

457
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,000
And I was listening as you were talking about like, OK, I had not heard about

458
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,720
like the polished, I had not never even heard of polished.

459
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,040
Like that's so fucking funny that he thought it was such a strange story

460
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,680
that he's like, I'm going to go back and do this whole.

461
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,040
And I'm just going to add everyone.

462
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,440
Everyone was begging him like, stop, please.

463
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,200
Like every time you put out a new page, people are like, oh, cool.

464
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,560
But can maybe you should do this for this reason and this reason and this reason.

465
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,400
And he was like, he just it wasn't like he like read it and was like, oh,

466
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,000
I see what you're saying.

467
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,360
He was like, no, yeah, no, you're you're wrong.

468
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,600
That's so funny.

469
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,000
So I had not I had not heard of that.

470
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,120
But when I talked to him, he told me that the thing that he was going to do

471
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,840
instead of finishing Tales, Gets Trolled was to remake an old

472
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,360
like YouTube web series that he and his brother made called Micorat.

473
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,520
You seen that? Yeah, that was his.

474
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
I don't know the lore of Micorat.

475
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,840
I just know that that was his like avatar and his use.

476
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,960
I have watched all of Micorat and Micorat does not need a remake.

477
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,720
Micorat, the little I've seen seems like a very strange little.

478
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,200
It seems like it's like it is what it is.

479
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,000
Like it's a little YouTube thing and it should stay.

480
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,440
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure that Micorat is just like him and his brother

481
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,360
and their friend, like just ad-libbing into a microphone,

482
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,440
like just fucking around with no plan at all.

483
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,560
And then they just like went and like drew these like funny pictures

484
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,800
of like rats and dinosaurs over it.

485
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,040
Can you imagine being invested in something where it's just you and your

486
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,520
friends talking into a microphone with no plan at all?

487
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,520
OK, all right.

488
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,760
Burn. Can you imagine ad-libbing something and then animating it?

489
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,840
Like I'm pretty sure Rick and Morty rip these guys off big time.

490
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,640
And I think I'm seeing a laser ball lawsuit and imagine trying to remaster that.

491
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,560
Imagine trying to go back and remake it.

492
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,400
It does seem like I don't even understand it.

493
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,280
I don't understand what it is yet.

494
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,640
And like I mentioned in the video, like Super Mario Bros.

495
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,160
Z like like there's like multiple projects that like these people

496
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,280
are like creative types.

497
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,200
I mean, they're like, I'm just going to go back and start from the square one

498
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,680
and do it all over again, but better.

499
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,360
But it's like, yeah, no.

500
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,440
The whole point of art is like you get better over time.

501
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,080
Like by the time he catches up to like where he was,

502
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,880
he's going to be so good and even prove to skills even more

503
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
that he needs to remaster the remaster.

504
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,440
You know, yeah, it's just it's just one of those

505
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
artism things that just pervade the creative mind.

506
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,760
I don't know if it's really good.

507
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Has it ever been a good idea to like for a creator to go and like remaster their thing?

508
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,280
It is objectively bad every time.

509
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,520
If Tails gets trolled or this was completed, like it was done.

510
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,400
Like he finished the entire story, start to finish, told the entire thing

511
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,200
and he didn't have anything else he wanted to do.

512
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,760
Then maybe if he wanted to remaster it, I'd be on board.

513
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,520
But he literally stopped in the middle of a fight scene on a cliffhanger.

514
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
And people were like begging him to come back and work again.

515
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,320
And it was after a hiatus.

516
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,600
He came back to work on Tails.

517
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
His role. It was so funny.

518
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,840
It was like every single thing made it the bad, like the wrong choice, but he still did it.

519
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,040
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,840
No, so I'm yeah, I'm glad.

521
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,560
I'm glad that like the canon pages are coming out.

522
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,440
That's crazy. I haven't actually.

523
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,200
I'm so glad to see it going on.

524
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, it just like literally just a couple of days like two days ago,

525
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,280
the fight between Coyote and tomorrow finally, finally ended.

526
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,200
I saw someone wrote a I saw a spoiler for who won.

527
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
I won't repeat it.

528
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,440
This is the getting off a fucking the boat moment for Tails gets trolled

529
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,600
as far as I'm concerned, because now things can actually happen.

530
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,840
And then, you know, like spoilers, it is technically spoilers,

531
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,920
but the chapter 23 script was posted to his Patreon like years ago.

532
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,560
So I've sort of like known how this fight was going to play out for ages.

533
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,320
But it was it was really cool to see it like drawn.

534
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,280
And now I'm yeah, you know, it's actually not like not as an insult,

535
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,400
but it's it's really hard to read a laser bot script.

536
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,720
Not just because it's like it's like it's formatted to the point where like

537
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,640
it's genuinely hard to even tell when like one line starts and another stops.

538
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,760
You know what I mean? Yeah.

539
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,760
He'll write the character name and then just write the dialogue.

540
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,360
He'll write the character's name and the dialogue, but like no quotation mark.

541
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,480
So it's incredibly hard to tell what's going on.

542
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,680
But it was comprehensible enough that I got just what the fight is going to be.

543
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,280
I don't know if you have any idea,

544
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,680
but like did he used to like write the scripts out and then draw it?

545
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,360
Or did he just draw it as he goes?

546
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,760
Like, did he did he always think it?

547
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,440
I don't believe he always scripted.

548
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,360
I think he only wrote the chapter 23 script

549
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,760
because he was in one of those situations where he didn't have access

550
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,000
to his computer or whatever.

551
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,320
But yeah, you know, yeah, he had the idea.

552
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,680
He was the one saying, I wish I had a team to draw this for me way back in the day.

553
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,480
But it just, you know, he's not really the kind of guy

554
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,600
who's sort of going to be capable of putting together and managing a team.

555
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,760
You know what I mean? So that's so that sort of happened.

556
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,680
He's one sort of spontaneously formed from the talesgetstroll.org admin guy.

557
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,680
Just he will.

558
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,920
I mean, he just wanted to continue to see where it was going to go.

559
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,880
So he got some guys together and I should really join that discord

560
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,040
and like get better, you know, because I'm just talking over Twitter, DMs and stuff.

561
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,680
So yeah, there's like they they they they're making new pages and stuff.

562
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,560
And I'm very excited to see where it's going to go.

563
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,560
Damn, is this is this like the last chapter?

564
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,960
Is it supposed to like end relatively soon?

565
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,680
No, OK, so it's a little confusing

566
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,840
because the chapter that he's been on and working for for a long time

567
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,640
has been called the conclusion, but that's just referring to the conclusion

568
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,360
of the Coyote and Demaro fight.

569
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,800
Yeah, I'm not sure how much longer the actual comic is going to go.

570
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,400
He said different things.

571
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,680
I've seen a post where he's like, it's going to be 100 chapters long.

572
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,000
I saw a later post where he said it's going to be 60 chapters long.

573
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,480
And then I saw another post where he's like,

574
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,240
I haven't told a quarter of the story I wanted to.

575
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,040
So I have no idea how long it's going to actually end up being where could it even go?

576
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,480
That's what I'm trying to say.

577
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,800
Like, it's like, I know it's like it's he posted something incredibly

578
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,880
like when he canceled it or quote unquote canceled it,

579
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,600
he posted like a question and answer session on his DeviantArt

580
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,960
and people would just ask about random plot points and he did reveal some things.

581
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,920
And I don't know how much of that's going to like stay canon.

582
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,600
You know what I mean?

583
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,960
Because like he talked about the man and ice or whatever a little bit

584
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
and some just some of the weird, interesting things.

585
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,840
The man and ice, yes, the man and the ice, of course.

586
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,440
There's so many weird little plot threads that he like like seeds

587
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,200
and like things he's planted like.

588
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
And there's so many things it didn't really

589
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,120
even seem like he was wrapping up like he was really introducing

590
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,240
it's not like the ant from ants was still like was like a new thing

591
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,920
that seemed like a complete out of nowhere like twist.

592
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
OK, so that's one of the funniest parts about polish.

593
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,080
It was that it really wasn't polished to such a misnomer

594
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,360
because it was so much of polish was new content added mixed in with the old content.

595
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,680
So it was literally like new comic mixed in with the old comic with which new are.

596
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,280
It was so confusing.

597
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
But yeah, it's so funny.

598
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,960
The new stuff was not.

599
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,240
I mean, the new stuff was was it good at all?

600
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,080
Or was it just like padding?

601
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,320
The new stuff in Tales.

602
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,000
It's true polish.

603
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,440
I don't want to just dismiss it all as being like bad.

604
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,360
But like I tried to explain to you like, you know,

605
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,040
a lot of the good parts of early Tales gets trolled is things

606
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,160
are just like happening at a very brisk pace.

607
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,520
And like, you know, he's not overthinking.

608
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
He he was not overthinking it back in the day.

609
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,320
He was just like, I'm going to get a comic where Tales gets trolled

610
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,760
and then tales and they beat up the trolls.

611
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,120
And I don't even know if he really thought he was going to go further than that,

612
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,840
but he just kept going and going.

613
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,360
Yeah. And there's so many individual plot threads that have yet to pay off.

614
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,000
Like like you think in the early comic, Shadow and Mario and Bowser

615
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,480
and like the Troll Slayers, you seem like they're going to be so important.

616
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,840
They've spent the last like 20 chapters just like sitting in a field planning

617
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,160
that's like all they've been doing for years.

618
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,000
The way that the comic almost immediately pivots to not being about

619
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,200
Tales getting trolled, but being about this weird conspiracy theory

620
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,120
and like this war is like really funny.

621
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,040
And it's seen it really just seems like he had this initial idea about

622
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,720
like, how would have tales got trolled?

623
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,360
And then he had the and Sonic had to go and get revenge or whatever.

624
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,160
And then he like did that.

625
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,080
And then it's like, well, nothing else to say about that, I guess.

626
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,320
But I've introduced all these Troll characters and stuff.

627
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,160
And now I've put all these Sonic the Hedgehog characters together.

628
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,040
And I'll Mario's there and Bowser and whoever the fuck else from League of Legends.

629
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,960
And like, yeah, I'll just I'll just keep it going.

630
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,640
He's got like all these little warring factions that he's setting up.

631
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,480
And for one of the stupidest things I always thought was so funny was he's like

632
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,680
when he's showing off the defenders or whatever, he's like,

633
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,080
now I'm going to show you our two bosses.

634
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,800
It is like leapfrog and a frogger, but you only see him in that one page.

635
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,960
And then like now we'll show you our real main.

636
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you literally never see leapfrog or frog ever again.

637
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,920
After that, it's like, you're informed that they are the boss,

638
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,520
but there's like bigger bosses that matter more.

639
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,960
It's actually all that Pacman.

640
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,360
So fuck those other guys, they're unimportant, irrelevant.

641
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,200
Even then, even in the later chapters, now everything with Pacman is

642
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,400
completely even superseded.

643
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,160
And Pacman himself is just a pawn of the Cheeto man.

644
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,400
And I don't want to get into spoilers too much, but it's like

645
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
it's so confusing.

646
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,960
And like a lot of stuff he's definitely like didn't fully plan out.

647
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,120
But I know it's so funny that he's not Chester Cheeto.

648
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,880
He's just Cheeto man.

649
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,400
He's never going to correct it.

650
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,080
It doesn't matter.

651
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,120
That's what he's called.

652
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,520
That's what he's called in this universe and who are you to say otherwise?

653
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,720
Oh, my God.

654
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,080
I do love how he'll take characters and make them his own.

655
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,400
Like he clearly doesn't really give that much of a shit about silver the hedgehog.

656
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,840
He just sort of took the base and used them to make an interesting funny

657
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,680
character. But the weird thing is he does have a weird amount of like respect

658
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,840
for the lore, like silver is using his green telekinetic powers.

659
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,400
Like it's it's not it's not completely like it's mostly lore accurate.

660
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,480
It's just his personality is different and better, in my opinion.

661
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,360
I mean, yeah, I don't know.

662
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,960
I mean, I don't know shit about Sonic, so I don't know what silver is

663
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,720
actually supposed to be like.

664
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,240
I think he's like he's like really smart, right?

665
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,920
He's like some kind of super genius like psychic guy.

666
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,800
He's like it's a little confusing, but he's like from the future

667
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,320
and he's like, yeah, he's got psychic powers and he's sort of like an optimist type guy.

668
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,840
He's not like super smart.

669
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,680
He's just sort of like, I don't know.

670
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,640
He's not really the he's really not the most well fleshed out character,

671
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,120
which is why I think laserbot had more fun just sort of, you know, exploring him.

672
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,080
And I don't know, like, like, I just it's funny just to me to see his

673
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,200
like his interpretation of Sonic was really fucking funny to me.

674
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,920
And I just that almost instantly hooked me in the line where he's like,

675
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,200
sorry, tales of this looks gay to the viewers.

676
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,680
I don't know why that was I died laughing at that classic.

677
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,160
And then and then spoilers.

678
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,320
I don't want to get too much spoilers, but this is pretty early in on.

679
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,880
But when he actually did kill off Sonic, I was like, oh, oh, shit.

680
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,840
This is this is getting real.

681
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,560
I feel, yeah, I can't believe I like forgot to mention it in the lecture.

682
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,680
I just like if I had one tiny little complaint,

683
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,320
though my one and only tiny complaint with your lecture is you glossed over that.

684
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,880
But the fact that you just gloss over the fact that you even could forget

685
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,040
that plot point is hilarious to me because it really does like it.

686
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,400
It's funny. It's funny.

687
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,000
It doesn't really matter.

688
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,760
And it's like there's a point where he clearly wanted everyone to be on the same

689
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,200
page, but then he never had tales found out.

690
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,600
So tales finds out because Pac-Man tells him he can do the soul bond with Sonic,

691
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,560
who's dead. And then he's like, he's in tales like, but Sonic isn't dead.

692
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,840
And Pac is like, oh, shit, nobody told you.

693
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Waka, Waka. Oh, sorry about that.

694
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,120
It was cursed to say Waka from his childhood trauma.

695
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,680
Yes, the elaborate backstory for Pac-Man was so strange and funny.

696
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,120
He'll throw he'll throw characters in there.

697
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,880
And it's like he'll just kind of it almost seems like he's picking at random

698
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,120
like when he needs a new character, like Pac-Man.

699
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,920
It is really, really strange to mix like you wouldn't expect Teemo

700
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,040
and fucking Bugs Bunny in the same team.

701
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,760
Like he's not Pac-Man like like Chester Cheeto or Cheeto Man is not Cheeto Man

702
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,840
because like, you know, he like this character like has like this

703
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,800
this like cool guy attitude like Chester Cheeto.

704
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,040
I mean, he gives him a couple of lines or something

705
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,760
that sort of imply that he's like that he's a cool laid back dude.

706
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,840
But at the end of the day, you know, this is just like an Obi-Wan type guy.

707
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,120
And he could have it could have just if it could have been anyone.

708
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,400
And it maybe if it had been, I don't know, if it had been, you know,

709
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,880
Agumon or whatever, it would be the exact same character.

710
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,240
And just maybe he would make some jokes about fire breath instead of Cheetos.

711
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,440
And that would be that would be the different that would be the different thing.

712
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,600
I don't know.

713
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,160
It is funny to think it is almost completely random.

714
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,240
The characters he'll pick like he could have just done this.

715
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,160
He could have made this entire comic with just completely original characters.

716
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,200
You know, it could have been called laser.

717
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,280
Well, I guess trolled or just some original character, you know,

718
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,160
because it's really funny because it really just seems like he got trolled

719
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,080
and then he was pissed off and he wanted to vent and blow off some steam.

720
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,960
So he wrote a little story about killing trolls.

721
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,360
But then he himself has gone on record saying, oh, no, no, no, that's not what happened.

722
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,040
I didn't get trolled.

723
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,560
I based this story off of my friend who got trolled.

724
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,760
Like a likely story.

725
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,400
Uh, it's it's, um, oh, fuck, I was going to say, I was going to say something about

726
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,880
Oh, it's really funny, the juxtaposition between the like his original characters

727
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:29,160
and the like people like Pac-Man and and like Frogger and like all these

728
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,600
like goofy like children's cartoon characters juxtaposed against like all

729
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,280
these like weirdly over designed kind of like emo edgy anime people that all have

730
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,440
like it is really funny.

731
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,640
Yeah.

732
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,160
He has like he has his original characters that he wants to be cool like

733
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,840
tomorrow and like Alex who has got the care and he smokes a cigarette.

734
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,800
But he's also capable of making original characters like Rob, the guy with no ears,

735
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,880
who's just perfect in every way.

736
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,120
Yeah, yeah.

737
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,480
Rob's not like Rob's Rob is meant to be funny.

738
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,120
But then he like, I think he's supposed to be cool later on.

739
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,920
Like he's he's so strange because of the most powerful fighters.

740
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,520
Rob is like it is a joke like obviously intentionally supposed to be funny.

741
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,800
But it's like it's Rob is like funny intentionally and unintentionally

742
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,760
because, yes, he makes like he ends up becoming like this really bad

743
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,520
ass character later on is some really fun.

744
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,720
He's a really fun fight scene.

745
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,000
Oh, shit, he's dragon born and it all changes.

746
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,680
One of my top favorite fucking twists in the entire comic

747
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,240
because it's like it really was such a silly thing.

748
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,040
But all of a sudden it opens up all these new powers for Rob to have.

749
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,720
And it's sort of almost makes sense because like his ears

750
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,760
not having ears protects him from the shouts he does.

751
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,480
I don't even know. It's so fucking funny.

752
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,920
Oh, of course, he was dragon born the whole time.

753
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I should have known that in this world, some people are just dragon born

754
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,840
and they have whatever powers that entails.

755
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,360
I don't I'd never play it just like, you know,

756
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,360
Laserbot played Skyrim at some point and then he's just like,

757
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,440
yeah, I'm going to put that in the comic.

758
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,200
Like it's just so funny.

759
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,920
Like he will just put things in the comic and like there's no one in the comic

760
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,760
is ever like, hey, why is Bugs Bunny hanging out with Shadow of the Hedgehog?

761
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,800
It just makes sense. Like nobody questions it.

762
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
It's just like what a stupid question.

763
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,640
Like I could point to any two people on the street and be like, hey,

764
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,800
why is that guy hanging out with that? I don't know.

765
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,320
These are just these are people in this world.

766
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,000
Why would you at least in Sonichu there's like this sort of like

767
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,920
alternate dimension and like imagination type lore that almost sort of explains

768
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,000
that there's nothing like that in Tales of Troy. It's just this is the world.

769
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,080
Tales of Troy is simply a world in which the people happen to be

770
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,480
Bugs Bunny, etc.

771
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,080
Yeah, it's not like it's not like Sonichu where it's like this is this

772
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,480
this takes place in the cartoon version of reality where like cartoon characters are real.

773
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,360
The realm of pure imagination C197.

774
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,760
Exactly. There are reasons for the things that happen in Sonichu

775
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,440
with regards to fictional characters.

776
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,640
And then like, you know, they're aware that they're fictional and or at least

777
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,000
for our from our perspective.

778
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,880
Whereas, you know, Tales of Troy, it's like, again, you pretty much could have made

779
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,800
that comic with completely original characters.

780
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,720
You just would have had to have, you know, changed a few powers here and there.

781
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,680
But it's just so funny to me the way he was randomly wouldn't be the same.

782
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,480
It wouldn't.

783
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,160
Oh, that's the thing. No one would have ever discovered it.

784
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,600
No one would have cared about it because it's the beauty of seeing this.

785
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,120
Like this character, these like warped like it's entertaining versions of them.

786
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,760
It's Wiley Coyote, like pulling off this like master anime villain plan.

787
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,840
Like a piece of charm.

788
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Honestly, the story of any of the five people getting neutral powers

789
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,080
and becoming master necromancers, but learning how to hide in the shadows

790
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,800
and control their emotions is an interesting story.

791
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,800
But the fact it's Elmer Fudd and fucking Tom Sylvester and porcupine,

792
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,280
that makes it like God tier.

793
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,400
It's a beautiful juxtaposition.

794
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,600
The new the neutrals are I think I remember Digi

795
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,800
during the lecture says like this is just like cool.

796
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,000
This is just like cool anime story powers.

797
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,120
And it's like, yeah, the neutrals are actually kind of a cool

798
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,440
like at world element in in it.

799
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,000
And it's like kind of it's like, oh, wow, good job, ladies.

800
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,040
But you did it.

801
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,920
You had a good idea when you put it in your thing.

802
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,480
You start reading the comments.

803
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,240
Everyone starts reading the comic like as a joke to like be like,

804
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,200
what's this? This looks kind of stupid and funny.

805
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,600
And but like if you keep reading it, if you actually stick with it,

806
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,360
at some point you're going to get hit with a cool idea that you weren't like

807
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,720
you weren't ready to be hit with like an actually unironic thing.

808
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,360
So you're going to be blindsided by it.

809
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,120
And it's going to like hit you like like as if you were a kid

810
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,800
experiencing a cool thing for the first time like what you'll see.

811
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,720
You'll see fucking tomorrow, like pull out his third eye

812
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,040
and put you in like his mind dungeon or whatever.

813
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,360
And it actually looks kind of cool.

814
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,600
And you're like, oh, shit, fuck.

815
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,280
Well, here it is. Here we are.

816
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,840
It happened. And now it is interesting, although

817
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,360
it is interesting to think also that we are experiencing it

818
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,200
or at least people who are getting into it now rather are experiencing

819
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,640
it differently than the people who were there at the start

820
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,400
because he used to put out, you know, on a page by page basis.

821
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,960
Imagine if your favorite manga like Berserk or whatever

822
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,840
was published on a page by page basis, you know what I mean?

823
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,360
That would feel absolutely torturous.

824
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,320
Like it would feel like everything happens at a beyond a snail's pace.

825
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,200
So people got so pissed off at him when he stopped focusing on tales

826
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,880
and he just wanted to have a cool fight between two of his original characters.

827
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,640
And now when people go back, they're like, this is a cool, fun fight scene.

828
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,000
But at the time, people were so pissed off.

829
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,240
Like a month straight, like what happened to team up?

830
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,760
Yeah, there were a ton of people that weren't

831
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,240
on board with the idea of even attempting to like enjoy it unironically.

832
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,960
They just were like, I want to laugh at the silliness of the tales parts, please.

833
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,920
And that's it. But I was glad that laser was like, I don't give a fuck.

834
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,520
I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want to do.

835
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,840
It's exactly the same as like the Berserk reference you're talking about before,

836
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,600
like the whole boat getting off the boat thing.

837
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Like you read that now.

838
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,760
It's not nearly as bad as it is when you think about like for years,

839
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,440
people were waiting for that to end, but you can blow through it

840
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,320
and like less than an afternoon now, if you're just catching up to get

841
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,520
to where it is currently, like the distribution matters so much

842
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,120
and how these stories kind of like flow.

843
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,040
I mean, some of some of the original character fights are kind of lame.

844
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,360
Like, I think, I don't know.

845
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,680
I think when Rob fights the lightning guy, I was kind of like whatever.

846
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,920
But but but but that was so yeah, I will admit that one doesn't even take very long.

847
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah, it's short.

848
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,800
There's a lot of like new powers in that fight and there's always a risk.

849
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,600
Like it's always more fun to see characters who have like pre established

850
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,400
powers that you sort of like understand going against each other.

851
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,280
Whereas the yellow electric guy strikes me as a completely pointless

852
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,480
like inclusion, who it's like who gets like an orange screen time

853
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,000
relative to like what he actually means to the story,

854
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,920
which as far as I can tell is nothing.

855
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,280
I believe I believe his name is Pindo, which is a strange name.

856
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,320
But I'm not sure.

857
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,840
And yeah, it's like it is funny.

858
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,240
They sort of set him up as, you know, like he's going to be Rob's rival.

859
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,760
And he has this moment where he steals Elmer through the power lines.

860
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,720
He starts showing up in all these Troll King scenes.

861
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,240
I have much, much, much, much less investment in him compared to

862
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,240
way more of these other characters like Troll King, Cheeto Man, like Demaro.

863
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,640
There's there's so many good like antagonists that he has waiting the way.

864
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,400
And there's like interesting things like Troll King and Cheeto Man are

865
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,640
on their own separate factions and they're going to have their own things,

866
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,840
presumably, if they ever interact with each other.

867
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,800
And, you know, there's all the entire words of death plot line.

868
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,120
And even then Alex, the red hair, the troll with a little bit of red hair,

869
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,280
he's like secretly plotting against the Troll King.

870
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,200
So like I said, there's so many different plot threads that when

871
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,920
you're not getting that comic coming out at a regular pace, it's like

872
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,480
it can feel a little, you know, painful when it's like you just wanted

873
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,680
to see something happen with a character that you haven't seen in like 10 years.

874
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,920
Yeah, I'm I'm I don't know.

875
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,520
It's exciting that it's coming out again.

876
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,160
I should I imagine there's not that much new stuff out yet.

877
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,520
I don't know.

878
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,040
Do you think it's too early to go and check it out and like get caught up?

879
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,280
Should I more accumulate now that the chapter

880
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,880
twenty three fighting is done, I'd say it's worth reading that thing.

881
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,360
And like one sitting, I would say.

882
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,680
Yeah, I want to see that.

883
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,240
I totally I'm like on board.

884
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,600
I get it.

885
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,880
Like I love like binge reading through a whole long like longer

886
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,280
or something like having to come up with weekly updates just is like it's so slow.

887
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,080
It's like I just but I do want to support the comic is the thing.

888
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,360
And you know, the only way you can't you can't we're not going to be able to wait

889
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,320
for the volume sales on this one.

890
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,400
We're going to have to support them as it's coming out.

891
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,120
So how cool would it be to own physical copies?

892
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,000
I hope you don't I've thought about it.

893
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,240
I've literally spent hours thinking about this, but it's so strange

894
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,520
because the pages are different sizes and there's all these weird little things

895
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,040
you'd have to consider.

896
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,120
Like there's a lot to have to say.

897
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,840
I'm not giving I'm giving up on it.

898
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
One day I would love to own a fucking huge.

899
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,960
I'm sure it could be done.

900
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,280
Yeah, and it would be a fucking it would be a fucking mess.

901
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,760
But I mean, this is tells gets trolled.

902
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,720
We're talking about so like it would be OK.

903
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,440
I would I would just have to take the time to design and lay out a nice solid part back copy.

904
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,600
And again, I would I'm not sure how much like when I'm going to wait for him to finish.

905
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,200
But then it's like, I'll just I'll do a volume one that's like everything up to this point, at least.

906
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,480
And that I would love to have it on my fucking shelf.

907
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,400
That would be awesome.

908
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:16,760
Oh, man, laser, but you you dog, you devil, you've you've done it again.

910
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,680
It's so easy to just be like, oh, look, it's some silly

911
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,880
M.S. paint drawn with a mouse fan fiction comic.

912
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,760
Look how lame that is.

913
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,480
But it's actually like the coolest thing ever.

914
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,600
It's like, I don't know.

915
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,760
That's what's so good about it.

916
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,320
That's what's so good about it is how low it sets your expectation.

917
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,280
I always I've just been obsessing over this idea of how like cool it is to actually make a thing.

918
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,840
Like it was I'm a big fan of all the PCP lectures I've seen, but I haven't seen all of them.

919
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,440
And there's some I'm waiting to see like I haven't read one piece yet.

920
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,000
So I'm not going to watch that one for a while.

921
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,680
But I just recently watched Kokoro wish and I was thinking like, God damn,

922
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,600
I just came into this to laugh at some fucking autism comics.

923
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,680
And this is actually cool as hell.

924
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,840
What the fuck? That was a mind fuck.

925
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,680
Oh, yeah.

926
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,880
She that that one's weird.

927
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,640
I feel like I feel like Jennifer is a bit of a legitimate law cow.

928
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,240
But like it doesn't really come through and I don't talk about it that much in that lecture

929
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,240
because I'm talking about the comics and the comics are not as bad as people say they are.

930
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,040
So so I could have that lecture could have been a lot different

931
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,760
if I had just if I had focused more on J.D.R.

932
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,280
is a shenanigans.

933
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,800
Oh, yeah, I absolutely believe that there could have that could have been a completely different one

934
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,440
that you could only passingly mention some of the lower elements.

935
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,360
But it was way more interesting to me just to hear about these just ridiculously

936
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,400
complicated and convoluted and like connected comics

937
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,320
that spawned from this canceled game from I've heard enough stories,

938
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,760
but I've never heard anything about like the concepts in those comics.

939
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,480
That was a much more interesting part.

940
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,800
When I when I when I learned about when I learned about

941
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,520
fuck, what was that?

942
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,520
I don't even remember what the game was called, multiverse.

943
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,920
When I learned about multiverse, I was like, it snapped into place.

944
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,880
I was like, oh, my God, this this like this like multiverse idea is like present in all.

945
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,440
Like this is the this is like clearly the foundational idea

946
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,400
upon which all these other stories that she wrote is based.

947
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,920
Like, ah, there's a narrative through line here.

948
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,880
I found it. I found the thread.

949
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,240
I can pull on it until the sweater unravels.

950
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,240
Amazing.

951
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,120
It was very I thought it was a really cool little linchpin

952
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,160
to keep like tie everything together, you know what I mean?

953
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,000
Because I don't know.

954
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,400
It was I thought I thought it wrapped it up in a very interesting story

955
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,360
just the way like, you know, you have all the she had so many like ideas.

956
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
And I always like that.

957
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,680
Like I just people that get so bizarrely insanely into the nitty gritty details

958
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,320
of the world building to the point where they're talking about the fucking physics.

959
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,720
I don't know why I like that shit.

960
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,120
It's just like such a obsessive, yeah, like compulsion

961
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,840
to justify everything that happens that like most most works of fiction

962
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,080
don't bother to do because like that kind of detail for the most part,

963
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,520
it's beyond the scope of any story that you want to tell

964
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
because most stories are character centric.

965
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,160
So to just like go out of your way to not only

966
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,920
conceptualize those details, but make the story revolve around them

967
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,080
is so atypical that it's like fascinating because it's so fresh and interesting,

968
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,560
even if like the context of it is like kind of rudimentary

969
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,360
in terms of its execution, just the ideas are fascinating.

970
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,320
Good news, though. Good news, though.

971
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,320
Jennifer was online on FIM Fiction.

972
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,800
Only eight hours ago.

973
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,560
So she is she is not gone anywhere.

974
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,160
She's still active.

975
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,240
She is still writing.

976
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,040
Oh, she just posted.

977
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,440
She posted a new conversion bureau story.

978
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,680
I'm genuinely glad she's still out there and creating.

979
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,080
But like you sort of said, I've zero

980
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,600
interested in reading MLP fan fiction fiction.

981
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,880
I'm I'm I'm sad.

982
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,040
I'm sad that it's MLP stuff.

983
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,720
I don't want to read MLP stuff.

984
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,280
Unless, well, unless and, you know, for the only in this one moment,

985
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,040
have I suddenly considered maybe I should maybe I should read one

986
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,000
and see what it's like, because what if it's like tales gets trolled and like,

987
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,800
yeah, there's ponies in it.

988
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,800
But like the stuff that actually goes on in it is like

989
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,560
very non pony centric.

990
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,440
And it's really it's a thing that just happens to be set in even back in the pony days.

991
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,840
I remember I've heard the name Conversion Bureau like.

992
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,320
Talked about like that was something that people knew of.

993
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,440
I never I never heard about it back in the day,

994
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,520
but she didn't make the Conversion Bureau.

995
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,480
She just she just writes within it.

996
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,120
I mean, for all I know, she could be writing in the Conversion Bureau universe

997
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,120
and her stories might not even have that much to do.

998
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,600
Oh, God, there's so many layers.

999
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,360
You might be right.

1000
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,600
And it might be like good MLP fan fiction type story.

1001
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,360
But like the mere fact that she's writing within another universe

1002
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,880
makes it less interesting to me because I like that she created

1003
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,400
not only her own physics, but she would like conceptualize the entire universe

1004
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,880
starts to finish. I don't know why that's just so funny to me.

1005
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,040
It's like the kind of creator that the limitations of fan fiction

1006
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,360
would be just another obstacle to overcome and she would find a way to do it, you know?

1007
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,520
I absolutely believe it could be like actually really entertaining,

1008
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:15,160
but it is just the fact that it's MLP fan fiction is a little bit of high bar

1009
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,720
for me, at least to get over.

1010
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,680
I agree completely, but it's just like, well, never know.

1011
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,160
You know, I mean, it's like we were just saying, like we were just saying,

1012
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,080
Tails gets trolled, Tails gets trolled, sets you up with low expectations.

1013
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,680
And maybe maybe that's the same for me with these pony stories.

1014
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,520
Maybe that's just the hurdle I need to give in chapter one.

1015
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,120
A shot would not be a huge ask in terms of time.

1016
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,320
So oh, oh, she's making posts.

1017
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,720
She's making posts about Trump.

1018
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,720
She doesn't like him.

1019
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,400
Oh, she's talking about the election.

1020
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,280
Know what my Kokoro wishes that Joseph Biden wins the election?

1021
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,720
Yes, yes. Should I?

1022
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,520
OK, I kind of want to read some of this.

1023
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,480
Do you want to do you want to hear? Oh, how long do you want to hear?

1024
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,120
It's it's not that. All right, all right.

1025
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,520
OK, I mean, let's get a vibe check on how this feels.

1026
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, vibe, vibe, check, vibe, check.

1027
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,960
OK, a prediction checklist by Chateau Yance, she wrote this yesterday.

1028
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,760
The Trump publicans install a loyal Supreme Court replacement

1029
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,440
Barrett for Ginsburg.

1030
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,400
The Democrats will do almost nothing at all.

1031
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,120
Their reaction will be weak and you know what?

1032
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,200
This is boring. Never mind.

1033
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,280
She's just whatever. Yeah.

1034
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,600
She just leave a comment that's like, go back to talking about world plates.

1035
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,200
Go back to talking about ponies.

1036
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,840
Oh, man, she's posting like she's posting like every day,

1037
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,440
not stories, just like posts on her time.

1038
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,520
Oh, no, got into the politics fandom, the worst fandom of all.

1039
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,320
God, I really hope she is it's literally more healthy of an outlet

1040
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,160
to be writing My Little Pony fan fan fiction than it is to be ranting

1041
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,880
about Donald Trump every day on what on a My Little Pony fan fiction site.

1042
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,400
Like, yeah, at least do it on Twitter where people will actually give a shit.

1043
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,400
Oh, yeah, no, she's she's saying she's predicting that she's predicting

1044
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,080
that Trump stays in office and basically declares himself dictator for life.

1045
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,040
And we enter a dystopia.

1046
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,240
That's that's what she thinks is going to happen.

1047
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,280
She's not alone on that thought process.

1048
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,000
Write some fan fiction about it.

1049
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,920
Let's. Yeah. Yeah.

1050
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,520
Write some fucking fan fiction about it.

1051
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,640
Go back to dance for me, monkey.

1052
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,600
You know, it is kind of funny that you're saying that, like,

1053
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,960
I'm sure there are so many people who, like, I'll never, ever, ever,

1054
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,960
ever get to consider reading tales get strolled because they are just such

1055
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,080
a strong aversion to like Sonic in Sonic autism.

1056
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,960
You know what I mean? Right.

1057
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,560
And that's what I know. Let's let's not be close.

1058
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,360
Yeah, you know, it's funny.

1059
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,320
I'm going to I'm going to admit something which is a little rude to you guys,

1060
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,040
I guess, but back when my little pony first hit the scene, I was like, yes,

1061
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,720
finally, finally, there's a bigger lightning rod for autism than Sonic.

1062
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,160
And I was just so grateful that it was like a diverting away the autism

1063
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,520
from my franchise. That's fair.

1064
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,240
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

1065
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,640
Um, OK, but the show had like really great animation

1066
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,240
and like the songs are really catchy.

1067
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,680
And, you know, it was it was a hell of a joke.

1068
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,280
One of the more embarrassing things

1069
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,600
that I'll probably ever admit is that I never watched an episode of my little

1070
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,640
pony because I was afraid that I would like it.

1071
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,600
That I was I thought I would like it because I could get into that.

1072
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,480
I like Sonic. Who knows what I like.

1073
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,920
It's true. I totally do not understand Sonic.

1074
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,360
I the only Sonic I've ever played was like I had a friend in like elementary

1075
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,160
school who had a genesis and I would fuck around and play a little Sonic here and

1076
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,680
there. I never like, you know, a game or anything.

1077
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,080
And I never played any games after the genesis.

1078
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,880
There is something really compelling about Sonic Adventure

1079
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,240
that I can't quantify, but it's there.

1080
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,960
And I really like it, even though they're not.

1081
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,560
I know exactly what you didn't own a Dreamcast.

1082
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,200
I just I can't see it. I can't see what you see.

1083
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,480
I just watched I literally before this episode started,

1084
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,240
I watched Cybershell's video on the differences,

1085
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,480
like why Sonic Adventure DX is a bad port.

1086
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,400
And like you open it, talking about how like it's you first played on Dreamcast

1087
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,640
and it was like magical.

1088
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,840
I had the exact same experience because I played it on Dreamcast the first time

1089
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,760
and like it blew my mind to shit about how just how like playing through

1090
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,440
that first level, it just felt like this is like bigger and better

1091
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,880
and cooler than anything my other consoles could back in the day.

1092
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,760
Every time there was a new console generation,

1093
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,000
it was like the next coming of fucking Jesus Christ itself.

1094
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,120
And it was the dream that it was the first new console, but I mean,

1095
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,160
I can absolutely agree that it's technically I can like I I can hear

1096
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,440
like I'll sit down and listen like a two hour long video detailing every reason

1097
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,360
Sonic Adventure one and two are objectively bad games.

1098
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,360
Don't like sit there nodding along, agreeing with every single thing they say

1099
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,880
and then go, yep, and then I'll go back to playing them and loving them

1100
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,760
and continuing to enjoy them. And it's isn't a sound job.

1101
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,880
I don't know, maybe, maybe I replayed City Escape

1102
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,480
like trying to get like a hundred points higher score

1103
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,800
and just like trying to like min max my run in Metal Harbour

1104
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,240
and all that kind of shit like I don't know.

1105
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,000
There was just something so fucking compelling about that those games.

1106
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,640
So OK, so even to this day, to go on a little

1107
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,800
just quick tangent about it back in the day.

1108
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,120
I mean, I could only I first of all, I get why people don't like

1109
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,960
Sonic games because if you just pick up, play it, beat it one time

1110
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,040
and then put it down, it probably won't feel that great because like

1111
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,080
you can just run straightforward in a Sonic game and ram your fucking face

1112
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,680
into every single enemy and lose all your rings and pick them up.

1113
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,280
And you can beat the level like that.

1114
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,240
You know what I mean? The skill like it's not hard to beat a Sonic game.

1115
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,320
It's hard to beat a Sonic game and like play it well.

1116
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,800
And that's where like the joy comes from.

1117
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,360
They actually like put the onus on you to put like get skill mastery

1118
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,800
and actually like learn these games.

1119
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,920
That's why they spend so much time on these first levels,

1120
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,080
making them so intricately crafted because you're going through them.

1121
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,440
Who's video about that?

1122
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,960
Davoo made a video about Sonic.

1123
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,240
Yeah, I did. I did see that video a long time ago.

1124
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:50,840
It was a good video.

1125
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,800
Yeah, pretty much explained it right.

1126
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,160
Because like Sonic is about speed, you know?

1127
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,920
And because back in the day, back in the day, it sound like a boomer,

1128
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,640
you know, say good design games with an arcade mindset

1129
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,080
that you would be playing it over and over and over again to get good at it.

1130
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,560
You know, because like you bought Sonic, it's a brand new game.

1131
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,920
It's two hours long.

1132
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,120
Obviously, you're going to play it more than one time.

1133
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,720
You know what I mean?

1134
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,560
But I feel like I didn't get not to get too boomery,

1135
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,960
but like Zoomers will pick up a game, play it one time and be like,

1136
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,240
yeah, that sucked.

1137
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,520
And then, you know, you don't you don't have I don't expect everyone

1138
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,760
who wants to get a song to have to sit down and play through the same game

1139
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,760
like 20 because I didn't have a lot of games.

1140
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,800
And I did what I'd like to play Sonic over and over.

1141
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,040
So I just naturally, without having to think about it,

1142
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,800
mastered these skills by playing them over and over and over again.

1143
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,240
So it's like, I forget who said this, but it's like a Sonic level is like a skate park.

1144
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,720
You know what I mean?

1145
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,800
Like you can have fun there.

1146
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,680
You just have to put in the effort to get a little bit good.

1147
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,280
You know what I mean? Like we first are skateboarding.

1148
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,240
You're not going to have fun. You know what I mean?

1149
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,280
I feel like the Sonic series in general has always had this weird kind of pendulum

1150
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,080
of an identity crisis because I feel like the original Genesis trilogy,

1151
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,120
like there was a lot of mastery you could do to mid-max your runs.

1152
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,280
But I feel like the focus, like they were still operating under

1153
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,120
the input, like the idea of it being like a Mario style game of like a platformer.

1154
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,560
Like you play through Green Hill Zone and Sonic one, and it's a fucking blast.

1155
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,240
And you can just like go really fast.

1156
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,880
And there's like different paths you can find.

1157
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,160
There's like kind of like, you know, the top, mid and bottom of those levels.

1158
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,160
So you can kind of like figure out new paths when you first start playing it.

1159
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,480
Like, oh, you can go down this way or like, oh, this part of the wall is like

1160
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,120
breakable so I can go through here.

1161
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,640
But then you get to like Marble Zone and it's like slow.

1162
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,800
And it's about like precision platforming.

1163
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,360
And like with with like, you know, replaying it over and over again,

1164
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,560
you can like find ways to like cut down on the time.

1165
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,480
But like as someone playing for the first time,

1166
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,800
it just comes to a grinding halt on that second level.

1167
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,200
Big time, big time.

1168
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,400
A lot of a lot of the modern Sonic is like, oh, no, but Sonic is like speed.

1169
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,520
Like that's the meme.

1170
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,400
So it's just like hold X to win where you just kind of like get

1171
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,960
build up your speed meter and you just keep like hitting the boost constantly.

1172
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,240
And there's very little platforming involved now.

1173
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,600
It is really strange how the boost games have basically like they've

1174
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,560
always taken speed out of the equation because like getting and maintaining

1175
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,280
top speed used to be such an ordeal.

1176
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,840
And now it's just press a button.

1177
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,560
And again, that boost gameplay has its things that are good about it.

1178
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,960
I'm not fully shitting on it or anything.

1179
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,800
But like it's just so fundamentally completely different from everything

1180
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,720
before it. You know what I mean?

1181
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,000
You have you have like the old games that were very much a platformer

1182
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,760
with speed is kind of like an afterthought in a marketing gimmick.

1183
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,640
Then you have the boost games where it's like speed and the platforming

1184
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,840
is like an afterthought.

1185
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,800
But like I remember playing Sonic Advance 2 and I feel like that was like

1186
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,560
the closest to Sonic ever like finding its fucking zen in terms of I guess

1187
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,400
Sonic Adventure 2 speed levels or Sonic and Shadow Levels did this a lot too.

1188
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:34,720
But like speed you could mix like slowing down is like a fail state,

1189
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,000
you know, because like you could replay the first level of Sonic Advance 2

1190
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,720
over and over and over again, because I did this in math class

1191
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,760
instead of paying attention.

1192
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,720
Me and my friend would pass our GB ASP back and forth trying to do

1193
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,800
the time trial on that.

1194
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,600
You could get your run down to like 15 seconds on the first level

1195
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,200
if you like did it well enough because they had all these extra little

1196
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,400
mechanics of like having like an air boost and like these side boosts

1197
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,640
to like keep your momentum going where normal Sonic mechanics would have you stop.

1198
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,400
And it's just like that seems like the way to do it.

1199
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,560
Like that seems like what this game should be about.

1200
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,920
It should be about keep building and then maintaining momentum

1201
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,840
for as long as possible and giving you a tool set to do that.

1202
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,760
And like Adventures 2 levels have a lot of that too.

1203
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,440
Like once you get the light dash, there are gaps where you can keep

1204
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,480
momentum going instead of stopping like in Metal Harbor, especially.

1205
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,640
You can skip a lot of like the ramps and stuff.

1206
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:31,120
And like that just seems like where the soul of the series really should be

1207
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:37,720
focused on is just like a kind of like a skill based maintaining of momentum.

1208
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,960
And there's just like little pockets of it throughout the games,

1209
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,680
where it's just like it's so fun and it's so replayable,

1210
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,640
trying to like get a little bit higher score by like minimum

1211
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,600
like min maxing your ability to go through these stages.

1212
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,680
And so much of the franchise doesn't do that.

1213
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,720
And it's frustrating because like these like these one like levels

1214
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,640
like Green Forest and Metal Harbor and City Escape and like the bulk

1215
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,480
of Advanced 2s mechanics like get it.

1216
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,320
And like somebody at SEGA understands what the series should be doing.

1217
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,960
And it's just frustrating as someone who grew up with it, being like,

1218
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,960
there it is, I want more of that.

1219
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,080
And then you get like another boost game.

1220
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,160
You're like, OK, I'll see you in three years, give it another shot.

1221
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
Yeah, that's pretty much what I felt about the Genesis games.

1222
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,800
And like that's why I like Mania so much, because I absolutely fully

1223
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,240
100 percent agree with everything you said about Sonic 1

1224
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,520
in that they had they spent ages getting Green Hill Zone just right.

1225
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,960
And then they really didn't have they're like, well, it has to be a platforming game.

1226
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,040
So they have all these slower zones like marble and labyrinth that nobody

1227
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,440
really likes that much.

1228
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,040
But I really feel like they started to get it better.

1229
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,880
They kind of went really hard the other way in Sonic 2, where they had

1230
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,200
very streamlined levels with the top, middle and bottom routes that were

1231
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,640
much less just waiting for platforms and stupid shit like that.

1232
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,880
And in some ways, Sonic 2 was almost a little too streamlined.

1233
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,360
They kind of cut out a lot of the exploration.

1234
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,160
That's why I thought Sonic 3 and Knuckles brought back the exploration

1235
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,960
where it was it wasn't going fast all the time, but there were some really

1236
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,480
good areas you can get some like speed that you could maintain.

1237
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,120
Yeah. And yeah, I feel like Sonic 3 and Knuckles sort of perfected

1238
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,440
how I like see the 2D games.

1239
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,400
I can see the appeal of the advanced games.

1240
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,840
I only really had advanced one as the one that I played a lot.

1241
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,560
But I was interested in advanced two and three.

1242
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,160
They seemed interesting.

1243
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,880
I would even now I'd recommend advanced two because like advanced

1244
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,240
advanced one plays a lot more like the Genesis games.

1245
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,640
Advanced two is different in that you start.

1246
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,560
Yeah, it starts you out at speed, which is really interesting.

1247
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,680
And then it has it has a boost function, but it's not boost

1248
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,120
as we've come to know the boost function where you press a button

1249
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,920
to get max speed.

1250
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,000
It was like you go fast enough and you will once you maintain your

1251
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,720
which is interesting.

1252
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,840
I sort of like that idea way more than the current boost one.

1253
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,040
But yeah, you know, there's a lot of interesting stuff

1254
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,880
you can do in the adventure games, especially to once you get the bounce

1255
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,000
bracelet, you know, there's like a lot of interesting things you can do

1256
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,200
to like exploit the physics and just the spin dash like you can really

1257
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,640
use it in creative ways to get like just do some crazy big jumps.

1258
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,880
I'm not even like a speed runner, but you can just like so that was

1259
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,760
one of the interesting things about the chow garden, which is like it's

1260
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,720
such a ridiculous, pointless thing.

1261
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,640
Like why is in the game right now?

1262
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,640
I got a button to say that I really liked your video about the chow raising.

1263
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,040
I love that shit.

1264
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,200
They look weird, esoteric systems.

1265
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,040
I had no idea so much time.

1266
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,240
I had no idea they could look all these different ways.

1267
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1268
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,440
There's so many different like ways they can look with other

1269
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,680
evolutions and stats and cosmetics.

1270
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,640
It's wild.

1271
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,800
And it's funny because like people are like they should make a standalone

1272
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,160
chow game. It's like on one hand that makes sense.

1273
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:32,760
That would be fun.

1274
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,680
But I'm just trying to think like how would you meaningfully

1275
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,960
gait your chow's progression?

1276
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,760
Like how like what's to stop you from just giving them 100,000 animals

1277
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,240
or crystals in a row because what you'd have to like hide the animals

1278
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,600
behind a minigame or something, right?

1279
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,280
But then the minigame would get super boring after the 10,000th time.

1280
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,000
So I thought it was kind of brilliant to have like they don't make you play

1281
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,280
a stupid minigame to get the chow parts to need.

1282
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,440
They make you play a real actual fun game Sonic Adventure 2 and it gives

1283
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,400
you incentive to replay those levels over and over again to master them.

1284
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,600
If they're the synergy between the two like systems is really interesting

1285
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,480
because like me and my sister played Sonic Adventure 2 like constantly

1286
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,800
when we were kids, it's funny.

1287
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,080
There are people who don't even really like the Sonic part that much,

1288
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,560
but they were super into the chow stuff.

1289
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,520
So that was my sister. Yeah, exactly.

1290
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:19,760
She bought like probably like 25 VMUs just to like bring all their

1291
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,360
chow around and like work on their stats and stuff.

1292
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,560
That's really funny because I took a lot of data in the VMU to store the data.

1293
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,920
So she would just like get like her allowance money and just buy another

1294
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,640
Dreamcast VMU just just to raise another one in addition to like the 15

1295
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,600
she was already working on.

1296
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,720
We had like a fucking graveyard full of VMUs that are just gone.

1297
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,360
Yeah, I love you.

1298
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,240
I was going to say, I was going to say they're probably all dead now.

1299
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,360
All my old VMUs are fucking batteries died.

1300
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,640
But yeah, that's I love the Dreamcast.

1301
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,800
There's so many things about the Dreamcast that are just so interesting to me

1302
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,680
and like unique and I just love the VMU.

1303
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,160
So stupid.

1304
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,280
Like why do they make a little screen with like a little it's like they made

1305
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,160
their memory part into a little Game Boy.

1306
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,200
It's so fucking strange.

1307
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:56,640
I love it.

1308
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,960
I love it, but it is so strange.

1309
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,680
Like why would you do that?

1310
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,320
My sister, like the chow, the chow die eventually.

1311
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,160
Like they'll eventually just die off.

1312
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,760
And like one of my sister's favorite chow like died.

1313
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,240
And so she like restarted the game without saving it.

1314
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,800
And like before it died, she just threw it in a VMU to keep it alive forever.

1315
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,800
And just like weird little things like that that just emerged from the gameplay.

1316
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,440
And it was just like, I don't know.

1317
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,360
It was like such an interesting system that I never really got into.

1318
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,600
But like I was able to see how complicated and intricate it got.

1319
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:31,920
What do you think are the implications of the fact that a, oh God,

1320
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,560
I might be a little off, but I think you'll understand what I'm saying.

1321
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:41,520
That a dark speed chow looks like shadow, but it's not a hero speed

1322
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,440
chow that looks like Sonic.

1323
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,040
It's a neutral speed chow.

1324
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,920
Yeah, I always thought that was really strange.

1325
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,160
I don't know what it is exactly.

1326
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,200
Maybe it's because the hero version is like this white stripy thing.

1327
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,320
And like it sort of implies that there's some other creature out there

1328
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,360
that looks like that, that is like a light counterpart to Sonic and Shadow.

1329
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,120
Who is this man?

1330
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
That is a pretty funny thing.

1331
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,760
And I have noticed that before because it is strange.

1332
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,760
They just wanted all the hero chow to have like this, like they all wanted

1333
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,800
all the heroes to basically look sort of the same, you know, white, I guess.

1334
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,760
And they didn't mind that the neutral chow

1335
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,000
and it could be all sorts of different colors.

1336
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,400
But yeah, that is a very it results in a very strange thing where Sonic

1337
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:18,200
like the genetic information that composes Sonic is based in speed

1338
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,280
and not necessarily heroism.

1339
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,880
And it's deliberate.

1340
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,120
It's specifically like morally neutral,

1341
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:28,320
whereas Shadow is like specifically evil and speedy.

1342
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,000
I guess the implication is that Sonic is actually so heroic

1343
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,920
that he has no natural inclination towards being a hero.

1344
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,600
He's completely neutral at all times,

1345
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,080
but he still saves the world anyways, because he's that cool.

1346
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,960
I guess, I guess so.

1347
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,440
I just I just want to meet.

1348
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,880
I just want to meet the other.

1349
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,680
The implication there is that there must be some creatures

1350
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,520
that look like every every form of this that this chow can like be like

1351
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,400
whatever like whatever like a hero power chow looks like.

1352
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,840
Maybe there's some guy out there who looks like that, but bigger.

1353
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,840
And if Sonic ever met him, well, if you want to get deeper into the lore

1354
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,720
of like Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure, too, there's this whole plot

1355
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,040
point where Shadow talks about how he's the ultimate life form and the ultimate

1356
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,800
life form. But if you there's this weird thing where if you wait like the final

1357
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,800
battle against the bio lizard in space, where you're super sonic and super

1358
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,240
Shadow has a five minute time limit, I think it's five minutes.

1359
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,200
Yeah, I think it's five minutes.

1360
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,200
If you wait for like four minutes and 30 seconds, like right before you're about

1361
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,560
to die, like one of the things Shadow can say to you is like, Sonic,

1362
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,080
I think I realized something.

1363
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,080
I think you're actually the ultimate life form.

1364
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,320
And there's a whole what?

1365
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,720
Yeah, that's in the game.

1366
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,160
So no, yeah, that's it.

1367
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,480
Yeah, that's so that's some deep lore that not a lot of people realize.

1368
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,240
So yeah, so it might be something related to that.

1369
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,960
Yeah. So Sonic is actually the real ultimate life form.

1370
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,760
And that explains why Shadow looks like him because Gerald was trying to

1371
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,760
create the ultimate life form and it's going to look like Sonic because Sonic

1372
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,080
is the ultimate life form. Shit.

1373
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,400
That's amazing. No, I never knew I never heard that.

1374
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,400
I knew Shadow now that you say it.

1375
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,360
I feel like I probably heard that as a kid at like 10 years old,

1376
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,040
but didn't like have the brain power to like contextualize it and anything

1377
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,800
other than like, oh, it's just it's just game talking to me.

1378
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,320
And that was it.

1379
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,680
But yeah, it's a line that you could easily just sort of be like, yeah,

1380
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,920
whatever, ultimate life form.

1381
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,400
They say that like a hundred times throughout the game.

1382
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,080
So you get kind of numb to hearing it at the end.

1383
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,960
But right. It's like the game is the game even implies that like it's the

1384
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,840
bio lizard that was the ultimate life form and not Shadow the entire time.

1385
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,600
There's this weird fucking lore where like Rouge will show the bio lizards

1386
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,960
like report on screen, but like for like one second,

1387
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,600
like no human could ever read it without having to like pause it.

1388
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,160
And back in the day, you're going to like pause, you know, that that was no

1389
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,040
one's an option. So only later, like a lot of lore came out.

1390
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,720
And it's like, yeah, it's so strange that like it doesn't seem to make any sense.

1391
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,440
Like how could you have two attempts to make the ultimate life form?

1392
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,480
And one is a giant fucking lizard and one is a little shadowy hedgehog thing.

1393
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,160
But it makes a little more sense than it seems.

1394
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,960
I'm not saying I'm not saying it makes perfect sense or anything like that,

1395
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,440
but it makes a little bit more sense than it might initially.

1396
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,960
Gerald just got into the Sonic fandom and realized that he needed to make his

1397
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,440
edgy OC, you know, like he changes.

1398
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,680
There's all this like there's these fan theories,

1399
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,720
like he's at the very end of Sonic 3 and Knuckles.

1400
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:07,160
There's this ancient mural that shows Super Sonic fighting like the Eggman robot.

1401
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,200
And the theory is that Gerald saw the mural of Super Sonic.

1402
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,880
And that's where he got the idea to have a hedgehog shaped type creature.

1403
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,480
I got a deep dive into the Sonic fandom.

1404
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,000
Look all this shit I'm learning, all these connecting threads.

1405
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,920
This is fucked up, I gotta say.

1406
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,040
This is way fucked up.

1407
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,320
Yeah, it's deep lore, man.

1408
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,280
There's deep Sonic lore.

1409
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,760
But it's funny because it's also one of the series that genuinely,

1410
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,000
like genuinely the creators do not give a fuck about like lore between games.

1411
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,360
Like there's like no continuity.

1412
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,280
Like the moon is blown up in Sonic Adventure 2.

1413
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,760
It looks fine in the next game like shit like that.

1414
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,760
Then they just don't give a fuck.

1415
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,760
Like it's bizarre.

1416
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,440
Oh yeah, they blew up the moon.

1417
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,080
I mean, they just forgot about it.

1418
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,440
Yeah, it's completely fine.

1419
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,800
Never once mentioned again.

1420
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,000
Well, they blow up half the moon.

1421
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,840
So it should have a giant.

1422
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,320
It would have been so easy just to have a big chunk missing in the next game.

1423
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,280
It would have been such a small, easy thing to like remind people that

1424
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,360
it doesn't matter.

1425
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,680
You know, again, it's not something worth getting upset about,

1426
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,640
but it is funny.

1427
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,760
They genuinely like like they'll practically go out of their way to make the world

1428
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,800
not actually make sense.

1429
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,240
What's the fan theory for preparing the moon?

1430
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,880
I'm sure someone has come up with a theory.

1431
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:08,880
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1432
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,120
I I guarantee for a fact, you could easily find multiple different fan theories

1433
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,800
as to what the fuck went on with that moon.

1434
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,320
Yeah, yeah, makes you makes you wonder.

1435
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,200
World sure is mysterious.

1436
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,880
Sonic Lore is so funny because at the end of Sonic Oh, six, I'm sure.

1437
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,280
I think most people know this, but like he has to go back in time

1438
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,480
to undo the events of the game.

1439
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,480
So the game retcons itself out of existence.

1440
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,720
So I don't even know why people are so upset about that game,

1441
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,800
because literally nothing that happened in that game even happened.

1442
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,280
Wait, which game still happened to me?

1443
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,200
Sonic Oh, six. Oh, a legendarily bad one.

1444
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,840
Yeah, the really bad one with the human kiss, which is the most, you know,

1445
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,000
it's so easy to meme on because it's funny.

1446
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,480
But they didn't happen.

1447
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,000
Oh, God, you know, it's funny.

1448
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,440
I feel like I should have some sort of more like strong feelings

1449
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,680
on Sonic Oh, six. I never even bother playing it.

1450
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,280
Yeah, he's from the future on that one.

1451
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,400
And then in that game blazes from the future.

1452
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,880
But then in Sonic Rush blazes from a different dimension.

1453
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,440
And then when they meet in the Olympics games, they can't keep it straight.

1454
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,200
It's such a fucking mess.

1455
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,240
Do they do they canonically go to the Olympics?

1456
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,040
Or is that just sort of like a side thing, like a Mario card?

1457
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,320
I'm pretty sure that's not canon, but I I choose to believe it's canon.

1458
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,120
There are some really bizarre and hilarious, like not like full on cutscenes,

1459
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,640
but like weird things were like omega the robots.

1460
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,080
Like I have must give Donkey Kong my gratitude for fixing me.

1461
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,200
It's this great show.

1462
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,800
Is laser bat writing these games?

1463
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,680
What the fuck? Imagine Sonic is Donkey Kong.

1464
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,240
It is. It is like that.

1465
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,600
Oh, God.

1466
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,640
Oh, fuck. Well, I love that.

1467
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,880
Yeah, see, the Sonic series is like if there's so much weird cringe,

1468
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,360
but like wholesome cringe, I don't even know.

1469
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:55,600
I'm like so past like touched on like the sad AM and the Archie.

1470
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,440
Yeah, see, OK, that's the thing about Sonic is like Mario is great.

1471
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,280
I wish I could have this whole K-Fade where I pretended to hate Mario all the time,

1472
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,920
but I can't do it. I like Mario games.

1473
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,640
So like Mario is great, but he has much more cohesive identity

1474
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,720
where Sonic is like fractured through this prism where there's like

1475
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,160
10,000 different versions of Sonic.

1476
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,480
You can just pick the kinds you like and get in arguments

1477
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,440
with other Sonic fans over the kinds they like.

1478
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,880
And it's a self perpetuating war of Sonic fandom.

1479
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,880
I don't know.

1480
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,560
Oh, my God.

1481
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,280
And yeah, like multiple shows, like five different shows,

1482
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,800
each with like a totally different they had they had the sad AM

1483
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,920
and the Adventures of Sonic the dog show running at the exact same time.

1484
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,400
And they're completely different takes on the character.

1485
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,440
I remember because like I was I would rent like the Adventures of Sonic

1486
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,960
the hedgehog on on like from Blockbuster.

1487
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,240
And then one time I got a sad AM tape and it was totally different.

1488
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,880
Like what the fuck is this?

1489
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,840
And I was very confused.

1490
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,360
Literally, like, again, it's not like the sad AM was so it's not that edgy,

1491
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,680
but like compared to the straight up Looney Tunes nonsense

1492
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,040
of Adventures on the hedgehog is it's quite jarring the difference, honestly.

1493
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,520
It's it's like it's like sitting down to watch Looney Tunes

1494
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:10,560
and then like like Bugs Bunny is like in an episode of like a serious

1495
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,640
corner. Yeah, Bugs Bunny joins the resistance to save.

1496
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,320
It's like it's like one Looney Tunes show that that is always.

1497
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,240
Oh, yeah, lunatics or whatever the fuck.

1498
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:23,040
The one where they're all in like black jumpsuits and they look like.

1499
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,000
Yeah, but like that's what sad AM is for Sonic.

1500
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,080
Like instead of it being like a Looney Tunes show, it's like he's a freedom

1501
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:32,560
fighter fighting against like an oppressive technological regime.

1502
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,520
It is kind of strange that like how many like shows like that?

1503
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,920
Like like Robotnik already took over the world.

1504
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,680
Like he already won and they're already living in like hiding.

1505
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,120
You know what I mean? They're the freedom fighters.

1506
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,360
It's kind of a strange setting, honestly, dystopic,

1507
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,520
but you don't see a lot of dystopian children's fiction, I got to say.

1508
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,120
It was such a strange concept because like even though it's like

1509
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,840
I would argue it's a better like storytelling and probably a better show

1510
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,520
overall than like the other adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon.

1511
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,600
That felt much more in spirit of the original games.

1512
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,880
Like there's nothing like super serious in Sonic one.

1513
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,720
It's very much like a cartoony.

1514
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,320
It's funny because you're absolutely right.

1515
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:12,400
There are there are and I have always been undercurrents of environmentalism

1516
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,240
and natural Green Hill being better than the mechanical robotic

1517
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:19,400
like scrap brain type things, but there was never like overt

1518
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,440
like message or anything.

1519
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,280
So yeah, I have to agree.

1520
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,920
It's funny because as a kid, I really liked the sat and one

1521
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,160
because I thought it was so cool and serious and mature.

1522
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,520
And I didn't I mean, I didn't hate it, but I wasn't that into the adventures

1523
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,680
of Sonic the Hedgehog because it was I thought it was so like it's for kids or whatever.

1524
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,800
And now that I'm older, I really, really like adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog.

1525
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,480
That's a really funny show.

1526
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,080
Sat a.m. feels like a fan fiction.

1527
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,080
It really does.

1528
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,520
Although it doesn't even come close to feeling like a fan fiction

1529
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,080
compared to Sonic Underground, which is literally like fan fiction

1530
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,320
that got licensed and put on television somehow.

1531
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,280
I don't even know what the fuck.

1532
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:51,840
But you're right.

1533
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,440
Sat a.m. definitely has strong fan fiction vibes to it.

1534
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,600
God, Sonic is weird as shit.

1535
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:03,560
So yeah, it really it really is such a strange franchise in multiples.

1536
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,680
It's like a huge like thing, like all this stuff going on.

1537
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,480
And then plus there's the Sonic movie that came out this year,

1538
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,520
which I had completely assumed was going to be the most worthless piece

1539
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,720
of shit of all time and somehow it wasn't.

1540
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,840
And then thank God that Corona virus hit because now we can go down

1541
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,760
as the second highest grossing movie of the year or whatever.

1542
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,760
Thank God. Yeah, yeah.

1543
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,400
Yeah, it was all worth it.

1544
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,440
Just so the Sonic movie could be a success.

1545
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,920
What do you what do you think of the Sonic movie?

1546
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,000
You know, it's like I'm of two minds about it because on one hand,

1547
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,360
if you want to say that it's not that good because I mean, like it's like

1548
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,640
compared to like an actual 10 out of 10, it's it's a kid's movie.

1549
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,600
It's like, you know, alien comes to earth, learns the power of friendship.

1550
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,640
I can see all the complaints and I agree with that.

1551
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,040
But, you know, they unfucked up the design.

1552
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,400
They have a lot of cute little Easter eggs and references that I got.

1553
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:59,400
So it was pretty much the fact that it wasn't a disaster means it was a huge success.

1554
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,200
OK, yeah, pretty much fair enough.

1555
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:07,000
That's the best you can really say about it is that it should have been

1556
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,520
a fucking nightmare and it was just like another movie.

1557
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,440
Yeah, I was I was seriously just like, OK, well, there are all these things

1558
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,080
in the like their Sonic oh sick or the shout of the Hedgehog the game

1559
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,120
that everyone laughs at their Sonic oh sick, everyone laughs at their

1560
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,680
Sonic Boom shitty game that everyone laughs at in the Sonic movie is just

1561
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:24,320
going to be other tentpole thing in the history of Sonic that everyone can laugh at

1562
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,240
and all just have to, you know, cope and deal with it.

1563
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,400
No big deal. But, you know, kids liked it.

1564
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,280
And then, you know, the idea that there are kids out there

1565
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,680
who just didn't even know about Sonic and then they watch that movie

1566
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,840
and now they're like Sonic fans.

1567
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:38,480
Really strange timing from Sega because there are absolutely no games

1568
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,920
or anything released like concurrently to like promote, you know what I mean?

1569
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,080
Like they really which is very it was such a bad decision from there.

1570
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:48,080
And the fact that they had to pull, they had to redesign Sonic,

1571
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,320
which I mean, people think it's like all publicity stunt,

1572
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,560
but they had all these toys and merchandise designed

1573
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,120
that they had to pull from store shelves.

1574
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,920
And when the movie went out, there were no toys in the stores

1575
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,520
and people were like posting on Twitter like I want to see the movie

1576
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,160
and I wanted to buy a toy for my kid and there's no fucking toys to buy.

1577
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,400
Yeah, so great, great job, Sega.

1578
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,360
It's wild. God, it's weird.

1579
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,960
It's weird that they would fuck up that bad.

1580
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,480
It's very strange story.

1581
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:15,080
It's funny. It feels it feels like they thought the movie was going to be a disaster.

1582
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,120
Whenever people ask them about the movie during development, they're like,

1583
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,040
don't ask us. We don't anything. Just that's about Paramount.

1584
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:19,840
We don't know anything about that.

1585
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,600
Like it seems like they were already prewriting an office, a huge failure.

1586
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,160
And like they weren't ready for it to be a success, you know what I mean?

1587
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:30,200
Yeah. But like this is such this the the entire story of the movie.

1588
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:35,800
Just it feels like this is exactly what the Sonic franchise would would do.

1589
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,000
You know, it is a bizarre little encapsulation of like this coming out.

1590
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,960
Like it would be like the fans having a meltdown.

1591
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,160
It's is Sonic encapsulated in one thing.

1592
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,920
And then the final product ended up not being quite as bad as you think it would be.

1593
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,040
It really just sums the whole thing up.

1594
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,640
Yeah. And you know, I got to say, there's an Illumination Mario movie coming out.

1595
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,520
I think either twenty twenty one or twenty twenty two.

1596
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,480
And I strongly believe it's going to be worse than the Sonic movie.

1597
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,280
In fact, I honestly do believe unless you are incredibly

1598
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,920
based and like the original Mario Bros.

1599
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,640
movie that I think the Sonic movie might be the best video game movie.

1600
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:14,120
And I staunchly take the belief that it is much better than Detective Pikachu was.

1601
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,440
I liked the Mario movie as a kid.

1602
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,160
I mean, I don't I liked it, too.

1603
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,920
I don't think I was a kid, too, because it was Mario and I was so stupid.

1604
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,160
I was just like, it's Mario.

1605
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,040
So I like it. It was so strange.

1606
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,520
Like I was captivated.

1607
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:31,440
It was Mario and like I guess I thought it was weird that everything looked that way.

1608
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,600
But I was like, yeah, I mean, it's live action.

1609
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,600
So of course, it's not going to look like the video game.

1610
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,520
I guess this is just how it looks. Whatever. Oh, Yoshi is a velociraptor.

1611
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:43,680
Sure. Yeah, it's funny, because like, yeah, it's funny, because they ease you into it.

1612
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,680
Like, OK, you know, Bob Hoskins, Mario, like, OK, I can see that.

1613
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,680
You know, and then and then they ease you into the Mushroom Kingdom

1614
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,680
and then it's like covered in fungus and it's like, yeah, OK, I guess.

1615
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:57,480
And then it's what fucking the goombas are these little headed monsters.

1616
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,080
The certain point you just have to be like, what the fuck are you doing?

1617
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,360
Where's anything from the game?

1618
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,280
I haven't seen that since I was a little kid.

1619
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,320
I'd love to watch it again.

1620
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,640
So I guess like there's people that genuinely defend it.

1621
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,160
It sort of has like a following now.

1622
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,520
And I would love to watch it again as an adult and be like, I they're like,

1623
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:16,640
this is kind of actually I sort of see why I liked it or like, wow,

1624
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,760
as a kid's really just will watch anything.

1625
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,800
This is like trash.

1626
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,040
I mean, there are some legitimately creative, interesting elements, interesting ideas.

1627
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,040
I just I'm not.

1628
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,240
I just don't know how much all of it ever belonged in a Mario Bros.

1629
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,760
movie. That's my only issue.

1630
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,000
It's just like it's like what?

1631
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,200
It's like the late 80s, early 90s, whenever that fucking movie came out.

1632
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,200
And it's just like, OK, it's that time.

1633
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,720
You can't do like computer animation or anything.

1634
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,760
Yeah, it is a movie of its time.

1635
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,600
Everyone was going to do with a Mario movie in the late 80s.

1636
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,760
Honestly, that is a good point.

1637
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,480
Because like, what are you going to do?

1638
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,240
Mario is so animated.

1639
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,080
They have there was a Japanese animated.

1640
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,280
They should have they should have just an animated movie.

1641
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,240
But that wouldn't have made the box office bucks, I guess.

1642
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,080
I don't know. So it's not American.

1643
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,200
They're not such a strange.

1644
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,520
Well, just funny because like nowadays,

1645
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,160
nothing Nintendo was such a tight stranglehold over how

1646
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,320
Mario can be portrayed in other media.

1647
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:14,880
You know what I mean?

1648
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,960
Like the idea that something that strange could ever happen.

1649
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,440
I feel like the reason they have such a stranglehold on now

1650
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,440
is because of that movie.

1651
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,080
Oh, yeah, that's probably definitely a contributing factor.

1652
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,520
Like never again. No, we fucked up.

1653
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,680
We can't allow it. It is funny.

1654
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,720
Like, yeah, even Sega, like when they're like, yeah,

1655
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,080
go ahead, make a sonic movie.

1656
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,880
Like, do they do they understand how much a big block

1657
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,840
like Hollywood movie can affect the public consciousness of a franchise?

1658
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,240
Like the that could have seriously affected the Mario franchise.

1659
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,520
You know what I mean? Right. Yeah.

1660
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,720
I mean, Sega was like crazy, because like not only did they

1661
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,720
give Hollywood Sonic and like let his fate rest in their hands,

1662
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,120
they didn't have any like again, there was no product out there

1663
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,800
to kind of like do damage control if it turned out to be a total nightmare.

1664
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,360
Just like, oh, everyone like this,

1665
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,680
they would have painted the perception of Sonic for an entire generation, essentially.

1666
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,800
Yeah, it really there really could have been an entire generation of kids who,

1667
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:14,000
I mean, beyond like their entire exposure to Sonic is that's the frame of reference.

1668
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,320
Cringe movie cringe meme movie and hearing Aaron make fun of it on Game Grumps.

1669
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,640
And that's their only exposure to Sonic.

1670
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,600
And that makes me a little sad, because like, you know, if you don't like Sonic,

1671
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,360
if you play the Sonic games like and try to like them and don't like them,

1672
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,920
that's fine. I mean, it would be kind of psychotic if I demanded every single

1673
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,800
person on Earth love Sonic the Hedgehog.

1674
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,320
But, you know, I just want I just want people to try it, you know,

1675
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:42,280
don't come up to conclusions before you've because I know he has become a meme.

1676
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,720
And it's weird because even the Sonic Twitter account, like they've embraced

1677
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,720
the memeyness of it all, you know, like it's like we're in a post-modern

1678
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:52,720
Sonic era where he's becoming fused into the memeyness of like

1679
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,360
Sonic was in the Sonic movie.

1680
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,760
Think about that. Yeah, that was really, yeah.

1681
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,080
Yeah, there's a scene where someone was like showing a sketch of Sonic and it's

1682
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,040
literally the Sonic meme. That's that's great.

1683
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,920
I love it. Yeah, it was pretty funny.

1684
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:11,040
And like, again, it's I'm not like saying it's a bad thing, but like we're like

1685
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,640
it's entering an interesting age for Sonic.

1686
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,920
And, you know, with the success of the Sonic movie, which again,

1687
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,320
I don't think it's the greatest movie of all time, but I think kids probably liked it.

1688
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,360
And, you know, it's funny, when they first announced Jim Carrey as Robonic,

1689
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,240
I was like, what the fuck?

1690
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:26,960
I couldn't think of like a worse like like I like Jim Carrey, but he's not Robonic.

1691
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,120
You know what? He did a good job.

1692
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,120
He actually did a good job like he did a good interesting take on the character.

1693
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,040
And, you know, by the end,

1694
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,080
he even had the look right because a little teaser for fans.

1695
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,280
So, you know, I really didn't have a problem with him at all.

1696
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,560
It's kind of unfortunate because like that stinger at the end with Robonic

1697
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,400
and like Sonic the Sonic world or whatever, like it looked like a fucking

1698
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,800
like almost like something out of Spy Kids, like in terms of like just bizarre

1699
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,640
like hyper realistic. I could definitely see the Spy Kids.

1700
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,040
But like it worked and I want a whole movie there.

1701
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,600
I want a whole movie. Yeah, you see, I I actually would love to see him

1702
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,600
in that like Robotnik Final Four.

1703
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,240
I'm afraid that they're going to walk it back as soon as the second

1704
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,440
movie starts. Better not.

1705
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,920
I want I want Jim Carrey in that costume for two hours in the fucking Spy Kids

1706
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,440
CGI. I would love him to do that.

1707
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,800
I again, again, I really actually liked the take on Robotnik.

1708
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,120
And it was so funny because like almost zero Sonic media even touches

1709
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,280
on his origin story.

1710
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,560
So it was actually kind of interesting to see the movie's take on it,

1711
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,440
even though it's a little weird, weird owl mother figure.

1712
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,000
But, you know, once you get over it, it's over very fast.

1713
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,480
And then he's in the human world, which again, there's a whole super

1714
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,680
played out Alvin the chipmunks coming to the human world thing, which I

1715
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:38,880
totally get way too much money to have to make a CGI fucking alternate reality

1716
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,840
for like if you ask me, I would have loved to see the whole movie

1717
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,640
take place in the whole Green Hills zone type area.

1718
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,560
But I get it. I get why they had to do it.

1719
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,760
They need Joe Normie to connect to the cop guy and whatever.

1720
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,440
And, you know, you know what?

1721
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,640
Honestly, he was not that bad.

1722
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,120
It's like he could it could have been a Chris Thorndike situation where

1723
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,280
the human character was insufferable, but they honestly, they were OK.

1724
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,360
The characters were OK.

1725
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,360
I mean, they were all like very stereotypical, very generic.

1726
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,840
They weren't like my favorite characters, but they didn't like it.

1727
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:09,160
So when it's not a dismal failure, you've met my expectations when it comes to this franchise.

1728
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,840
I had I had one sort of Chris Chan type

1729
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,920
complaint, which is that two thirds of the movie, he's wearing these generic

1730
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:16,880
looking white shoes.

1731
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,440
I just wanted him to get in his red shoes.

1732
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,080
God damn it.

1733
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,240
And I understand why they had to move that scene to the later part of the movie.

1734
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,680
And I like the part where the girl gave him the shoes is a cute little scene.

1735
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,120
But I want to eat Sonic's red shoes.

1736
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,200
God damn it.

1737
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,440
He also has tan arms as we all have learned.

1738
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,080
You know, it's funny.

1739
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,600
I wish I could get heated about that.

1740
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:38,160
But the blue arm design works for the movie because, you know, the tan arms

1741
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,400
works in like the smooth like renders or whatever.

1742
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:45,080
I like the way that looks in game Sonic, but movie Sonic looks fine for what he is.

1743
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,040
Movie Sonic had tan fur.

1744
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,160
That was strange.

1745
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,800
It was supposed to be skin.

1746
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,000
Yeah, it's yeah.

1747
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,240
That's the thing because he has to be spiky because he's a hedgehog

1748
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,640
and people aren't going to want to see him with his little tank top sleeve arms

1749
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,640
and belly, I guess.

1750
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,280
But I mean, yes, it was a little strange that he had tan.

1751
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,400
That didn't make any sense.

1752
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,160
But I wouldn't I wouldn't have wanted him to have a solid blue stomach either.

1753
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,520
So I don't know that early design.

1754
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,600
The first design for Sonic, the worst of the teeth were his little white hands.

1755
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,560
I don't know what the fuck when they were thinking with that.

1756
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,480
That wasn't his little hamster, his little raccoon hands with his human fingers.

1757
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,920
Yeah, yeah, the hands did more for me than the disgusting face and teeth,

1758
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,840
which also were not good.

1759
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,480
But the hands, I don't know why that was the thing.

1760
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,000
I mean, the original shoes were also worse, too.

1761
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,240
Yeah, the whole thing.

1762
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,800
There was a very the Sonic movie came very close to showing his feet.

1763
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,640
And I was like praying that they weren't going to.

1764
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,120
And then they didn't I was happy.

1765
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,880
Dude, that was my biggest fear.

1766
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,120
I was like, if they do a fucking joke about they had a scene with him in Sox,

1767
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,160
I was like, God, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,

1768
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,320
don't you walk out of the theater.

1769
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,840
I'll have to just walk out of the theater and back.

1770
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,040
I can't do it. Can't do it.

1771
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,320
Oh, my God, they knew they knew they knew not to do it.

1772
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,360
I'm just so glad they I mean, on the one hand,

1773
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,360
I I I mourn the loss to culture.

1774
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,920
The fact that we didn't get the original model in the movie

1775
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,920
just because it would have been like, yes.

1776
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,480
OK, I am is a little bit of a meme to say, but God,

1777
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,520
I would love to see the original the original cut.

1778
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,480
Like, I would just love to break into the studio and see like,

1779
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,560
I know it's not fully rendered.

1780
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,400
They don't have fully rendered, disgusting Sonic,

1781
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,320
but I would love to see all the fully rendered scenes mixed in with the work

1782
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,720
for this thing. Sonic.

1783
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,000
There's like, there's like a real.

1784
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:17,800
There's like a real.

1785
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,560
The gross cut.

1786
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,320
Classic Sonic is modern Sonic.

1787
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,480
There's disgusting Sonic.

1788
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,720
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I feel like you say that everyone would know exactly what you meant.

1789
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,560
Yeah. What if what if in the second movie,

1790
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,880
they have like a weird clone of Sonic and it's just that model,

1791
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:35,280
but like, I would not even remotely be surprised if they had some sort of reference

1792
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,760
or we got to reclaim our costs on this design seems like something they would do.

1793
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,560
It definitely seems like like a not out of the realm of possibility.

1794
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,240
I just remember. I don't know.

1795
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:47,440
I just remember the funniest thing is like I was with the first poster,

1796
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,160
like the teaser poster that came out, where it was just like him sitting on

1797
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,920
like the bridge with his like, God, his muscular leg shoes and his shoes.

1798
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,600
Yeah, there is that.

1799
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,760
And there was one that was like him, but like in a silhouette.

1800
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,200
And you could but you could still see like this thigh muscles.

1801
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,720
I was like, I said that poster.

1802
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:04,720
I said that poster to my sister, who was a huge Sonic fan with me back in the day.

1803
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,880
And we both like still meme on Sonic all the time.

1804
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,480
And I just sent her to that and her response and text was that

1805
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,080
I thought Knuckles was the one who flexed his muscles.

1806
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,040
And I thought it was the perfect response for a Sonic fan.

1807
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,160
That's absolutely right.

1808
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,280
And it's just so funny, like that they could have made that design

1809
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,280
and like let it get like obviously didn't happen,

1810
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,680
but they let it get out into the trailer form.

1811
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,720
You know, like they didn't anticipate the backlash.

1812
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,480
Like that is so strange.

1813
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,600
They actually thought they did a good job.

1814
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:35,080
I can't I can't give an objective perspective as a Sonic fan.

1815
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,760
Obviously, it looks terrible as a Sonic fan,

1816
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:40,640
but I couldn't fathom anyone ever looking at that and thinking it looked OK.

1817
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,200
You know what I mean? Some fucking studio exact.

1818
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,200
He looks like he's wearing pajamas.

1819
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,800
It's it's fucked up.

1820
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,200
It was a little it was strange.

1821
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,200
They were trying so hard to make him look realistic,

1822
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,440
but like the more realistic they tried to make him look,

1823
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,200
the less he looked like he actually existed in the world.

1824
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:56,640
You know what I mean?

1825
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:59,320
Like the more cartoony version actually fits in better.

1826
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,320
I don't even know how that works.

1827
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,840
Look at that original design.

1828
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,360
You're like, man, the Five Nights at Freddy's movies getting pretty weird.

1829
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,080
Yeah, dude, if I ever if I ever get roll into some Five Nights

1830
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,840
of Freddy's money or some fucking Minecraft notch money,

1831
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,160
I'm going to finance a billion dollar

1832
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:16,360
Tails gets trolled movie with those disgusting Sonic design pictures.

1833
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,840
Holding you to that.

1834
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,000
Once you hit a million subs, I'm going to I'm going to.

1835
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,400
Yeah, once I once I become the first billion.

1836
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,840
I'm going to be like, all right, it's time.

1837
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,960
I've got all the here's all the licenses

1838
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,760
you're going to have to buy for this movie.

1839
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,000
That's 90 percent of your budget.

1840
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,600
But go.

1841
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,600
It is funny because like I would never want

1842
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,800
there to not be a copious amount of copyrighted characters

1843
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,600
and Tails gets trolled.

1844
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,480
But it is sad that like that because of that,

1845
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:44,440
you'll never be able to get it like see those animated versions

1846
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,640
on Adult Swim or anything fun like that or any sold merchandise

1847
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,440
or any sold books.

1848
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,920
You have to print my own damn Tails gets trolled book.

1849
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,840
Unless you can like squeeze it through with like parody or something.

1850
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,680
But I don't I don't think it really works.

1851
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,920
God, maybe I don't know.

1852
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,560
Yes, because it's like it is an interest.

1853
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,360
It's like in a perfect world.

1854
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,880
Yes, you should absolutely be allowed to because it's so like

1855
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,200
transformative and different.

1856
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,480
How many times his family guy who's going to the actual copy.

1857
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,360
Exactly.

1858
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,200
And that's never going to be a problem.

1859
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:14,960
Tried to sell.

1860
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,560
Tried to sell.

1861
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,280
Tails gets trolled.

1862
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,440
Yeah, if you tried to.

1863
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,400
Yeah, because he does all the copyrighted characters.

1864
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,200
It's just like it's in such a limbo that it's not even like it's to the point

1865
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,440
where like Alvin Earthworm, the guy to Super Mario Bros.

1866
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,840
Z had like a whole like meltdown thing where he couldn't even use his

1867
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,640
Patreon because he was afraid Nintendo was going to tell him that you're not

1868
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:34,440
allowed to get money from Patreon if you're making an animated series

1869
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,000
about Nintendo characters, you know what I mean?

1870
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,800
So it's like, what the fuck?

1871
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,360
Yeah, yeah.

1872
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,760
But like, I don't know, they can't enforce that.

1873
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,120
Right.

1874
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:45,040
I mean, Nintendo has gone out of their way to be like overly aggressive

1875
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,320
when it comes to shutting down shit.

1876
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,560
It's like, what do you mean like they can't enforce it?

1877
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,040
Like maybe they wouldn't win in court.

1878
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,920
They wouldn't win in court, but they could take you to court

1879
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,360
and make you spend thousands and thousands and thousands of defending yourself.

1880
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,000
Like that's like that's how the legal system works.

1881
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,360
It's not about whether you're right or wrong.

1882
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,520
It's about whether you have the resources to win.

1883
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:06,240
I mean, I guess, yeah, I guess they could say something to Patreon.

1884
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,600
And if Patreon saw that, like, yeah, you're you're posting shit

1885
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,840
with Nintendo characters on it, they could make you take it down.

1886
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,400
I think he already got around this.

1887
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,360
But he has he has his own separate, like original creative works.

1888
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,240
And he has a Patreon for his own original creative works.

1889
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,560
Oh, and also he does this.

1890
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,800
He does Mario on the side here now.

1891
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,960
Because originally, I think his patron was like, donate to me

1892
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,840
because I'm just a couple days ago.

1893
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:32,760
Nintendo took down a patron or a game

1894
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:37,120
that was like some like porn game with Princess Peach.

1895
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,160
And they like took that down.

1896
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,520
So like they're taking stuff down, like even to this day, it's wild.

1897
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:46,040
And again, I'm not to get too into the whole reliving my youth console wars

1898
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:49,520
from the playgrounds of the 1990s, but Sega continues to be based as hell

1899
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,760
not ever issue any sorts of cease and desist.

1900
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,200
And in fact, hiring fan game designers and stuff.

1901
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,560
Right. That's how Sonic Mania happened.

1902
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,800
And it was exactly that's how you should do it.

1903
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,080
Shot in the arm, the franchise is needed for like a decade.

1904
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:05,600
It is. There is something deeply hilarious about the fact that fans

1905
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,280
just had to like, say, stop, you just stop.

1906
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,280
Just let us do it, please.

1907
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:13,720
And after like a decade of trying to do it better, like fine, just do it.

1908
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,920
And it was like the best selling game for a moment a while.

1909
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,760
And it did really well.

1910
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:21,680
Yeah, great selling game and a highest rated Sonic game of the past 20 years.

1911
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,720
Although it is it is funny, you know, like if you talk about Sonic Adventure

1912
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,800
one and two, I like the vast majority of people seem to be like, yeah,

1913
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,880
those games are not good, but it's funny because when they came out,

1914
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,720
everyone thought they were good, or at least not everyone thought they were good.

1915
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,840
That's a way over some location.

1916
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,080
They got good reviews.

1917
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,280
Everyone I talked to knows that thought they were fun.

1918
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,480
I didn't hear any of these like, like, yes, the camera is shit.

1919
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,280
I mean, the camera is shit.

1920
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,680
It's from already 64 and here are people bitching about it back then.

1921
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:50,920
The camera is shit in every game for the like the first like from 1996 to 2001.

1922
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:54,880
Yeah, I know it sounds incredibly defensive, but I feel like people are just

1923
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,840
they just tend to be more hyper critical of Sonic games.

1924
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:03,280
And you know, I think it's just there are super easy things to pick on in those games.

1925
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,520
Like big, the cats levels are boring as shit.

1926
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,440
Like it's really easy to look at that and like look at like knuckles levels

1927
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:12,080
where you just have to like hunt for like little emerald shards.

1928
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:12,960
Make this boring as shit.

1929
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,840
This isn't what Sonic's about.

1930
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:14,840
Sonic's about speed.

1931
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:19,400
This game is terrible, you know, and then it is strange because like people

1932
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:23,360
have this vitriol hatred for those knuckles and tails and slash Eggman levels.

1933
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:27,920
But it's like if they just let you play the levels in the order as you want it.

1934
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:31,400
Like I like the hero and dark story as like a like the originally they had

1935
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,960
the six stories in Sonic Adventure one that might have been a little too much,

1936
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:37,600
even though I have a huge fucking hard on for that type of Rashomon style.

1937
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,200
See things from different perspectives, type storytelling.

1938
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:43,040
But like I see why they wanted to condense it down to just two different

1939
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,800
storylines that are playing at the same time.

1940
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:49,040
But like, yeah, because they force you to like people just want to play a Sonic,

1941
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:52,560
you know, and if like if you finish playing a Sonic and you're not

1942
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,120
into the other gameplay styles, you can just not play the rest of the game.

1943
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,680
And then maybe you wouldn't get your money's worth, you wouldn't like it.

1944
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,960
But the fact they force you to play these levels you don't want to play

1945
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:03,680
just to get to the Sonic levels you do want to play really seems to leave

1946
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,320
a bad taste in some people's mouths.

1947
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:10,360
I think they sort of just focused on the speed element of like the Sonic levels

1948
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,440
and then like did what they kind of what they did with Sonic and Knuckles,

1949
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,120
where like they brought another character that added

1950
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,480
slightly different mechanics that could have changed.

1951
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:21,600
Yeah, so seeing back in the Genesis games, there was no no one was complaining

1952
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,880
that there were too many playable characters because it was just slight

1953
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,480
variations on the exact same core gameplay style with new abilities.

1954
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,400
It was perfect. There was no problem there.

1955
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,920
I feel like for Sonic Adventure one, one of the problems with designing

1956
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,680
a 3D platformer where the characters main gimmick is that they goes really,

1957
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,800
really fast is that it's just hard to design levels around that in general.

1958
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:42,000
But mainly because like you just go through the levels really fast.

1959
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,560
So you have to spend a long time designing.

1960
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:48,160
It is a worse problem in the boost games, but like it just takes longer

1961
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,080
to design a level for Sonic and it gets it gets done with so fast.

1962
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,400
So that's why they had the like the Knuckles levels in the first game.

1963
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,680
So they just reuse some of these stages that they made for Sonic,

1964
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,200
these open, expansive areas, but with a slightly different gameplay, you know,

1965
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,840
just because I didn't I don't I'm one of the guys that doesn't really mind

1966
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,560
the other types of gameplay. I don't I mean, I don't like big levels,

1967
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,520
to be honest. It's shitty fishing.

1968
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,600
I'm not even opposed to fishing games, but like the level of fishing

1969
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,800
you get in big stages is not that great.

1970
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,560
But because I've done it so many times, I can beat the big stages

1971
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:19,360
and like I mean, one minute, they're over in no time.

1972
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,560
But I understand if you don't, if you're not an expert,

1973
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,080
if you just play, you can take forever.

1974
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:26,080
My confession is that I've never beaten Sonic Adventure one

1975
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,880
because I hated the big level so much.

1976
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,400
I just went on Sega Net and downloaded a file with him.

1977
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,600
Downloaded a file.

1978
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,600
So I can play the Super Sonic level and beat the game.

1979
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,840
Yeah, I totally get why people don't like big

1980
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,480
because they gate the ending of the game behind this character

1981
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,800
that has a completely different play style.

1982
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,640
I mean, I'll still go up to that, say, Sonic's like levels were fine.

1983
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,600
Tails levels in the first game were basically just Sonic levels.

1984
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,320
So they're fine, although I understand if you don't think they're that great

1985
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:54,800
because they're not that new.

1986
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,080
Knuckles levels, if you're not into it, that's fine.

1987
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,320
But I think in the first game, especially because the levels were smaller,

1988
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,880
his radar wasn't fucking busted so you could actually detect all three at once.

1989
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,560
So they weren't too bad.

1990
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:11,040
The Amy, Amy, I'm of two minds about the Amy stages aren't that bad themselves.

1991
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,000
Although the gimmick of the robot chasing you I used to hate.

1992
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,920
Well, now that I'm older, I realize he poses no threat whatsoever.

1993
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:17,760
You can just knock him down.

1994
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,040
He's he's a complete joke.

1995
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:23,080
But yeah, Amy's main problem is that she's so slow

1996
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,720
that just getting between her levels, which she only even has three of,

1997
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,560
it just takes forever. She's so slow.

1998
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,120
And you have to for some reason, they made her campaign.

1999
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,440
So you have to walk across the entire adventure fields

2000
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:37,960
for like three levels and they needed to make it feel like that's exactly right.

2001
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,800
And it's funny, because on a fundamental level,

2002
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,520
I kind of like her movement mechanics.

2003
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:45,040
I like that when you reach top speed, you can do that hammer bounce,

2004
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,760
which actually goes really high up and it's kind of fun chaining the bounces together.

2005
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,960
But it's just there's so much tedium between the fun parts of the Amy stage.

2006
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,800
For some reason, they're like, oh, we'll have puzzles for Amy.

2007
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,440
But the puzzles are like, put the green box in the green thing,

2008
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,400
put the orange box in order.

2009
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,560
It's not even it barely even counts as a fucking puzzle.

2010
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:04,600
You know, I just think instead of like having these this entire dedicated

2011
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:08,040
campaign to Amy that was like half baked, they should have just like done

2012
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,480
more speed levels that were the same kind of structure as like a sonic level.

2013
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,560
But they're like, OK, Amy has this hammer mechanic.

2014
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,960
Let's try and integrate that into the core gameplay loop.

2015
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,560
So they had it was more iterative instead of like, let's like

2016
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:23,720
remake everything from the ground up six times with very shout out.

2017
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:26,480
Yeah, I got angry as a kid, because I was like, I wanted to take Amy

2018
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:29,120
into all the sonic levels and then take Tails and Emerald Coast.

2019
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,080
And you actually could like glitch.

2020
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,040
Which is why Sonic Sonic and Knuckles was so fucking sick.

2021
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,400
Because that's what you could do.

2022
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,040
It's like, you want to.

2023
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,280
Yeah, you want to play all of Sonic 2 with Knuckles.

2024
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,480
Here you go. Like have at it.

2025
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,600
I can't tell you how cool I thought that was as a kid.

2026
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,440
You know what I mean? Because, you know, Mario Mario always had

2027
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:48,120
better fundamentals and but Sonic always had like the craziest shit.

2028
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,040
You know, when it was always trying to throw a million ideas into the blender

2029
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,720
and just like so cool to like play a game that I had already like been pretty

2030
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:59,480
knowledgeable of and like, oh, but now you can like climb up surfaces.

2031
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,800
It's like, how does that change it?

2032
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,360
How can I do things differently?

2033
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:05,160
It was like, bro, breathe new light into that entire game.

2034
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,920
It's like super fucking cool.

2035
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,200
Yeah, on paper, Knuckles doesn't even seem like he's that different.

2036
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:15,000
He has an ever so slightly less high jump than Sonic, which makes some parts

2037
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,800
a little hard, but he completely can compensate for that by having his

2038
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,600
gliding and climbing, which is just, you know, all you need.

2039
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,160
And it was fun.

2040
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,320
Yeah, he was a great character just to explore, because back in Sonic 2,

2041
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,480
it was the first game with Tails as a playable character,

2042
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,160
but he was only a reskin of Sonic.

2043
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,160
He didn't have the ability to fly.

2044
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:32,160
So Knuckles was like, it was it was really fun to just explore this.

2045
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:35,480
They even put new hidden one up monitors that only Knuckles could reach

2046
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,320
because, you know, they wanted to reward you for looking at.

2047
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,000
And it was just such an interesting piece of like technology

2048
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,560
that they would bother like, because it's funny, because like there's

2049
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,120
you could easily make an argument that Sonic 3 and Sonic Knuckles is bad

2050
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,080
business consumer practices, because they're basically making you buy two

2051
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,520
games to pay to play the finished one game.

2052
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,000
You know what I mean?

2053
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,040
But, you know, it didn't feel that way as a kid, because I felt like I was

2054
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,680
going to play two games combined into one and had this crazy substantial

2055
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,360
by itself. Yeah.

2056
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:02,400
And they didn't go and didn't tell everyone, oh, this is part one.

2057
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,920
They just said, hey, everyone, this is Sonic 3.

2058
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,320
And then six months later, they're like, oh, and also there's this game

2059
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,480
called Sonic and that was originally going to be one game.

2060
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,560
But because of development problems, they had to split it up.

2061
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,640
Yeah, there was these development problems.

2062
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,160
It's only three had a strange development.

2063
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,800
And there's also like, like they had a promotional deal with McDonald's

2064
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,760
when they're like obligated to get a game out in this certain time period.

2065
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:24,000
Wasn't Knuckles originally going to be a Nike thing?

2066
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,000
Yeah, I've heard that for so long.

2067
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,320
I heard that I thought it was a complete like meme or joke that his

2068
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:32,240
his little white chest thing was going to be like a Nike swoosh.

2069
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,840
But that was apparently actually really in like talks.

2070
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,800
And that was really going to happen.

2071
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,520
But it didn't happen.

2072
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,400
They left the thing on his neck.

2073
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,120
Yeah, it was supposed to be a Nike.

2074
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,160
Yeah, there was going to be a little Nike thing.

2075
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:49,840
I mean, I yeah, for Knuckles, I don't know why it's so it's so strange.

2076
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:50,600
Yeah, I don't know.

2077
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,800
I do not know the full details as I have to do some more research.

2078
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,680
But for a long time, I was like, no, that's not true.

2079
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,400
That can't be true.

2080
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,520
I don't even know if it is the heard rumors.

2081
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:57,960
I don't know.

2082
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,480
I I don't know the full details.

2083
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:01,600
I would I still wouldn't be surprised if a part of it wasn't true.

2084
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,760
But like, I kept here.

2085
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,680
It's such a strange thing.

2086
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:04,640
It's such a strange thing.

2087
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,400
But it's so sonic at the same time.

2088
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,480
Like, yeah, exactly.

2089
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:09,520
I mean, I could I could absolutely believe that, dude.

2090
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,160
It's so strange.

2091
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,320
They literally got Michael Jackson to come make a music for Sonic 3.

2092
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,000
Like, why would you do that?

2093
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,480
Like they had in-house people who'd made great music.

2094
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,840
But they I don't know, I'm not complaining.

2095
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,720
He's uncredited.

2096
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,640
Like it was something that like had to like be slowly.

2097
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:23,720
Yeah, it was bizarre.

2098
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:27,400
It was uncredited, but it was like there were so many signs.

2099
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,640
And it wasn't just like Michael was the one guy.

2100
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:30,680
He just like team of people.

2101
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,040
And there was this dude called Brad Buxer who also contributed

2102
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,960
with some song from like a band he had that was unreleased.

2103
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,320
It's just a strange thing.

2104
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:38,840
And yeah, it's well documented now.

2105
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,920
I don't really feel like I need to make a whole video talking about it.

2106
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,520
But yeah, just search like Michael Jackson, the Sonic 3.

2107
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,000
And it's just a whole thing where like like the the the the Sonic 3,

2108
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,200
when you play it just by itself, when you only play it,

2109
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,920
not put into Sonic 3 and Knuckles, it has its own unique ending

2110
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,160
like credits theme that's like exactly the same.

2111
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,920
Like note progression is Stranger in Moscow by Michael Jackson.

2112
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,600
So fucking cool.

2113
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,760
So fucking weird, man.

2114
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,040
Sonic's wild.

2115
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:10,400
It really is one of the strangest media franchises out there, I got to say.

2116
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,480
Yeah, sounds about right.

2117
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:19,120
So so anyway, what you guys what you guys been up to?

2118
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,400
How's your how's your week been?

2119
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,560
I'm sorry, I can't I have so little I have so little to contribute

2120
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,960
to a Sonic the Hedgehog discussion, but I appreciate it.

2121
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,120
And you just got to start playing all the games.

2122
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,640
I got to go back and get a dream cast.

2123
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,080
You know, it's funny.

2124
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,320
I always thought like I really liked those PCP lecture things.

2125
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,960
And I always would watch them and be like, there is no way I could like

2126
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:46,000
give a lecture on anything because it's just I mean, I'm very reliant

2127
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,600
on my scripted content and being able to ruminate over what I'm going to say.

2128
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,360
I mean, you just talked about Sonic for like 45 minutes.

2129
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:57,840
Right. Well, yeah, I was going to say, I was just I was just I actually

2130
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,200
probably now that I'm really thinking about now that I'm just like ranting

2131
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,520
about like these random things, like they just connected to each other.

2132
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:05,440
I probably could do it, although, yes, it would be very helpful to have

2133
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,200
like a list of notes and like a blackboard or whatever.

2134
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,280
I think we all have.

2135
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,720
Yeah, you have notes.

2136
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:15,120
You know, my notes are just like bullet points that are like, you know,

2137
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:18,880
an ordered list of like things that I want to make sure that I touch on.

2138
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,800
And, you know, all I do is just like, I'll just look at the next one and be like,

2139
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,440
oh, yeah, that thing. So here's how it happens.

2140
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,760
Here's how it connects to the last thing.

2141
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:27,520
Talk about it for a bit.

2142
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,800
When I'm done, I look at the next one.

2143
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,680
Oh, yeah. OK. And then after that, this thing happens.

2144
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,080
Just just just fill in the gaps between.

2145
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,240
Yeah, as long as you got a rough outline, I can totally see that.

2146
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:39,840
The only thing I would have as an issue with giving

2147
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,320
Electron Sonic is like, where the fuck do you begin and like end?

2148
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:43,880
You know what I mean?

2149
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:47,800
Like, if it was the entire history of everything, I'd be there for like 48 hours,

2150
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:51,600
you know, to give yourself some sort of like guiding principle.

2151
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,080
That's why, like, yeah, like Tails gets trolled or so I see

2152
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:58,120
or Kokoro wish that it's like a nice, finite amount.

2153
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,240
I wish that my son should let you were longer.

2154
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,440
It's not even two hours. It's nothing.

2155
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,480
That one could. Yeah, you're right.

2156
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,680
That actually one could the God.

2157
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:08,360
Well, I mean, for God's sake, you could be talking about Christian for

2158
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,400
Electron that for that would.

2159
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,320
I mean, there's like a video series on YouTube that's like 40 parts now.

2160
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:16,720
It's like each is like, yeah, and it's just going over every single fucking thing.

2161
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,480
I mean, I haven't seen I ever tell you like I.

2162
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:23,520
I was just I got into Christian in the weirdest thing.

2163
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,880
This was back in like, I don't even know how long this was like years and years

2164
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,920
and years ago, I was I was back in Virginia as a pure coincidence.

2165
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,040
I was actually it was a super depressing time

2166
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,800
because we were visiting my sick grandmother and it was like clear.

2167
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,320
She was like near the end of her life.

2168
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,600
So it was like not.

2169
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,640
It was like sad, but like we were happy that we got to hang out with her again

2170
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,200
one last time. So it's like weird vibes or whatever.

2171
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,440
So then I was like in the hotel room and I was just like,

2172
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,040
I really need to like have something else to think about right now.

2173
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:51,480
And I'd heard of Sonichu before, but I didn't really like know that much about it.

2174
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:53,680
Did you just do the sonichu ended up on the quickie.

2175
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,120
And I ended up.

2176
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:59,680
Yeah, pretty much I ended up on the quickie and I read the entire fucking thing

2177
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,440
and it took me like a week.

2178
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:03,280
But I read like every single fucking page on that thing.

2179
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,080
And I felt like a goddamn like expert on it.

2180
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,040
But that was so long ago.

2181
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,480
And I have I have not kept up.

2182
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:10,080
But some of those pages, it's fascinating, man.

2183
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:14,920
The idea that one person's life can be this chronicled is just kind of terrifying.

2184
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,720
It's just like you're just like one.

2185
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:21,080
You're a little terrifying moment away from your entire history being exposed.

2186
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,880
No, I don't think that's true.

2187
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,960
Chris is not Chris did not have one locale moment.

2188
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:27,880
We're we're not.

2189
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,720
We're not all exactly like that.

2190
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,360
I do get what I do get.

2191
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,880
I get what you're saying, though, that like one mistake and you can like

2192
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,640
have someone if people get obsessive enough, they'll dig in your online history.

2193
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,120
And like, do you have this in this?

2194
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:44,480
Our generation has this entire like paleolithic, paleolithic, like

2195
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,000
uncovering like layers and layers of history.

2196
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,640
You can go back and dig up someone's old my space and dig up their old fucking

2197
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,000
deviant art. I don't even know.

2198
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,800
An internet historian video about like that that Japanese lawyer

2199
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,480
who got like got like trolled harder than anyone's ever been told before.

2200
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,080
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2201
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,600
I don't know.

2202
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,480
Yeah, I'm actually not sure I know what you're talking about here.

2203
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:08,280
I do. I do like internet historians, so I should watch that.

2204
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,480
Oh, God, I'm going to feel stupid if I'm if I'm thinking of someone else.

2205
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:15,640
But like, it was there was like a kid who was getting like cyber bullied

2206
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:21,440
and he he like hired a lawyer and like this lawyer like went on 4chan

2207
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:25,760
and like said that he was like an expert on like trolling law or something

2208
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,800
and that like everyone needs to stop bullying right now or there will be

2209
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:34,440
legal consequences and this guy's fuck this is like a famous case.

2210
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:38,000
And I think you'd probably know his face if you saw it, but I don't remember his name.

2211
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,840
And it's like, yeah.

2212
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:44,520
And so this this these people like they took this lawyer's face like they knew

2213
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,480
which they knew which law firm he worked for.

2214
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:50,240
They knew his full name and they just like they made like this huge

2215
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:55,000
harassment campaign against this lawyer and plastered his face like all over the country.

2216
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,160
God, that's so funny that like if you're getting trolled,

2217
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:03,360
the one thing you should never do is like make a big public statement going,

2218
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,160
guys, please stop trolling.

2219
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:09,320
I'm he basically said like I will sue you through the Internet.

2220
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:12,840
If if, you know, this is obviously like, obviously,

2221
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,280
he can't fucking do anything against a bunch of anonymous posters.

2222
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:20,320
I love when people are claimed to be experts on troll law.

2223
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,080
You know, yeah.

2224
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:24,360
And like, you know, the fact that he's there, the fact that he's doing that

2225
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,800
just proves that he has no fucking clue, right?

2226
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,000
But he's there to he's there to claim he's an expert and to try to intimidate these people.

2227
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:31,000
I'm so embarrassed.

2228
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,160
I can't I don't remember.

2229
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:36,920
I can't find the video and I'm not sure if it's in an historian and I don't remember his name.

2230
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:41,440
But I swear in the comments to tell me who this person is, because I know I'm sure this is what

2231
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,240
this guy hopes everybody is like.

2232
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,400
They can't remember his name.

2233
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,040
They don't know where they saw him.

2234
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:48,320
Finally, I'm doing him a big nightmare is over.

2235
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,000
The guy just like still is a lawyer.

2236
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,640
He still works at his fucking law firm, even though he's like the most trolled man in the world.

2237
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:59,200
Punished Japanese lawyer, man.

2238
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:00,760
Yeah.

2239
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:05,720
I found Chris. I found Chris in college.

2240
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:06,960
I think I don't know.

2241
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,800
I would spend a lot of time.

2242
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,160
I would spend a lot of time on other kin forums.

2243
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:15,360
I would like I would hang out on other kin forums and just like get mad and see

2244
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:20,960
over like how stupid and like try and troll them

2245
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,040
and stuff. And I think through my other controlling activities,

2246
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:28,080
I I somehow stumbled across probably

2247
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,360
something awful threat or something about Chris Chan.

2248
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:33,400
And that's probably how I found him or him at the time.

2249
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:38,640
I just found him randomly and I felt bad and I never dug into it any further

2250
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:39,760
until your lecture.

2251
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:40,800
So just like this.

2252
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,800
This seems like a sad human that deserves my pity.

2253
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,200
No, I can't believe how long he's thriving.

2254
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,160
She loves it.

2255
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:51,040
She I don't know if you guys see, but Chris's latest tweet.

2256
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:54,760
Chris's latest tweet has been up for days and it is addressed to me.

2257
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,360
Do you are you?

2258
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,480
Oh, yeah, I did. I did see that.

2259
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,880
Actually, I got to admit, I'm not 100 percent up to date on all the lore,

2260
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:06,440
although I was vaguely aware that you were engaging in some sort of slime war to

2261
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,480
it's also ugly.

2262
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:10,040
And it's also ugly. Follow me on Twitter, by the way,

2263
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:12,400
from Chris Chan, Sonichu of the Alpha Timeline.

2264
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,200
Your slime and punishment ended long ago.

2265
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,800
Our Quickville and Arizona have made amends.

2266
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,400
Our mutual grievances remain with you and your motley crew.

2267
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,920
Even Phantom Horn himself has a horn to pick with you.

2268
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,240
See you.

2269
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,120
Oh, my God.

2270
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:32,560
That's pretty much no shame about Phantom Horn.

2271
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:33,640
Phantom Horn is my buddy.

2272
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:37,320
She she must be talking about the other Phantom Horn that she gave the Blue

2273
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:39,400
Podron and gave the Ghost Horn.

2274
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:41,840
That Phantom Horn is fucked up. I hate that guy.

2275
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:46,400
Get like CWC lecture three or four where you enter the narrative

2276
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:48,680
and you have to do a lecture on yourself.

2277
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,960
This that'll be fun.

2278
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:56,200
I this makes me very happy because like I had I had had a little

2279
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,520
Twitter interaction with her fairly recently and it was about it was about

2280
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:01,600
slime and punishment and stuff.

2281
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,600
And she was like, oh, no, that's the Omega Timeline.

2282
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,840
That's not the Alpha Timeline.

2283
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,120
This is the Beta Timeline.

2284
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,640
This is a different universe.

2285
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,880
No, I stopped time and I ran away and it didn't happen.

2286
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,760
And and and I was like, no, wrong.

2287
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,560
And then there was like silence.

2288
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,840
I didn't hear from her for days.

2289
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:23,320
And I thought, oh, no, I think maybe she just finds this annoying and is going

2290
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:27,520
to just pretend to just ignore it and leave it be and like go off and do

2291
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,000
something else with her time, which would probably which would be the right move.

2292
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:34,000
But I'm afraid she's going to do the right thing and ignore me and go off

2293
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,280
and do something else and think about something else.

2294
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:40,040
But no, days later, she comes back with this proclamation.

2295
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:42,040
And I'm like, yes, I'm in there.

2296
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:44,200
I'm in that head rent free.

2297
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:48,080
I'm going to get her to make an entire issue about about Fandom Horn.

2298
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,720
And that's what it's going to be.

2299
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,320
This is this is the first step.

2300
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:54,360
This is the goal of the pages of Sonichu themselves.

2301
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:55,920
The long game.

2302
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,880
Just wanted to come.

2303
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,800
I got to say, it's pretty based.

2304
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:00,640
Yes, exactly.

2305
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:04,160
To be influencing the entire universe and then tell.

2306
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,360
So I saw at one point that Christine was giving you like five dollars on

2307
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:11,120
Patreon, which made everyone on the Kiwi Farm, Steve anger.

2308
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,640
She did. She she subscribed because she wanted.

2309
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,720
I told her no, you can't give money to Ben Sainte.

2310
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:18,840
He's not allowed to be making history.

2311
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:23,440
No, she she wanted to see the the pages that I hadn't released before

2312
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,240
the the the semi finale.

2313
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:27,280
And I was like, well, I'll release them soon.

2314
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:31,640
But like they're up on my Patreon until I'm ready to make them public.

2315
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:33,280
And she just went and pledged.

2316
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:36,720
I think she's still pledged, actually, which is I don't know why.

2317
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:41,200
But the pretty fucking based, I got to say, you know, I really,

2318
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,920
really liked that part of this on a two lecture where you were just like, oh,

2319
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:48,040
yeah, I also commissioned official canon art of what happened to liquid.

2320
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:48,960
I have that in my room.

2321
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,680
I haven't hanging over my bed right now.

2322
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:53,760
Right in the corner. I can see it.

2323
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,000
I got them.

2324
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,160
I don't know if you I suppose you you might not have seen.

2325
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:58,960
You probably wouldn't have.

2326
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,000
But yeah, during making this, making the the comic that I'm

2327
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,080
doing, the slime and punishment, Chris has made Chris made a bunch of

2328
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:08,520
like response images.

2329
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:12,400
She drew a bunch of like art trying to like influence the story.

2330
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,440
And I have I should really get around to editing it soon.

2331
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:19,880
But I have Chris Chan 102, you know, it's in the editing bay.

2332
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:21,960
It's going to come out one of these days.

2333
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,080
And you know, I show a bunch of those in there.

2334
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,440
And so I didn't even have to commission that.

2335
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:29,520
She just did it because, you know, she couldn't help herself.

2336
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:32,880
She was so offended by the events taking place in New

2337
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,240
Los Angeles City, AKA Neo Milwaukee, that she had to set the.

2338
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:39,600
That's a 9000 IQ play where you don't even commission things.

2339
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,600
You just be so interesting that you get free fan art.

2340
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:45,160
Oh, boy, those are those are.

2341
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,920
Oh, yeah. And she put them on cards.

2342
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,720
She put them on cards.

2343
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:52,040
Do you do you know what Twilight Sparkle's secret shipfic folder is?

2344
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,880
You probably don't.

2345
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:58,960
I do not know that fan made card game about my little pony.

2346
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,200
Brony's made it up.

2347
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,600
I don't exactly know how it works.

2348
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,760
I've never actually played it.

2349
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:07,480
But she made an expansion pack based on my characters.

2350
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:13,000
And she sent me a copy of the cards for this game that I don't know how to play.

2351
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,600
But I have these. That's so funny that she would just do that completely

2352
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:20,640
like unsolicited for like, well, she tried to get me to pay her

2353
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,880
for it, like, because I love that.

2354
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,280
It's like, please pay me for this.

2355
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,320
Oh, whatever. You can just.

2356
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,800
I think she she tried to get me to pay her, I think, for the right to use

2357
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:35,520
Nightstar or yeah, and Christian's use of user characters or whatever.

2358
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,800
But she gave that up very quickly.

2359
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,000
Uh, I don't know.

2360
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,200
It it, you know, I wonder this this this makes me think about

2361
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,200
Tails gets trolled and publishing it physically.

2362
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:51,000
And I don't know. I think.

2363
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,920
Like, I don't think I think I think he could do it.

2364
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,080
I think he could publish physical books if he wanted to.

2365
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,360
Like, I don't think Nintendo would do anything.

2366
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,920
I don't think Sega would do anything.

2367
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,080
Sega is like very hands off in that way.

2368
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:07,240
It's so out there, like, yeah, I like it almost seems like it would be worse

2369
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,880
move for like Nintendo to even bother trying to comment on it.

2370
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:12,760
You know, like, I feel like even though they're so out of touch,

2371
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:15,800
just a bunch of old geriatric Japanese men that don't understand anything,

2372
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,760
they're finally wrapping their head around the like stri-sand effect,

2373
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:21,880
like stop giving attention to these like fan projects.

2374
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:24,480
Like when you shut them down, you're like giving them and making everyone

2375
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,960
love them and want to support them. I don't know.

2376
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,360
But Tails gets trolled.

2377
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:30,400
It's like it's like Tails is in the title.

2378
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,560
I don't know. Hopefully that wouldn't be an issue.

2379
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,920
I don't think it would be an issue.

2380
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,040
Tails. I don't know.

2381
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,480
I really don't know that much about Tails.

2382
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:42,880
How much how much do you think he could reasonably make by selling

2383
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,320
Tails gets trolled?

2384
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:49,320
Like, I'm thinking he could make on the order of maybe tens of thousands of dollars

2385
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:51,760
at like sounds about right. Yeah.

2386
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,760
I'm not sure. I don't know.

2387
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:54,880
I'm very not sure.

2388
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,320
Like, I don't know if that's enough

2389
01:49:56,320 --> 01:50:01,160
that that's Sega who's like would find it worth getting their nose dirty.

2390
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:02,800
You're sure it's true.

2391
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,120
Like, there's plenty of people that like publish fanzines

2392
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:08,400
and like they just do on a smaller scale that just it's just absolutely

2393
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,080
not worth interfering with.

2394
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,960
And like, you're right, unless Tails gets trolled,

2395
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:16,480
it gets like giga popular to the point where it's in the shown in jump listings.

2396
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,960
It's probably not going to be such an issue where they have a problem with it.

2397
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,080
Tails gets trolled is known.

2398
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:24,440
It's known by a lot of people, but like it's very niche.

2399
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:27,520
And how many people are like, how many people are interested enough

2400
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,880
that they would like commit money to purchasing a copy?

2401
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:39,120
Me, you, you guys and, you know, a very small slice of the reading population.

2402
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:43,720
And like, Nintendo seems to be much more interested in like, you know,

2403
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:48,600
taking action and issuing C&Ds for video games, because that's their bread and butter.

2404
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:51,720
They don't seem to be as active as taking down like other media,

2405
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:56,120
probably because it's not like people won't confuse it with their brand, I guess.

2406
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:57,360
Maybe that's true. Yeah.

2407
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:00,680
Webcomics and whatnot have got to be like insanely low down

2408
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:02,440
on their list of things to worry about.

2409
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:06,400
You know, did you say in your video that he was thinking of like

2410
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:10,400
replacing the copyrighted characters with original characters or something like that?

2411
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:15,480
Yeah. OK, so when he had like canceled it, he was like,

2412
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:19,680
oh, maybe we'll continue the story, but like in a text based form.

2413
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:22,000
But then he had the idea he was going to split it in half.

2414
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,360
And there was going to be the comedy series with the with the copyrighted

2415
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,560
characters called the Troll Slayers, but he was going to split all the drama

2416
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:33,320
and serious story stuff into a separate issue that replaces all the characters

2417
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:36,600
with like original characters called Teyel's realm.

2418
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:40,280
Teyel's realm.

2419
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,400
I had not heard it.

2420
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,880
Yeah, this blew my fucking mind.

2421
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,520
Teyel's realm, this blew my mind hearing that in your on your video,

2422
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:49,720
because like I'd never heard this before.

2423
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,600
And it's it's insane.

2424
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,400
It's total insanity.

2425
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:54,760
It's it's insane.

2426
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,320
Like, OK, that was the funniest part to me.

2427
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,200
Like, like he gets tailed, gets trolled, polished,

2428
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,360
and that's not even the worst idea.

2429
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,440
Yeah. Yeah.

2430
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:06,000
Oh, luckily, that one never actually like made it out of the planning phase,

2431
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,560
luckily, at least as far as I know.

2432
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:10,920
Somebody sent me somebody sent me a Facebook message.

2433
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:13,480
It was I think it was either.

2434
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:16,960
Oh, man, I have to fucking log in to Facebook.

2435
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:19,040
Oh, my God.

2436
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,120
That is the worst thing ever.

2437
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:21,320
It is.

2438
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:23,360
I deleted my Facebook out of anger.

2439
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:28,840
I just sort of I just forget about it in like nine ninety nine percent of the time.

2440
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:33,040
But I think I still have one, but I haven't used it in like over a decade.

2441
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,800
I deleted it so I could epically

2442
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,840
poned Mark Zuckerberg, but it doesn't even matter,

2443
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:40,680
because if you don't have a Facebook profile,

2444
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:43,480
that it just constructs a shadow profile of you based on information

2445
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:44,640
that gathers from your friends.

2446
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,200
Yeah, really?

2447
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:47,520
Yeah. What?

2448
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:48,600
Yeah.

2449
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,960
And based on other sites you visit on the Internet,

2450
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:54,560
it's a shadow a shadow clone, because like Facebook has the

2451
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:57,240
has trackers and like embedded in other websites,

2452
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:59,800
because that's like how businesses can like

2453
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,160
track like your purchasing habits and stuff.

2454
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:06,360
Yeah. So they can just construct a profile for you.

2455
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,240
Even if you don't have a profile, they know a lot about you.

2456
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:11,600
I guess that's a better way of saying it than a shadow profile.

2457
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:12,840
It does sound cooler, though.

2458
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:14,840
Well, that blows.

2459
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:16,360
I got to say, I'm not the biggest fan.

2460
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:18,520
Yep. There's no escaping the panopticon.

2461
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:21,160
We live in the state of total global surveillance,

2462
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:23,840
and it's never going to get any better.

2463
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:27,240
Hey, man, don't be such a downer about it.

2464
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,880
All right.

2465
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:31,840
It's shadow profile, more like shadow, the hedgehog.

2466
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,760
Yeah.

2467
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,240
Hey, yeah, video games.

2468
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,840
Exactly.

2469
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,400
That's why I think we need to elect

2470
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,360
Laserbot as president of the United States in 2020.

2471
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,760
We should write a name.

2472
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,800
Do you know Ace Watkins?

2473
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,800
Ace, Ace, Ace Watkins.

2474
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,200
I know that name.

2475
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,000
Yeah, the first gamer president.

2476
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,600
Yes, I know that Twitter account.

2477
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:56,080
Yes, very funny.

2478
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,840
I wouldn't happily vote for the first gamer president.

2479
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,840
He's a he's a real quote factory.

2480
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:03,040
OK, now I got a message.

2481
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:05,640
Oh, yeah. No, Laserbot sent me.

2482
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:08,520
Laserbot sent me a Facebook message on September 11th.

2483
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,760
This is this was 16 days ago.

2484
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:12,600
And I didn't answer.

2485
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:15,080
Fuck, he just asked me how's everything been.

2486
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,560
And I don't know why I don't know what he wanted.

2487
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,400
Oh, that's weird.

2488
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,840
Because he had to talk to me in like in like two years.

2489
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,920
OK, well, I'll have to like carefully consider

2490
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,120
how I want to respond to that.

2491
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:28,440
That's I just I just remember that right now.

2492
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:31,400
I've just finished doing a podcast

2493
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,480
where I talked about your work for like two hours.

2494
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:34,160
Man, how you do it?

2495
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:36,200
It was it was I think it maybe.

2496
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:39,000
Oh, maybe he wants to come on a podcast.

2497
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,560
I feel like that's why because that was that was the initial idea.

2498
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:43,000
That's what we that's what we talked about.

2499
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,160
That is really funny timing, I got to say,

2500
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:48,480
because it's like right before I ended up posting that video about it.

2501
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,920
Yeah, that's what we talked about on Facebook,

2502
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:52,360
was whether he wanted to come on the podcast

2503
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:55,200
and he wouldn't do it because he didn't have a microphone.

2504
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:58,960
And I'm like, well, there's always some sort of technical issue

2505
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,800
when you want to organize something with Laserbot.

2506
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:02,680
Unfortunately, I would I would buy him a microphone

2507
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,760
if that's what I said, like you want for like thirty five dollars

2508
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:06,720
and it would be fine.

2509
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:09,840
But it's like my internet doesn't work very well.

2510
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:12,960
Just say you don't want to do it, you coward.

2511
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,240
But well, I mean, he's reaching out.

2512
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:16,480
So maybe he does.

2513
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,840
I'm hoping the tides of time

2514
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,560
because maybe maybe he said would be incredible.

2515
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,400
Maybe he's got something he wants to promote.

2516
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,400
I'm not going to try and pretend

2517
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:27,360
like I could take any sort of credit for this.

2518
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:31,480
But hopefully my video contributes to a somewhat resurgence

2519
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:33,160
in popularity for Tails gets trolled.

2520
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:36,160
I would be happy for him to get back in the spotlight more.

2521
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:37,360
I mean, he's going to be working on it again.

2522
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:41,280
You guys are both going to draw new pages to the to the legacy of Tales of Trolls.

2523
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,400
I hope so.

2524
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:45,520
Like I say, at the end of the video, I really genuinely there is nothing

2525
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:48,960
I want to see more than for Tails gets told to actually finish in my lifetime.

2526
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,640
I would love to see that story finished.

2527
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:51,160
You know what I mean?

2528
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:53,400
Just sort of those like stories you have in the back of your head.

2529
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:55,560
It's going to be sitting there in my head for the rest of my life,

2530
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,520
even if it finishes.

2531
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:03,280
I just I can't imagine what we've seen so far being only a quarter of it.

2532
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:06,800
Like where the fuck would it go for the rest of its runtime?

2533
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,720
I do briefly mention this like in the video.

2534
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:12,200
But like one of my favorite things is like every time you finally like

2535
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:15,360
really sort of like get it, like you sort of get a grasp on it.

2536
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,120
Like you sort of get the Troll Slayer situation.

2537
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:18,520
Like, OK, I get Tails gets trolled.

2538
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:21,280
It completely changes it up with like the new Trolls or just introducing

2539
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:26,760
something or like the whole party at Cheeto Man's house and like the mass grave

2540
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:28,960
and shit like that's like a big fuck.

2541
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:29,720
Yes, exactly.

2542
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:32,560
Like every time once you finally get used to the defenders and you're like, OK,

2543
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:35,480
I finally am used to this insane convoluted all this bullshit.

2544
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:37,000
There's no you don't even understand.

2545
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,920
There's this conspiracy with the Cheeto Man.

2546
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,720
And it is so fucking funny.

2547
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:43,720
He has to I can't even think about that laughing.

2548
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,640
Knuckles' plan is to bring over a bunch of hoes who have STDs with God Maria.

2549
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,800
So he has to kill them all.

2550
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:54,040
Even though God Maria can be cured in a couple of weeks with Amy Pay likes.

2551
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:58,040
It's so funny.

2552
01:56:58,040 --> 01:56:59,040
It's like the funny thing.

2553
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,200
It's like Cheeto Man's one way to make a fucking video.

2554
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:04,400
Boy, it sure would ruin my criminal empire.

2555
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:08,960
If someone were to present me a hoe with an STD that I would have sex with,

2556
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,880
like that it's a laser.

2557
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,440
Bond has led the greatest mind of our generation.

2558
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,320
I just want to see what else it can come up with.

2559
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:19,240
It's priceless.

2560
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:20,760
Yeah, it's priceless.

2561
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:25,200
So I've been watching movies lately.

2562
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,400
I watched a lot of movies this week.

2563
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:29,800
It's very weird for me because I never watch movies.

2564
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:32,160
I hate all media.

2565
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:35,920
I go through phases where I'm like a movie guy and I'm going to be the coolest guy

2566
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,200
who listens to fucking directors, commentary and shit.

2567
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,080
And then I'm like, fuck movies, movies suck.

2568
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:41,680
They're all a bunch of Hollywood bullshit.

2569
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,800
I was I've been feeling that way for a long time.

2570
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:47,120
And then I I won't belabor this because I've talked about it before.

2571
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:50,320
But I made a tweet asking for recommendations of people about movies

2572
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:54,280
where people just talk, just people talking, nothing happened.

2573
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:55,640
I don't want me.

2574
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:57,680
When you watch my dinner with Andre, I have seen that before.

2575
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:01,440
Yeah. So that I didn't I didn't watch that one.

2576
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:05,240
But I watched like no, I watched an insane amount of movies this week.

2577
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:06,720
I watched like a dozen movies.

2578
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:10,800
That's more than I've watched in like the decade up till now or the previous decade.

2579
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,480
I don't think I've watched a dozen movies this year yet.

2580
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:16,160
Yeah, no, I watched Sonic.

2581
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:17,200
I just probably some more.

2582
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:19,280
I just got on one day where I was like bored

2583
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:22,320
and I guess I was procrastinating from doing like sending off books

2584
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:24,480
and doing the like signatures and stuff.

2585
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,160
And I was just I just was downloading one movie after another,

2586
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:28,920
just going down the list like, yeah, I'll get that one.

2587
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:31,080
Tarned it. OK, watch it an hour and a half later.

2588
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:32,320
All right, cool.

2589
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,040
Um, it feels good to get into a movie zone.

2590
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,240
And I know that feeling where you're like banging on movies.

2591
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:38,080
It's like when you watch a movie,

2592
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,120
it almost feels like you just finished a whole show, you know what I mean?

2593
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:41,120
Think about a movie.

2594
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:44,880
A movie feels like a big commitment, but it's really not like.

2595
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:46,800
It's so it's so funny.

2596
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,880
I have the exact same thing where it's like, I'm like, I can't.

2597
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,680
I don't have time to sit down and watch a two hour movie.

2598
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:53,560
I might as well just sit down and watch eight half hour episodes

2599
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:55,520
of some fucking show I don't even give a shit about.

2600
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,120
And then I regret my time watching.

2601
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:59,920
But I watched I watched like eight movies in one day

2602
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,520
and I felt like I'd accomplished something.

2603
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,160
It didn't feel like I'd wasted my time.

2604
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:04,960
It felt like I'd been on a journey.

2605
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,640
Right. Well, movies.

2606
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,240
I know what you mean.

2607
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:09,840
It's very satisfying.

2608
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:11,280
You feel like you've.

2609
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,560
There is something super satisfying about a good movie

2610
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:16,840
that you can't get from like pretty much anything else or like if you binge

2611
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:20,800
like a TV show, like usually if you binge a season of a TV show,

2612
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,040
it's not the full story, so it doesn't feel like something's wrapped.

2613
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:26,440
Even if it has, you're like you've wasted your entire day.

2614
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:29,680
And if you kind of like feel almost sick of watching TV

2615
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:32,160
by the time you're done binging a season of a TV show, you're just like,

2616
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:33,920
fuck, and me.

2617
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,440
But the movie is like long enough.

2618
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,880
It's like designed psychologically to be long enough

2619
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:42,320
to like keep the average person engaged without almost like they did it that way

2620
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:45,120
on purpose. It's like almost like this was like intentional.

2621
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:48,320
It actually it is really funny to think movies can be any length.

2622
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:52,480
The movie can be any length, but they're all pretty much the exact same length.

2623
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,600
Well, they're getting longer.

2624
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,160
That's the best. They're getting longer and longer.

2625
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:55,920
They'd get. OK, true.

2626
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:58,760
They are getting much longer than they used to be.

2627
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:01,560
So and, you know, that's probably what I just said is getting less true

2628
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:04,640
as time goes on. But yeah, it is funny that it's like we're programmed to just

2629
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:06,320
have this two hours. It's like the perfect amount of time.

2630
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:11,440
It feels totally substantial, but also it is not nearly like it doesn't waste

2631
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:13,680
it doesn't waste your whole day.

2632
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:16,480
Let me just, you know, fuck it.

2633
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:17,480
I'm just going to go down.

2634
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:20,000
I'm just going to go down a list of movies I watched this week.

2635
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,480
There's a whole bunch.

2636
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:25,600
I watched Ghost World based on the comic by Daniel Clouse.

2637
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:27,480
Either you're familiar.

2638
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:30,200
No, that's a good I've never seen it before.

2639
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:32,600
Yeah, it was a good movie. It was pretty sweet.

2640
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:35,200
What's your name? Really hot in that movie.

2641
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:37,160
It's really fucking hot.

2642
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:39,760
I don't remember the actress's name.

2643
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:42,440
It's the same actress that plays is the girl in

2644
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,440
American Beauty.

2645
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:48,040
Oh, yeah, Thorough Birch.

2646
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:49,240
Thorough Birch.

2647
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:52,880
I'm pretty sure it's her name.

2648
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:55,000
Yeah. Yeah.

2649
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,920
Wait, TV shows, walking Thorough Birch, American actress.

2650
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:01,800
I got to make sure I got to make sure.

2651
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,560
Filmography.

2652
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:06,760
She was in Dungeons and Dragons, the movie legend.

2653
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,840
She was in Dark Corners.

2654
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:11,440
She was in The Atruscan Smile.

2655
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:12,320
Oh, yeah, she was in.

2656
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:13,960
Yeah, she was in it. Yeah, in it.

2657
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,800
So fucking hot. I can't stand it.

2658
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:18,360
Ghost World is like definitely a movie that I was like.

2659
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:22,440
I didn't watch for a long time because I don't want to watch a movie about a world of ghosts.

2660
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:24,320
But it's about but it's about teenagers.

2661
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,240
Yeah, I don't know why it's called that.

2662
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,240
I haven't read the comic.

2663
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:28,240
It's based on either.

2664
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:29,640
I've seen it, though.

2665
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:33,120
When I I got the movie and I found out, like, as it was

2666
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:35,120
as the credits were rolling, it was based on the comic.

2667
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:36,560
I was like, wait, I mean, I've heard of that.

2668
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,720
And I looked it up and like, I was like, oh, yeah, Daniel Clouse.

2669
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:40,680
I know who that is.

2670
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:43,360
I watched Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.

2671
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,480
It's really good.

2672
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:47,760
It's a really good movie about some drunk asshole.

2673
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:51,960
Getting mad at his rich dad, who's got cancer.

2674
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,000
And they hash it out in the basement.

2675
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,840
They yell at each other.

2676
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:00,480
Their shitty relatives are shitty.

2677
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:03,440
They bond a little bit.

2678
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:07,960
The wife is talking, talking movies that are the primary

2679
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:11,200
like problem is just like family and type just problems

2680
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:12,040
where people have to talk.

2681
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:14,000
There's going to be really interesting if you have like a well,

2682
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:14,680
well, it's like a plot.

2683
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:16,440
Those are like what basically what plays had to be.

2684
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:19,520
Yeah, I think I think a bunch of them are just based on

2685
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:22,040
chamber chamber plays, right?

2686
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,000
Like there's there was one next one on my list.

2687
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,920
Carnage is just four people, two or two parents of one kid,

2688
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:32,960
two parents of another kid talking in a room, talking in their apartment

2689
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:35,840
about how one kid like beat up the other kid and broke his tooth.

2690
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,680
And they get really mad at each other.

2691
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:40,680
And that's what Carnage is about.

2692
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:43,240
Carnage is a little bit.

2693
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:47,280
If I have not seen Carnage, but I think this was also a play, I believe, right?

2694
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,480
I think I don't see it.

2695
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:50,520
I don't know, but I feel very confident.

2696
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:56,400
I just saw a video of James Gandolfini, I think, in a little role for this play.

2697
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,560
Because yeah, I like the idea of a movie that's just like

2698
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:03,520
like a big conversation between people, you know, you know, I like my dinner with

2699
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,520
Andre, my dinner with Andre is good.

2700
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:07,080
Carnage stars John C.

2701
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,760
Riley, so that's pretty cool.

2702
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:16,440
I watched going down my list here, The Man from Earth, which made,

2703
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:22,880
which I found out afterwards, made YMS's best movies of 2007 lists, right?

2704
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:28,520
So very prestigious, hated it, hated it completely, thought it was so annoying.

2705
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:33,640
I I never watched this movie, but I went and I read the Wikipedia page

2706
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:36,400
and I saw the plot twist and I cringed and I thought it was right.

2707
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,680
OK, OK, it's not just me.

2708
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:40,280
The plot twist was pretty cringe.

2709
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:45,680
For my first I was so obnoxious and the way that the guy is Tom,

2710
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:48,120
do you know this movie? I've never heard of it, but I'll probably never watch it.

2711
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:55,480
OK, the plot of the movie is this guy is a professor and he's like moving away

2712
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:58,040
and his colleagues are like throwing him a going away party.

2713
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,320
And as he's going away party, he decides to admit to them, hey, guys,

2714
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:04,480
I have a secret, I wasn't going to tell you.

2715
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:08,600
But what would you think if I told you that I'm like 50,000 years old?

2716
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:12,400
Like, I'm like a fucking caveman who has survived to the modern era.

2717
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
And they're like, what?

2718
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,480
And they talk to him about they try to like tease it out of him.

2719
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:20,480
Like, is he telling the truth? Is he lying?

2720
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:24,240
Like, can we can we even determine whether this is true or not based on what he says?

2721
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:26,280
It's like, OK, well, he's telling us about history,

2722
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:28,160
but he could have known this just by researching it.

2723
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:29,520
So there's no way to know for sure.

2724
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,080
And, you know, it goes on and goes on.

2725
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:36,480
It's it is it is the case that, yeah, he really is this magical,

2726
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,320
ever-living caveman or whatever. It's fine.

2727
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:42,000
Halfway through the movie, he's like, he gets like, oh, I didn't want to talk about this.

2728
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,320
I don't want to talk about this, but I guess I technically was Jesus.

2729
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:47,400
So I'm sorry about that.

2730
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:50,560
And I'm like, no, no.

2731
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,480
Fuck this movie.

2732
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:53,680
This movie is shit.

2733
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:56,400
That's like, it's just it's like a ton of what?

2734
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:59,040
No, it's like a Neil Breen twist, you know?

2735
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:00,800
Yeah. Yeah.

2736
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:05,560
Well, he's he's like, yeah, you know, I preached, I preached peace in Judea.

2737
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:08,720
You know, I didn't tell I didn't want people to fight each other.

2738
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:10,400
I didn't want the Crusades or anything.

2739
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:13,080
I just took the Buddha's teachings that I learned in India.

2740
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:15,600
And I brought them to I brought them to Greece.

2741
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:16,880
And they but they perverted them.

2742
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:19,360
It's like, fuck you. That's fuck it.

2743
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:23,000
What's a note when it it annoys me that, like,

2744
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:26,800
it I feel like I feel like I could have written this movie myself.

2745
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:30,120
I feel like I could have, like, given the premise of a guy

2746
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:34,720
who's been alive for 50,000 years, I could have, like, put all the words in his mouth.

2747
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,640
It's so obvious.

2748
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:37,960
Like, it's such an obvious twist, but it's like so obvious

2749
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:41,120
that you don't think they're going to do it because it's not obvious.

2750
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:42,120
I didn't think they were going to do it.

2751
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:45,000
It was too bold and reductionist as well.

2752
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,640
To be like, oh, we're going to, like,

2753
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:50,280
reduce the complexity of human history down to the actions of one person.

2754
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,960
And it's like so pathetic.

2755
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:55,200
Yeah, I'm not the kind of person who gets offended, but like, that is offensive.

2756
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:57,360
Like, I could see that being offensive to people.

2757
02:05:57,360 --> 02:06:00,320
You know what I mean? I mean, it's not. I'm not a.

2758
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:02,800
Yeah, again, it doesn't offend me. I don't really give a shit.

2759
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,160
I was offended not because it was like it offended my religious sensibilities,

2760
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:09,640
but because I'm like, it offended my suspension of disbelief.

2761
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:12,040
Yeah, yeah.

2762
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:15,760
So I didn't like that one, that the idea that like Jesus

2763
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:19,960
could go on to just be some boring douchebag who works at a college is kind of hilarious.

2764
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:24,640
Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, he says, like, you know, I was just a normal guy.

2765
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:27,400
They made up all those stories about me later or whatever.

2766
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:32,160
OK, fine. I'm just a normal guy who lived for 50,000 years, you know.

2767
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:33,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2768
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:35,440
But other than that, perfectly reasonable.

2769
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:39,840
I watched never thought about trying to share your secret of ever

2770
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,400
lasting after lasting life with us.

2771
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:44,320
You know, you never wanted to go get experimented on by the US government,

2772
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:45,240
like any good patriot.

2773
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:46,000
What if he doesn't?

2774
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,760
He doesn't want to get cut up in a lab, which, you know, I don't get it.

2775
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:52,160
I don't get that. Fuck him.

2776
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:56,280
OK, I watched what's the next one on my list here.

2777
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:03,400
Friday, a comedy starring Chris Tucker and Ice Cube about getting high

2778
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:08,960
and robbing your neighbors and

2779
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:15,000
and and being in debt to a drug dealer who shows up with a car full of machine

2780
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:19,280
guns to gun you and your best friend down over two hundred dollars.

2781
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:24,920
And at the end, it's revealed that Ice Cube was Jesus Christ and the whole movie.

2782
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:26,760
Ice Cube and the whole movie.

2783
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:30,000
Ice Cube is like, damn, my girlfriend, shit.

2784
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:34,280
And Chris Tucker is like, why don't you fuck this other girl?

2785
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:36,480
And he's like, yeah, I guess I will.

2786
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,480
And at the end of the movie, they get together and it's it's a happy ending.

2787
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,680
That's the best conflict in a movie.

2788
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:47,720
Damn, my girlfriend, my girlfriend just sucks so bad.

2789
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:52,360
I'm sorry. I'm sorry you're going through this, Ice Cube.

2790
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:55,560
It was it was fairly entertaining.

2791
02:07:56,840 --> 02:08:00,920
Next one on the list is called I'm Thinking of Ending Things.

2792
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:02,840
Very creepy movie.

2793
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:05,640
I have been that's on my two watches.

2794
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:06,840
The Charlie Kaufman movie, right?

2795
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:08,600
It is. Yeah, it's like just came out.

2796
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:09,600
New Charlie Kaufman.

2797
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:11,080
Yeah, it just came out. It's on my list.

2798
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,200
I love Charlie Kaufman.

2799
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:14,560
I love adaptations of my favorite movies of all time.

2800
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,320
I saw being John Milkovich when I was way too young to understand

2801
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:20,920
what the fuck any of the like symbolism or any of it meant.

2802
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:21,920
I was just like, what the fuck?

2803
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:23,920
This is the weirdest movie I've ever seen in my life.

2804
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:26,440
I watched it when I was like in like when I was like 14.

2805
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:27,520
And I probably didn't get it.

2806
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:31,320
Did Charlie Kaufman make Synecdoche New York?

2807
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:34,800
Yeah, that was his directorial debut.

2808
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,920
Yeah, I really love Synecdoche New York.

2809
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:43,200
Yeah, I love anything that's just like a massive rumination on dying.

2810
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:45,160
Yeah, we're just going to suck to be dead.

2811
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:47,440
That's just my inner monologue.

2812
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:49,880
It's the last thing I need is more of that.

2813
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:55,480
I'm thinking of ending things is a little bit of that, not entirely.

2814
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:58,600
It's I won't say too much about it, but it's very it's OK.

2815
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:01,000
I don't need to hold another movie that's making me want to die.

2816
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,160
Very it's very unsettling.

2817
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:05,600
Um, I will definitely watch that.

2818
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:09,600
I watched a trilogy of movies called the before trilogy

2819
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:13,080
before sun before sunrise before.

2820
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:14,440
Oh, I know this movie.

2821
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:16,040
I was sorry. Again, this is another one.

2822
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:18,760
I have a problem where I just read about movies on Wikipedia.

2823
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:19,720
Then I'm like, oh, I don't need to see this.

2824
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:20,760
Now I read about it on Wikipedia.

2825
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,240
That's exactly the same as seeing a movie.

2826
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:24,120
But no, no, I haven't spoiled it or anything.

2827
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:26,280
I'm just aware that this is like a trilogy of movies

2828
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:29,840
based on like a relationship and like at different stages in these couples.

2829
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:30,880
These movies are really good.

2830
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,240
The before series is really good.

2831
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:36,760
Yeah, in before sunset, in before sunrise, these they meet on a train

2832
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:41,360
and then they spend the day like they like, oh, let's let's go see Vienna.

2833
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:44,120
And then they spend the day walking around Vienna

2834
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:47,200
and then the other movies are future.

2835
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:53,160
It's sort of a spoiler to even say like what the circumstances of them are

2836
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:56,680
because before before sunrise ends on a cliffhanger

2837
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,880
where you don't know if they'll get together again.

2838
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:01,600
So I guess spoiler, like they do, in fact, meet again.

2839
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:04,720
But it would be spoiling too much to say how.

2840
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:09,760
So but yeah, and it's like just and yeah,

2841
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:12,680
the whole movies are just them like talking to each other, talking to other people,

2842
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:16,520
going on nice dates and it's very cute.

2843
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:19,080
It's cute. I like it a lot.

2844
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:20,240
Yeah, I've heard good things about it.

2845
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:22,640
And I'm definitely at the stage of my life where I can handle a movie

2846
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:23,920
that's just people talking now.

2847
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:26,640
I think when I first heard of those movies, I was like, you know, younger.

2848
02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:29,920
And I was like, if there's nobody getting killed, then it's not a real movie.

2849
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:31,120
No, I'm I'm ready.

2850
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:32,440
I'm ready for nothing.

2851
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:34,480
I'm ready for movies where things don't happen.

2852
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:37,200
The less that things happen, the better.

2853
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:40,560
Yeah, I've become I've become so jaded and cynical and such a contrarian

2854
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:44,400
that any time things are just different than like the mainstream.

2855
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:47,160
Like just the idea of a movie that's just people talking is inherently

2856
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:48,560
like interesting to me.

2857
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:51,200
Whereas I'm sure lots of mainstream audiences would be like, no,

2858
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:54,560
I'm not going to watch a movie that's just a surprising number of movies like this.

2859
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:58,400
I feel like they're sort of out not the norm.

2860
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,120
But and yet it makes sense.

2861
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:02,600
Yeah, there's an audience and it makes sense.

2862
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:05,520
And just it's like it gets an easy not easy that it's easy to make a good

2863
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,640
movie that's people talking because you have to have a good conversation.

2864
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:10,040
But production wise, you don't need any special effects

2865
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:12,520
or you don't need any costumes or whatever.

2866
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:16,240
You just need a house and a couple of actors and a script.

2867
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:18,560
If I was going to make a movie, I would love to make a movie

2868
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:21,920
that's my first movie is just people talking movie rather than trying to start

2869
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:25,120
off with something like Space Cop where I completely fall on my face.

2870
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:28,080
I got I got two more.

2871
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:29,360
I got I watched Locke.

2872
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:32,360
Have you heard of Locke?

2873
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:34,760
I don't think I have or if I have, I can't remember.

2874
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:36,120
So fucking sick.

2875
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:37,640
Locke is a movie.

2876
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:41,440
The entire movie takes place in a guy's car as he talks on the phone.

2877
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:43,760
That's the whole fucking movie.

2878
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:45,200
And it's so good.

2879
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,120
It's really tense.

2880
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:50,160
He's like he's on the phone trying to he's got like a big fucking

2881
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:53,040
like business project that is like on the verge of falling through.

2882
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:56,000
And he's got to talk his assistant through making sure it doesn't go to shit.

2883
02:11:56,360 --> 02:12:00,680
He's got his marriages falling apart while he's like on the phone talking to his wife.

2884
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:04,880
He's like having a baby is being born and he's like trying to talk the mother

2885
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:08,040
through as she's like getting ready, just getting prepped for childbirth.

2886
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:10,760
It's very good.

2887
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:12,080
I thought Locke.

2888
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:13,120
Oh, this is an interesting movie.

2889
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:14,040
I just Googled it yet.

2890
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:14,640
Tom Harvey.

2891
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:15,520
OK, this looks interesting.

2892
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:17,520
Yeah, just him talking on the phone in his car.

2893
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:18,440
Really good.

2894
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:21,440
Last one was dirt.

2895
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:23,360
Fuck. Wait, where was it?

2896
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:24,920
Wait, where? Oh, OK.

2897
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:26,760
This is the weirdest fucking movie I've ever seen.

2898
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:30,160
Death by Hanging is a Japanese movie.

2899
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:36,360
I thought it was going to be like an anti death penalty like propaganda movie.

2900
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:39,040
And I guess maybe a little bit it is.

2901
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:45,320
But the plot of it is that they hang this kid, this guy, who is a rapist.

2902
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:48,080
He is a rapist and murderer.

2903
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,920
They hang him, but he doesn't die.

2904
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:53,240
And they're like shit.

2905
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:54,120
They like wake him up.

2906
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:55,440
He's like he's like catatonic.

2907
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:56,520
He doesn't know who he is.

2908
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,520
He doesn't know what's going on.

2909
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:59,920
And they're like, well, he's he's mentally incapacitated.

2910
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:02,960
We can't execute him if he's mentally incapacitated.

2911
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,080
That's against the law.

2912
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:06,840
So we got to remind him of who he is.

2913
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:10,240
So he remembers everything and admits to being who he is

2914
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:13,880
so that we can execute him again and make it work this time.

2915
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:18,000
So it's these like military officials acting out his crimes,

2916
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,800
like his rapes, like pretending to rape each other.

2917
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:22,840
And like, look, this is what you did.

2918
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:24,560
This is what you did to those girls.

2919
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:26,720
And he's just like, what?

2920
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:29,080
And then like they act out his whole family life.

2921
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:31,720
They like they all like start playing the role of like his dad

2922
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:35,720
and his brothers and his mom and stuff and like trying to get him to remember who he is.

2923
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:39,160
And then like the ghost of his sister or something appears.

2924
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:41,160
I think she's a ghost.

2925
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:45,000
And she says like, yeah, my brother's a murderer or rapist,

2926
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:49,720
but it's Japan's fault because we're Korean and they colonize Korea

2927
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:51,440
and they destroyed our home.

2928
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:55,960
And like it's the only way that my brother could justifiably spill Japanese blood

2929
02:13:56,200 --> 02:14:00,800
as his as he is want to do in vengeance for what you have done to our country.

2930
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:03,480
And it's like, yeah, I guess that's fair.

2931
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:07,480
The movie is 100 percent on the side of this murderer rapist

2932
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:10,720
because Japan did bad things to Korea.

2933
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,640
It's like it's like three fucking hours.

2934
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:20,080
That is a pretty wild movie plot, I got to say.

2935
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:22,040
This is this movie came out in 1968.

2936
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:25,240
That is insane. It's it's the weirdest movie I've ever watched.

2937
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:26,800
Easily.

2938
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,840
It's it's way too long.

2939
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:36,520
Like it takes the like most of the movie to get around to the whole thing

2940
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:39,960
with the sister and like the whole like Korean identity thing.

2941
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:41,080
And like, that's the point.

2942
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:45,480
The point of the movie is supposed to be that like these Japanese officials

2943
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:50,960
are, you know, imperialist dogs who are just enforcing, you know,

2944
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:56,920
they're like violent hegemony over the people and specifically over, you know,

2945
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:01,520
people from another country, Korea, which like who gives them any right to do that, right?

2946
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,800
That's the point of the movie.

2947
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,400
But it doesn't get there until like two thirds of the way through.

2948
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:08,000
And it's most it's like mad captioning

2949
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:13,200
Anagans where these like goofy military officers have to like act out, pretend rapes.

2950
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:15,960
That's like half the movie.

2951
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:16,960
It's so strange.

2952
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:20,320
And it's so hilarious to me that they think it's even worth like,

2953
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:21,640
oh, he doesn't remember who he is.

2954
02:15:21,640 --> 02:15:23,360
So we have to make him or like, why?

2955
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:25,920
Just like, if it was America, they would have just shot him in the head.

2956
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:29,040
Yeah. I mean, I mean, I guess that's like.

2957
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:31,480
I mean, I'm not complaining.

2958
02:15:31,480 --> 02:15:34,280
I just think it's kind of funny like I get where they're coming from.

2959
02:15:34,280 --> 02:15:37,520
Like if you wouldn't want to, like if you made someone mentally incapacitated,

2960
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:41,680
mentally disabled, you made that person mentally disabled, then you were going to execute them

2961
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:43,520
as a mentally disabled. That's pretty fucked up, I got to say.

2962
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:45,640
Like, I mean, I understand where they're coming from.

2963
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:49,600
I don't buy that it would play out like this in real life, but it's, you know,

2964
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:54,840
I understand it's a movie they're they're trying to play up some theater

2965
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:56,640
of the absurd type shit. I totally get that.

2966
02:15:56,640 --> 02:16:00,800
But, you know, it is it is it is a very like that's such like,

2967
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:01,840
how do you even have that?

2968
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,800
Like, who came up with the idea for that for a movie?

2969
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:06,000
You know what I mean? That's what I'm trying to say. That's so wild.

2970
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,200
Yeah. No, I guess I would recommend it.

2971
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:12,800
I feel a little bad to spoil it, but like, I don't know.

2972
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:13,360
It's just bizarre.

2973
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:15,280
It's really bizarre to me that anybody made a movie.

2974
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:18,400
I don't know how much I kind of that was one of those movies.

2975
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:19,840
I think I needed to hear some spoilers,

2976
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:22,360
and otherwise I might have not been willing to check it out, you know,

2977
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:23,840
because I like weird ass movies.

2978
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:27,080
I always enjoy this a nice strange experience.

2979
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:28,880
Yeah, check out this one.

2980
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,760
I don't know. I don't know.

2981
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:34,360
Maybe Japanese cinema in the late 1960s was just like this,

2982
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:36,200
and I'm just not that familiar.

2983
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:39,560
But it's see this one seems like pretty uniquely.

2984
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,240
Bizarre, just in its whole conception,

2985
02:16:43,640 --> 02:16:45,240
just why why would it even exist?

2986
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:47,640
But it does. So, you know, that's something to be celebrated.

2987
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:51,280
OK, so that's it. That's my that's my that's my movies

2988
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:53,680
where nothing happens round up for this week.

2989
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:59,160
Yeah, I hope you guys enjoyed Ben's movie corner.

2990
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:01,600
Yeah, yeah, it's a new segment.

2991
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:03,480
Ellie is our put in a jingle.

2992
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:05,360
Put in a jingle for Ben's movie corner.

2993
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:13,880
What movie is Ben going to watch on Ben's movie corner?

2994
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:17,040
Ben's movie corner.

2995
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:17,800
Thank you.

2996
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:21,080
This will be a segment that comes out once every four years.

2997
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:25,720
When I when I get around to watching another dozen or so movies.

2998
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:28,160
Next time you have a movie day.

2999
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:29,280
Tom, you still awake?

3000
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:30,480
I'm still over here.

3001
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:32,680
You're so quiet. Am I?

3002
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:34,000
You. Oh, you were.

3003
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
You must have been far away from like, you're so distant, Tom.

3004
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,280
Tom, come back. We miss you.

3005
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:41,080
I just caught myself off emotionally to keep myself from getting hurt, you know.

3006
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:46,160
Yeah, Tom was getting too emotionally invested in the movie plots.

3007
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:50,440
Well, what do you guys think of going to voicemails?

3008
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:51,840
Let's do it.

3009
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:53,400
All right, here we go.

3010
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:56,040
I'm going to I'm going to share screen.

3011
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:58,960
Actually, wait, can you guys give me can you guys give me 30 seconds?

3012
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:00,520
And then I'll come back and I'll share speed.

3013
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:02,240
Counties are counting it down right now.

3014
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:05,160
Ellie is our cut this part out.

3015
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:06,840
Ellie is our don't cut this part out.

3016
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:09,360
Let's embarrass Ben.

3017
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:10,240
Yeah, I heard Ben.

3018
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:13,120
He told me that he's a he actually watched movies

3019
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:14,920
that didn't have people talking in them.

3020
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:16,960
And they were just they were just action movies.

3021
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,560
Oh, my God, it's funny you mentioned that

3022
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:20,840
because I watched Robocop for the first time yesterday.

3023
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:22,720
Oh, yeah, really? Yeah.

3024
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:23,600
It's a dope ass movie.

3025
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:24,680
I like these movies.

3026
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:26,840
I didn't want I didn't even bother watching them for so long

3027
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:28,600
because it was just like, oh, it's just like a meme right?

3028
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:30,000
It's like an 80s. Well, that's culture.

3029
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,760
Like I saw it on Family Guy, whatever I get it, I get Robocop.

3030
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:34,240
That's the whole thing has some interesting stuff to it.

3031
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:34,760
You know, it's interesting.

3032
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:37,280
There are so many movies that are like kind of staples of culture

3033
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:38,440
that I've never seen before.

3034
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:41,400
And I just I just got tired of watching half in the bag

3035
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:43,360
and having them reference movies that I'd never seen before.

3036
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:45,920
I'm like, fuck it, I'm making a list of all these like classic movies

3037
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:48,320
that like everybody knows about that I know about, but I never watched.

3038
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:50,520
And I have a bunch of them downloaded

3039
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:52,480
and Robocop is the first one I decided to watch.

3040
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:54,440
And it was pretty cool.

3041
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:57,240
It feels good to bang some of those like movies

3042
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:59,760
that you've been meaning to watch for so long, like off.

3043
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:01,920
There's some movies I never even thought I would watch

3044
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:04,080
because I just like I don't need to watch this movie.

3045
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:05,480
I just got it all through cultural.

3046
02:19:05,480 --> 02:19:07,440
I remember friends worth watching.

3047
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:10,240
I remember friends in like second grade

3048
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:13,000
who were fans of Robocop who watched Robocop and like

3049
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:16,800
I was just too busy watching like Japanese bootleg Godzilla movies

3050
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,320
to like watch popular movies at the time, I guess.

3051
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:21,960
And so there's like this huge gap in my cultural knowledge.

3052
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:26,080
I was like weirdly dismissive of Robocop because I just was like, OK,

3053
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:27,360
it's fucking copies of Robocop.

3054
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:28,320
What's the big fucking deal?

3055
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:30,000
I've seen way cooler shit than that.

3056
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,960
But it actually is a lot.

3057
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:33,080
There's a lot more to it than that.

3058
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:35,800
This whole time I can't believe you were going to let me do my whole movie

3059
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:38,640
round up and not mention that you watched Robocop for the first time.

3060
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,280
Yeah, well, I was going to I was going to wait

3061
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:42,880
until you were done with your movie stuff,

3062
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:44,040
but it took longer than I thought.

3063
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:45,920
So I was like, I have the moments past, but then you left.

3064
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:47,920
And I was like, all right, here's a window to bring it out.

3065
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:49,320
The moment returned.

3066
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:51,520
I probably was I respect the overall

3067
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:54,320
slow of the podcast more than getting in my personal points.

3068
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:58,120
I think I don't feel if I've ever actually watched Robocop all the way through.

3069
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:00,720
I feel like I saw like some of it as a kid, maybe.

3070
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:05,240
And yeah, red, red letter media talk about it a whole bunch.

3071
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:06,040
Got a lot.

3072
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:08,280
I think that I'm going to watch one every Friday.

3073
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,040
I'm going to watch Blade Runner next.

3074
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:12,080
I think I've never seen Blade Runner either.

3075
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:14,360
I enjoy I like Blade Runner.

3076
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:16,680
It's one of those movies where I mean, I'm not going to spoil anything,

3077
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:20,120
but like I definitely get where the people who watch it and they're like,

3078
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:21,560
what's the big fucking deal?

3079
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:26,360
Like if you're expecting some sort of super epic, bombastic thing,

3080
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:29,600
it's a little slower, a little more contemplative is all I'll say.

3081
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:31,120
I'm I'm totally fine with that.

3082
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:33,200
So that's why I think I'll probably I'll probably enjoy it.

3083
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:36,280
But even if I don't enjoy it, just don't watch the director's cut,

3084
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:38,920
which don't watch everyone.

3085
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:39,760
Everyone's been telling me.

3086
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:42,400
My understanding was to watch the director.

3087
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:44,600
Wait, which one's the one with the narration?

3088
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:46,600
There's like five different cuts as all.

3089
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:47,600
There's the director's cut.

3090
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:48,800
There's the final cut.

3091
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:51,080
There's the theatrical cut.

3092
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:52,120
There's like different versions.

3093
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:56,000
I believe the totally the not there's definitely legal download

3094
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,160
I got was for the final cut.

3095
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:00,480
I think that's OK.

3096
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:04,480
It I there might be something you don't my understanding is that's fine.

3097
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:08,160
The theatrical cut leaves a lot of things out that.

3098
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:12,360
Make sure the only thing I say is don't watch the original theatrical cuts.

3099
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:13,440
That's the only one I would say.

3100
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:14,400
Pretty sure everything else is fine.

3101
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:17,560
So there's a Wikipedia page that's just going over the differences

3102
02:21:17,560 --> 02:21:19,880
in the versions of Blade Runner, which is pretty awesome.

3103
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:23,280
Yeah, I was looking at an article that like broke down the differences,

3104
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:26,880
but it was an article written from the perspective of having already seen the movie.

3105
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:27,640
So I didn't read it.

3106
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:30,080
Yeah, it's actually kind of hard to explain the differences

3107
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:31,000
without getting in a spoiler.

3108
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,040
So that's why I'm like trying to not really get into it.

3109
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:34,560
I'm just going to watch the one I have.

3110
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:35,920
You'll be fine. You'll you'll be fine.

3111
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:37,400
You know, it's not going to like ruin it.

3112
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:40,000
If you watch, I mean, plenty of people watch the theatrical version

3113
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
first and end up liking it still. So who knows?

3114
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:43,520
I already know a lot about the movie

3115
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:47,040
through cultural osmosis, so I'm sure it won't be a big deal one way or the other.

3116
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:49,160
But I just want to watch it to say that I have.

3117
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:51,360
And you can watch the the sequel that came out.

3118
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:54,040
Yeah, that'll be interesting.

3119
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:55,800
I can't. I still can't believe they made a sequel.

3120
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:59,800
I thought it was such a strange like I mean, I guess it's not even that strange.

3121
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:02,440
Hollywood has been a whole fucking kick of making these sequels

3122
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:04,320
twenty, thirty years after the fact.

3123
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:07,640
But I don't know, it just never seemed like one that needed a sequel to me.

3124
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:08,680
But hey, it wasn't that bad.

3125
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:12,360
I know franchise no franchise left on milk, as Hollywood would say.

3126
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,880
Quite literally, I mean, like we're approaching like critical

3127
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:19,560
diminishing returns of like every franchise has been rebooted or going to

3128
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:21,760
start rebooting the fucking reboots.

3129
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:24,560
I was watching half in the bag and they were talking about like a couple of years

3130
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:26,240
ago, they tried to reboot chips.

3131
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:27,920
And I was like, yeah, that's ridiculous.

3132
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:30,400
And they were just making fun of why you would ever reboot that.

3133
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:32,880
And it's like Hollywood is just that desperate, I guess.

3134
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:37,360
It's because some fucking executive in Hollywood is like, yeah, I've heard of

3135
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:39,840
chips everywhere. Everybody knows chips is right.

3136
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:41,600
Everybody in my age knows what chips is.

3137
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:44,400
Kids will be happy to go see chips.

3138
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:45,640
It was like, have you ever heard of chips?

3139
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:49,880
It's like California Highway Patrol Squad or something.

3140
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:50,440
I can't remember.

3141
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:53,480
It's like some boomer show about being a cop on a highway.

3142
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:55,480
It sucks, as far as I know.

3143
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:59,400
Dude, all TV was like bad before nineteen, like ninety four.

3144
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:00,160
Nineteen, I don't know.

3145
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:02,480
I guess this whenever the Simpsons started coming on the air,

3146
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:05,880
pretty much all TV before that was dog shit, at least American TV.

3147
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:10,120
Yeah, I've never I've never watched TV in my fucking life.

3148
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:14,360
You're missing out on probably, you know, you may miss some cultural things,

3149
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:17,880
but I don't know. Yeah, just stick to movies, be a movie guy.

3150
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:21,880
I guess I have to be a movie guy now.

3151
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:23,880
I guess I have to be a chamber play guy now.

3152
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:28,560
I should be Ben. Ben, what if we what if we start a spinoff podcast

3153
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:32,360
that's just about talking about movies about sitting in a room?

3154
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:35,040
And the podcast is like two guys sitting in a room,

3155
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:37,680
talk about movies about guys sitting in a room.

3156
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:40,640
That's no good, but you could make instead of the podcast.

3157
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:41,960
You should make a full on movie.

3158
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:44,560
That's a movie about guys talking about like my dinner.

3159
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,720
Well, community already had a big parody episode

3160
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:49,600
that was like a parody. We have to fight and kill content.

3161
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:52,560
If we can get more subs than content, the podcast will be a success.

3162
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:55,000
Uh, uh,

3163
02:23:56,440 --> 02:24:02,600
anything, I'll do anything to to undercut and destroy our our our friends.

3164
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:05,360
Well, you know what they say?

3165
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:06,960
Healthy competition is good.

3166
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:09,200
So if you have your rival shows going at it,

3167
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:11,360
you should have a rival show where it's like

3168
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:13,520
you ostensibly about talking about movies.

3169
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:16,960
But the entire show is nothing but just taking potshots of content.

3170
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:19,440
Yeah, that's the kind of show I can get behind.

3171
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:21,360
Just a flimsy excuse.

3172
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:27,760
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'll I'll I'll make I'll do a movie podcast.

3173
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:29,520
I would I'm down to do a movie podcast.

3174
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:32,440
You I was I got jealous of you last episode, Tom,

3175
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:35,040
talking about doing your Godzilla podcast.

3176
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:37,680
I'm like, why can't I have that?

3177
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,760
You know, what I do?

3178
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:41,000
What did I do?

3179
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Podcasts are high returns, low investment.

3180
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,880
So I you can do a million of them and you just got nothing but time.

3181
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:50,160
Fuck yeah.

3182
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:52,120
OK, it's it's a deal.

3183
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:53,920
All right, we'll hash that out.

3184
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:55,640
All right, we've we figured it.

3185
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:59,880
We figured something finally, finally, something happened on this podcast.

3186
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:05,320
God, I'm glad the two hours of nothing of dead air led up to this moment.

3187
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:07,320
We're two and a half hours in.

3188
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:08,400
Oh, that reminds.

3189
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:10,760
Yeah, let's let's go to voicemails.

3190
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:12,640
I will share my screen.

3191
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:13,640
I hope this works.

3192
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:18,640
We're trying a new method today because of our guest.

3193
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:22,800
If it doesn't work, I did I did download that zip file.

3194
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,240
So it's nothing in the world.

3195
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:26,360
Yeah, that would that would work.

3196
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:29,680
But it's probably more convenient to just do it this way.

3197
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:31,640
Yeah, probably is.

3198
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:34,200
Oh, wait, look at my screen.

3199
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:36,200
Your screen's like winging out and I kind of like.

3200
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:38,280
Yeah, it looks like it's looking at a million different.

3201
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:40,320
My I've seen I've seen this happen before.

3202
02:25:40,320 --> 02:25:41,480
I don't know why it happens.

3203
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:43,680
But this is like this is not the first time.

3204
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:46,400
I guess it doesn't matter.

3205
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:48,960
It's just about the audio.

3206
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Hold on.

3207
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,560
Voice and video.

3208
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:56,440
You're your Twitter page was like frozen on like some guy

3209
02:25:56,760 --> 02:25:59,000
like kissing some girl on a cheek.

3210
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,200
And now there's like all these little cursors around.

3211
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,360
It looks like one of those like

3212
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:04,680
clingy gifts from like early 2001.

3213
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:06,760
No, I can see it.

3214
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:09,280
Yeah, I see exactly what you're talking about.

3215
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,000
I don't know.

3216
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,280
I don't know who those people are.

3217
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:14,560
How many of these voice ones

3218
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:15,960
are going to have to listen to like this?

3219
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:18,000
Oh, a whole bunch.

3220
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:18,920
Don't worry.

3221
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:19,800
Don't worry about it.

3222
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:23,920
OK, can you can you see what I'm looking at?

3223
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:28,400
No, it's still it's still still speaking out a nightmare.

3224
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:30,080
All right, here we go.

3225
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:33,600
First one is called seething peasants.

3226
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:36,760
Stay seething, Nate heads.

3227
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:41,120
Stay seething over eight weeks since his last upload.

3228
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,920
Fucking Lamau.

3229
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:48,160
This guy, the voice voicemail God is no fan of Nate Vestman.

3230
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:51,360
And he he makes, you know, you know,

3231
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:54,840
he uses his God given right to express that in the voicemails.

3232
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:57,040
It's fair.

3233
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:59,440
I'll defend to the death is right to say it.

3234
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:01,720
I think Nate's lucky to have his own personal troll.

3235
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,880
Next one, dolphin question.

3236
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:08,120
What? I didn't hear it.

3237
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:10,080
I don't know if that was bad audio quality.

3238
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:11,800
Was that a dolphin?

3239
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:13,320
Let me let me try again.

3240
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:19,040
Christian Christian Christian is a real

3241
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:27,840
character in Sonic Christian is a real character in Sonic something something.

3242
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:30,720
Didn't they like parody him in Sonic Boom?

3243
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:33,400
That's what I was thinking, sort of.

3244
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:37,120
Yeah, there's like an Ardvark who kind of looks like Chris.

3245
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:39,600
Yes, they made a little arms joke.

3246
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:42,000
Yeah, they made a blue arms joke, too.

3247
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:42,760
That's right.

3248
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:47,920
It's pretty like it's it's just enough of a Chris Chan parody

3249
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:50,560
where it's definitely Chris Chan, but like it was vague enough

3250
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:52,760
where they could keep plausible deniability.

3251
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:56,000
Yeah, it could just be any like weird fan.

3252
02:27:56,200 --> 02:28:00,800
Yeah, it's like I could I could see theoretically see like just it does

3253
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:04,240
as spoof of the concept of weird fandom just coincidentally happens to line up

3254
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:06,080
exactly for the portrayal of Chris. Yeah.

3255
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:09,400
It's it seemed kind of deliberate, though.

3256
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:12,040
The blue arms thing was so on point.

3257
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:13,280
That wasn't a Chris Chan reference.

3258
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:15,160
I would be I would be shocked.

3259
02:28:15,160 --> 02:28:17,160
Well, OK.

3260
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:19,960
Devil's advocate here.

3261
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,040
Nate's not here, so I got to play devil's advocate.

3262
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:23,040
Oh, no.

3263
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:26,760
Was was the blue arms thing something that other people were mad about

3264
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:29,840
and Chris just like took it and ran with it further than anyone else?

3265
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:30,960
Yeah, see, exactly.

3266
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:33,920
That's just another case of like it is enough plausible deniability where

3267
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:36,840
there's like I don't think you could prove in a court of law this absolutely

3268
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:38,840
had to be inspired by Chris Chan.

3269
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:44,000
But like I'm pretty sure by far you are the most vocal complaining.

3270
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:47,240
A lot of people saw it and immediately thought that's Chris.

3271
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:51,560
So yeah, I think it was a deliberate reference.

3272
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:52,400
Yeah, I don't know.

3273
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:53,320
I didn't write the show.

3274
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:54,840
It could it could it could have been.

3275
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:58,400
I think maybe yeah, we would we'd have to like ask the writers or something.

3276
02:28:58,400 --> 02:29:01,520
And they would probably deny it even then if you ask them publicly.

3277
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:02,280
Yeah, they're going to die.

3278
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:03,880
And you'd have to corner them privately.

3279
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:06,120
And then then what you're going to leak your their private information

3280
02:29:06,120 --> 02:29:08,200
that they shared with you. So we'll just yeah.

3281
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:13,160
Next one. Play this one.

3282
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:14,560
OK, there was nothing in it.

3283
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:16,400
It was empty. It was silent.

3284
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:19,040
You just got trolled.

3285
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:20,440
All right, next one.

3286
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:23,320
Next one, I only get 15 seconds.

3287
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:25,040
This is all your fault.

3288
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:26,800
It's not my fault.

3289
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:29,680
I don't expect you to play literally any of my voice mails.

3290
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:33,320
But if you do, then fuck you because you fuck you failed.

3291
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:35,640
These suck.

3292
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:37,360
Well, he's not wrong.

3293
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:40,040
Man, these voicemails have been fucking incredible this week.

3294
02:29:40,040 --> 02:29:41,960
Did you guys do you only like?

3295
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:45,360
Do you deliberately say if you're a fan of the show, do not send a voicemail.

3296
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:47,080
But if you hate the show, please send in.

3297
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:49,160
No, it just kind of works out that way.

3298
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:51,280
Well, Ben Ben says it in so many words

3299
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:54,120
because he's made it that like he'll play every voicemail now

3300
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:55,560
and has made that public knowledge.

3301
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:59,800
So if you hate the show and you want to say it and have it be in the show,

3302
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:01,520
you have carte blanche to do so.

3303
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:04,240
We will we will platform you.

3304
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:07,040
We will platform your hate speech, specifically hate speech

3305
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:10,240
about how much you hate that dedication of freedom of speech.

3306
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:12,640
Yeah, absolutely.

3307
02:30:12,640 --> 02:30:17,000
Every podcast, every section world renowned free speech defender.

3308
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:20,360
Don't don't tread on me.

3309
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:23,480
Next one, please don't play my voicemails.

3310
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,200
Don't play any of mine.

3311
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,400
Please don't play.

3312
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:28,800
What? I'm stop.

3313
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,680
I think these all might be from the same guy.

3314
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:34,600
We can't tell if the voicemail sounds like shit

3315
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:37,760
or if it's just that I'm listening in it through a stream from your speakers.

3316
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:39,560
No, it sounds really bad to me.

3317
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:41,600
It's not making it any better, though.

3318
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:45,080
Yeah, yeah, we're getting like multiple levels of the shit audio.

3319
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:48,600
All right, we've got another one called I only get 15 seconds.

3320
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:51,000
So let's here we go.

3321
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,240
Literally, don't play any of the voicemails

3322
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:55,200
that were sent in the past four hours.

3323
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:57,480
They are all mine and they're all shit, please.

3324
02:30:58,080 --> 02:30:59,800
You suck and your timing suck.

3325
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:02,160
I only have 15 minutes. Suck you. Fuck you.

3326
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:02,960
Why? Why?

3327
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:06,480
He's mad at you for playing his voicemail that he sent.

3328
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:09,880
He's continuing the same.

3329
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:12,040
What a great bit.

3330
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:16,720
This is sort of blowing my mind like I'm struggling to comprehend this.

3331
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:19,680
We have to deal with this kind of stupidity every week.

3332
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:23,080
This is worse than usual, I will say.

3333
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:26,000
All right, next one.

3334
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,840
After binging all the PCP episodes.

3335
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:32,440
Fuck this shit.

3336
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:34,040
I'm out.

3337
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:35,040
Fuck this shit.

3338
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:36,640
I'm out of nothing.

3339
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:38,120
Don't mind me.

3340
02:31:38,120 --> 02:31:40,440
I'm just grab my stuff and leave.

3341
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:41,840
Excuse me, please.

3342
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:42,840
Fuck this shit.

3343
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:43,520
I'm out.

3344
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:45,440
Nope. Fuck this shit.

3345
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:47,560
I'm out. All right, then.

3346
02:31:47,560 --> 02:31:49,600
I don't know what the fuck just happened.

3347
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,200
But I don't really care.

3348
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:53,920
I don't understand the context.

3349
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:58,760
He he he binged the entire podcast and now he's out.

3350
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:00,400
He didn't.

3351
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:03,520
He liked it enough to listen to every single episode

3352
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:08,240
and send in a voicemail and presumably listen to this one to hear his voicemail.

3353
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:09,600
But he's out.

3354
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:10,440
What does that mean?

3355
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:14,120
He's about to go by a no-nate-no-watch-see-you-next-review-share-you.

3356
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:17,920
Um, uh, it, um.

3357
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:20,880
I don't fuck.

3358
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:22,040
I don't fucking know.

3359
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:24,960
I had something I was going to say, but I didn't I didn't say it in time.

3360
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,040
And now it's over.

3361
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:28,160
The moment has passed.

3362
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:30,760
Is that an original song?

3363
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:32,360
That's that's like an internet thing.

3364
02:32:32,360 --> 02:32:36,280
There's like a I've heard that as like a as a Twitter reply song.

3365
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:37,440
It's like a stick to your guy.

3366
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:38,560
I don't know the origin, though.

3367
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:39,560
No, I don't know.

3368
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:45,640
Copyright struck on last week's episode because of what because of the clip of the dictator.

3369
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:48,840
Oh, my God, really?

3370
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:50,000
Yeah, yeah.

3371
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,440
Wait, that's that's not in the public domain.

3372
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:54,800
Uh, not.

3373
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:55,840
That's so old.

3374
02:32:55,840 --> 02:33:00,880
Not according to, I mean, maybe I can maybe I can look up who know who got the strike.

3375
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:02,840
But that's pretty wild.

3376
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:04,480
Yeah, I was going to say, like, what the fuck?

3377
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:08,160
You can always counterclaim, but who knows if that's not even worth it.

3378
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:09,520
Yeah, I lost all the money.

3379
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:12,160
It's so like, God, I fucking hate trying to deal with you.

3380
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:14,600
I know you lost the five dollars that episode was going to make us.

3381
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:17,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

3382
02:33:17,160 --> 02:33:23,280
Okay, it was a video and then yeah, on squad Zilla and Harry Potter,

3383
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:27,040
monetization, ineligible copyright claims, see details.

3384
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:33,240
And it is, um, yeah, content used, final speech from the great dictator, Charlie Chaplin.

3385
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:37,920
Copyright owner has monetized it in some territories.

3386
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:42,360
Copyright owner is Merlin, idle distribution.

3387
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:46,360
Somehow I doubt they actually own the copyright for that.

3388
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:47,720
And they're probably gaming the system.

3389
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:48,520
It's so stupid.

3390
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:52,240
Yeah, yeah, people just submit straight up false copyright claims.

3391
02:33:52,280 --> 02:33:53,240
It's absolutely bullshit.

3392
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:56,680
And even when it's like working as intended, like my latest video is blocked

3393
02:33:56,680 --> 02:34:00,080
in England and or the UK, rather, and Ireland.

3394
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:03,320
And because of a clip from an American TV show, but Channel four happens

3395
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:05,440
to license that show there, so it's blocked there.

3396
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:05,800
I don't know.

3397
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:06,720
It's fucking stupid.

3398
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:08,120
See, they see.

3399
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:11,720
Okay.

3400
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:13,200
Move moving on.

3401
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,600
This one is called free the nipple logic.

3402
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:17,280
Oh, God.

3403
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,160
It's a minute 30.

3404
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:24,920
Okay, guys, so a couple of episodes ago, you guys were talking about some guy

3405
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:29,480
that was saying that we shouldn't feel the nipple for any reason or whatever.

3406
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:34,120
You guys gave your reasons of why he was dumb or wrong, right?

3407
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:36,880
And what you said was technically right.

3408
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:38,840
It's actually right.

3409
02:34:38,840 --> 02:34:43,920
But the same logic that you were guys saying that we only think the way we do

3410
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:50,760
about boobs or whatever is because society says so.

3411
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:55,320
Well, the same way it can be applied to if I were to say that I want to show

3412
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:56,760
my dick and balls to everyone.

3413
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:00,760
And it's literally the same because, well, you can say that, oh, well,

3414
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,880
dick and balls are different because they are reproductive organ.

3415
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:06,080
You use it for sex or whatever.

3416
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:06,760
Doesn't matter.

3417
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:15,640
Thing is that even if that's true, a dick and balls is just a body organ.

3418
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:18,760
It's part of my body, just as boobs are on women.

3419
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:27,600
So if I cannot show my dick and balls because women would be obviously would

3420
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:33,320
not like that, we can also say that we don't want women to show their

3421
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:34,600
boobs because we don't like it.

3422
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:36,080
And that's really the only reason.

3423
02:35:36,360 --> 02:35:43,640
And you guys, well, you guys were saying it's true, but it doesn't matter.

3424
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:44,720
Doesn't matter.

3425
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:48,480
The only reason of why we shouldn't free the vote is because we don't want to.

3426
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:53,360
I thought the whole Free the Nipple thing was about like breastfeeding.

3427
02:35:53,360 --> 02:35:54,920
I mean, I don't understand his argument.

3428
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:57,640
You don't see guys walking around with little babies suckling at their

3429
02:35:57,640 --> 02:35:58,600
dicks out in public.

3430
02:35:58,600 --> 02:35:59,400
I should hope not.

3431
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:03,640
Yeah, I guess, well, I mean, it's the Free the Nipple thing.

3432
02:36:03,640 --> 02:36:04,720
It's partially about breastfeeding.

3433
02:36:04,760 --> 02:36:08,920
It's also just partially about like, you know, is it illegal to expose your

3434
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:09,920
nipple generally?

3435
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:16,120
It is a double standard between males and women.

3436
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:18,560
Whether you like it or not, there's a full on double standard.

3437
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,480
Yeah, I mean, is it?

3438
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:23,440
I don't know if it's hypocritical if you just like, well, we should just why?

3439
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:27,120
Yeah, we should have this apply the same standards to one and the other.

3440
02:36:27,440 --> 02:36:28,680
You don't show both.

3441
02:36:28,680 --> 02:36:30,320
Just don't show their reproductive organs.

3442
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:31,080
I think you can make a.

3443
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:31,760
There you go.

3444
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:34,320
I think there's like a difference.

3445
02:36:34,320 --> 02:36:37,160
Like, yes, the reproductive organs is a broad term.

3446
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:41,360
Like, I think cock and balls is like, like a little different than boobs.

3447
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:41,720
I don't know.

3448
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:42,280
I don't know.

3449
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:47,480
Yeah, what we're saying, like, OK, like, yeah, they're all just body parts.

3450
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:50,320
But if you, yeah, like, yeah, they're different.

3451
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:53,280
It's different because like, because men can show their fucking nipples.

3452
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:55,360
And yeah, it's an it's an asymmetry.

3453
02:36:55,360 --> 02:36:57,480
Just, I don't know, we can hide.

3454
02:36:57,480 --> 02:36:59,760
We can we can cover up the nipple as much as we want.

3455
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:04,920
I'm just against it being illegal, especially in a way, especially in a

3456
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:08,480
in a way that's like arrested for having their tits out as fucked.

3457
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,080
That's not that everyone should be showing the nipples all the time or has to.

3458
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:15,720
I just think everything should be legal.

3459
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:19,880
Yeah, the idea that it's a crime is like fucked.

3460
02:37:19,880 --> 02:37:25,040
Like, I get that it's like can still be like socially faux pas for tits to just be hang.

3461
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:26,720
I mean, I wouldn't mind if women did that.

3462
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:29,560
But I can understand that that's like, you know, a social faux pas.

3463
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:32,360
But yeah, it's like a criminal thing.

3464
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:33,680
That's why people are upset about it.

3465
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:38,880
Like, that's what I think should probably change and also make, you know, I don't know.

3466
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:43,520
People should probably not be shitty to people that are like breastfeeding in public.

3467
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:46,000
Like, I shouldn't do that either.

3468
02:37:46,520 --> 02:37:47,600
That should be a crime.

3469
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:50,160
Harassing people that are breastfeeding should be a crime.

3470
02:37:51,240 --> 02:37:53,400
So everything should be illegal.

3471
02:37:53,400 --> 02:37:57,040
Are there are there like really men's right activists out there going women shouldn't

3472
02:37:57,040 --> 02:37:58,320
be allowed to breastfeed in public?

3473
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:00,360
Is it men's right or I don't know.

3474
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:04,320
Is it? I just I'm trying to figure this out.

3475
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:08,520
So I'm not making any I'm not declaring that I'm just like, who who's who's out there

3476
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:10,400
against this? I don't know.

3477
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:17,080
Sure, this is some some like some like pure pure tins with like weird reactionary

3478
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:21,400
politics that are just like want to fucking that want to fuck it.

3479
02:38:21,400 --> 02:38:23,160
Hey, don't tread on me, man.

3480
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:24,280
No step on snack.

3481
02:38:24,280 --> 02:38:25,280
All right.

3482
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:29,600
It's breastfeeding my child in public doesn't violate the nonaggression principle.

3483
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:31,960
Is he pro free speech?

3484
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:36,120
Like he wants the cock and balls to be able to be hung out or is he saying no?

3485
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:38,200
They shouldn't point out our hypocrisy.

3486
02:38:38,200 --> 02:38:39,800
I think that's what this is about.

3487
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:43,040
But there's another half of it, so he'll continue so we can find out.

3488
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:45,320
Oh, boy.

3489
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:49,200
And just in case you're going to say that, well, then the only thing that we need to

3490
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:53,000
do is that we need to stop thinking of boobs that way.

3491
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:56,920
Well, it's just a continuation of what I was saying before.

3492
02:38:57,240 --> 02:39:04,200
Then I just can say, well, you can you have to tell all women that it's irrational

3493
02:39:04,200 --> 02:39:08,920
for them to think that them seeing my fucking dick and balls when I'm talking

3494
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:12,920
to them, I'm just swinging it, swinging it, swinging it like a motherfucker,

3495
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:14,600
like an elephant.

3496
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:19,400
It's stupid because even if I'm doing it, it's it's just society that is telling

3497
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:20,240
them that is wrong.

3498
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:22,280
It's technically there's nothing wrong with that.

3499
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:24,880
So we live in a society in that case.

3500
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:29,160
If you were a woman swinging my balls, I would appreciate if you guys told Cassie

3501
02:39:29,160 --> 02:39:33,400
about this because I'm interested in what a woman would say.

3502
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:35,600
He wants us to tell.

3503
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:38,480
So he wants to give you and your own opinions.

3504
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:42,440
The worst part about the podcast is that you all three.

3505
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:46,320
I mean, I appreciate that you guys are holding the fort or whatever.

3506
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:52,680
But if you guys all think the same things and there's no one saying that you are

3507
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:59,000
stupid beside the commenters, the podcast gets worse because it's only like

3508
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:00,360
a echo chamber.

3509
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:02,200
You guys need other opinions.

3510
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:05,720
So stop saying shit that you guys don't know.

3511
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:07,200
You guys are both stupid.

3512
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:07,840
Fuck you.

3513
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:08,560
That's fair.

3514
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:12,000
I can't tell how genuinely mad this guy is.

3515
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:17,160
I can't tell how much of that is a joke and how much is he is actually annoyed.

3516
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:18,720
Yeah, I don't know.

3517
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:21,960
There was the whole thing was a joke that was funny in this when he's talking

3518
02:40:21,960 --> 02:40:22,880
about the cock and balls.

3519
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:24,160
But yeah, you never know.

3520
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:29,400
What I mean, I don't know.

3521
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:31,800
You've got to draw the line somewhere, right?

3522
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:34,560
It's just should be symmetrical.

3523
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:37,680
At the very at the very least, we can make our lives.

3524
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:39,760
I would personally and that seems fair.

3525
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:44,600
I would really like to apologize to that guy for my my part in bringing down

3526
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:47,240
this podcast by making it an echo chamber.

3527
02:40:47,240 --> 02:40:49,440
It's for being back at us.

3528
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,800
What a fucking joke.

3529
02:40:52,680 --> 02:40:54,000
We got to get some real.

3530
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,960
We got to get some real fuckers on this show.

3531
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:59,720
We got to get some real like men's rights guys on here.

3532
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:02,640
We got to get some real like a full on debate.

3533
02:41:02,640 --> 02:41:05,000
I get some real fuckers.

3534
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,480
Then I'll have a real discussion.

3535
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:12,280
When you when you think about it, if like the the contention is that like, oh,

3536
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:14,960
it's an echo chamber now because everybody isn't fighting.

3537
02:41:15,320 --> 02:41:18,760
But then before Nate stopped coming on, the problem was, oh, God,

3538
02:41:18,760 --> 02:41:21,280
they need to stop talking about politics and fighting all the time.

3539
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:23,160
I really have to ask, what are these people?

3540
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:25,960
Well, it's probably, yeah, I mean, sure.

3541
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:30,240
One people, some people just want to be able to swing their cock and balls

3542
02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:34,000
around and not listen to an echo chamber, you know, who could blame them?

3543
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:35,000
That's a fair enough.

3544
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:39,440
OK, the next one is called it's flat dummy.

3545
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:41,200
And I hope he's talking about the earth.

3546
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:46,160
Look, look, look, look.

3547
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:48,600
You have no proof that the earth isn't flat.

3548
02:41:49,720 --> 02:41:52,240
The earth. Have you ever been to space?

3549
02:41:52,400 --> 02:41:54,680
No. All right.

3550
02:41:54,680 --> 02:41:55,960
Have you done the math?

3551
02:41:55,960 --> 02:41:58,520
Have you calculated that the earth isn't flat?

3552
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:01,760
No. OK, then how do you know it's not flat?

3553
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:06,480
Do you have a belief, a belief in people who are smarter than you?

3554
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:09,120
Dare I say it? Faith?

3555
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,680
Are you a faithful person?

3556
02:42:12,680 --> 02:42:14,600
Is that it? Mr.

3557
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:17,200
Atheist Professor.

3558
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:20,160
And do you believe in the sciences?

3559
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:22,680
Who's the atheist professor?

3560
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:24,800
I don't know what to say.

3561
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:26,560
Did I mention?

3562
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:27,880
Well, I'm convinced, honestly.

3563
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:29,960
I mean, the earth is flat now.

3564
02:42:29,960 --> 02:42:33,120
I mean, do you have any proof that the earth is flat?

3565
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:36,680
Have you personally gone to the edge of the world and seen the ice wall?

3566
02:42:36,880 --> 02:42:38,120
Did you do the math?

3567
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:41,800
You're just taking it on faith of the people who post videos to YouTube

3568
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:44,320
after like snorting cocaine, who believe this?

3569
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:46,680
Just use your eyes, man. Open your eyes.

3570
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:48,400
Can you see the curvature?

3571
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:52,600
No, you can't see that mean that's like proof of the round earth stacks of books,

3572
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:54,240
proof of the flat earth.

3573
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:56,840
It's just your eyes.

3574
02:42:56,920 --> 02:42:59,720
The the dimension on the show,

3575
02:42:59,720 --> 02:43:03,480
the video that just came out in Uendo studios, not in Uendo studios,

3576
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:06,440
folding ideas just dropped a video in search of a flat earth.

3577
02:43:06,440 --> 02:43:07,160
Yeah, that was a good one.

3578
02:43:07,160 --> 02:43:08,760
We folded into the QAnon shit.

3579
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:10,160
That was interesting. I like that.

3580
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:11,280
I love that. Yeah.

3581
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:12,880
I've watched it like three times now.

3582
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:15,880
And I've seen it in my rock and roll game, but I haven't watched it.

3583
02:43:16,040 --> 02:43:17,000
It's really good.

3584
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,360
I like his whole channel, but I think that might be his best video.

3585
02:43:19,880 --> 02:43:21,880
It might be his magnum opus.

3586
02:43:21,880 --> 02:43:26,160
But in it, he does an experiment that demonstrates the curve of the earth.

3587
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:28,240
Like, you see it.

3588
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:30,320
It's very interesting how he does it.

3589
02:43:30,320 --> 02:43:37,040
He uses he uses a lake that has like a long stretch of clear water

3590
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:41,760
that he can see over and he knows the distance to the far shore.

3591
02:43:42,440 --> 02:43:45,560
And, you know, and like because it's like several kilometers long,

3592
02:43:45,800 --> 02:43:50,120
that means that the curve of the earth obscures a certain amount of, you know,

3593
02:43:50,120 --> 02:43:54,200
vertical distance and therefore he takes his camera and he puts it on a

3594
02:43:54,320 --> 02:43:56,760
dolly or something and he moves the camera up and down.

3595
02:43:57,040 --> 02:43:58,960
And as the camera moves up and down a few feet,

3596
02:43:58,960 --> 02:44:02,120
you can see that like trees on the opposite shoreline become

3597
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:05,000
occluded by the curvature of the earth and you see it.

3598
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:07,000
And it's really awesome.

3599
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,160
So I guess that's it.

3600
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:11,360
Man, that was all fake video editing.

3601
02:44:11,360 --> 02:44:15,000
It was all just water vapor, liberal bullshit magic.

3602
02:44:16,400 --> 02:44:20,760
It was all just it was all just globe heads doing what globe heads do.

3603
02:44:20,760 --> 02:44:24,200
Falsifying evidence, just it's just the lens distortion.

3604
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:27,840
And if you correct the lens distortion by using a flat line,

3605
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,760
it magically makes everything flat.

3606
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:32,360
Whoa, whoa.

3607
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:37,160
Anyone can curve the earth with a camera's lens,

3608
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:40,760
but you have to use your eyeballs as in you have to literally take your eyeball

3609
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:43,920
out and then capture footage through it and then upload it to the internet.

3610
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:48,840
You know, it makes sense to me.

3611
02:44:49,240 --> 02:44:53,320
Uh, next one is called Where All Good Things Go.

3612
02:44:55,720 --> 02:44:58,720
Konnichiwa, Samurai-sama.

3613
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:03,120
I, uh, I, uh, escape voice jail.

3614
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:03,680
It's impossible.

3615
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:07,360
And now that whole story is over.

3616
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:13,880
And I also released Chris-chan, Beno-san girlfriend.

3617
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:23,520
In fact, Beno-san, you say last week, Samurai in a discolored nototail

3618
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:29,400
and less or Samurai Imposter Beno-san, right?

3619
02:45:29,920 --> 02:45:36,000
Fuck you, Beno-san, you are an Imposter Samurai.

3620
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:41,240
You reader of a fake Imposter Samurai.

3621
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:48,440
You walk with a swagger and a cane like Kevin Spacey in hit film.

3622
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:52,600
Usual suspect and also gay.

3623
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:56,520
Okay, I call it in no more.

3624
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,440
Joke or not funny anymore.

3625
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:04,040
But until you make the wrong time, sayonara.

3626
02:46:05,360 --> 02:46:09,160
The Samurai died on his way back to his home planet.

3627
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:13,680
No, I didn't know how much I loved him until he was gone.

3628
02:46:16,320 --> 02:46:20,040
Well, Ben, do you have anything to say for yourself about your complete lack

3629
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:21,640
of following the Bushido code?

3630
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:27,960
I'm flattered by the comparison to Kevin Spacey and in, in, in usual suspects,

3631
02:46:27,960 --> 02:46:31,040
not in general, I think he's like a rapist or something.

3632
02:46:31,080 --> 02:46:35,320
So only in the context of the movie am I flattered by the comparison.

3633
02:46:39,400 --> 02:46:42,400
Ah, I'm going to miss him.

3634
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:44,760
I'm going to miss that Samurai.

3635
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:47,560
Why did I, why did I even run away from the clan anyway?

3636
02:46:49,320 --> 02:46:50,800
Why did, why did I leave the chorus?

3637
02:46:51,080 --> 02:46:54,160
Fuck, Kurosawa, Kurosaki.

3638
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:55,680
Fuck, what's the name of my clan?

3639
02:46:55,680 --> 02:46:56,840
It's all blurry.

3640
02:46:56,840 --> 02:46:58,680
It's all blurry and indistinct.

3641
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:00,400
The memory is all gone so long.

3642
02:47:00,400 --> 02:47:01,520
You're mixing with one another.

3643
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:03,840
You're forgetting your past, Ben.

3644
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:05,960
Remember who you are.

3645
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:09,680
I mustn't, I mustn't, it's not allowed.

3646
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:13,440
Ben's just screaming up into the voicemail.

3647
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:15,680
No, please, don't leave me.

3648
02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:17,000
Please, don't leave me, no.

3649
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:22,840
What a journey, though, what an adventure.

3650
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:25,200
We've learned a lot.

3651
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:28,280
Well, someone's been impersonating him, so I should probably go kill that.

3652
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:30,760
I should probably go kill the imposter.

3653
02:47:30,760 --> 02:47:31,840
I'll handle it later.

3654
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:32,240
Fair enough.

3655
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:34,840
Next one, fuck being in goal.

3656
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:37,960
All right, lads.

3657
02:47:37,960 --> 02:47:42,960
Last week, one of you knuckleheads said something about most AAA games being weird sports,

3658
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:47,960
which made me think, when I was a kid, here in Joliel Gibbentageland,

3659
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:53,960
the AAA paid-to-win gamehouse service for kids was just straight up going outside and playing football.

3660
02:47:53,960 --> 02:47:56,960
I think things might be better now.

3661
02:47:56,960 --> 02:47:58,960
Football's got one map.

3662
02:47:58,960 --> 02:48:04,960
The character creator is generic, kits and boots, season passes, they cost, like, thousands of pounds,

3663
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:09,960
most of which is like prestige cosmetics, at least with games you don't have to be out in the freezing cold

3664
02:48:09,960 --> 02:48:11,960
and the soundtracks are better.

3665
02:48:11,960 --> 02:48:18,960
And if you're too fat to stand up, you don't just get put in goal like some sort of big hitbox end boss.

3666
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:24,960
I guess what I'm saying is thanks, EA, discuss.

3667
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:30,960
Oh, and the next US mass shooting, Utah.

3668
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:33,960
It rhymes with shootar.

3669
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:37,960
Well, he's calling.

3670
02:48:37,960 --> 02:48:38,960
Can't argue without logic.

3671
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:39,960
That's a solid yes.

3672
02:48:39,960 --> 02:48:40,960
He's calling it.

3673
02:48:40,960 --> 02:48:43,960
That guy's got a nice voice.

3674
02:48:43,960 --> 02:48:44,960
I'm impressed.

3675
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:50,960
I can't tell, because it just sounds like shit over this connection.

3676
02:48:50,960 --> 02:48:53,960
I gotta say, he was pretty convincing.

3677
02:48:53,960 --> 02:48:57,960
I no longer wish to go outside and play football.

3678
02:48:57,960 --> 02:49:00,960
Jerks on you, I've never wanted to do that.

3679
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:04,960
Yeah, but you don't have to pay for that.

3680
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:05,960
No, it's better.

3681
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:07,960
It's better because everyone owns it.

3682
02:49:07,960 --> 02:49:09,960
It's better because nobody owns football.

3683
02:49:09,960 --> 02:49:12,960
Actually, football is a registered trademark of the NFL.

3684
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:13,960
No, he's totally wrong.

3685
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:22,960
He's talking, first of all, he's talking about British football, the bad kind, which nobody owns, because who would even want to own it?

3686
02:49:22,960 --> 02:49:24,960
Fancy a bit of the old footy, then?

3687
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:26,960
A bit of the old footy.

3688
02:49:26,960 --> 02:49:33,960
A bit of a foot of your ass, more like, if you come around here with that.

3689
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:41,960
I mean, I would hate to play soccer, so I guess he's right about that.

3690
02:49:41,960 --> 02:49:47,960
But I also hate video games, so everything sucks.

3691
02:49:49,960 --> 02:49:50,960
Next one.

3692
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:52,960
Nexus is dead.

3693
02:49:53,960 --> 02:49:55,960
Konnichiwa.

3694
02:49:55,960 --> 02:49:57,960
Nah, I'm just kidding.

3695
02:49:57,960 --> 02:49:59,960
It's the imposter.

3696
02:49:59,960 --> 02:50:01,960
What an awful introduction.

3697
02:50:01,960 --> 02:50:03,960
Anyway, hi, PCP.

3698
02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:04,960
I have an announcement.

3699
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:06,960
Nexus is dead.

3700
02:50:06,960 --> 02:50:08,960
Yes, Nexus Mania is gone for good.

3701
02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:11,960
He does not belong to this world anymore.

3702
02:50:11,960 --> 02:50:12,960
Forget about him.

3703
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:15,960
The new shit, the new brand is Kaiju-kun.

3704
02:50:15,960 --> 02:50:18,960
Yes, I rebranded myself as Kaiju-kun.

3705
02:50:18,960 --> 02:50:19,960
Holy shit, incredible.

3706
02:50:19,960 --> 02:50:24,960
Go follow me on Twitter, or patreon.com slash kaiju-kun.

3707
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:27,960
Yes, I made up voicemail just to promote myself.

3708
02:50:27,960 --> 02:50:29,960
I'm a piece of shit.

3709
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:32,960
Have a nice day.

3710
02:50:35,960 --> 02:50:36,960
It's true.

3711
02:50:36,960 --> 02:50:44,960
Nexus Mania is Kaiju-kun on Twitter, and I guess he's got a new Patreon.

3712
02:50:44,960 --> 02:50:52,960
He's built up enough clout to have one promotional voicemail, and that's it.

3713
02:50:52,960 --> 02:50:53,960
Don't miss it.

3714
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:55,960
Don't miss him, alright?

3715
02:50:55,960 --> 02:50:57,960
You gotta respect the hustle.

3716
02:50:57,960 --> 02:50:58,960
I don't know why.

3717
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:01,960
I don't know why he decided to change his handle or whatever.

3718
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:02,960
Yeah, I don't know either.

3719
02:51:02,960 --> 02:51:04,960
More power tune.

3720
02:51:05,960 --> 02:51:11,960
Check out his fucking vaporette in my freaking book that you should have bought already.

3721
02:51:11,960 --> 02:51:13,960
Read his web comics.

3722
02:51:13,960 --> 02:51:15,960
They're fucking great.

3723
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:19,960
Bunny, Wolf, Ruckado Punch, go.

3724
02:51:19,960 --> 02:51:20,960
Do it.

3725
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:21,960
Yeah, Nexus is good.

3726
02:51:21,960 --> 02:51:22,960
He's a good man.

3727
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:23,960
He's a good lad.

3728
02:51:23,960 --> 02:51:26,960
Next on, Commenter Rules.

3729
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:33,960
In ages long ago, there was a fucking podcast called the PCP, and they had an episode called Commenter Rules.

3730
02:51:33,960 --> 02:51:40,960
And there were many rules, but the enforcement of these rules was done by something called banning and muting people.

3731
02:51:40,960 --> 02:51:49,960
And, you know, I think maybe you all should go back to that, because, you know, it's fun as it is going into the comments and seeing, like, a no-nate-no-watch 50 times.

3732
02:51:49,960 --> 02:51:50,960
I think we only need one of those.

3733
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:54,960
So, you know, maybe the core no-nate-no-watch guy can continue.

3734
02:51:54,960 --> 02:52:00,960
But I think, you know, if you're shady in the comments and annoying, you should just be banned censorship-based.

3735
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:02,960
Yeah.

3736
02:52:03,960 --> 02:52:08,960
The core no-nate-no-watch guy is an institution at this point.

3737
02:52:08,960 --> 02:52:12,960
Most other people saying it are, like, putting a little twist on it.

3738
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:14,960
And I think that's funny.

3739
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:16,960
They're, like, they're mixing it up.

3740
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:17,960
They're remixing it.

3741
02:52:17,960 --> 02:52:24,960
I mean, they can downvote and hate comment all they want, but that's just driving up our engagement and making us more powerful.

3742
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:27,960
It's insane how many people do not understand.

3743
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:31,960
Like, if you don't like a video, don't leave a dislike and comment.

3744
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:32,960
You're helping the video.

3745
02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:33,960
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

3746
02:52:33,960 --> 02:52:35,960
I love when people leave those fucking hate comments.

3747
02:52:35,960 --> 02:52:37,960
Why does it work like that?

3748
02:52:37,960 --> 02:52:39,960
I've never understood why they built it that way.

3749
02:52:39,960 --> 02:52:40,960
Okay.

3750
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:41,960
I don't understand either.

3751
02:52:41,960 --> 02:52:47,960
And I've heard from some people that if a video is, like, really heavily disliked, that can affect it in the algorithm.

3752
02:52:47,960 --> 02:52:50,960
I've never ever seen any proof of that, but I've heard from those people.

3753
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:53,960
I think it's because YouTube doesn't care about quality.

3754
02:52:53,960 --> 02:52:54,960
They care about-

3755
02:52:54,960 --> 02:52:56,960
Yeah, they want eyeballs on the videos.

3756
02:52:56,960 --> 02:52:57,960
They don't care if you like it or not.

3757
02:52:57,960 --> 02:53:01,960
So, if someone's hate-watching something and downvoting it, they're gonna share it and be like,

3758
02:53:01,960 --> 02:53:03,960
please hate this as well.

3759
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:05,960
A downvote means you felt strongly about the video.

3760
02:53:05,960 --> 02:53:06,960
Yeah.

3761
02:53:06,960 --> 02:53:07,960
Doesn't this make you mad?

3762
02:53:07,960 --> 02:53:10,960
And then they'll bring more people to watch it and get mad.

3763
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:14,960
And so those videos are great because that's doing exactly what YouTube wants you to do.

3764
02:53:14,960 --> 02:53:15,960
Stay on their website.

3765
02:53:15,960 --> 02:53:17,960
Consume their advertisements.

3766
02:53:17,960 --> 02:53:19,960
That's exactly right.

3767
02:53:19,960 --> 02:53:22,960
And they can't tell the difference between angry comments and good comments.

3768
02:53:22,960 --> 02:53:24,960
So, again, every angry comment you get is just helping.

3769
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:25,960
Exactly.

3770
02:53:25,960 --> 02:53:26,960
It doesn't.

3771
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:27,960
I mean, they're the same fucking thing.

3772
02:53:27,960 --> 02:53:28,960
They're both comments.

3773
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:29,960
Yeah.

3774
02:53:29,960 --> 02:53:30,960
Yeah.

3775
02:53:30,960 --> 02:53:31,960
I don't mind.

3776
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:32,960
I don't know.

3777
02:53:32,960 --> 02:53:33,960
I'm kind of over it.

3778
02:53:33,960 --> 02:53:34,960
I'm just like, yeah.

3779
02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:36,960
Bring on the...

3780
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:38,960
Criticize us in the comments.

3781
02:53:38,960 --> 02:53:39,960
I don't know.

3782
02:53:39,960 --> 02:53:41,960
I don't feel like it's a banable offense.

3783
02:53:41,960 --> 02:53:42,960
Unless you're like...

3784
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:43,960
I don't...

3785
02:53:43,960 --> 02:53:48,960
You have to be like, particularly shitty for me to even consider banning you.

3786
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:52,960
You have to be spouting some real shit.

3787
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:55,960
Now, people are gonna try pushing the envelope just to see where the line is.

3788
02:53:55,960 --> 02:53:58,960
I don't think there's any amount of...

3789
02:53:58,960 --> 02:53:59,960
There's no...

3790
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:03,960
I don't think there's any insult you could levy at me specifically,

3791
02:54:03,960 --> 02:54:05,960
or maybe even at the podcast in general,

3792
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:10,960
that I would be like, that's bad enough that it deserves a ban.

3793
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:14,960
But I mean, if you want to try that out,

3794
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:18,960
see if you can push me.

3795
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:19,960
Okay, next one.

3796
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:23,960
Hardwood, Rich Mahogany.

3797
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:25,960
Woo-hoo!

3798
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:28,960
Benno Sento-san!

3799
02:54:28,960 --> 02:54:35,960
I am a ghost of your samurai who died earlier.

3800
02:54:35,960 --> 02:54:38,960
My revenge for your spirit.

3801
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:40,960
Honto voi someru.

3802
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:41,960
Forever Benno-san.

3803
02:54:41,960 --> 02:54:42,960
He's back!

3804
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:43,960
Mamel!

3805
02:54:43,960 --> 02:54:44,960
Woo-hoo!

3806
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:46,960
Belly spooky.

3807
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:50,960
What an effect a turn of events.

3808
02:54:50,960 --> 02:54:52,960
Woo-hoo!

3809
02:54:52,960 --> 02:54:58,960
But until next time, sayonara!

3810
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:06,960
You might have to call an exorcist for your voicemail box, dude.

3811
02:55:06,960 --> 02:55:09,960
This is such a rich tapestry.

3812
02:55:09,960 --> 02:55:13,960
This is such a rich history for this character.

3813
02:55:13,960 --> 02:55:16,960
He's gone through so much.

3814
02:55:16,960 --> 02:55:20,960
But you know, his vision remains clear and unclouded, consistent.

3815
02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:21,960
Eyes on the prize.

3816
02:55:21,960 --> 02:55:22,960
That's what I love about him.

3817
02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:25,960
That's what I respect him for.

3818
02:55:25,960 --> 02:55:27,960
Okay, incredible.

3819
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:31,960
Ben said, when you worked that out, make another voicemail.

3820
02:55:31,960 --> 02:55:35,960
This is probably about morality or whatever, lol.

3821
02:55:35,960 --> 02:55:40,960
So last week I left an absurdly simplistic model of utilitarianism and voicemail being like,

3822
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:47,960
oh, morality is like, it's good if well-being is increased and bad if well-being is decreased.

3823
02:55:47,960 --> 02:55:57,960
I mean, and obviously there's critique that like, well, yeah, but the world is full of all of these like complicated situations with a lot of context that complicates the decision.

3824
02:55:57,960 --> 02:56:03,960
But I feel like that's a, you know, people have that complaint of utilitarianism a lot.

3825
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:16,960
And I feel like it's a weird complaint because utilitarianism taken to its logical conclusion is just to analyze that context as much as you reasonably can in order to ascertain like the like true utility of each option.

3826
02:56:16,960 --> 02:56:27,960
You have is, you know, to see like, okay, what does like produce like the situation where as many people are as happy as possible.

3827
02:56:27,960 --> 02:56:34,960
And obviously that in itself, as you also said last week is like non-quantifiable because it's all subjective.

3828
02:56:34,960 --> 02:56:41,960
But I think that continues to just emphasize the fact that everything should be looked at case by case.

3829
02:56:41,960 --> 02:56:54,960
The reason why I use this to describe my moral thinking is because it emphasizes that you adapt your moral thinking to each situation instead of adhering to inflexible moral principles.

3830
02:56:54,960 --> 02:57:01,960
Anyway, fuck it titties bro, fuck it boobies.

3831
02:57:01,960 --> 02:57:04,960
That's pretty based.

3832
02:57:04,960 --> 02:57:05,960
I guess.

3833
02:57:05,960 --> 02:57:21,960
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's true that like maybe maybe it's not maybe it's a little unfair to be like, oh, well that that rule you just laid out doesn't like, you know, you can't that doesn't solve every problem by just applying that rule.

3834
02:57:21,960 --> 02:57:29,960
You know, we can't just use this one this one concept in order to determine the proper outcome very given situation.

3835
02:57:29,960 --> 02:57:31,960
Therefore it fails.

3836
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:37,960
You know, maybe the point is like, you know, this yeah, this is a rule of thumb that we should keep in mind.

3837
02:57:37,960 --> 02:57:41,960
But like no one's going to no one's going to have like, oh yeah, here are the rules.

3838
02:57:41,960 --> 02:57:42,960
Here's the formula.

3839
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:45,960
If you follow these rules, you get the morally correct.

3840
02:57:45,960 --> 02:57:56,960
Don't you think that's that's walking back the point though, like if anyone if you said utilitarianism, or considering the utility of a choice is an important factor when making decisions.

3841
02:57:56,960 --> 02:57:59,960
Nobody would argue that point because everybody does that already.

3842
02:57:59,960 --> 02:58:04,960
The reason we mocked that voicemail last week was because it was like utilitarianism is the one and only true way.

3843
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:05,960
It's so simple.

3844
02:58:05,960 --> 02:58:06,960
Duh.

3845
02:58:06,960 --> 02:58:08,960
And our point was, no, it's not.

3846
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:13,960
So like, I don't the idea that we value utility in all of our decisions all the time.

3847
02:58:13,960 --> 02:58:19,960
And so by walking it back and saying like, you use utility to help you figure out your moral dilemmas on a case by case basis.

3848
02:58:19,960 --> 02:58:20,960
Well, no shit.

3849
02:58:20,960 --> 02:58:23,960
That's basic logic that everybody does.

3850
02:58:23,960 --> 02:58:25,960
It is kind of like it's insanely obvious.

3851
02:58:25,960 --> 02:58:27,960
Like, oh, we should just maximize happiness for everyone.

3852
02:58:27,960 --> 02:58:28,960
It's like, yeah, no shit.

3853
02:58:28,960 --> 02:58:30,960
But it's like, I mean, I don't know.

3854
02:58:30,960 --> 02:58:35,960
I don't trust human beings to determine that kind of shit like with utilitarian like type rules.

3855
02:58:35,960 --> 02:58:40,960
So I mean, I'm not a full Kantian, but I'm not saying day ontology needs to be thrown out, you know, like as a baby with a bathwater.

3856
02:58:40,960 --> 02:58:42,960
That's pretty much what we were saying last week.

3857
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:48,960
Was that like, it's the world is more complicated to simply make calculations like that.

3858
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:56,960
That can't even be truly quantified from a human level anyways, because we don't know the repercussions of our actions.

3859
02:58:56,960 --> 02:58:59,960
I would love to maximize happiness, but like, I don't know how.

3860
02:58:59,960 --> 02:59:06,960
And like, I would love to look at everything on a case by case basis, but that's not really feasible, you know.

3861
02:59:07,960 --> 02:59:09,960
Okay, oh wait, I'm going to sneeze.

3862
02:59:09,960 --> 02:59:11,960
Am I going to sneeze? No, never mind.

3863
02:59:11,960 --> 02:59:12,960
False alarm.

3864
02:59:12,960 --> 02:59:13,960
Okay.

3865
02:59:13,960 --> 02:59:16,960
Next up, cross my contribution.

3866
02:59:17,960 --> 02:59:18,960
Nice.

3867
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:22,960
Thanks.

3868
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:23,960
Thank you.

3869
02:59:23,960 --> 02:59:24,960
Thanks.

3870
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:25,960
I appreciate it.

3871
02:59:25,960 --> 02:59:26,960
Pretty based.

3872
02:59:27,960 --> 02:59:28,960
Okay.

3873
02:59:28,960 --> 02:59:29,960
God, I feel so much better now.

3874
02:59:29,960 --> 02:59:31,960
It just brightens my day.

3875
02:59:31,960 --> 02:59:34,960
Every Sunday, I look forward to it.

3876
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:36,960
Next up, Margar.

3877
02:59:39,960 --> 02:59:40,960
Hey, Margar here.

3878
02:59:40,960 --> 02:59:45,960
I bet you guys are probably wondering, where was Margar last week?

3879
02:59:45,960 --> 02:59:47,960
Where was the voicemail?

3880
02:59:47,960 --> 02:59:50,960
I was at work and I forgot to.

3881
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:54,960
But I'm back now, still in prison.

3882
02:59:54,960 --> 02:59:59,960
It's still back and I've kind of gotten over the depression I was in earlier.

3883
02:59:59,960 --> 03:00:03,960
And you know, I'm just kind of like doing my slave labor.

3884
03:00:04,960 --> 03:00:12,960
Although Samurai, Ben St. Sensei, he's here in the voice jail.

3885
03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:18,960
And he's like starting a Yakuza gang and is killing a lot of people.

3886
03:00:18,960 --> 03:00:19,960
He must have gotten tired of that.

3887
03:00:19,960 --> 03:00:21,960
I'm fearing for my life.

3888
03:00:21,960 --> 03:00:22,960
That must have been how we got out.

3889
03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:26,960
The goons were one thing, but this Japanese stuff is too much to handle.

3890
03:00:26,960 --> 03:00:28,960
Please make it stop.

3891
03:00:28,960 --> 03:00:34,960
Well, I mean, he's a spooky ghost now.

3892
03:00:34,960 --> 03:00:35,960
The Yakuza...

3893
03:00:35,960 --> 03:00:38,960
I love the idea that it's like you're in jail and it's like, you can hit the ghost.

3894
03:00:38,960 --> 03:00:42,960
It's like, but this Japanese stuff, it's a little too far for me.

3895
03:00:42,960 --> 03:00:45,960
Being in jail and the ghost and slave labor, that was all fine.

3896
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:50,960
But yeah, this is getting a little too Japanese.

3897
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:55,960
Margar, be a little more open-minded in your confinement.

3898
03:00:55,960 --> 03:01:00,960
I'll send some goons out to do some sensitivity training with you.

3899
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:04,960
I think that's what we could all use a little bit of right about now.

3900
03:01:04,960 --> 03:01:08,960
Next up, if Raiden was raised in Texas...

3901
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:11,960
I'm strong!

3902
03:01:11,960 --> 03:01:16,960
I said my tool was a tool for justice.

3903
03:01:16,960 --> 03:01:18,960
Not to use an anger.

3904
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:21,960
Not to use prevention.

3905
03:01:21,960 --> 03:01:25,960
Now, I'm not that sure.

3906
03:01:25,960 --> 03:01:32,960
And besides, this isn't my sword.

3907
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:34,960
Lance Dance.

3908
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:40,960
Everybody knows he'd say this ain't my sword.

3909
03:01:40,960 --> 03:01:42,960
Illusion Shatter.

3910
03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:44,960
That's a good point.

3911
03:01:44,960 --> 03:01:47,960
You had to be up until that last sentence.

3912
03:01:47,960 --> 03:01:52,960
Yeah, a little tragic misstep. Stumble at the finish line.

3913
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:55,960
I like the voice though, but yeah, I should have changed that line.

3914
03:01:55,960 --> 03:01:58,960
Seven out of ten overall. Good effort.

3915
03:01:58,960 --> 03:02:02,960
It sounds exactly what he probably would sound like.

3916
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:06,960
He would whine like that, I think, nasally.

3917
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:10,960
Next up, Ben SSS.

3918
03:02:10,960 --> 03:02:12,960
Hello, PCP.

3919
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:19,960
It is I, Ben Shapiro, also known as Spicy Salts.

3920
03:02:19,960 --> 03:02:24,960
You see, I did it because I crave to be in your shoes.

3921
03:02:24,960 --> 03:02:28,960
May is the sweetest and kindest girl in the world.

3922
03:02:28,960 --> 03:02:32,960
I imagine she smells like strawberries and love.

3923
03:02:32,960 --> 03:02:36,960
Your house, your girlfriend, your life.

3924
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:38,960
I want to be you.

3925
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:41,960
I crave to be you.

3926
03:02:41,960 --> 03:02:46,960
And for that brief instant, I was inside your house with your girlfriend.

3927
03:02:46,960 --> 03:02:49,960
In that moment, I was you.

3928
03:02:49,960 --> 03:02:51,960
Am I not correct?

3929
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:54,960
And it was beautiful.

3930
03:02:54,960 --> 03:02:57,960
I guess we have to explain this.

3931
03:02:57,960 --> 03:03:00,960
Unfortunately, yeah, I guess we do.

3932
03:03:00,960 --> 03:03:04,960
Do you want to, or should I?

3933
03:03:04,960 --> 03:03:10,960
How does one even begin to tackle this?

3934
03:03:10,960 --> 03:03:17,960
There is there is a person known as Spicy Salts.

3935
03:03:17,960 --> 03:03:22,960
Who's been a a thorn in our side for a while now.

3936
03:03:22,960 --> 03:03:25,960
I think I first found him through I Am Games.

3937
03:03:25,960 --> 03:03:27,960
I think that might have been her.

3938
03:03:27,960 --> 03:03:30,960
It was fine. It seemed mostly fine.

3939
03:03:30,960 --> 03:03:36,960
It was mostly just like a typical kind of like just kind of trollish commenter.

3940
03:03:36,960 --> 03:03:41,960
It seemed to be in relatively good fun, I guess.

3941
03:03:41,960 --> 03:03:42,960
It's just like an annoying person.

3942
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:47,960
Me, me and Digi on I Am Games, when he would message it all the time and say dumb things,

3943
03:03:47,960 --> 03:03:52,960
just pegged him as like, this is a kid, like a little kid being a little child.

3944
03:03:52,960 --> 03:03:57,960
And I guess it just continued to escalate.

3945
03:03:57,960 --> 03:04:05,960
And this guy was way more weird than either of us gave him any credit for.

3946
03:04:05,960 --> 03:04:09,960
And I guess like a week or a little like two weeks ago now.

3947
03:04:09,960 --> 03:04:11,960
A while, a little while ago.

3948
03:04:11,960 --> 03:04:19,960
Allegedly, but not allegedly, but allegedly broke into Digi's house.

3949
03:04:19,960 --> 03:04:21,960
That seems to be the story.

3950
03:04:21,960 --> 03:04:28,960
Tried to put like May in handcuffs or some shit until Digi chased him off.

3951
03:04:28,960 --> 03:04:29,960
Something like that.

3952
03:04:29,960 --> 03:04:30,960
Something like that.

3953
03:04:30,960 --> 03:04:32,960
It's very bizarre.

3954
03:04:33,960 --> 03:04:36,960
The internet is such a fucking weird place.

3955
03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:39,960
Cyber, this must be pretty awkward for you.

3956
03:04:39,960 --> 03:04:40,960
Yeah, yeah.

3957
03:04:40,960 --> 03:04:46,960
I was like vaguely aware that there was some sort of situation with the drama going on,

3958
03:04:46,960 --> 03:04:48,960
but that's pretty intense.

3959
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:55,960
So the voicemail we just listened to was a supposed message sent by Spicy Salts to Digi.

3960
03:04:55,960 --> 03:04:56,960
I don't think it was.

3961
03:04:56,960 --> 03:04:59,960
I'm pretty sure it was just some troll.

3962
03:04:59,960 --> 03:05:00,960
I would hope so.

3963
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:02,960
I would certainly hope so.

3964
03:05:02,960 --> 03:05:04,960
But you know, I can't believe anything these days.

3965
03:05:04,960 --> 03:05:06,960
I can't be sure of anything anymore.

3966
03:05:06,960 --> 03:05:08,960
No, we can't.

3967
03:05:12,960 --> 03:05:15,960
Yeah, I guess there's not much else to say about it.

3968
03:05:15,960 --> 03:05:17,960
I guess it's good that we acknowledge that that was a thing that...

3969
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:25,960
Yeah, like this week, that's kind of big news in PCP lore, I guess, is that that whole thing happened.

3970
03:05:25,960 --> 03:05:26,960
That was very bizarre.

3971
03:05:26,960 --> 03:05:32,960
And I guess Digi is moving and stuff, and it's caused a bit of a fuck.

3972
03:05:32,960 --> 03:05:34,960
It's caused some fuckery.

3973
03:05:35,960 --> 03:05:40,960
Now listen, guys, I might not be a member of the PCP, but I feel like I can speak on there we have when I say,

3974
03:05:40,960 --> 03:05:42,960
please don't do that.

3975
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:46,960
Yeah, I'm glad we could get a neutral third party to clarify that,

3976
03:05:46,960 --> 03:05:48,960
because I know it was obviously a little bit of confusion.

3977
03:05:48,960 --> 03:05:55,960
I didn't feel comfortable saying it myself, but I needed someone with clear eyes.

3978
03:05:55,960 --> 03:05:57,960
With eyes I'm clouded by hate.

3979
03:05:58,960 --> 03:06:05,960
I'm not sure if I can consider myself a perfectly neutral observer, but for my somewhat subjective point of view,

3980
03:06:05,960 --> 03:06:11,960
being a weirdo stalker who breaks into people's houses is not good to do.

3981
03:06:11,960 --> 03:06:14,960
Generally frowned upon.

3982
03:06:14,960 --> 03:06:16,960
I am...

3983
03:06:16,960 --> 03:06:17,960
Obviously this is terrible.

3984
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:20,960
Obviously this is a bad thing that should not have happened,

3985
03:06:20,960 --> 03:06:28,960
but I will say that I am interested and very curious honestly to learn more about why this happened,

3986
03:06:28,960 --> 03:06:31,960
because it's so strange.

3987
03:06:31,960 --> 03:06:32,960
It's so weird.

3988
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:37,960
It's so strange, but like you said it, and I'm like, oh yeah, of course that happened, because of course that would happen.

3989
03:06:37,960 --> 03:06:49,960
And I'm looking forward to more details coming to light in a very sort of gossipy TMZ kind of way.

3990
03:06:49,960 --> 03:06:51,960
I can't help myself.

3991
03:06:52,960 --> 03:06:53,960
So you know, very exciting.

3992
03:06:53,960 --> 03:06:55,960
So what I'm saying is that I'm glad it happened.

3993
03:06:55,960 --> 03:06:56,960
It's good. Thanks Spicey salts.

3994
03:06:56,960 --> 03:06:58,960
You really, you really shit things up around me.

3995
03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:01,960
No, no, no, no, no, no, disavow, disavow.

3996
03:07:01,960 --> 03:07:02,960
Sorry.

3997
03:07:02,960 --> 03:07:05,960
Every good arc needs a good villain, so that's all I'll say.

3998
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:07,960
That's right, that's right.

3999
03:07:08,960 --> 03:07:12,960
Anyway, Shaggy wants to be you.

4000
03:07:12,960 --> 03:07:14,960
Is this just going to be another thing?

4001
03:07:14,960 --> 03:07:16,960
Oh, no.

4002
03:07:17,960 --> 03:07:28,960
Like I did it, because I crave to be in your shoes, and that means the sweetest and kindest girl in the world.

4003
03:07:28,960 --> 03:07:39,960
I imagine she smells like Scooby Snacks and loves you, your house, your girlfriend, your life.

4004
03:07:39,960 --> 03:07:41,960
I want to be you.

4005
03:07:41,960 --> 03:07:45,960
I crave to be you.

4006
03:07:45,960 --> 03:07:53,960
And for that brief instant, I was inside your house with your girlfriend.

4007
03:07:53,960 --> 03:07:57,960
In that moment, I was you.

4008
03:07:57,960 --> 03:07:59,960
And it was beautiful.

4009
03:07:59,960 --> 03:08:02,960
You know, it's too on the nose.

4010
03:08:02,960 --> 03:08:11,960
I wasn't surprised when I had confirmed that, yeah, this is probably not a genuine message.

4011
03:08:11,960 --> 03:08:13,960
But it's pretty funny, though.

4012
03:08:13,960 --> 03:08:15,960
It's pretty fun.

4013
03:08:15,960 --> 03:08:19,960
Next up, Ben was wrong about something.

4014
03:08:19,960 --> 03:08:24,960
Like the Democrats, they're not good people.

4015
03:08:24,960 --> 03:08:26,960
They're not any better than the Republicans.

4016
03:08:26,960 --> 03:08:30,960
They're all filthy, disgusting politicians.

4017
03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:33,960
And they'd block him.

4018
03:08:33,960 --> 03:08:36,960
They'd block his nomination if they could, but they can't.

4019
03:08:36,960 --> 03:08:40,960
They can't because, oh, guess what?

4020
03:08:40,960 --> 03:08:43,960
In 2013, they legislated against it.

4021
03:08:43,960 --> 03:08:44,960
They can't filibuster anymore.

4022
03:08:44,960 --> 03:08:46,960
Oh, boo-hoo.

4023
03:08:46,960 --> 03:08:51,960
But you regret it now, Democrats.

4024
03:08:51,960 --> 03:08:52,960
We went over this.

4025
03:08:52,960 --> 03:08:58,960
The Republicans did some filibuster bullshit in 2016.

4026
03:08:58,960 --> 03:09:02,960
You know, they did it, whether it was legislated against or not.

4027
03:09:02,960 --> 03:09:04,960
I didn't say the Democrats were good.

4028
03:09:04,960 --> 03:09:09,960
I think some of them are better people than the Republicans are.

4029
03:09:09,960 --> 03:09:10,960
Some of them are.

4030
03:09:10,960 --> 03:09:12,960
Not all of them, by any means.

4031
03:09:12,960 --> 03:09:16,960
The Justice Democrats are, I mean, you know, they're better.

4032
03:09:16,960 --> 03:09:17,960
They are.

4033
03:09:17,960 --> 03:09:18,960
They just are.

4034
03:09:18,960 --> 03:09:20,960
They're the minority, but they're there.

4035
03:09:20,960 --> 03:09:22,960
And that's all I have to fucking say about that.

4036
03:09:22,960 --> 03:09:24,960
Fuck you.

4037
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:25,960
Go...

4038
03:09:25,960 --> 03:09:26,960
Who is...

4039
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:29,960
Hey, I got a great post for you to read.

4040
03:09:29,960 --> 03:09:35,960
It's by Jennifer Diane Reitz, and it was posted on fucking FIM Fiction earlier today.

4041
03:09:35,960 --> 03:09:40,960
I'll go and read the whole list of her dystopian predictions for you.

4042
03:09:40,960 --> 03:09:41,960
No.

4043
03:09:41,960 --> 03:09:42,960
Yes, yes, yes.

4044
03:09:42,960 --> 03:09:43,960
This is content.

4045
03:09:43,960 --> 03:09:45,960
This is content, Tom.

4046
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:50,960
If someone's going to bring in that right-wing stuff, you got to go as far as you can get

4047
03:09:50,960 --> 03:09:55,960
and just blast them with that drumflist from your ultimate Kokoro wish.

4048
03:09:55,960 --> 03:10:00,960
Yeah, we got to go as far, we got to go as far left as we possibly can with JDR.

4049
03:10:00,960 --> 03:10:01,960
She is...

4050
03:10:01,960 --> 03:10:02,960
She is the...

4051
03:10:02,960 --> 03:10:03,960
She is the...

4052
03:10:03,960 --> 03:10:05,960
She's the new burning.

4053
03:10:05,960 --> 03:10:07,960
Oh, dear.

4054
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:10,960
Next one is, Huh?

4055
03:10:10,960 --> 03:10:19,960
The Procrastinators podcast is a show where a bunch of content creators pick a topic and

4056
03:10:19,960 --> 03:10:22,960
talk about it until no one cares anymore.

4057
03:10:22,960 --> 03:10:23,960
What?

4058
03:10:23,960 --> 03:10:24,960
Is that like a...

4059
03:10:24,960 --> 03:10:25,960
Topic?

4060
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:26,960
Description?

4061
03:10:26,960 --> 03:10:27,960
Why does it say topic?

4062
03:10:27,960 --> 03:10:28,960
Why does it say topic?

4063
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:29,960
I don't get it.

4064
03:10:29,960 --> 03:10:31,960
At least the podcast probably.

4065
03:10:31,960 --> 03:10:33,960
Is this like a VCR?

4066
03:10:33,960 --> 03:10:34,960
What's a VCR?

4067
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:38,960
I thought our channel description said under construction.

4068
03:10:38,960 --> 03:10:43,960
I think the podcast upload probably still says that because that was never changed.

4069
03:10:43,960 --> 03:10:45,960
Oh, no.

4070
03:10:45,960 --> 03:10:47,960
Oh, dear.

4071
03:10:47,960 --> 03:10:50,960
Well, I mean...

4072
03:10:50,960 --> 03:10:55,960
I'll immediately change it to it's a low energy podcast by boring people about that.

4073
03:10:55,960 --> 03:10:56,960
Yeah, please.

4074
03:10:56,960 --> 03:10:57,960
Yeah, please do.

4075
03:10:57,960 --> 03:10:58,960
Please do.

4076
03:10:58,960 --> 03:11:00,960
And that way nobody can possibly complain.

4077
03:11:00,960 --> 03:11:02,960
Yeah, this is exactly what you signed up for.

4078
03:11:02,960 --> 03:11:04,960
They cover all our bases.

4079
03:11:04,960 --> 03:11:06,960
Next up is, Them Snakes.

4080
03:11:06,960 --> 03:11:08,960
Oh, my God.

4081
03:11:08,960 --> 03:11:09,960
The Legend Return.

4082
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:10,960
Them Snakes.

4083
03:11:10,960 --> 03:11:15,960
You thought you could be sneaky and climb into my snake pile last night.

4084
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:21,960
Well, I detected you and I found the letter that you left behind.

4085
03:11:21,960 --> 03:11:24,960
I'm sorry, but this is pretty fucking cringy.

4086
03:11:24,960 --> 03:11:29,960
And I will now read it for the entire world to see.

4087
03:11:29,960 --> 03:11:31,960
Oh, I wonder what this could be.

4088
03:11:31,960 --> 03:11:37,960
I did it because I craved for it in your metaphorical shoes.

4089
03:11:37,960 --> 03:11:42,960
Them Snakes is the sweetest and kindest abomination in the world.

4090
03:11:42,960 --> 03:11:47,960
I imagine they smell like strawberries and dead rats.

4091
03:11:47,960 --> 03:11:52,960
Your pile, your hive mind, your life.

4092
03:11:52,960 --> 03:11:54,960
I want to be you.

4093
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:57,960
I crave to be you.

4094
03:11:57,960 --> 03:12:04,960
And for that brief instant, I was inside your wriggling pile surrounded by snakes.

4095
03:12:04,960 --> 03:12:08,960
In that moment, I was you.

4096
03:12:08,960 --> 03:12:12,960
And it was beautiful.

4097
03:12:12,960 --> 03:12:15,960
Love, Ben St.

4098
03:12:15,960 --> 03:12:17,960
It sounds like something I said.

4099
03:12:17,960 --> 03:12:20,960
I'm sorry, but this is cringe.

4100
03:12:20,960 --> 03:12:23,960
You posted cringe.

4101
03:12:23,960 --> 03:12:26,960
You lose a subscriber.

4102
03:12:26,960 --> 03:12:29,960
No, don't unsubscribe, then, Snakes.

4103
03:12:29,960 --> 03:12:30,960
Please.

4104
03:12:30,960 --> 03:12:34,960
I just, I just, you know, who wouldn't.

4105
03:12:34,960 --> 03:12:37,960
How do you deal with these accusations that you posted cringe?

4106
03:12:37,960 --> 03:12:49,960
Who wouldn't, who wouldn't occasionally wonder what it feels like to be a hive mind of serpentine, of wriggling serpentine, you know, Majesty.

4107
03:12:50,960 --> 03:12:51,960
Who could blame me?

4108
03:12:51,960 --> 03:12:53,960
He'd have done the same thing if the roles were reversed.

4109
03:12:53,960 --> 03:12:55,960
He can't prove otherwise.

4110
03:12:55,960 --> 03:12:56,960
All right.

4111
03:12:56,960 --> 03:12:57,960
Hey, thanks.

4112
03:12:57,960 --> 03:12:58,960
Hey, thanks for the message.

4113
03:12:58,960 --> 03:12:59,960
Love you.

4114
03:12:59,960 --> 03:13:00,960
You smell so good.

4115
03:13:00,960 --> 03:13:02,960
I want, I want to, I want more.

4116
03:13:02,960 --> 03:13:03,960
I want to be you.

4117
03:13:03,960 --> 03:13:05,960
No, no, no, never mind.

4118
03:13:05,960 --> 03:13:11,960
Next one is from if you don't like America, then you can get out.

4119
03:13:16,960 --> 03:13:18,960
Okay, good.

4120
03:13:19,960 --> 03:13:21,960
Hey guys, we're almost done.

4121
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:23,960
Are you excited?

4122
03:13:23,960 --> 03:13:24,960
Incredibly.

4123
03:13:24,960 --> 03:13:26,960
Well, nothing's gonna be better than that last voicemail, but yeah.

4124
03:13:26,960 --> 03:13:31,960
There are so many mouse cursors on your feed now that it's like making me sick.

4125
03:13:31,960 --> 03:13:34,960
It doesn't, it doesn't even like look like a screen anymore.

4126
03:13:34,960 --> 03:13:35,960
It's too like artifact.

4127
03:13:35,960 --> 03:13:38,960
I have no idea why it's doing that, but I like it.

4128
03:13:38,960 --> 03:13:40,960
It's, it's better.

4129
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:44,960
Next one is from trans bullshit.

4130
03:13:44,960 --> 03:13:45,960
Sorry for the length.

4131
03:13:45,960 --> 03:13:46,960
I love you, Tom.

4132
03:13:46,960 --> 03:13:48,960
Do you know this person?

4133
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:50,960
I don't think so.

4134
03:13:50,960 --> 03:13:51,960
Okay.

4135
03:13:51,960 --> 03:13:53,960
Well, let's hear, let's hear what they have to say.

4136
03:13:53,960 --> 03:13:54,960
Okay.

4137
03:13:54,960 --> 03:13:56,960
I was just like asleep and I like thought of this.

4138
03:13:56,960 --> 03:13:57,960
So I dreamed it anyway.

4139
03:13:57,960 --> 03:13:58,960
Secondary voicemail.

4140
03:13:58,960 --> 03:13:59,960
Sorry for making too.

4141
03:13:59,960 --> 03:14:03,960
Tom at some point says like transphobia wouldn't exist or be like way less prominent.

4142
03:14:03,960 --> 03:14:08,960
If trans people instead of like trying to make more pronouns made less, there's like

4143
03:14:08,960 --> 03:14:10,960
a ton of problems with this.

4144
03:14:10,960 --> 03:14:14,960
First, like traditional trans people don't make new pronouns and like transphobia goes

4145
03:14:14,960 --> 03:14:15,960
against them.

4146
03:14:15,960 --> 03:14:17,960
I go by she, her typical pronouns.

4147
03:14:17,960 --> 03:14:19,960
Nothing new to remember.

4148
03:14:19,960 --> 03:14:21,960
People are still transphobic to me.

4149
03:14:21,960 --> 03:14:27,960
Two, um, uh, fucking like trying to like impose on cis people and what cis people do would

4150
03:14:27,960 --> 03:14:30,960
obviously like, uh, have some other counter effects.

4151
03:14:30,960 --> 03:14:34,960
Uh, three, like this is fundamentally, you misunderstand the root of transphobia and

4152
03:14:34,960 --> 03:14:38,960
things like the, like the genuine, like how would I explain to my kids?

4153
03:14:38,960 --> 03:14:41,960
It's like, it's like real, but it's not like the roots of transphobia or in like, uh,

4154
03:14:41,960 --> 03:14:46,960
uh, fucking, uh, sexism and fucking, uh, uh, like all the isms, you know, all the bullshit

4155
03:14:46,960 --> 03:14:47,960
that you already know.

4156
03:14:47,960 --> 03:14:53,960
And like maybe in disgust on some level, uh, like the roots, like, like the reason fucking

4157
03:14:53,960 --> 03:14:57,960
trans people are mad isn't, um, you know, or trans people.

4158
03:14:57,960 --> 03:15:00,960
The reason people are mad at trans people isn't because they have to learn, like they have

4159
03:15:00,960 --> 03:15:03,960
to learn to use they them on like more people or something.

4160
03:15:03,960 --> 03:15:04,960
I don't know.

4161
03:15:04,960 --> 03:15:07,960
Like a new pronouns aren't the common, but like, like the reason someone's disgusted

4162
03:15:07,960 --> 03:15:11,960
by someone who uses neo pronouns isn't cause they like fucking are like, are too stupid

4163
03:15:11,960 --> 03:15:13,960
to remember an extra two words.

4164
03:15:13,960 --> 03:15:18,960
It's cause they fucking, uh, cause of like complicated societal and, uh, and whatever

4165
03:15:18,960 --> 03:15:20,960
factors, you get it.

4166
03:15:20,960 --> 03:15:21,960
Anyway.

4167
03:15:21,960 --> 03:15:22,960
Yeah.

4168
03:15:22,960 --> 03:15:27,960
Uh, not sure exactly what to say to that.

4169
03:15:27,960 --> 03:15:32,960
Um, well, I mean, I, the quality wasn't great cause I'm still listening to your speakers,

4170
03:15:32,960 --> 03:15:40,960
but like the, the point that I was making last week wasn't that I think they, them like

4171
03:15:40,960 --> 03:15:45,880
producing pronouns, just a genderless pronoun would solve the problems.

4172
03:15:45,880 --> 03:15:49,760
My point was that by, if they would, it's gone in that direction instead of creating

4173
03:15:49,760 --> 03:15:57,400
multiple new pronouns, you just would have removed that, uh, that counterpoint from the

4174
03:15:57,400 --> 03:15:58,400
discussion, right?

4175
03:15:58,400 --> 03:16:01,960
Cause there was like a whole, there's a whole bunch of like jokes and memes and like,

4176
03:16:01,960 --> 03:16:05,200
it would have been one less thing for them to make fun of, but I mean, we wouldn't have

4177
03:16:05,200 --> 03:16:08,360
like changed everything, but I do see where you're coming from though.

4178
03:16:08,360 --> 03:16:12,360
People are going to, are going to push back against that concept societally because it

4179
03:16:12,360 --> 03:16:17,840
goes against, uh, the general kind of cultural consensus for the last like forever, right?

4180
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:22,640
This is still a relatively new concept, uh, socially, especially in the West, uh, in this

4181
03:16:22,640 --> 03:16:27,880
culture where Jen, the gender binary has been heavily, uh, reinforced and used honestly

4182
03:16:27,880 --> 03:16:31,240
for marketing purposes and for a bunch of other stuff, right?

4183
03:16:31,240 --> 03:16:36,440
So like to, to push back against that, you're going to meet friction like regardless, uh,

4184
03:16:36,440 --> 03:16:38,800
just because that's the nature of change.

4185
03:16:38,800 --> 03:16:42,600
All of my, my only point was you would have one less obstacle to go over if you were trying

4186
03:16:42,600 --> 03:16:48,600
to simplify things rather than expand complexity because more complexity makes that problem

4187
03:16:48,600 --> 03:16:54,640
more complicated to digest to someone, uh, who might be on board, but not understand

4188
03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:58,940
and gives people who are detracting against it more ammo to use against you.

4189
03:16:58,940 --> 03:17:00,440
Not that that was going to blanket solve anything.

4190
03:17:00,840 --> 03:17:06,760
I mean, I feel like, um, I feel like if there, if there is a benefit, if there is some benefit

4191
03:17:06,760 --> 03:17:15,120
to like a, a neo pronoun over like they, them, then I can see why you might say like, no,

4192
03:17:15,120 --> 03:17:19,080
it's, it's not helpful to say like, oh, we'll just go with they, them it's simpler.

4193
03:17:19,080 --> 03:17:23,880
But like, I feel like I would need to be someone who uses neo pronouns to understand what's

4194
03:17:23,880 --> 03:17:25,200
useful about them.

4195
03:17:25,200 --> 03:17:28,040
I don't need them, but like they're not for me.

4196
03:17:28,040 --> 03:17:33,000
So it's like not, it kind of doesn't matter if I think they're useful or not, uh, or if

4197
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:42,840
I think they're overly complicated or something, uh, so, um, on a, hmm, uh, I guess on a case

4198
03:17:42,840 --> 03:17:46,560
by case basis, I'd have to judge if they increase overall, uh, well-being.

4199
03:17:46,560 --> 03:17:47,560
Sure.

4200
03:17:47,560 --> 03:17:48,560
Hmm.

4201
03:17:48,560 --> 03:17:52,760
I mean, I was about to go that angle as well, like utility, like the utilitarian angle versus

4202
03:17:52,760 --> 03:17:54,160
like subjective interpretation.

4203
03:17:54,160 --> 03:17:55,160
Yeah.

4204
03:17:55,160 --> 03:18:01,160
I mean, I, I don't know anybody who uses a pronoun outside of they, them, or, you know,

4205
03:18:01,160 --> 03:18:02,160
the typical binary.

4206
03:18:02,160 --> 03:18:06,160
So like, some would have to make a case to me, this is why I use this and this is why

4207
03:18:06,160 --> 03:18:07,160
it works.

4208
03:18:07,160 --> 03:18:11,080
I would have to judge for myself if I feel that that is a coach and argument or not.

4209
03:18:11,080 --> 03:18:12,080
Well, I wouldn't, I don't agree.

4210
03:18:12,080 --> 03:18:13,080
I don't agree.

4211
03:18:13,080 --> 03:18:16,160
I wouldn't, I wouldn't say they have to like explain it to me.

4212
03:18:16,160 --> 03:18:20,640
Like if they, if they said that they're, that's how they go by, then fine.

4213
03:18:20,640 --> 03:18:23,240
Like I'm not going to argue with them.

4214
03:18:23,240 --> 03:18:25,120
I'm not, I'm not going to tell them they can't use it.

4215
03:18:25,120 --> 03:18:26,120
Right.

4216
03:18:26,120 --> 03:18:30,200
I mean, when they explained to me to see if I agree with that perspective or not.

4217
03:18:30,200 --> 03:18:31,200
That's all.

4218
03:18:31,200 --> 03:18:37,080
Not that I, I mean, I mean, I'm not going to be persuaded to use any different pronouns.

4219
03:18:37,080 --> 03:18:42,600
But, you know, not for me personally, but if I, if I understand their perspective or

4220
03:18:42,600 --> 03:18:44,360
not, like I, I can respect it.

4221
03:18:44,360 --> 03:18:49,360
I'd be, I'd be curious if someone was like, if someone was like, yeah, I'm a, I'm, I don't

4222
03:18:49,360 --> 03:18:50,360
know.

4223
03:18:50,360 --> 03:18:53,200
I don't know if this is one people use or not, but like Zeezer, I mean, I would be

4224
03:18:53,200 --> 03:18:59,520
curious why I would be curious, like why that, like why is they, them, not something you,

4225
03:18:59,520 --> 03:19:01,760
you are okay with or comfortable with?

4226
03:19:01,760 --> 03:19:06,720
Like what's the, I would just, I would just, I would just be curious why not.

4227
03:19:06,720 --> 03:19:11,840
I wouldn't, I would never really thought about this, but I never met anyone who uses like

4228
03:19:11,840 --> 03:19:13,440
an extra pronoun like that.

4229
03:19:13,440 --> 03:19:16,680
So like, I just don't consider myself very knowledgeable enough like that I'm willing

4230
03:19:16,680 --> 03:19:20,440
to make any sort of declaration that whether it is or isn't helpful, but like I've never

4231
03:19:20,440 --> 03:19:22,360
met, I've never met anyone who uses that.

4232
03:19:22,360 --> 03:19:25,200
So I would be interested in hearing their like their point of view on it.

4233
03:19:25,200 --> 03:19:28,800
The only time I've ever heard Zeezer is as the butt of a joke.

4234
03:19:28,800 --> 03:19:29,800
Well, exactly.

4235
03:19:29,800 --> 03:19:31,920
I've heard it million times as a joke.

4236
03:19:31,920 --> 03:19:35,840
So that's why I'm wondering like, again, I don't know, which was my entire point from

4237
03:19:35,840 --> 03:19:41,360
last week that if it was just they, them, and there was a simplification of pronouns,

4238
03:19:41,360 --> 03:19:45,840
that wouldn't be a joke that could be used, which was the only point I was trying to make

4239
03:19:45,840 --> 03:19:46,840
last week.

4240
03:19:46,840 --> 03:19:53,760
I think the problem is that like, okay, I think, I think with, with this voicemail would

4241
03:19:53,760 --> 03:20:02,480
say to that is like, aren't you, aren't you, isn't the problem there not that something

4242
03:20:02,480 --> 03:20:04,680
invites a joke to be made about?

4243
03:20:04,680 --> 03:20:08,880
Like it's not the thing's fault for that, like that one could, that he could make fun

4244
03:20:08,880 --> 03:20:09,880
of it.

4245
03:20:09,880 --> 03:20:13,360
The fault lies with someone who chooses to make fun of it instead of trying to understand

4246
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:14,360
it.

4247
03:20:14,360 --> 03:20:15,360
Right?

4248
03:20:15,360 --> 03:20:16,360
Yes.

4249
03:20:16,880 --> 03:20:24,640
But all, all, all I'm trying to say is that objectively, the thing not being there would

4250
03:20:24,640 --> 03:20:25,800
remove the joke from the table.

4251
03:20:25,800 --> 03:20:31,160
I'm not making a prescriptive statement on like, therefore, it shouldn't exist.

4252
03:20:31,160 --> 03:20:32,160
I'm just saying.

4253
03:20:32,160 --> 03:20:33,160
Yeah.

4254
03:20:33,160 --> 03:20:34,800
If it wasn't there, it wouldn't be there.

4255
03:20:34,800 --> 03:20:36,640
That's, I can't, I can't argue with that.

4256
03:20:36,640 --> 03:20:38,440
Yeah, I agree with you.

4257
03:20:38,440 --> 03:20:39,440
They would be one less thing.

4258
03:20:39,440 --> 03:20:43,400
I mean, the only thing I'll say is like, it doesn't, the actual thing doesn't matter.

4259
03:20:43,400 --> 03:20:46,600
They're going to like make fun of them with something else if that wasn't there.

4260
03:20:46,600 --> 03:20:48,320
But I mean, I do, I do get what you're saying though.

4261
03:20:48,320 --> 03:20:51,920
Like it's not like, you know, you're not, you're not trying to say it would fix the

4262
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:52,920
situation.

4263
03:20:52,920 --> 03:20:53,920
It's just like.

4264
03:20:53,920 --> 03:21:01,680
As somebody who has never heard any sort of explanation of why other pronouns exist,

4265
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:05,240
I cannot say whether they're helpful or not.

4266
03:21:05,240 --> 03:21:09,800
All I could say is that they are more confusing because you're adding more language.

4267
03:21:09,800 --> 03:21:10,800
Yeah.

4268
03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:11,800
Right.

4269
03:21:11,800 --> 03:21:17,320
And that is something that is not, is not equivalent to him and her because they're

4270
03:21:17,320 --> 03:21:22,680
not, they're no biological cues or aesthetic cues to help you make that inference.

4271
03:21:22,680 --> 03:21:26,560
So there was no way for me to know you're using ZZer, if that's what you're using, without

4272
03:21:26,560 --> 03:21:28,400
me specifically asking for you.

4273
03:21:28,400 --> 03:21:30,440
So you've increased the complexity of language.

4274
03:21:30,440 --> 03:21:35,480
If I could weigh the magic wand, I would reduce the complexity all the way until we're just

4275
03:21:35,480 --> 03:21:39,720
like finished and we just have, we just, we're just all it.

4276
03:21:39,920 --> 03:21:45,960
I mean, that, that, that to me seems like the more efficient way of going about, if,

4277
03:21:45,960 --> 03:21:51,120
if you have a problem with, with the gender binary, which I'm assuming a certain, a certain

4278
03:21:51,120 --> 03:21:57,560
degree of people do, instead of adding more choices, get rid of the gender connotation

4279
03:21:57,560 --> 03:21:59,040
and language altogether.

4280
03:21:59,040 --> 03:22:02,840
And then you can identify it as whatever you need to, and language will still accommodate

4281
03:22:02,840 --> 03:22:08,800
everybody with one blanket term and therefore reduce any, literally any chance of ever being

4282
03:22:08,840 --> 03:22:12,360
misgendered because there's no longer any gendered language, as opposed to creating

4283
03:22:12,360 --> 03:22:14,960
new pronouns that everybody has to learn.

4284
03:22:14,960 --> 03:22:18,960
And they have no way of inherently understanding based on your appearance, like we do with

4285
03:22:18,960 --> 03:22:23,800
traditional gendered language, we can make pretty accurate assumptions on who is, you

4286
03:22:23,800 --> 03:22:28,880
know, a male or female based on the, you know, traditional paradigm.

4287
03:22:28,880 --> 03:22:34,360
So that was all it was implying is that the more complexity is going to be inherently

4288
03:22:34,360 --> 03:22:38,600
more difficult and harder for the average person to digest, then less complexity is

4289
03:22:38,640 --> 03:22:39,840
that the ethical thing to do.

4290
03:22:39,840 --> 03:22:44,440
I have no idea, because I have no idea what the argument for increased pronouns are until

4291
03:22:44,440 --> 03:22:45,200
I know what that is.

4292
03:22:45,200 --> 03:22:48,760
I can't comment on it any further other than the empirical statement that you're adding

4293
03:22:48,760 --> 03:22:49,560
more complexity.

4294
03:22:49,560 --> 03:22:50,760
Yeah. Sure.

4295
03:22:51,600 --> 03:22:54,480
When it comes to complexity in language, though, I mean, we are just talking about

4296
03:22:54,480 --> 03:22:57,960
English, there's all these other foreign languages that have like gendered fucking

4297
03:22:57,960 --> 03:23:00,480
nouns and all the shit that I barely even understand.

4298
03:23:00,480 --> 03:23:06,640
Moving past the fucking binary is going to be like, I can't even fathom it.

4299
03:23:06,680 --> 03:23:12,480
I mean, you're moving the gendered pronouns wouldn't, you know, remove the gendered binary

4300
03:23:12,480 --> 03:23:15,560
as like a concept that we have in society or anything.

4301
03:23:15,560 --> 03:23:19,720
But we're just, we're just, we're just simply talking about English language at this point.

4302
03:23:19,720 --> 03:23:24,680
This is a huge, massive, complicated issue that no amount of podcasts will ever be able

4303
03:23:24,680 --> 03:23:25,160
to cover.

4304
03:23:25,160 --> 03:23:27,440
Oh, no, no, no, I just agree.

4305
03:23:27,440 --> 03:23:27,880
I don't know.

4306
03:23:27,880 --> 03:23:29,240
I think we spent another half hour.

4307
03:23:29,240 --> 03:23:30,080
We can fix this.

4308
03:23:30,080 --> 03:23:32,200
Yeah, we can we can fix this another half hour.

4309
03:23:32,200 --> 03:23:35,720
Just get through all the genders, all the everything we can have that sorted out.

4310
03:23:36,040 --> 03:23:38,080
Let's just pull up gender on Urban Dictionary.

4311
03:23:38,080 --> 03:23:39,960
And we can pass us all out in the next 20 minutes.

4312
03:23:39,960 --> 03:23:40,880
You know what?

4313
03:23:40,880 --> 03:23:42,560
Let's fucking do it.

4314
03:23:42,560 --> 03:23:45,720
Urban Dictionary gender.

4315
03:23:47,720 --> 03:23:49,600
Just feel better to feel like you all came home.

4316
03:23:49,600 --> 03:23:50,720
Legacy PCP view.

4317
03:23:50,720 --> 03:23:51,320
Here we go.

4318
03:23:51,320 --> 03:23:55,880
Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to differentiating between

4319
03:23:56,000 --> 03:23:58,680
masculinity and femininity, depending on their context.

4320
03:23:58,680 --> 03:24:01,200
These characters, it's may include biological sex, i.e.

4321
03:24:01,200 --> 03:24:03,760
the state of being male, female, or an intersex variation.

4322
03:24:04,280 --> 03:24:06,360
Sex based social structures, i.e.

4323
03:24:06,360 --> 03:24:08,120
gender roles or gender identity.

4324
03:24:08,120 --> 03:24:11,600
Traditionally, people who identify as men or women or use masculine or feminine

4325
03:24:11,600 --> 03:24:14,880
gender pronouns are using a system of gender binary, whereas those who make this

4326
03:24:14,880 --> 03:24:18,480
outside these groups fall under the umbrella terms, non-binary or genderqueer.

4327
03:24:18,480 --> 03:24:21,560
Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from men and women,

4328
03:24:21,560 --> 03:24:23,480
such as the hegeras of South Asia.

4329
03:24:23,480 --> 03:24:25,720
These are often referred to as their genders.

4330
03:24:27,280 --> 03:24:29,480
Well, that wasn't very funny.

4331
03:24:29,480 --> 03:24:32,880
See, that was less funny than the average Urban Dictionary definition.

4332
03:24:32,880 --> 03:24:34,760
But, you know, it was pretty accurate, I guess.

4333
03:24:34,760 --> 03:24:39,240
But. Oh, but don't I was just like the dictionary definition.

4334
03:24:39,720 --> 03:24:40,720
Oh, but don't worry.

4335
03:24:40,720 --> 03:24:43,760
Right underneath, we have the September 6th word of the day,

4336
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:47,320
STEEZY, which is to style with ease.

4337
03:24:49,320 --> 03:24:54,120
So in case you were wondering, God, I love learning urban words.

4338
03:24:56,040 --> 03:24:58,120
I don't know how urban I think that is.

4339
03:24:59,760 --> 03:25:00,920
It's on Urban Dictionary.

4340
03:25:00,920 --> 03:25:01,680
It has to be.

4341
03:25:01,680 --> 03:25:05,080
I guess by, I guess by definition, even if it wasn't before, it is now.

4342
03:25:05,320 --> 03:25:07,920
What's the definition for Urban Dictionary on Urban Dictionary?

4343
03:25:08,920 --> 03:25:10,280
I'm really going to do it.

4344
03:25:10,280 --> 03:25:11,360
I'm really going to do it.

4345
03:25:11,360 --> 03:25:12,920
No, no.

4346
03:25:12,920 --> 03:25:13,720
How deep is the rap?

4347
03:25:13,720 --> 03:25:15,600
We have one more voicemail.

4348
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:20,400
We have one more Urban Dictionary, a site where it's a challenge

4349
03:25:20,400 --> 03:25:23,680
to find one subject where no one talks about sex.

4350
03:25:25,760 --> 03:25:28,160
That's the top definition.

4351
03:25:28,160 --> 03:25:29,520
Incredible.

4352
03:25:29,520 --> 03:25:32,080
OK, one last, last voicemail.

4353
03:25:32,720 --> 03:25:34,680
Play this to pass by Nate Heads.

4354
03:25:34,680 --> 03:25:35,840
I love Clarissa.

4355
03:25:35,840 --> 03:25:37,520
Ha, ha, wee.

4356
03:25:37,520 --> 03:25:40,960
I am here with an explanation of why Nate is not back on the podcast.

4357
03:25:41,440 --> 03:25:43,960
I understand this man's filthy rotten little brain.

4358
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:48,760
Basically, what is happening is Nate likes to do big celebrations

4359
03:25:48,760 --> 03:25:50,120
when something finally comes up.

4360
03:25:50,120 --> 03:25:52,080
He tries to make everything a big event.

4361
03:25:52,080 --> 03:25:56,080
So what he is doing is he is currently editing the Brad lecture.

4362
03:25:56,680 --> 03:25:58,520
And I think he's doing the OV as well.

4363
03:25:58,520 --> 03:25:59,720
Someone's doing the OVA.

4364
03:25:59,720 --> 03:26:02,480
So when those are up, he's going to come on the podcast

4365
03:26:02,480 --> 03:26:05,160
and try and make a big stink about it and say, hey, guys, look,

4366
03:26:05,160 --> 03:26:06,160
you get a double reward.

4367
03:26:06,160 --> 03:26:06,800
The thing's out.

4368
03:26:06,800 --> 03:26:08,080
And so am I.

4369
03:26:08,080 --> 03:26:09,560
I'm out the closet because I'm Nate.

4370
03:26:09,560 --> 03:26:11,240
Whoa, look at me.

4371
03:26:11,240 --> 03:26:15,160
Also, you can go watch all his old videos if you need to hear

4372
03:26:15,160 --> 03:26:18,160
this strange man's voice and also all the old episodes

4373
03:26:18,160 --> 03:26:19,960
of the podcast will exist.

4374
03:26:19,960 --> 03:26:22,400
Tom, Ben, Hippo, whoever else is on this episode.

4375
03:26:23,480 --> 03:26:25,360
You're pretty cool.

4376
03:26:25,360 --> 03:26:27,160
I understand.

4377
03:26:27,160 --> 03:26:28,240
Do your best.

4378
03:26:28,240 --> 03:26:29,400
I'm one of Mary Clarissa.

4379
03:26:29,400 --> 03:26:30,400
I'm not very cool.

4380
03:26:30,400 --> 03:26:32,280
That thing I like it.

4381
03:26:32,280 --> 03:26:33,400
He likes Clarissa.

4382
03:26:33,400 --> 03:26:34,520
That's pretty good.

4383
03:26:34,520 --> 03:26:36,720
It's pretty based to like Clarissa.

4384
03:26:36,720 --> 03:26:37,720
Indeed.

4385
03:26:39,280 --> 03:26:43,520
I mean, Nate is working on some Brad stuff.

4386
03:26:43,520 --> 03:26:45,840
So this is partially accurate.

4387
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:51,600
We've we had to do some some some a little bit of voice acting this week.

4388
03:26:53,240 --> 03:26:54,680
Very simple, simple shit.

4389
03:26:54,680 --> 03:26:57,680
But yeah.

4390
03:26:57,680 --> 03:27:03,680
Brad Brad stuff I should I really should get around to fucking

4391
03:27:03,680 --> 03:27:06,800
finishing that son of two one or two lecture really should

4392
03:27:06,800 --> 03:27:08,640
probably honestly how I want to finish that.

4393
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:10,720
I thought it was already out.

4394
03:27:10,720 --> 03:27:12,000
What? What?

4395
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:15,280
Why? I just I just assumed it was already out.

4396
03:27:15,280 --> 03:27:16,840
It's been so long.

4397
03:27:16,840 --> 03:27:18,320
No, you rude.

4398
03:27:18,320 --> 03:27:19,880
No, I have not put it out yet.

4399
03:27:19,880 --> 03:27:22,080
Sorry, I had more faith in you than I should have.

4400
03:27:22,080 --> 03:27:25,400
Yeah, that was your biggest mistake, I think.

4401
03:27:25,400 --> 03:27:26,840
Truly, I was a fool.

4402
03:27:26,840 --> 03:27:30,120
Big, big problem, big problem.

4403
03:27:30,120 --> 03:27:31,920
I'm excited to see Son of two one or two.

4404
03:27:31,920 --> 03:27:32,840
That's going to be good.

4405
03:27:32,840 --> 03:27:34,640
Son of two one or two.

4406
03:27:34,640 --> 03:27:39,040
I mean, have you have you read like the later chapters?

4407
03:27:40,560 --> 03:27:42,840
I have not actually like sat down and just read them.

4408
03:27:42,840 --> 03:27:44,400
I have like read a little bit about them.

4409
03:27:44,400 --> 03:27:45,200
But no, I'm not.

4410
03:27:45,200 --> 03:27:46,600
I don't consider myself an expert on it.

4411
03:27:46,600 --> 03:27:52,280
No, Son of two gets very unstructured as it goes on.

4412
03:27:52,280 --> 03:27:54,440
And very right.

4413
03:27:54,480 --> 03:27:55,440
There's interest.

4414
03:27:55,440 --> 03:27:59,200
There's one chapter in particular where it's just all

4415
03:27:59,200 --> 03:28:04,080
everything goes right out the window and like complete chaos

4416
03:28:04,080 --> 03:28:04,680
breaks loose.

4417
03:28:04,680 --> 03:28:08,000
The canon of the story is just completely fucked.

4418
03:28:10,080 --> 03:28:12,960
And that's that's probably the best part.

4419
03:28:14,160 --> 03:28:15,360
It sounds like fun.

4420
03:28:15,360 --> 03:28:16,960
Yeah, it's pretty good.

4421
03:28:16,960 --> 03:28:20,480
It's just imagine me just kind of like reading like events

4422
03:28:20,480 --> 03:28:23,920
in a list of just like things that happen.

4423
03:28:23,920 --> 03:28:29,440
That just each one individually is like really fucked up beggars

4424
03:28:29,440 --> 03:28:32,520
belief. Why would why would the story?

4425
03:28:32,520 --> 03:28:34,640
Why would that happen?

4426
03:28:34,640 --> 03:28:38,640
Example, a wild song to becomes a meth head.

4427
03:28:38,640 --> 03:28:39,360
There you go.

4428
03:28:39,360 --> 03:28:41,040
That's a little incredible.

4429
03:28:41,040 --> 03:28:44,000
That's I know I'm the guy who is specifically saying not to

4430
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:45,040
like lump them in together.

4431
03:28:45,040 --> 03:28:47,120
But that is one thing I love about things like tales gets

4432
03:28:47,120 --> 03:28:49,640
trolled and Son of two is that like there's so much of media

4433
03:28:49,640 --> 03:28:51,520
that you can sort of predict what's going to happen.

4434
03:28:51,520 --> 03:28:54,320
Or at least you can like know the things that definitely won't

4435
03:28:54,320 --> 03:28:55,000
happen.

4436
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:57,120
But you just you have no idea what's going to happen in these

4437
03:28:57,120 --> 03:28:57,960
things.

4438
03:28:57,960 --> 03:29:05,720
I I certainly didn't expect Chester Cheeto man to just fucking

4439
03:29:05,720 --> 03:29:08,840
butcher those women and throw them and like every female

4440
03:29:08,840 --> 03:29:11,000
character in the story into a mass grave.

4441
03:29:11,000 --> 03:29:13,640
Didn't didn't see it go in there.

4442
03:29:13,640 --> 03:29:16,640
I don't think anyone could have possibly predicted that.

4443
03:29:16,640 --> 03:29:19,560
But that's what happens.

4444
03:29:19,560 --> 03:29:20,920
Spoilers for.

4445
03:29:20,920 --> 03:29:23,320
Well, he is a dangerous weed dealer.

4446
03:29:23,320 --> 03:29:28,160
So you know, deals the best weed.

4447
03:29:28,160 --> 03:29:29,560
And love that smart weed.

4448
03:29:29,560 --> 03:29:35,440
I'm smarter when I'm high and you should watch out for it.

4449
03:29:35,440 --> 03:29:38,680
Man, very.

4450
03:29:38,680 --> 03:29:42,120
Hey, you know, it's been a it's been a session been really

4451
03:29:42,120 --> 03:29:45,760
fun just talking about tales gets trolled with you, cyber.

4452
03:29:45,760 --> 03:29:49,320
I've enjoyed I've enjoyed our conversation a lot today and I

4453
03:29:49,320 --> 03:29:50,920
want to say thank you.

4454
03:29:50,920 --> 03:29:53,360
Thanks for being a guest on the procrastinators.

4455
03:29:53,360 --> 03:29:54,320
Yeah, this was really fun.

4456
03:29:54,320 --> 03:29:54,920
I enjoyed it.

4457
03:29:54,920 --> 03:29:57,560
I like talking about all this weird shit like Kokoro wish and

4458
03:29:57,560 --> 03:29:59,520
fucking Sonichu and tales gets trolled.

4459
03:29:59,520 --> 03:30:01,680
And I appreciate you having me on because I know that

4460
03:30:01,680 --> 03:30:05,320
traditionally this is not exactly a super guest heavy

4461
03:30:05,320 --> 03:30:06,120
podcast.

4462
03:30:06,120 --> 03:30:09,040
And I'm very much like to say that I'm super happy that I

4463
03:30:09,040 --> 03:30:12,240
ruined this episode for all the PCV heads who can't stand the

4464
03:30:12,240 --> 03:30:13,200
guests.

4465
03:30:13,200 --> 03:30:14,440
Whoo.

4466
03:30:14,440 --> 03:30:15,800
Fuck yeah.

4467
03:30:15,800 --> 03:30:18,120
Yeah, everyone check out cyber shell.

4468
03:30:18,120 --> 03:30:18,920
He's on YouTube.

4469
03:30:18,920 --> 03:30:21,880
He's just made his big a big comeback.

4470
03:30:21,880 --> 03:30:24,920
Oh, you know, I wanted to ask you have you seen a video called

4471
03:30:24,920 --> 03:30:26,920
the rise and fall of cyber shell?

4472
03:30:26,920 --> 03:30:28,760
Have you seen that video?

4473
03:30:28,760 --> 03:30:31,480
Yeah, you know, actually, I went on my way not to watch

4474
03:30:31,480 --> 03:30:35,040
anything related to me because it's hyper cringe for a long

4475
03:30:35,040 --> 03:30:35,360
time.

4476
03:30:35,360 --> 03:30:37,240
But then when I came back, I was like, well, I should probably

4477
03:30:37,240 --> 03:30:39,480
watch the things that are yeah, the guy that made that is

4478
03:30:39,480 --> 03:30:41,440
that he's a nice dude and we're on good terms.

4479
03:30:41,440 --> 03:30:44,560
OK, I watched that the other day and I was like, I wonder

4480
03:30:44,560 --> 03:30:48,480
what cyber shell thinks about this like it is funny because

4481
03:30:48,480 --> 03:30:50,520
you know, I mean, I just I just basically dipped without

4482
03:30:50,520 --> 03:30:52,560
saying anything because I just I don't really like when people

4483
03:30:52,560 --> 03:30:53,680
know about my personal life.

4484
03:30:53,680 --> 03:30:56,400
So I can't I can't really blame people for just wildly

4485
03:30:56,400 --> 03:30:58,520
speculating on all sorts of shit, you know.

4486
03:30:58,520 --> 03:30:59,880
Sure, sure.

4487
03:30:59,880 --> 03:31:02,360
As we've learned, that's what they do when you don't spell

4488
03:31:02,360 --> 03:31:04,280
things out for them very clearly.

4489
03:31:06,480 --> 03:31:07,960
We we wouldn't know about that.

4490
03:31:07,960 --> 03:31:12,360
We keep all of our listeners up to speed on everything going

4491
03:31:12,360 --> 03:31:15,880
on all the time and there's never any confusion and no one

4492
03:31:15,880 --> 03:31:19,760
ever is wondering about like who is or is not on the podcast

4493
03:31:19,760 --> 03:31:20,920
or why.

4494
03:31:20,920 --> 03:31:23,680
That's because everybody who listens to the podcast

4495
03:31:23,680 --> 03:31:27,480
follows us on Twitter at TP Crasnators and is a patron at

4496
03:31:27,480 --> 03:31:30,120
patreon.com slash the procrastinators where we keep

4497
03:31:30,120 --> 03:31:32,800
everybody abreast of everything that's going on down to the

4498
03:31:32,800 --> 03:31:34,320
smallest minutia.

4499
03:31:34,320 --> 03:31:39,160
Ab so literally if you're not even a patron, then you don't

4500
03:31:39,160 --> 03:31:41,320
even deserve to know what's happening, frankly.

4501
03:31:41,320 --> 03:31:42,400
No, that's fair.

4502
03:31:42,400 --> 03:31:44,960
And if you know, it's an accident and you weren't supposed

4503
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:51,640
to and also everyone probably sends voicemails to speakpike.com

4504
03:31:51,640 --> 03:31:54,240
slash PCP voicemail because I don't know if that's also a

4505
03:31:54,240 --> 03:31:56,800
cool thing, a cool thing to do if you want, if you want to get

4506
03:31:56,800 --> 03:31:59,000
your voice, listen to your voice and listen to your stupid

4507
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:01,200
bullshit, listen to your dumb bullshit on the show.

4508
03:32:01,200 --> 03:32:02,000
We'll do it.

4509
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:03,440
We'll do anything.

4510
03:32:03,440 --> 03:32:05,480
Um, anything else?

4511
03:32:08,320 --> 03:32:11,880
I'm pretty much by a t-shirt by I don't know if I'm up with

4512
03:32:11,880 --> 03:32:14,880
another dumb t-shirt idea this week, but we didn't.

4513
03:32:15,880 --> 03:32:20,040
Um, what if we just sell CyberShell t-shirts?

4514
03:32:21,320 --> 03:32:24,000
I don't think I even, like what my pay, I don't even know if I

4515
03:32:24,000 --> 03:32:26,600
own the rights to my own like avatar, you know, so that's

4516
03:32:26,600 --> 03:32:27,880
one reason I haven't sold merch.

4517
03:32:27,880 --> 03:32:28,880
I see.

4518
03:32:28,880 --> 03:32:32,000
Um, well, we'll come out of, we'll think of some way to

4519
03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:33,000
commodify you.

4520
03:32:34,520 --> 03:32:37,600
Just put the text CyberShell like on a plain white shirt.

4521
03:32:39,120 --> 03:32:42,200
Just taking, I'm being cool shirt, cross out cool and just

4522
03:32:42,200 --> 03:32:44,880
write CyberShell under it and you too can be

4523
03:32:44,880 --> 03:32:45,880
CyberShell.

4524
03:32:45,880 --> 03:32:47,440
I'm tempted to do it for real.

4525
03:32:49,600 --> 03:32:53,080
Every, every joke shirt I've ever like said in the last couple

4526
03:32:53,080 --> 03:32:54,400
weeks, you've just made real.

4527
03:32:54,800 --> 03:32:56,280
Yeah, it's fine.

4528
03:32:56,360 --> 03:32:57,680
It's it's the beauty of the internet.

4529
03:32:57,680 --> 03:33:00,000
You can just make these wallets to loop it all around.

4530
03:33:00,000 --> 03:33:01,880
You know, people wanted to have their little shirts when they

4531
03:33:01,880 --> 03:33:04,640
were peasants and, you know, you are actually allowing these

4532
03:33:04,640 --> 03:33:07,120
peasants who listen to the podcast to have that opportunity to

4533
03:33:07,120 --> 03:33:09,800
actually make the I have the bubonic plague shirt and send

4534
03:33:09,800 --> 03:33:12,400
them back in time to all the peasants who needed them.

4535
03:33:12,440 --> 03:33:15,880
Anyone, anyone could make these shirts

4536
03:33:15,880 --> 03:33:18,640
theoretically, but they wouldn't.

4537
03:33:19,640 --> 03:33:21,760
They became an or official realist.

4538
03:33:21,760 --> 03:33:23,840
Yeah, they could only spring.

4539
03:33:23,960 --> 03:33:27,480
They could only spring from a mind such as ours.

4540
03:33:27,480 --> 03:33:31,440
They could only spring from the well, the font of creativity

4541
03:33:31,720 --> 03:33:33,080
that is the PCP.

4542
03:33:33,080 --> 03:33:36,520
It could only emerge organically in this in this chemical soup

4543
03:33:36,520 --> 03:33:38,560
that we've created here of ideas.

4544
03:33:38,560 --> 03:33:42,080
We were the modern day Duchamp and the

4545
03:33:42,080 --> 03:33:44,200
Bay State t-shirt is our fountain.

4546
03:33:44,480 --> 03:33:47,200
Go give it all the credit it deserves.

4547
03:33:48,600 --> 03:33:51,280
It's it's about it's not about the shirt itself.

4548
03:33:51,280 --> 03:33:52,440
It's not about what's on the shirt.

4549
03:33:52,440 --> 03:33:55,120
It's about the context that the shirt exists within.

4550
03:33:55,560 --> 03:33:57,200
Indeed. Think of think about it.

4551
03:33:57,200 --> 03:33:58,760
Think about that.

4552
03:33:58,760 --> 03:34:02,560
All right, let's we've got three and a half hours in.

4553
03:34:02,560 --> 03:34:05,640
It's time to wrap this baby up.

4554
03:34:05,640 --> 03:34:07,360
We got fucking go.

4555
03:34:07,360 --> 03:34:08,000
We got to go.

4556
03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:10,080
That was a got to go fast.

4557
03:34:10,080 --> 03:34:11,960
I got to say for a guy that doesn't do podcasts.

4558
03:34:11,960 --> 03:34:13,280
I had a good time.

4559
03:34:13,280 --> 03:34:15,880
Can't believe we got we got Cybershell.

4560
03:34:15,880 --> 03:34:17,800
Cybershell never do pot does podcast.

4561
03:34:17,800 --> 03:34:18,920
We got him.

4562
03:34:18,920 --> 03:34:22,440
Yeah, he's you're going to have a hard time finding me on other podcasts.

4563
03:34:22,440 --> 03:34:25,000
Unless you're watching this video in like four or five years.
