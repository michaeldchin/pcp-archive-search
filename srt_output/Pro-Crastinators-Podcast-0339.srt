00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
I won't bless that guy. That son of a-

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,640
That son of a-

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,640
That son of a-

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,640
That son of a-

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,640
That son of a-

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,640
Son of a-

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,300
Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,800
The Pro, ah, Crastinators Podcast.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,300
Ben St. and Gibb and Tate are here after a one week hiatus.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,500
Was there a week hiatus?

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Well, there was a week between the last time we recorded and.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,240
Oh, I see.

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,000
The usual week, one week hiatus.

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,740
This is zero second hiatus.

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,100
We weren't we weren't gone.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,900
Well, we were recording.

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,500
We're just on schedule.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,300
Well, we're recording a day late because you were traveling or something.

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,940
I was sleepy is that's the truth.

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,940
That's the whole that's the whole thing.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,900
No, that's all there is to it.

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,700
I was coming home from camp and so we could record the normal time.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,240
Was it and it was going to be a later recording.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,340
But then I was like, was it the gunnery?

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,940
It wasn't a gunnery.

29
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,140
That's a summer camp.

30
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,640
It was just we have a Christmas camp as well.

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
A Christmas camp, which we just call Christmas camp.

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,240
It's just like in December get a, you know, everyone has a good old Christmas fun.

33
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,740
There's some activities and a Christmas dinner on the last day.

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,140
It's really just a stay for a night thing in like cabin somewhere.

35
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,200
Yeah.

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,940
OK, OK, like a family thing.

37
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,640
I know the it's the scout group.

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,600
Oh, yeah.

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,640
That I volunteer at.

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,040
So it's the same like general scout sort of stuff.

41
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,280
Yeah, help out with the other mentally disabled children.

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,280
And I make sure that they don't, you know, do anything fucking stupid.

43
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,580
Definitely, definitely.

45
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,380
I make sure they have a lovely time, but it was very fucking tiring

46
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,040
because there was a there was a kid who is very hyper

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,080
and needs constant supervision.

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,520
So I needed to do a lot of that.

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,920
And by the time I got back, I was like, fuck, I don't want to do a fucking podcast.

50
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,420
No, no.

51
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,580
OK, that makes that makes sense.

52
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,420
OK, I see. Yeah, I didn't know what you were up to.

53
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,120
I just knew you had come back from somewhere.

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Yeah, cool, cool, cool.

55
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,880
Oh, I finished your lecture.

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,120
I actually got to the end.

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,020
Yeah, how well, I mean, I hope you had a good time.

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,820
Hope you enjoyed learning about.

59
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,460
Yeah, stuff.

60
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,460
My favorite thing is is the connections from previous characters,

61
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,420
like the fact that, you know, everything's so connected.

62
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,220
Even though the generally the law is

63
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,820
or the story of each game is you're a little guy

64
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,760
and you've got to stop a certain number of similar guys that have different powers.

65
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,620
Yeah, go get them.

66
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,860
And like, that's every single game, but the story and the law is like

67
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,700
it keeps expanding on itself.

68
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,300
Yeah, I do like how like it goes from like there are humans

69
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,100
and they build robots and then there's the whole thing with the reploids

70
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,900
and then the carbons at the end.

71
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,860
Yeah, it's like, yeah, the what would happen if what would happen

72
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,200
if robots became so smart?

73
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,400
The the thing the thing about the carbons is that

74
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,560
because they were made like first.

75
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,400
So it's really it's really kind of tenuous to draw the connection.

76
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,360
You can kind of see it if you if you take a step back and look at the whole thing,

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,560
you can kind of see that they were doing something.

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,460
I hear people talk about the end of ZX Advent and be like, oh, well,

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,300
yeah, I think, you know, maybe.

80
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,360
Oh, all those like human body parts and the immortal reploid DNA

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,520
that he says he's got like somewhere in a vault somewhere.

82
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,160
Like maybe he used those to like build the first prototype

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,760
and throw units, which became the carbons.

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,020
And it's like, yeah, yeah, maybe.

85
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah, it's possibly.

86
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,960
But like, you know, who really knows?

87
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,420
Because like, yeah, the legends is like XXX DX.

88
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,260
Legends is way, way, way more than 9000 the year, 9999.

89
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,020
It could be. It could be.

90
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,060
But. Yeah, it was all.

91
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,760
But it was also made like before it was made before zero.

92
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,260
It was made before into creates started like zero and ZX.

93
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,160
So basically, Capcom told them like, yeah, OK, here's Mega Man X.

94
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,960
This is the the canon.

95
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
And then here's legends.

96
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,520
And we've decided that legends takes place in the future.

97
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,060
And we didn't think about it any further than that.

98
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,760
So just go wild.

99
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,160
And they were like into creates just kind of had to be like,

100
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,660
well, how can we how can we?

101
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,560
How can we establish some connections between these two things?

102
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
And they they did an admirable job.

103
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
And I think people are probably onto something with that thing

104
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,260
about like Thomas Thomas's threat at the end of ZX Advent

105
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,600
being related to the prototype and through a unit project.

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,260
That seems like it makes a lot of sense, but it is ultimately speculation.

107
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah, that's just I wish we got ZXC wish we got wish we got Legends three.

108
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Yeah, hearing from Twitch last week about the the the the the fall of Inafune

109
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,160
was really it's really depressing.

110
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,920
It's even it just gets more depressing the more I learn about it.

111
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,760
Yeah, I I mean.

112
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,620
I like what is Mega Man currently?

113
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,940
What is a Mega Man?

114
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,780
A mega pile of secret, a mega pile of mega lore.

115
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,220
A pile of scrap serotonium.

116
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,540
Like he he was fired or I forget.

117
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,340
But like basically fired from Capcom.

118
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,080
Yeah, for his for his for his cheeky monkey behavior

119
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,280
of of of of getting games made that are successful.

120
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
And they didn't like that.

121
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
But now what is the IP of Mega Man doing?

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,840
Has there been a game since he left or yeah?

123
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sitting on it.

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,040
Well, yes.

125
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,680
After he left, which I think was in around was it around like 2008,

126
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,600
2010, something like that?

127
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,200
Because that was when all the projects started getting canceled.

128
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,080
Yeah, there was.

129
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,000
I think after he left, they they did Mega Man not

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
well, nine and 10 and 11 have all come out in like not recently.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,040
But like, I think those are all post in a Fune.

132
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,760
At least 11 is post in a Fune, for sure.

133
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
OK.

134
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,240
That has.

135
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,160
Has it been 12 years since Mega Man 10?

136
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,040
What the fuck?

137
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,760
I remember Mega Man like being talked about on YouTube early on,

138
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,160
because like everyone likes Mega Man.

139
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,080
I never heard about it before.

140
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,200
I saw lots of like videos that YouTube music.

141
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
You'd never you'd never heard about it?

142
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,320
Never heard.

143
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,080
Well, maybe I'd seen him in like a gaming magazine,

144
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
but I didn't have an NES or any of that.

145
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,440
Oh, yeah. OK. Yeah.

146
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,960
I was I was growing up in the time where like Ray Man was the hot shit

147
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,760
and Tomb Raider was all over the place.

148
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,400
That's I mean, I had.

149
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,880
I had I had a like computer.

150
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,280
I had like a PC demo disc that had a bunch of game demos on them.

151
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,760
And I had a demo for Ray Man, I think the first Ray Man.

152
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,320
And it ran really badly on that computer.

153
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,160
So I thought Ray Man's.

154
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, yeah. Sucked ass because it was like at like 15 frames per second.

155
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
The PC port of Ray Man.

156
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,800
I don't know if it was a bad port, but I remember trying to play that

157
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,440
on a really shitty laptop and it just wasn't very good.

158
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,600
It was OK.

159
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,200
But, you know, I tried to play it and I played it a bit

160
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,960
and it was quite hard and the frame rate was bad.

161
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,000
And I think I don't know if I ever beat the demo or if I just gave up on it.

162
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,680
I think there were other games that I liked more.

163
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,840
But yeah, I remember Mega Man 10 or 9.

164
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,040
What was the newest like the old it was it was newly made,

165
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,360
but looks like an NES game. That was well, that was 9 and 10.

166
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,280
Yeah. So I remember that those coming out and being everyone being like,

167
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,240
oh, my God, they're doing it. Yeah.

168
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,120
But it's old fashioned.

169
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,400
I'm like, who's Mega Man?

170
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,640
And they said, shut the fuck up, get out of here, get out the fuck out of our forum.

171
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,480
You idiot. Mm hmm.

172
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,720
They were right. They were right to say it.

173
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,200
Or wait, no, eight. Eight was the one.

174
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,560
Eight was in. Eight was in 97 or 96.

175
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,840
Oh, my God. And then nine was in nine was the first retro one

176
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,880
or the first recent retro one in 2008, 14 years ago.

177
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,440
So not that recent.

178
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,080
And then 10 was in, I think it was in 2010.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,280
And then they didn't do it for like literally 10 years.

180
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,240
These yeah, 10 was in 2010 and 11.

181
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,120
No, 11 was in 2018.

182
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,360
They went eight years without a new Mega Man game.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,960
And then they went and they've gone another

184
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,320
they've gone another four or five years since then or four.

185
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,800
Oh, yeah, four years.

186
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,080
But apparently there is and I heard this in my discord.

187
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,280
Apparently there is internal documents talking about something

188
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,120
that is internally referred to by something called,

189
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,520
and I hope I remember this correctly.

190
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,480
I think it was called like Mega Man, Tensai.

191
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,240
And that's not an official name.

192
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,600
It's just an internal name for something.

193
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,360
But apparently whatever it is has the biggest budget

194
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,960
of any Mega Man game ever made.

195
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,800
So something is being worked on, which is very.

196
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,760
Omega Man, it's a new Mega Man.

197
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,760
And he's going to be Omega and Oh, zero.

198
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,360
I'm thinking of another thing for zero equivalent.

199
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Well, you know, I mean, there is Omega.

200
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,480
Oh, I didn't know.

201
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,720
You will you fail the let you.

202
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,720
This is a test that you failed.

203
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,360
You got to watch the lecture again.

204
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,120
Do you? Yeah.

205
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,720
When, when, you know, when Dr.

206
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,880
Vile, when Dr.

207
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,720
Vile, you know, stole zero's body and turned it into Omega

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,680
as part of the Alpezo project, Project Alpezo.

209
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,400
I forgot he called it Omega.

210
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,040
Was that? Wait, what was the what was the zero

211
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,680
that was like a empty shell like it was just the body

212
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,000
and the soul was somewhere else?

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,040
Yes, that's Omega. That's Omega.

214
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
It's it's not it's not empty.

215
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,920
It has like a soul, but it's just evil.

216
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,480
It might be like zero's original personality,

217
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
or it might just be like a different entity.

218
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
So it's unclear.

219
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,760
OK.

220
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,640
But yeah, that's Omega law instead.

221
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,640
It's it's got to be I feel like it's got to be either

222
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,920
Mega Man 11 or sorry, Mega Man 12 or Mega Man X nine.

223
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,760
Why would Mega Man 12?

224
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
It's such a huge budget, though.

225
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,080
Well, it would be an NES style.

226
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,480
Well, it wouldn't because I mean, you know,

227
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,280
Mega Man 11 is not in the NES.

228
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, Mega Man 11 is like.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,880
They they they might have you not see Mega Man 11.

230
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,000
No, it's like it's 3D.

231
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,000
It's kind of got a new it's pretty modern looking.

232
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,680
I assumed all the new classic Mega Man entries were throwbacks.

233
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,760
No, nine and 10 were.

234
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,720
But 11 was they sort of modernized it.

235
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,960
And, you know, if you don't know,

236
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,080
just like I think we said this on the show,

237
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,040
like a month ago, Mega Man 11 became the best selling Mega Man ever

238
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,400
for basically the series entire history.

239
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,480
Mega Man two was the best selling Mega Man ever.

240
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,360
No other entry ever eclipsed it.

241
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,840
And then 11 just did, which is like a huge deal.

242
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,480
So it doesn't it doesn't I mean, from a business perspective,

243
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,000
it's not that shocking if they're like, well, we got to do another one.

244
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,200
And I think it's got to be it's just got to be 12, right?

245
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,520
Like it's got to be 12 or maybe X nine.

246
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,240
Because like, yeah, you know, the market has shown that the demand is there.

247
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,040
Yeah, I wonder because like all the

248
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,920
like not spin-offs, but like new parts of the the franchise,

249
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,040
the X, the zero ZX legends, they're like

250
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
they're more lore heavy than the classic one,

251
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,000
which is just sort of a monster of the week kind of, you know,

252
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
while he's back at it again, beat him up pretty much.

253
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,920
More like like, you know, Fune would not be needed

254
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,360
for a classic Mega Man.

255
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,640
I mean, as much not that they necessarily need him at all.

256
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,120
But like, yeah, I think they wanted to follow on like the story that he'd written.

257
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Oh, yeah. You know, there were there's making an X game would be difficult

258
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,280
without any input from him.

259
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,360
I mean, I don't know if into creates is still working for Capcom,

260
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,320
but like if they could get if they could get into creates to just do

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,080
to do whatever game they're doing next,

262
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,760
I feel like that's that's going to work just fine,

263
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,400
because they made a bunch of really good a bunch of really good Mega Man games.

264
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,360
And yeah, I don't I mean, they made I think they made nine and 10 and 11

265
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
without Inafune, I think so.

266
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,960
Yeah, that's it's doable.

267
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
That's doable.

268
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,960
Well, I mean, I'm hoping that whenever whatever that big project

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,400
is that's being worked on internally, it'd be cool if it comes out

270
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,040
and it would be even cooler if it gives my video a big algorithm boost.

271
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,560
And everyone's like, oh, my God, X nine is here.

272
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,800
I can't believe it.

273
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,240
We can revisit my favorite character, Axel.

274
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,840
Finally, we can return we can return to a trans what we can once again

275
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,720
step into Axel's shoes and a trans our enemies.

276
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,840
Yes, finally, there should be

277
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,800
a new character called Falsetto.

278
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,480
And she's a she's a she's a woman.

279
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,520
Falsetto feels.

280
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,680
That's like a base counterpart base and Falsetto base should come back.

281
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,080
Base I don't know.

282
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,840
Base should come.

283
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,160
Genuinely, base should have been in Mega Man 11.

284
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,280
And I don't know why he wasn't in it.

285
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,440
He wasn't even in deals.

286
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,040
It's actually kind of fucked up that base is nowhere in Mega Man 11.

287
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,120
You get Proto Man, get base, you get Quint, you get zero.

288
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,880
You get everyone who isn't Mega Man likes all of the shadow of the Hedgehog

289
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,920
characters, put them all together in one game.

290
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,360
Oh, and Proto Man and Proto Man was not in 11 either.

291
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,400
This is so fucked up.

292
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,720
This is so fucked up.

293
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,280
What were they thinking?

294
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,520
Games, games, trash, games, trash, trash, trash.

295
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,680
Um, yeah, if I play a Mega Man game, I will probably.

296
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,200
Well, I don't know, would you say I should start with zero because

297
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,520
they're a that's a good, like self-contained series.

298
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,400
That's the impression I got.

299
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,800
They are good.

300
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,120
They're really hard.

301
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,600
They're some of the hardest games in the whole series.

302
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,600
If I'm being if I'm being frank with you.

303
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,040
Dang.

304
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,080
Yeah, I think I think it's generally agreed that those are like.

305
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,520
Some of the some of the classic ones might be equally hard, just basically out

306
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,640
of like poor balancing, the zero games are like hard on purpose.

307
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,920
I'll be I'll be frank.

308
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,880
I used I use save states.

309
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,760
I use quite a bit in my in my revisit of the series because I just didn't want

310
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,960
to replay levels over and over again to get that.

311
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,160
Truly the most valid way to play games that suck if you don't.

312
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Absolutely, absolutely.

313
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
Games, I already beat the level.

314
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,160
I beat the level.

315
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,960
Get out of my get off my case.

316
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,560
The the it's so weird.

317
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,680
OK, Mega Man Zero has this scoring system that gives you a rank.

318
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,720
I don't know if we mentioned this in the lecture, but it's really funny.

319
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,160
It has a scoring system that gives you a rank and it gives you a code name

320
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,520
based on a combination of your rank and on like certain metrics.

321
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,280
Like if you kill lots of enemies, it gives you you get one code name.

322
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,680
If you heavily favor one weapon or another weapon, it gives you a different

323
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,520
code name and they can give you some really funny ones like like a wounded

324
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,600
edge boy or or or stuff like that.

325
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,080
But it also like punishes you for like playing the game.

326
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,880
Like if you use cyber elves, it's it's really hard.

327
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,760
It's really hard to like get cyber elves.

328
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,680
You have to feed them crystals and they're very expensive and they don't do that much.

329
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,520
Like they're pretty minor buffs, except for the really expensive ones.

330
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,800
So but if you use cyber elves, it like hurts your rank.

331
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,920
And it's the game just like don't you don't use the mechanic that we've made

332
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,520
gave you to make the game easier.

333
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,000
And in and in zero two, it's really annoying because, OK,

334
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,360
zero two actually has a sort of Mega Man

335
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,720
ask like you gain the enemy's weapon when you kill the the boss.

336
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,760
Like there are a bunch of like alternate attack modes that zero can unlock.

337
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,880
But you only unlock them if you beat the level with an A rank or better,

338
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,200
like an A or S rank.

339
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,440
And your rank is cumulative.

340
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,840
So if you like start out doing bad, like if you get a C rank on the first

341
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,520
on the first level, if you or if you get ranked badly on the first level,

342
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,440
like even if you do better on the next level, because rank is cumulative,

343
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,880
you still won't get the level because it'll average your your ranks out.

344
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,000
And it'll be like, oh, well, you did an A rank on this level,

345
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,120
but because you had C before it averages out to a B.

346
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,680
So sorry, you don't get the enemy weapon.

347
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,120
So you go the whole game with a shitty rank

348
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,280
and you don't get get any of the alternate fire or like special weapons at all.

349
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,160
And the game sucks.

350
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,200
Game is fucking asked and it's dog.

351
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Can you not can you not go back?

352
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,680
Is there no and you can't go back?

353
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,760
No, you can't go back.

354
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,920
You you can return back to the level,

355
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,960
but it doesn't give you like a new like rank because it's not like a mission

356
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,840
because like there's no boss at the end.

357
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,520
It's just you just walk around the level and like find items if you want to.

358
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,640
Oh, so that's the sort of game where like.

359
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,840
Like if you're doing badly, you just die and game over.

360
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,760
I mean, it's perfectly it's perfectly none of the alternate

361
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,960
like fire modes or the alternate attack modes are like game breaking

362
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
or like that much better than the regular one.

363
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,720
So it's not like it cripples you and makes the game really hard.

364
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,840
If you don't get them, it's just lame that.

365
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,560
It's just lame that you don't get them unless you meet this

366
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,560
like very specific and somewhat arbitrary thing.

367
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,320
You should just fucking get them for beating the bosses.

368
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
I'm sorry.

369
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,720
But it's it's it's perfectly it's perfectly doable to beat the game

370
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,080
without that stuff, but they are they are helpful.

371
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,080
Sometimes. Yeah, see ranking and scores.

372
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,440
I usually I'm like, yeah, whatever, I'm going to get a low score.

373
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,240
I'm going to get a low.

374
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,560
Oh, yeah, because I suck.

375
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,640
No, yeah, but but if I when I was doing when I was doing

376
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,400
actually important, I did not give a shit.

377
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,960
I did not give a shit about the rank, which was fine, except in zero,

378
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,040
two, which for some reason, gates like these fun little things

379
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,400
behind your stupid rank.

380
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,640
You're not allowed to have fun unless you have pain first.

381
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,320
You're not allowed to have fun.

382
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,480
You're not allowed to have fun unless you're a supreme edge man.

383
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
No wounded edge boys allowed.

384
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,880
Only supreme edge men can answer the secret clubhouse.

385
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Uh.

386
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,240
And then three is the perfect video game.

387
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,840
And then four is almost as good, except it's really weird

388
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,840
and they give you a stupid special weapon that sucks.

389
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,040
But the game is like, no, it insists that it's good, even though it's bad.

390
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,880
OK, I'm I'm I'm realizing now that like your lecture on the lore of Megman

391
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,880
has almost nothing to do with the enjoyment found in the game.

392
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,920
Although you did talk me into playing legends at some point.

393
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,160
So I will try that.

394
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,360
Oh, you definitely sound fun.

395
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,920
You definitely should. You definitely should play legends.

396
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,640
I did. Yeah, I didn't really. Yeah.

397
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,760
I mean, as the as the title says, yeah, it's about it's lore.

398
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
It's lore focused.

399
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Didn't really talk about the mechanics of the game, except to complain

400
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,080
about Axel's a trans and how it doesn't do anything.

401
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,080
There's no point.

402
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,440
There's no freaking point, man.

403
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,120
Does Axel have a little buddy called Grease?

404
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,680
Unfortunately, no.

405
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,600
Also, it's spelled AXL.

406
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,680
It's not spelled AXEL.

407
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,480
Because he's too cool. He's too cool for vowels.

408
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,280
He's actually not the game.

409
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
The game doesn't treat him like he's super cool.

410
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,320
The game mostly treats him like he's a a spunky brat.

411
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
So, I don't know, whatever.

412
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,880
Well, uh, well, hey, hell, yeah, glad you watched that.

413
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,800
You know, who else watched that?

414
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,240
Hundreds of thousands of people, two hundred and fifty,

415
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,800
a quarter million other people.

416
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,120
It just it just last night, it hit a quarter million

417
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,680
and it has officially it has surpassed

418
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,520
Kokoro Wish and Sonichu 102 and become my third most viewed video

419
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,000
passed after, you know, Sonichu 101 and Tales Get Strolled.

420
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,200
So. Good job.

421
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,520
It's great. It's amazing. Yeah, thank you.

422
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,120
I wonder if it will.

423
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,080
I wonder if it will eventually surpass Tales Get Strolled.

424
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,880
Maybe. Maybe if it gets a big.

425
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,000
It could. I mean, I'll go boost at some point.

426
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,120
I've seen people who are just like excited to see a long video.

427
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,760
So I feel like people would more likely click on an eight hour

428
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,400
big obsessive video game thing.

429
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,560
You know, I was looking at my metrics and I saw,

430
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,800
you know, how it shows you like views per.

431
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,640
You can see that you can see how many views it's gotten per hour

432
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,520
for the last 48 hours. Yeah.

433
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,880
Well, I was looking at that and I noticed that like a lot on several times,

434
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,000
there's like a spike in views around like seven PM, eight PM.

435
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,080
And I and I wonder if that's like, oh, this is these are the people

436
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,000
that like use these videos to go to sleep.

437
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,280
That's great. It might be.

438
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,840
It might be.

439
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,080
I don't have I might have said this already, but I don't get it.

440
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,760
I don't really get I can't I can't use videos of someone talking to go to sleep.

441
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,600
It doesn't work for me.

442
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,240
But people say that they do that.

443
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,200
So, you know, I think that might be those people.

444
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,240
Sometimes when I'm in bed and I've got my phone,

445
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,280
I'll be clicking on YouTube videos, not necessarily looking for something

446
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,520
to make me fall asleep, but I end up being sleepy.

447
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,960
And then I'm like, oh, shit.

448
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,640
I wasn't paying attention to any of the last like minute.

449
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,320
I should turn this off.

450
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,880
And that's how I know when I should go to bed.

451
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,160
But go to sleep, actually, you know, I said in the video,

452
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,320
like leave a comment and I'll try to answer questions.

453
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,040
But there's like so many comments

454
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,760
that I mentioned that like the video's comment ratio is really high.

455
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,920
Like it's it's it's my most common.

456
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,160
It quickly became my it's my second most commented video.

457
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,920
And it's it's it's definitely going to get more comments

458
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,160
eventually than the than the Son of Chew lecture.

459
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,960
Like people just can't stop commenting on this thing,

460
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,960
which is which is probably doing a lot for it algorithmically, which is nice.

461
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,240
So I I've tried to answer like some I've responded to some.

462
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
But like.

463
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,240
They just keep coming and they don't stop coming, you know.

464
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,520
Do you have metrics for how long the average

465
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,440
like view like watch time is?

466
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,080
Yeah, where do people leave if they leave?

467
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,520
I assume most people like the majority would stay for the whole thing.

468
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,040
But just in chunks, I think it's actually.

469
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
It's actually, I think.

470
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,920
I think people actually like tend to click off it pretty fast.

471
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,560
Like I think I think the I think like I think the watch time drops off

472
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,800
like really fast, like at the beginning, which is a bit.

473
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,720
Sounds bad, but I mean, I think I think it's it's mostly because you you

474
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,160
lead with the talk of lectures and the PCP and hey, guys, well, you know, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,040
Well, look, I'll show I'll show you the graph.

476
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Oh, shit, insider info.

477
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,280
Oh, these are you can post it on screen if you want.

478
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,800
You can we can we can public this private insider info if you want.

479
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
It's fine.

480
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,920
Where is it? Here we go.

481
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:19,120
Yeah, as as you can see, there is a big I mean, every video is like this to some extent.

482
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,440
There is a big drop off right at the very beginning.

483
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,960
You know, it quickly it quickly falls to like 20 percent or so.

484
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,160
And then it actually recovers a little bit.

485
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,280
And I'm pretty sure that's people taking my recommendation and clicking

486
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,760
the like skip ahead to where the actual game discussion starts.

487
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
You know.

488
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,200
So there's like a 40 percent drop off of all people.

489
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,560
I did.

490
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:55,360
So do you know how if those people leave very quickly, if they're counted as views?

491
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Or is that information?

492
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,040
I think they are.

493
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,640
I think they are because I know that views are separate from unique viewers

494
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,720
because I know that the video has around 100,000 unique viewers.

495
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
So.

496
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah, I think I think that one account

497
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,840
revisiting the same video multiple times does count as multiple views.

498
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,960
I I think I would imagine so.

499
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,520
Yeah, pretty pretty sure.

500
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,400
Well, let's let me let me show you.

501
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,880
OK, here's the similar metric for the Kokoro wish lecture.

502
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,120
Just to give a side by side comparison.

503
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,880
I know I've definitely done that thing where I'm like scrolling through

504
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,680
videos and like I click on something thinking, yeah, this might be interesting.

505
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,040
And as soon as it's finished loading, I'm like, actually, I don't want to and I leave.

506
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,760
I'm pretty sure that doesn't count as a view because it's like half a second.

507
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,360
But who knows?

508
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,560
I'm I'm looking at that.

509
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,640
OK, the stupid stupid discord is taking a second to process this image.

510
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,160
But looking at the Mega Man graph, I'm not sure what those like big spikes at the end are.

511
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,840
I, well, I'm curious about that as well.

512
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,840
But I did notice there's a bit where it could be that the people's favorite games

513
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,480
they want you to talk about and they click on that time code.

514
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,520
Who would that be?

515
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,720
Yeah, let me because I saw there was a part near the end half

516
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,840
where it's like most rewatched place, you know, the little bumpy line

517
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,400
that sometimes videos have where it's like, oh, this is the place

518
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,160
this is the place that people always click on to go see again.

519
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,800
It was near the end.

520
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,600
It could be the similar place six.

521
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,200
Let's see. The first bike is at 603.

522
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,360
Thirty one. OK.

523
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,360
So that's a little that's that first spike is around.

524
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,800
Or just or slightly after.

525
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,520
Mega Man zero fourth.

526
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,400
It's in the Mega Man zero four section. OK.

527
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,560
And then the second big spike is at 63311.

528
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,640
And that is at what am I talking about then?

529
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
Six thirty three.

530
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,120
That's just before I start talking about Mega Man X seven.

531
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,800
But it's not at the exact like time codes.

532
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,360
It's not the exact time when like you can click the little chapter starter

533
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,440
and it starts the chapter there.

534
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,120
So I'm not really sure.

535
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,120
Maybe they manually click on the time code area.

536
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,480
Like on the bar, an average, an average of people clicking around

537
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
the also spike.

538
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,040
Also, I have not looked at the.

539
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,920
Oh, my God.

540
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,560
Yeah, the the view like the viewer retention graph on the timeline is like,

541
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,200
yeah, it's big spikes like like huge spikes comparatively around.

542
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,880
Yeah, the trend, the end of Mega Man zero four and the start of Mega Man X seven.

543
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,800
OK. Or no, no, no, they love that they love it.

544
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,880
They want it, whatever it is.

545
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,640
It's no, it's it's X eight.

546
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,400
It's the start of X eight.

547
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,520
Why? It's not even at the very.

548
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,120
It's just kind of like towards the beginning slash middle part of X eight.

549
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,400
That's that's the the the money zone.

550
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,680
That's the the hotspot.

551
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,800
You know what they you know what the people want now.

552
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,280
It's the part where I'm talking about like rockets and the and the the orbital elevator.

553
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Huh.

554
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Weird, crazy.

555
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Crazy.

556
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,280
Anyway, anyway, to the graph, yeah.

557
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,640
Like, look at this, the Kokura wish, like the Mega Man lecture.

558
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,880
OK, now on the one hand, like the numbers are stretched out.

559
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,280
So it might be a bit deceptive and you might it might be like.

560
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,480
OK, like, yeah, they both kind of drop off really quick at the beginning,

561
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,320
but the the the Mega Man drops off much faster.

562
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,600
But actually, it's like kind of eight times slower than that

563
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,760
because the video is so much longer.

564
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,400
But yeah, the Kokura wish like quickly drops to about 33 percent.

565
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,120
And then there's that little kind of dip around the halfway mark.

566
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,320
And you know what that is?

567
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,160
What? That's the the part where I show the the little video,

568
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,400
like the game that she made, the little two zero and adventure game with the music.

569
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,120
How people skip through that?

570
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,000
I think I think people skip through that.

571
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,880
What was it called?

572
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,480
I'm pretty Halcyon.

573
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,480
Halcyon days. No, no.

574
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,320
What was wrong?

575
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,920
The pink girl, fuck, I'm blanking on what the pink girl's name is.

576
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,680
You know, the one spinel. No.

577
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,960
But she's got that name that means purple.

578
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,840
J.D.R. Pink Girl YouTube.

579
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,320
Help me. No, I mean, Google, help me.

580
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,120
Simply go to your own video.

581
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,720
No, I don't.

582
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
How?

583
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,840
No, what's the name?

584
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
I don't want.

585
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,640
All right, to give up.

586
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,880
Got to watch your own lecture.

587
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,920
I can't give the covid brain, the covid brain fog has come back.

588
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,000
No, this is the Mega Man thing.

589
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,520
You've you've filled it with Mega Man knowledge now.

590
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,760
Some other knowledge is gone.

591
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,040
Heliotrope, pastel defender heliotrope.

592
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,680
That's the one. Oh, you.

593
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,480
I know the name. I just haven't met the man.

594
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,800
Well, you were.

595
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Yeah, you did.

596
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,000
Maybe you haven't rewatched that video because you were there.

597
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
And I haven't rewatched the video.

598
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,520
It's been a long time.

599
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,720
It's the pink hair.

600
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,640
With the comic either.

601
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,000
This the superhero girl.

602
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,080
That's like the puppet that the guy put the the glowing orb in.

603
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,680
Oh, yeah, the sex doll that became his daughter.

604
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,440
Based anyway.

605
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,040
Yeah, that's the there's there's a musical when it's not musical,

606
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,760
but there's a part where I play a like video sort of like

607
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,760
video game bit in the middle to show it off.

608
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,520
And yeah, people click through that.

609
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,440
And then, yeah, versus on this one,

610
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,800
it like immediately drops to like 20 percent or even down to 15 percent.

611
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,160
And then it recovers up to like 30 ish.

612
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,480
What's that first little spike in the Mega Man?

613
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,440
Oh, you mean not the one at the very beginning,

614
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
but like kind of a third in? Yeah, yeah.

615
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,920
And is that where you start talking about X or something?

616
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,480
Yeah, analytics tab.

617
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,760
That's at two hours and twenty two minutes.

618
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
So that is.

619
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,720
No, that's some that's in between when I'm talking about Mega Man X

620
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,160
and Mega Man to the power fighters.

621
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
No, sorry, Mega Man seven.

622
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,280
But between Mega Man seven and Mega Man to the power fighters.

623
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,120
Yeah, I don't know why there's a spike there.

624
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,840
It's very strange.

625
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,720
Oh, speaking of why, it's not really much to say,

626
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,280
but like Mega Man knowledge has made me like, oh,

627
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,120
I remember when Game Grumps played Mega Man seven,

628
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,600
that was like the first game they played and I go back.

629
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,200
And it's like, oh, I remember this. This was good.

630
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,400
Why is this not a thing anymore? Dang it.

631
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,040
Mega Man's happening and they're just chilling out and joking.

632
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,280
Were they playing Mega Man seven, you said? Was that the one?

633
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,280
Yeah, it's like got the guy with the big chin robot.

634
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,520
Guts, man, all thing.

635
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,320
Not Guts, man, the the guy who sells stuff.

636
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,360
Oh, auto. Yeah, I recognize him in the lecture

637
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,440
when you play to demand. It's like, wait, I know that guy.

638
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
That's from Game Grumps.

639
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,280
That's the guy in the Game Grumps play through.

640
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,320
There's, oh, you know, it's like,

641
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,920
oh, Protoman told you to burn the trees in the forest.

642
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,360
And there was that whole bit.

643
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,920
They did seven asses is from that game.

644
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,880
Do you remember seven asses?

645
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,520
Do you ever watch?

646
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,080
Wait, you watch Game Grumps at the time?

647
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,680
I I've definitely heard seven asses before.

648
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,280
Yeah, it was it was a moment in the Mega Man seven that I didn't

649
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,440
realize at the time, but I'd since realized that

650
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,360
like John was playing and Aaron was looking up

651
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,360
which tree to burn to get a specific item.

652
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:48,920
Yes.

653
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,680
But they didn't want to say they were like looking at a walkthrough.

654
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,600
So John said, how much ass do you think Mega Man gets?

655
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,480
And Aaron says seven.

656
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,800
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven asses.

657
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
And it's the seventh tree, I guess.

658
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,120
I might have watched that video because I definitely remember that

659
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,480
or I might have seen it in a clip compilation or something.

660
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,520
But OK, the thing about auto and I'm hazyly remembering this,

661
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,640
I might get some details wrong.

662
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,280
But I think it's in Mega Man.

663
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,200
I think it's it might be in the one with cutscenes or it might be in.

664
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,040
No, it's in it's I think it's in one of the X games.

665
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,840
It might be an X for there's like an anime cutscene

666
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,360
and you can see auto in one of the cutscenes.

667
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,440
And it's and it's like auto is like cannon in in X.

668
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,040
But only in a cutscene and it's and it's like an Easter egg.

669
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,360
But he's there.

670
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,120
And it's a little wacky.

671
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,320
Hang on.

672
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,880
More like auto erotic

673
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,800
asphyxiation, am I right?

674
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,080
Yes, yes, yes.

675
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,200
That's right.

676
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,560
That's right.

677
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Very good.

678
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,000
He just chokes you.

679
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
He just chokes you.

680
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,640
And that's what that's that's how that's the game.

681
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,640
Oh, no, no, no, he has.

682
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,720
Auto has a small cameo in Volt Catfish's introduction scene

683
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,320
in the PlayStation Sega Saturn PC and Mega Man X collection versions of Mega Man X3.

684
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,520
Oh, it's in like a re-release.

685
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,040
It's in like an additional cut an additional cutscene

686
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,360
attitude to a re-release of X3.

687
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,040
He's like he's like sitting in the background.

688
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,920
He's like sitting in like a in like a Japanese style house,

689
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,240
like sitting on the tatami mats, watching TV or something.

690
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,160
And then Volt Catfish like swoops out in front and goes like,

691
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,320
die, Volt Catfish, die.

692
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,360
OK, that's debatably canon.

693
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,120
The fact that it's a remake makes me mistrustful.

694
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,120
Remake, more like P make.

695
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,000
I I urinate on this game.

696
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,840
I love when my video gets views and I love money and power.

697
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,040
I love clout.

698
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,680
This is just what Dr. Wiley would say.

699
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,560
Yeah, well.

700
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,560
What of it?

701
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,800
Maybe he had some maybe he would maybe he had some points after all.

702
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,800
But what would you say would say?

703
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,120
I love Dr. Wiley.

704
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,640
There's some things I love about Dr. Wiley.

705
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,640
He made some good points.

706
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,000
You know, he was just looking out for his for his robots.

707
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,640
You know, he made some mistakes, but haven't we all?

708
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:03,960
You know, I'm just thinking of like of like a YouTube version of Mega Man,

709
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,320
where like Dr. Light is a YouTuber and Dr. Wiley re re uploads the video,

710
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,560
but he changes it, changes it to make it evil.

711
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,120
I'm thinking about I'm thinking about a future because like we're getting on

712
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,840
towards 20 X DX already.

713
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,880
I'm thinking about a future where like Dr.

714
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,880
Light and Dr. Wiley are like guests on the Joe Rogan podcast,

715
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,920
like arguing about like whether I don't know,

716
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,200
like whether the double gear system is like the future of robotics or something.

717
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,480
You're thinking of using two gears.

718
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,320
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

719
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,480
What we don't like is like, you know, the the human, you know, a police human,

720
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,840
the robot police, the robots, the police are using now are too dangerous.

721
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,280
They they kill indiscriminately.

722
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,000
You know, we've got to we've got to build robots that can that can make

723
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,840
moral judgment.

724
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,400
We've got to advance AI to the point that they can they have human intelligence.

725
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,800
They can make moral judgment or something.

726
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Dr. Wiley, let me go back to you.

727
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,640
Let me go back to where you were saying you.

728
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,760
You're saying you want to add a second gear.

729
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,400
You're talking. You're saying you had two gears, though.

730
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,080
That blows my mind that I've seen one gear.

731
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:18,200
One gear I've seen before this little this little what do you call

732
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,240
the the Boston Dynamics dog?

733
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,240
There's a really I know that was a really weak Joe Rogan impression.

734
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,280
I'm sorry. I'm not that familiar with the man's work.

735
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,800
He just sort of is a big guy.

736
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,840
And he mumbles, isn't that the truth?

737
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,120
I yeah, there's not really like anything that distinct about the way he talks.

738
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,080
It's it's mostly his mic quality.

739
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,200
It's like the radio voice, like the the ASMR deep guy.

740
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,880
And he's just sort of like, wow, wow.

741
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,560
Yeah.

742
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Oh, this is it.

743
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,360
Yeah, that's really that's really important.

744
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,880
That sounds like it sounds like your team is doing really important work.

745
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Hey, you guys ever try DMZ?

746
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,720
You got you guys ever take mushrooms?

747
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,360
I don't know. That's my best.

748
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,360
That's my best. That's my best impression.

749
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,680
Dr. Light would make the little Boston Dynamics robot to like,

750
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,000
oh, it's stack books on shelves.

751
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,200
Isn't he a good boy?

752
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
Isn't he a good dog?

753
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Mm hmm. Yeah, pretty good dog.

754
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,520
And then Dr.

755
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,080
Wiley would make it pee on and take a shit all over the floor.

756
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,840
I've added we've added poop and pee technology

757
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,600
to bring to bring humans and robots closer to get closer than ever.

758
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,560
Uh, Dr.

759
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,080
Master Thomas at the end of Mega Man ZX

760
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:49,080
ZX Advent, hmm, Master Mikhail, you know, we've since the equality laws,

761
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,680
humans and robots, you know, we for equality, humans no longer poop and pee.

762
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,600
But what do you think we did with all that poop and pee, huh?

763
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,440
What do you think?

764
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,320
Do you think we just knew we were going to use it for something?

765
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,400
We're going to use all that poop and pee.

766
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,440
It didn't just go away.

767
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,080
We saved it. We saved it.

768
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,080
It's the future, Master Mikhail.

769
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,160
Oh, no, what do you think we did with all the poop and pee?

770
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,440
We've condensed it into a new material that we can use to make new robots.

771
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,360
Robots made of poop and pee.

772
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,720
We call them.

773
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,720
We call we would use to build who build Elysium.

774
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,000
This is the future.

775
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Uh, uh.

776
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,480
Diarrhea.

777
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,960
Lol. OK.

778
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,480
Hey, Lois. Diarrhea.

779
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,800
Hey, Wiley. What? Diarrhea.

780
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,280
Mega Man has infinite possibilities.

781
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,920
And this is what we choose.

782
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,520
That's why his name is X. That's why his name is X.

783
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,920
He doesn't have a code number.

784
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,000
He doesn't have a Wiley number.

785
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,280
He has the variable X because he can be anything.

786
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,440
Give. Do you understand?

787
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,280
Do you understand?

788
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Could there not be a Mega Man Y?

789
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,280
I.

790
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,600
I guess, you know, there's a there's a in like the toy line.

791
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,480
There is a, you know, you know how in Kingdom Hearts, right?

792
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,200
There's there's there's key like the key blade.

793
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,760
Some key blade.

794
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,000
Some some say Kai, but the meaning is the same.

795
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
Yeah.

796
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,840
And, you know, well, there's there's a there's like a dark evil X called

797
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,680
called Kai. Mega Man Ki.

798
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,640
Yeah, I think.

799
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,800
Yeah, some say key, but the meaning is the same.

800
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,640
Mega Man Eeks.

801
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,120
What's his? He has a slightly more long name than that.

802
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,760
Magnificent man.

803
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,200
He's like a dark copy of X and he's like gold and black.

804
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
Metal X.

805
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,320
Wait a minute. OK, there's also.

806
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,800
Oh, God, fucking damn it.

807
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,840
In the cards in in like the in the Mega Man in the Rockman X Mega Mission

808
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,160
like card series, there's one called how the fuck do you pronounce this?

809
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,360
OK, all right.

810
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:31,920
So X, his name in Japanese is pronounced X, right?

811
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,320
Like it's just the Japaneseization of the pronunciation of the letters X.

812
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,560
Well, this guy is called what the fuck?

813
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,400
This guy is called Iksu and it's spelled like this.

814
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,520
It's spelled like this.

815
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,480
It's spelled like this.

816
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,440
Eeks.

817
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,640
So this guy is from the card and he's an evil doppelganger of X,

818
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,400
right? And then there's OK.

819
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,040
Well, I you could read that as nine because of the Roman numeral.

820
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,880
I think that would be going against the wishes of the of the Greek.

821
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,800
And then there's this guy who is from the toy series.

822
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,160
And this guy, OK, in spite of the way his name is spelled,

823
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,360
his name is just pronounced Kai.

824
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,280
It's not pronounced X, Kai or key, Kai.

825
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,680
It's just Kai.

826
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,600
But you spell it like that as though you're meant to say it twice.

827
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,880
Kai, Kai.

828
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,440
And this guy is he's not a doppelganger.

829
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,560
He's a prototype copy.

830
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,360
He's a prototype copy of the original game.

831
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,520
So he maybe he's related to copy X.

832
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,040
From the other more fucking Mega Man

833
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,960
and then there are Pokemon like so many of these guys.

834
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,760
No, there's not a thousand.

835
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,880
There's not a thousand different Mavericks or Reploids.

836
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,040
I'm going to have to say probably not.

837
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,920
I mean, I guess there are lots of like generic background.

838
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,760
Reploids.

839
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,240
So like all of the ones, all of the ones in the lecture

840
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,120
is just the ones in the video games.

841
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,480
But then there's the I guess a card game and like the comics.

842
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,360
And yeah, most of those are most of those are repeats, though.

843
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Most characters and Mavericks like reoccur in the different,

844
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,160
you know, cards and games and stuff.

845
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,080
Each each each version has like a few new

846
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,560
dudes, a few new a few new dudes.

847
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,760
And I guess they're all I guess they were all the sub bosses.

848
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,640
Like, you know, there's like the the block Golem.

849
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,720
I wonder if you added up like all the different.

850
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,840
I mean, if you added up all the different enemies,

851
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,000
there probably are more robots in Mega Man than there are Pokemon

852
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,600
because each Pokemon is like a little bit more robustly fleshed out

853
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,880
than a rank and file enemy in the Mega Man series.

854
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,680
Like a little propeller with eyes from Mega Man.

855
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,480
Yeah, two or just a little met.

856
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,280
You know what a met is?

857
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,080
I don't even a metropolitan.

858
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,440
I don't even mention Mets.

859
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,840
Mets, Mets are the little guys in the classic Mega Man,

860
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,800
the little like black guys under the hard hat.

861
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,160
Oh, the little yeah, I like those guys.

862
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,480
Yeah, and they come in different like varieties sometimes.

863
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,280
They're just they're just little Mega Man goombas.

864
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:40,080
They're sometimes called Metals or Metars or Mets.

865
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,120
I think I think in English, they're usually just called Mets is what we've settled on.

866
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,040
And they're even in zero because there are cyber elves

867
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,120
that can transform regular enemies into Mets.

868
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,880
Just just because, just as a little cameo.

869
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,120
Hey, damn, there's so many things.

870
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,720
So many things to say.

871
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,680
Twitch was talking to Twitch a little bit in the server in the guest server.

872
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,640
And he said like, you know, he could just he could go on all day about Mega Man.

873
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,760
And like, there really is like there really is just no end of like facts

874
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,240
you could bring up and be like, did you know that in this one game,

875
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,160
some fucked up shit happens?

876
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,360
And you say, yes, of course, every game is like that.

877
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,480
I just I just assumed it is pretty cool.

878
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,160
Like just just the sheer quantity of little stories and characters and stuff.

879
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,080
Yeah, I like I like a really robust universe.

880
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,440
Yeah, it is pretty robust.

881
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,880
It's it's pretty robust and.

882
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,120
But it's just it's just it's it's it's a little annoying that like

883
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,920
I get I'm getting a lot of comments that are sort of specifically doing

884
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,520
the thing that I like didn't do, which is being like, oh, well, actually,

885
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,320
you know, this is the like X is the explanation for something in the games.

886
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,080
And it'll be like some fact that's like from the the manga or from like a cartoon

887
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,680
or from like a book or something.

888
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,120
And I'm like, kind of I kind of tried.

889
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,680
I mean, the mangas are specifically the mangas and the cartoons are specifically

890
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,960
an alternate canon.

891
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,600
The books, generally, I would say, probably are like legitimate canon.

892
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,440
Although they are mostly like.

893
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,840
Kind of after the fact is sort of a lot of it is retcon stuff, which is fine.

894
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,200
But like manga stuff is like doesn't it basically doesn't

895
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,520
count unless it's like something that's very strongly hinted at in the game.

896
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,160
And it's like reasonable to be like, this is probably what the game was trying to say.

897
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,200
And even then you kind of have to you kind of have to debate it.

898
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,000
I got a pee quick.

899
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,680
OK, back. OK.

900
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,520
I'm back.

901
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,960
Wahoo. Wow, we've been going for almost an hour.

902
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,360
Wow, that flew by.

903
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:12,520
I want to talk a little bit about something I mentioned last time briefly.

904
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,240
Yeah, the idea of going hibernating because it's cold and I just want to sleep.

905
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,520
I tried it out.

906
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,680
Well, I didn't really try it out.

907
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,520
It was just sort of.

908
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,400
Well, it the the idea is.

909
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,880
I'm done with like friendship ended with toil.

910
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,920
Now sleep is my best friend.

911
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,200
I just want to sleep for the whole rest of the year.

912
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,440
Makes sense.

913
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,160
I've realized that it's a little.

914
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,000
Like difficult to feel good at the same time.

915
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,560
Like it's nice to indulge a bit,

916
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,640
but like I feel bad that I'm not doing the things I did.

917
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,840
Got all this Clarissa stuff to still do.

918
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,880
Yeah.

919
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,760
So I'm going to I'm going to change my approach.

920
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,080
Hibernation nation is still happening,

921
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,320
but it's it's not so much that I'm going to stay in bed,

922
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,040
but I'm going to turn everything into a bed.

923
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,600
I'm going to extremely comfort my lived experience.

924
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,880
I'm going to wear blankets everywhere.

925
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,880
I'm going to I'm going to move my bed

926
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,480
and I'm going to get all my plushies and blankets and pillows

927
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,040
and put a big old like crash pile in the middle of the floor.

928
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,560
I'm just that's I feel like I need that.

929
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,080
I need to be able to just crawl into that

930
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,840
and then crawl out of it without too much trouble.

931
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,280
And it's different from going to sleep

932
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,600
because you can't really sleep on that, but it's nice and comfy.

933
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,760
I'm going to try and make it comfy

934
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,360
like the default state while I can do work at the computer and elsewhere.

935
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:54,320
I I think it's a worthy endeavor and I wish you great great success in it.

936
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,320
Yeah, it's just so cold.

937
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,560
You wake up and it's you don't yet.

938
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,280
How do you consider getting?

939
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,880
Have you considered getting a space heater?

940
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,080
Space is too big.

941
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,120
Just get a little space here, put it in your room.

942
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,600
That's what I do.

943
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,160
My room is I mean, sometimes it gets a little chilly.

944
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,440
I mean, all I really need is a blanket and I'm fine.

945
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,000
It's there's something to be said for a blanket

946
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,720
that's cozier than just a heater.

947
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,440
Yeah. I don't know.

948
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,440
I feel like it depends on the degree of chilliness we're talking about here.

949
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,840
I feel like it's it's like.

950
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,560
My my my wishes are to feel comfy all the time,

951
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,600
but I will only feel happy if I'm also getting some stuff done.

952
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,080
So I just need to be comfy while I'm working

953
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,640
and making my room more comfy is a good way to do that.

954
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,680
All right.

955
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,320
I understand.

956
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,160
Wait, I had to bite off my pinky fingernail.

957
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,600
You understand?

958
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,800
No, I do not.

959
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,080
Oh, well, sometimes you just got to do it.

960
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,480
I looked at my nails and they're they're fucked up.

961
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,600
But why it's not it's nothing.

962
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,400
It's it's a head nail polish on.

963
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,520
But they're starting to chip.

964
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,440
And so it looks like my nails are like cracked, but they're they're all right.

965
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,200
I got a call.

966
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,800
I could go to the dentist.

967
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,080
I've been saying for years now that I need to go to the dentist.

968
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,280
You know what I decided?

969
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,360
You know what I decided I'm going to do?

970
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,120
I had a genius idea.

971
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,360
One of the reasons I've been putting off going to the dentist

972
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,120
because I was like, I don't know how to sort out insurance

973
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,880
because like I don't have a like big boy real job.

974
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,200
So I don't have like employer provided dental insurance.

975
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,080
So I'm like, well, should I get some kind of private insurance?

976
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,040
And I looked into it and every private insurance company seems like they don't do shit.

977
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,120
They seem like garbage.

978
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,560
And I'm like, OK, well, I don't know what to do then.

979
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,200
But I realized, you know, I can probably just do.

980
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,520
I could probably just call the dentist and ask them

981
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,840
what insurance should I get that will cover, you know, routine procedures

982
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,280
like cleaning and maybe like cavity filling because they.

983
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,520
We're on the same team.

984
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,800
We both want the same thing.

985
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,040
We want an insurance company to give them money.

986
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,160
I could probably just call them and they'll just tell me, oh, yeah, get this,

987
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,520
get this, it'll cover all that stuff.

988
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,600
Have you done that yet? Have you done that yet?

989
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,520
Not yet. But it was just a couple of days ago.

990
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,760
I was like, I could just ask them.

991
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,160
I haven't done it yet, but I'm going to do that.

992
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,640
I hope that works because that that should be an easy way to do it.

993
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,040
I feel like I feel like it's I've I've arrived at a reasonable conclusion.

994
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,600
I feel like they'll want to help me with that so that I can pay them.

995
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,280
My teeth look like shit.

996
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,840
My teeth look terrible. I hate them.

997
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,760
They're like so dingy or too yet they're yellow.

998
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,880
In my they're yellow than they used to be.

999
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,240
And I hope to get some pain.

1000
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,560
I hope that if I get them clean, they will look better.

1001
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,360
I hope that if I get them clean, they will look better

1002
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,400
like I remember them looking and not all dingy and crappy.

1003
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,520
I hope it's a temporary state of affairs.

1004
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,480
But I'm actually scared.

1005
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,080
I'm actually scared they'll go to the dentist and they'll clean my teeth

1006
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,720
and I'll look at them and I'll be like, oh, they still look bad.

1007
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,400
My life is over.

1008
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,880
So I should just not go to the dentist to avoid that.

1009
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,720
Yeah, avoid all possible bad things.

1010
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,440
Never leave your house, never do anything.

1011
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,320
Yeah, foolproof, can't fail.

1012
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,320
I think I mentioned in the PCP chat.

1013
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,120
That I had a I had a battle of wills with my old landlord this week.

1014
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you said something about that.

1015
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,680
Yeah.

1016
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,480
Can I can I give you the quick version of what's gone on with that?

1017
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,600
Yeah. OK, it's it's.

1018
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,880
Uh, I knew this lady was not trustworthy.

1019
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,040
Everyone else that lived in the building that I talked to said,

1020
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,440
you're not going to your deposit back.

1021
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,680
She's going to try and like scam you out of your deposit.

1022
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,840
She's going to make up some fake shit.

1023
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,800
You're not going to get your deposit back.

1024
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,640
And I'm like, well, well, that sucks.

1025
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,720
So I deliberately did not pay my last two months of rent.

1026
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,480
Oh, three months, actually.

1027
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,080
Well, because, I mean, I had already paid last month when I moved in

1028
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,760
and she had a security deposit.

1029
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,360
So I was two months behind on rent, but she had the deposit.

1030
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,480
So it was really only one month behind, sort of.

1031
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,440
So that was a couple of months ago I moved out and.

1032
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,080
Kind of just to be a dick.

1033
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,320
I knew that I was two months delinquent on rent,

1034
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,240
but I kept texting her and being like, no, I didn't do it a bunch.

1035
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,200
I did a couple of times I texted her, like, where's my deposit?

1036
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,040
No, you're going to give me back my deposit.

1037
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,880
And then this week she messages me back to be like.

1038
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,800
There was some shoes.

1039
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,960
I was going to send me a bill or so she was like, I'll send you.

1040
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,840
I'll send you a statement.

1041
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,840
I'll send you a statement.

1042
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,240
And I think she had my zip code wrong or something.

1043
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,440
So like, I didn't get the statement so that we had to figure that out.

1044
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,840
But anyway, uh, cutting to the chase, she says, like, you're behind on rent.

1045
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,160
You owe me a lot of money.

1046
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,040
And then she sends me a bill for.

1047
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,960
Like more than two months, two months rent.

1048
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,640
She sends me a bill for like $1,600.

1049
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,040
And it's like, you owe me two months rent.

1050
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,200
No, mine, two months rent minus the deposit.

1051
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,040
So she did include the fact that she has my deposit and that went towards rent.

1052
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,840
So that was good.

1053
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,520
But then she also included like, like a hundred and something dollars for a

1054
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:59,160
cleaning bill, um, something else, $250 for damages to the window, which means,

1055
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,400
okay, when I moved in, there were like some metal bars across the window and I

1056
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,840
couldn't put an AC unit in.

1057
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:10,320
So I asked this, I literally asked the like super or whatever, the supervisor,

1058
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,600
I asked him, can you get these bars off?

1059
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,440
And he was like, sure.

1060
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,320
And he took the bars off so I could put my AC unit in.

1061
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,520
So I didn't even do that.

1062
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,600
The fucking property manager did that.

1063
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,160
So that's outrageous.

1064
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:26,200
And then the final straw was like, I think it was like $500.

1065
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,840
She wanted like $500 in late fees for the payment being late.

1066
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,240
And yeah.

1067
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,440
And that's like, that's, that's most of a month's rent.

1068
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,240
And here's the thing.

1069
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,080
I have, I have read the law.

1070
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,200
I have read Massachusetts tenant law in Massachusetts.

1071
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:50,280
Landlords can charge a late fee and it is not technically capped how much they can

1072
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:56,600
charge, but they cannot charge a late fee until rent is more than a month late,

1073
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:06,960
which to be fair, this latest month is one, one month's rent is, but she was

1074
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,360
charging for two months because she was including both of the months that I didn't

1075
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,880
pay, but one of those was covered by the deposit.

1076
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,720
So it really doesn't make any sense to charge a late fee for that month.

1077
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:24,280
And then on the other one, okay, the lease stipulates that there will be a late

1078
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,040
fee after a week, which is illegal.

1079
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,960
That's not what the law says you're allowed to do.

1080
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,680
And then it says there will be an additional late fee after a month and

1081
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:38,200
the after a month late fee that it stipulates is $250, which is outrageously high.

1082
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,120
But even that outrageously high amount is for the entire house.

1083
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,040
Like it's for everybody living in the house, not just for me.

1084
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,040
One guy, one of five guys living in one room.

1085
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,480
So the fact that she tried to charge me that amount like twice for two, for

1086
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,320
two different months is like completely ridiculous.

1087
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,880
So I have to do this.

1088
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,120
So basically I go into attack mode, right?

1089
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:06,040
I go into like rabid dog, you know, backed into a corner, you know, a mode.

1090
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,440
And I, and I'm just, and I just get, and I just like lawyer up.

1091
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,680
I'm like, I'm going to call lawyers.

1092
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,360
Like I'm going to take you to court over this.

1093
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,120
Like we're going to, we're like, fuck you.

1094
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,920
And she's like, I'll sue you for this.

1095
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,760
I'll, I'll sue you if you don't pay.

1096
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,400
What do you mean you're not going to pay?

1097
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,320
You're a bad person.

1098
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,760
I'm going to sue you for discriminating against me for being Indian.

1099
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,680
She said that she said you're discriminating against me for being Indian.

1100
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,760
There's a long text thing and she got really defensive.

1101
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,000
I know, I know in my heart.

1102
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,200
And I told this to her, you don't want me to go to, you don't

1103
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,680
want to take me to court because your lease is illegal.

1104
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,920
You've broken the law a bunch of times.

1105
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,320
You, I have, I have text messages of you requesting late fees when they are not legal.

1106
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,480
I have text messages of me requesting you to give me a copy of the lease.

1107
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,040
And you did not give it to me.

1108
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,400
You refuse to give it to me, even though I asked you for it.

1109
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,760
That's illegal, you know, you will, you do not, you do not want to go through

1110
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,760
what you will go through if this goes to court.

1111
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,960
I probably could just simply pay her nothing.

1112
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,200
I probably could just not give her anything and there would be nothing she

1113
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,120
would be willing to do about it.

1114
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,080
And I told her that and she got really mad.

1115
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,440
She said, I'm disrespectful, said I'm discriminating against her for being Indian.

1116
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,640
And I, and I said, no, I didn't even respond to that because it doesn't

1117
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,040
even merit a response.

1118
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:33,040
But anyway, the long story short of it, the ultimate conclusion is that,

1119
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:40,600
yeah, I bullied her into, I'll pay the rent that I owe minus the deposit,

1120
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,600
which she already has.

1121
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:49,080
And I, and I even agree, I'll pay the $100 cleaning fee and like another

1122
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,680
like $100 late fee or something.

1123
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,640
So I expected not to get my deposit back at all, but in the end, I am getting

1124
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:03,040
it mostly back minus like $200 for the clean, the cleaning fee is honestly

1125
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,400
kind of fair because yeah, the place was kind of a dump when we all moved out.

1126
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,200
So I'm not even mad about that one.

1127
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:14,280
Uh, the late fees, the late fees, a little bullshit, but like whatever.

1128
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,760
I talked to her down from $1,600 to like $900.

1129
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,640
So like, I don't care.

1130
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,480
Uh, so that's what happened.

1131
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,680
This woman is a demon.

1132
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,680
She's a vampire.

1133
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:31,920
Uh, I might, I just, after I send her the bill, I might take my, like the, I might

1134
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,480
try to like report her to some bureau or something because she's definitely

1135
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,320
like a scammer slumlord who is like breaking the law.

1136
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,480
And she definitely does this to all her tenants.

1137
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,720
She definitely bullies them all into giving her ridiculous late fees.

1138
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,480
And I'm sure most of them do not have the financial security that I have, that

1139
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,480
they can like play this stupid game of chicken that like if they lose, they,

1140
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:56,080
they might go to court and they might, you know, have to, she said like, oh,

1141
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,000
I'll sue you for double, you know, I'll see you and the courts will make you

1142
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,160
pay me $3,000.

1143
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,640
They'll make you pay me double in the end.

1144
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,600
Don't, don't do this.

1145
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,240
And I was like, no, you're lying.

1146
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,720
I know that won't happen.

1147
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:07,520
Die.

1148
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:08,960
Wow.

1149
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,960
That sounds, I mean, I'd, I'd be fucking scared.

1150
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:18,440
I, I mean, it was, it, it, it was, it was, I was a little scared because like,

1151
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,160
what if she, like, I, I know that she won't actually take me to court.

1152
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,520
I'm confident she doesn't actually want to do that.

1153
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,880
But I was afraid that she might take the bill and send it to a collections

1154
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,320
agency and I was afraid of that because if it went to a collections agency,

1155
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,600
then it might be report, even whether it's like, I didn't think the bill is

1156
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,520
legitimate, but like, I was wondering, like, even though the bill is legitimate

1157
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,720
and all these fees are just made up, can she just send that number off to a,

1158
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,200
a, a collections agency and have them like, and then they report it to a

1159
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,720
credit bureau and then my credit takes, that's like the worst thing that can

1160
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,880
happen to your credit score.

1161
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,560
And I have an immaculate credit score and I would be so mad.

1162
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:05,960
If like, I lost my incredible credit score because this, because this

1163
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:10,560
devil just made up a bunch of fake fees and told a credit bureau that I owe,

1164
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,120
that I owe her that money and they just believed her.

1165
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,440
That would make me so mad.

1166
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,120
So that's what I was really upset, really scared about was that happening.

1167
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,560
I knew that I would win in court because I had like, I had records of her

1168
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:26,600
like breaking the law and stuff, violating like 10, 10 agreements.

1169
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,120
So I wasn't that scared about that.

1170
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,520
I was afraid that she would try to go through with it, even, even like,

1171
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,880
without knowing that she would definitely lose.

1172
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
But in doing so would like, would like harm me on her way down, basically.

1173
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,880
Yeah, you don't want to ever try to get justice because you'll go broke.

1174
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,240
You'll get banged out.

1175
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,160
I'm sure, and I'm sure that when she does this most of the time, people

1176
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,520
do not want to risk that.

1177
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:58,360
And they're just like, yeah, because, because the other guy that lived there,

1178
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,280
he like, he just didn't get his deposit back.

1179
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:04,520
Like he, he, he moved out and she just kept his deposit.

1180
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,600
And I'm sure she said like, oh, yeah, late fees.

1181
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,080
Oh, yeah, cleaning fees.

1182
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,040
Oh, yeah, there was damage to the room.

1183
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,920
Yeah, we are there.

1184
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,720
I'm keeping your, I got to keep your deposit.

1185
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,120
And like, she's just a thief.

1186
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,520
She's just a thief and a criminal and she should be in prison, in my opinion.

1187
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,000
Um, I don't know.

1188
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,360
It's almost like you may as well trash the place.

1189
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,680
You may as well, you may as well do as many, break as many rules as you want

1190
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,320
because it's not going to make a difference.

1191
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,640
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

1192
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:37,640
Good.

1193
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,480
I think that happened to me.

1194
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:47,880
I mean, when I was at uni or as in a shared house, but nobody was really

1195
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,280
willing to do like the, the bins.

1196
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,840
And I was, we were all lazy, I guess, but like the bins did pile up.

1197
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,040
There was rubbish everywhere.

1198
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,040
So I understand that he took my deposit.

1199
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,360
Um, but he also was a scary old man.

1200
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,400
And I don't think he liked me or anyone.

1201
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,960
I didn't think he liked human beings because it was, it was a university area.

1202
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,400
So like, he's probably tired of those darned kids.

1203
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,960
And he had a point because we didn't clean up anything.

1204
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,440
Who wouldn't be tired of those darned kids?

1205
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,000
Yeah.

1206
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:27,080
Um, my, there's a, there's a, there's a fucking situation in my house right now

1207
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,320
is that there's no toilet paper anywhere.

1208
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,480
And like, I bought a huge box, like a huge case of toilet paper.

1209
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:40,480
I bought like, you know, 20, like 24 or 36 rolls or something a while ago.

1210
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,280
I just bought it and I let everyone use it, whatever.

1211
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,640
And it got used up.

1212
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,480
And now it's been like a week where there's like barely any toilet paper.

1213
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,320
And I'm just, and I'm just kind of waiting for someone else to get some.

1214
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,240
And nobody else is getting any.

1215
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,560
They're just, they're just sitting around with their poopy butts.

1216
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,720
I don't know what they're doing.

1217
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,200
They don't know what they're doing.

1218
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,360
Like, are they all just, everyone just have their own in their room that they

1219
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,320
are like courting for themselves?

1220
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:08,680
Possibly.

1221
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:13,120
I remember I did that because I didn't like buying stuff for these people.

1222
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,360
I mean, I would have it in my room.

1223
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,520
I just, I just bought a bunch.

1224
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:19,880
I'm, you know what?

1225
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,880
I feel, I feel like I've kind of like an idiot because like I did it once and

1226
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,040
nobody thanked me for it.

1227
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,640
And now, nobody else is stepping up to do it.

1228
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,760
So, yeah, I guess I'm kind of a rube.

1229
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,520
I guess I'm the fool if I do.

1230
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,360
But like, I kind of just want to probably, I'll probably just do it again.

1231
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,760
It's hate, it's hate that everyone's got there.

1232
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,840
Everyone's got their own secret toilet paper in their own, whatever.

1233
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,440
It's fucking idiots.

1234
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,400
Some, grow up.

1235
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,600
Just grow up.

1236
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,120
I'll do it.

1237
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:52,480
I'll do it.

1238
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:52,960
I don't care.

1239
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,720
Be like 25 bucks and give a shit.

1240
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,280
Annoying, though.

1241
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,120
It's just, it's just the, it's just the principle.

1242
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,440
It's just the principle that really, okay.

1243
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,200
Everyone else is happy.

1244
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,760
It's, it's a, what is it?

1245
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,800
You know that meme?

1246
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,840
It's like a political cartoon.

1247
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,600
It's like a guy standing on a podium and it's like, who wants, who wants to

1248
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,960
stay hydrated and everyone like raises their hand and is like, now who wants to

1249
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,560
actually drink water and like nobody raises their hand you don't talk about?

1250
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,600
I haven't seen that, but I get it.

1251
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:20,440
Yeah.

1252
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,000
Well, it's like, yeah.

1253
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,760
Who wants to wipe their, who wants to wipe their ass?

1254
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,160
Everyone.

1255
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:25,600
Yeah.

1256
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,960
Who wants to buy toilet paper?

1257
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,480
Nobody.

1258
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,000
It's really just one of those, like if you don't communicate with the house,

1259
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:38,240
everybody is going to hope that every, like every other person does the things

1260
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,200
that need to be done.

1261
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,320
Yeah.

1262
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,920
Well, somebody's, somebody's got to do, obviously somebody.

1263
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:44,400
All right.

1264
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,120
Here's what I'm going to do.

1265
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:45,800
I'll do it again.

1266
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,760
I'll do it one more time.

1267
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,880
I'll buy a big case of it one more time.

1268
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:53,600
And then when that runs out, I'll put a message in the group chat and be like,

1269
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,640
Hey guys, I bought toilet paper for the house like twice now.

1270
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,360
Could somebody else do it?

1271
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,960
Could somebody else just do it, please?

1272
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,360
Um, that's, that's my plan.

1273
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,200
Good plan.

1274
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,000
Yeah.

1275
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,720
Let them feel guilt.

1276
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,960
At least, at least they will be in pain.

1277
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,200
Slight name and shame, name and shame.

1278
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,800
That's the, that's the move.

1279
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,480
Yes.

1280
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,120
Um, there's also rats in my house.

1281
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,440
Maybe they were using the toilet paper.

1282
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,280
Yeah.

1283
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,960
The last place had mice, which was gross.

1284
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,320
This place, uh, apparently this is a new problem that was not a problem before.

1285
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:35,160
Like other people have lived here for years and this has never happened before.

1286
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,960
But there are like rats in the kitchen now and everyone is freaked out about it.

1287
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:44,200
And there was a, there was a kerfuffle, there was a, no, there's a new landlord kerfuffle

1288
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:50,080
because, and I didn't do this, but one of the other people here called the landlord.

1289
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:54,720
And I guess, and I guess threatened the landlord with like, we're going to

1290
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,560
withhold rent until the rat problem is done.

1291
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,480
And apparently that didn't go so well.

1292
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,360
Uh, but like he, they said like, okay, it's being handled.

1293
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,760
They've got pest control guys on it.

1294
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,800
Pest control guys are coming and they are checking on the house and they are

1295
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,000
leaving traps and they are leaving poison and they are doing whatever they do to get

1296
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,480
a house pest free.

1297
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,920
So like, okay, cool.

1298
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,120
Uh, glad it's being handled.

1299
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,640
So we did not withhold rent this month.

1300
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,040
I really hope it doesn't come to that.

1301
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,000
I really do not want to get into a thing about it.

1302
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,840
However, the rat situation is untenable.

1303
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,920
It is unacceptable.

1304
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,400
There are rats in the kitchen.

1305
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,520
Like, that's disgusting.

1306
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,040
That's vile.

1307
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:38,520
Yeah.

1308
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,000
Is it like rat poop?

1309
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,720
Just on the floor sometimes?

1310
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,960
I have not seen any rat poop.

1311
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,760
I have seen the rats like eating out of the garbage.

1312
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,440
Yikes.

1313
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,400
Yeah.

1314
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,240
So I mean, you know, we're all pretty upset about that.

1315
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,640
Did you see summoning salt called me a nerd?

1316
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,840
Uh, oh, I did.

1317
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:08,720
Lol.

1318
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,200
You you messaged or like added them on Twitter.

1319
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,160
I said get owned with your with your video being top of search results for

1320
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,280
Mega Man or something.

1321
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,240
Yes.

1322
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,000
When you searched and this was not not signed into my account, but when you

1323
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,720
searched, uh, what was it when you searched Mega Man on YouTube, the first

1324
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:35,040
result was my video, the second result was like a music video called the song of

1325
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:40,800
a song called Mega Man by somebody called take a on a channel called the

1326
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,360
shooters and I don't know.

1327
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,560
I've never heard of that, but whatever it is, it's got 25 million views.

1328
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,640
And then the third result was the summoning salt Mega Man to speed running

1329
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,200
video.

1330
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:56,720
So I told summoning salt to get owned and he responded and he said get owned.

1331
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,320
Uh, by, he had a little image.

1332
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,400
The image was him.

1333
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,040
Girl, I'll just, I'll just post the image because it was kind of funny.

1334
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,040
Ellie's are showed on screen right now.

1335
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,560
Oh, I see.

1336
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,800
He typed in nerdy, got you top of the list.

1337
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Top, top of the list, top of the list.

1338
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,760
Hey, you know what?

1339
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,320
That's, that's clout.

1340
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,560
He, he ratio, I feel, I feel, I think it should be illegal to ratio someone when

1341
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,080
you have more followers than them.

1342
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,640
What did it, my, my, my tweet at him got like a, got like three or 400 and his

1343
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:31,160
has a 1300, his reply has 1300 likes.

1344
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:32,400
I don't know.

1345
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:32,920
He's got a hundred.

1346
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,360
He's got a hundred thousand followers though.

1347
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,920
I think that, I think that spiritually I ratioed him actually.

1348
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,560
The moral victory.

1349
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,800
I think I would, I would call, I would definitely call this a moral victory

1350
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,360
100% for sure.

1351
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:47,800
Yeah.

1352
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,160
Ah, base, base, base.

1353
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,760
Um, damn.

1354
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,760
Try to think of a.

1355
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,280
Yeah, I can't think of anything off the top of my head.

1356
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,880
You want to go to voicemails?

1357
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,120
How long have you been going for?

1358
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,520
It's just been an hour.

1359
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,080
Oh, like it's a little early.

1360
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,080
An hour, 20 minutes.

1361
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:13,720
It's not that.

1362
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,400
Um.

1363
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,360
I don't know.

1364
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,720
Uh, what are you thinking about for Christmas?

1365
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,880
Um, I asked my mom, she asked what I want for Christmas.

1366
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,360
And I, I said, I would like an immersion blender.

1367
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,360
I would maybe like one of those magic bullet blenders.

1368
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,800
I would maybe like a rice cooker.

1369
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,120
But apparently there already is a rice cooker in this house.

1370
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,480
It's just like the parts are like.

1371
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:42,960
Not together.

1372
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:48,440
I might have to like find the parts just like Z just like X in Mega Man X two.

1373
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,480
I might have to like fight the fight the X hunters to collect the different parts

1374
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,480
of the rice cooker and then put it all together.

1375
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,840
Uh, oh, shit.

1376
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,240
Wait, um, one piece.

1377
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,680
Oh, fuck, I didn't read this week.

1378
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,880
Oh, you got to read it.

1379
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,880
There's a new chapter.

1380
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,480
We got to do our corner.

1381
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,480
I guess, I guess we could read it right now.

1382
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,240
We could do the same thing as last time, but you're the one reading it.

1383
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,400
Yeah, sure.

1384
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,480
Let's let's do it.

1385
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,760
I completely spaced on one piece.

1386
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,480
Um, I should have reminded you.

1387
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,280
I did see it and I was like, I should tell Ben in case, but I forgot.

1388
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:32,000
You, it would have, uh, it would have helped, but no matter.

1389
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,560
Okay.

1390
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,720
Chapter 1068, a genius's dream.

1391
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,400
An emotion.

1392
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,640
Jerma 66 is an emotionless voyage.

1393
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,200
These two once belonged in an organization called Mads.

1394
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:53,080
Oh, uh, skip to this time code posted on the screen to get plus one piece.

1395
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,080
We should make a time code for that.

1396
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:56,600
Okay.

1397
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:02,360
So, so I really, by the way, I realized that, um, the, the past, the pacifistas

1398
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:08,200
with the dark skin and the wings, the luminarian, the luminarian pacifistas

1399
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,320
are the seraphim.

1400
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,280
Yeah.

1401
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,000
Okay.

1402
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,440
I didn't put that together last time, but I understand.

1403
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,600
See, I don't want to say anything that you haven't read yet.

1404
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,200
So I'm waiting for you to like, yeah, make comments.

1405
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,080
I'm, I'm waiting until there's like something.

1406
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,240
That I can come in and like, definitely comment on.

1407
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:28,800
Wait a minute.

1408
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,360
The grand line.

1409
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,120
He pawpawed someone.

1410
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,280
Who, who did he pawpaw?

1411
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,360
Himself.

1412
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,080
Like he's gone.

1413
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:48,760
All of, all of those parts that were falling off of him and then he, he popped himself away.

1414
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,640
Oh, that's him.

1415
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,360
It's his, his robot guts coming out.

1416
01:15:53,480 --> 01:16:01,080
Yeah, they were repairing him or they were like trying to like undo the, the, uh, what

1417
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,160
do you call it, like the pacifist station or whatever they would, you would say.

1418
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,080
Oh, that's what they were doing.

1419
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,400
The, the Revolutionary Army were doing that.

1420
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:10,840
Okay.

1421
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,200
That, that's, that's, um, presumably, I can't remember if they say it out right, but

1422
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:21,360
like when they went to marriage water to save him, I think that was part of, there's

1423
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:28,880
one of their objectives is to find and rescue Kuma so that they could undo the damage and

1424
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,360
maybe get him back to his old self.

1425
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:33,560
Okay.

1426
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:40,800
I want to create a kind of world with science, a world where energy is widespread all over

1427
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,080
the world free of charge.

1428
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:42,960
Yeah.

1429
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,720
Communism.

1430
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,320
Yes.

1431
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,960
Based, based the resources that produce energy are fought over in many countries.

1432
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:57,720
Which when becomes the seed for war, you can feel energy here over there and everywhere

1433
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:02,960
else, even though the world is full of it, they can convert it to visible power, a large

1434
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:03,600
fuse of war.

1435
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,320
Oh, wow.

1436
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,440
Yeah, it's pretty good.

1437
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,320
He wants to give everybody what they need so they don't need to fight anymore.

1438
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,080
Ever, everybody, everybody has free energy.

1439
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,320
God damn.

1440
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,240
Sounds like I'm really interested.

1441
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,560
Hmm.

1442
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,640
I think a person that can make everyone happy is good.

1443
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,800
I'm not interested in being a hero, though.

1444
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,360
Okay.

1445
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,960
Dynamic power source was able to power this ancient robot soldier.

1446
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,240
Okay.

1447
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:37,600
Okay.

1448
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:37,880
Okay.

1449
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,120
So he's looking into whatever powered this ancient technology.

1450
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:42,520
Okay.

1451
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,240
Yeah, this is Mega Man Legends right now.

1452
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:50,120
And this is, they found ancient something or other.

1453
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,440
Oh, they found, oh, it's a refractor.

1454
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:51,840
Okay.

1455
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,160
Thank you for putting it in terms that I can understand.

1456
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:54,520
Okay.

1457
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,960
So it's like a quantum refractor.

1458
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:56,280
Okay.

1459
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,320
No, gotcha.

1460
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,400
I stepped too deep into the forbidden story.

1461
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,880
I will be eliminated by the world government.

1462
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,480
Just like what they did to Ohara.

1463
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:12,600
That's not good.

1464
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:19,520
CPO are those who only act under orders of celestial dragons, but it's CPO.

1465
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,520
It's not CP9.

1466
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,320
They are at the top of Cypherpole.

1467
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,720
Oh, well, that must mean they're really powerful if the number went up.

1468
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,720
Well, number went down.

1469
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,720
It's CP0.

1470
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:30,720
Oh, right, right, right.

1471
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:35,560
It's so, so wacky that they don't even have it listed.

1472
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,120
Everyone thinks it stops at CP9, except now everyone knows.

1473
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:44,160
Except now everyone knows because it's no longer a mystery to the reader.

1474
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,960
Chaka, CP0 is on the island.

1475
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,040
OK, OK.

1476
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,160
The CPO, I guess, is apparently here to kill

1477
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:07,640
Vegapunk because he knows too much about the void century.

1478
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:08,960
That makes sense.

1479
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,960
That makes sense.

1480
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,080
Sentomaru, wait, who's Sentomaru?

1481
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,280
If you remember here, right, he appeared at

1482
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,080
Shabaodi with the original Pesifista

1483
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,800
and he was like in charge of them.

1484
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,400
So I guess we're learning now that he's like a Vegapunk.

1485
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,440
Like guy, like he's on this island.

1486
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,920
I definitely recognize him.

1487
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,520
I remember there was information about like his,

1488
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,560
like being the grandson of somebody important or the son of someone.

1489
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,440
Let me check.

1490
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,760
Oh, he's the captain of the Marine Science Unit.

1491
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,640
He calls Kizaru uncle, but that might not be

1492
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,120
that might be a like a friendly thing rather than an actual family thing.

1493
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,760
He might be calling him like Osan or something.

1494
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,960
Is that the word for like an ojiki?

1495
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,680
Ojiki.

1496
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,880
Yakuza family, father, boss, yeah, it could be that.

1497
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,880
But he's a Marine boy and he's a Vegapunk.

1498
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:19,560
Marine science officer person who can control the Pesifista for some reason,

1499
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,320
maybe just that they've been programmed to accept his orders.

1500
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,560
Roku gun is the finger gun, right?

1501
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,120
It's when they shoot the little.

1502
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,200
Uh, I can't remember.

1503
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,640
I remember Shoku gun.

1504
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,320
It looks like he's.

1505
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,720
Kick it out of the face or something.

1506
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,960
It looks like he's exactly what he's doing.

1507
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:43,280
He's jumped and his legs are like his knees bent and he's got his.

1508
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,080
Yeah, he's probably doing the finger thing or like just punching really hard.

1509
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,840
OK, all right.

1510
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,960
So CP CP CP zero.

1511
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,040
The kill Vegapunk.

1512
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,600
Damn.

1513
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,680
The thing I got from this chapter mostly is that Vegapunk has his like,

1514
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:06,840
oh, this is my dream and, you know,

1515
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,720
those straw hat pirates don't have an old man on the crew yet.

1516
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:15,360
Maybe this is like a new crew member or at least it's certainly going to be temporary.

1517
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:22,160
OK, certainly going to be temporary ill on the crew for like a while after this, possibly.

1518
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,560
You know what?

1519
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,760
I think I didn't even think about it, but like.

1520
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,000
Yeah, that would be awesome.

1521
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,280
That's so awesome.

1522
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,320
Vegapunk rules.

1523
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,920
Vegapunk so good.

1524
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,720
So cool.

1525
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,880
I hope I hope it's a good design.

1526
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:40,040
You know, if we're if we're having like stupid new new team members.

1527
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,560
Yeah, yeah, Vegapunk.

1528
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,880
Yeah, please.

1529
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:48,560
Yeah, it's it's because we've not known enough about Vegapunks like once

1530
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,240
and like why he's working with the world government.

1531
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,680
And it's, you know, last few chapters is like, oh, it's because

1532
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,600
in order to pursue science, you need a lot of funds and you need a lot of,

1533
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,320
you know, freedom to work.

1534
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,600
Yeah. And so the world government can provide that for him.

1535
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,520
And that's the only reason.

1536
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,040
But he's getting close to some secrets that he shouldn't.

1537
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,360
And so just so happens as the straw hats arrive.

1538
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,960
That he needs to get out of there and he's going to be killed otherwise.

1539
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:20,840
So like it's perfect time for him to stop being working with the world

1540
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,760
government, stop being a pirate.

1541
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,280
Yeah.

1542
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:28,480
Certainly going to be like even he's already in outlaw, I guess.

1543
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,040
Yeah, he's currently in, I mean, CP zero is like.

1544
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:37,000
Implied to be super secret so that even the Marines don't know about them.

1545
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,960
So like this is like an assassination attempt.

1546
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,200
Yeah, he's not like publicly an enemy.

1547
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,160
He's not publicly an enemy, but like, I don't know what will happen.

1548
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,840
They are taking out.

1549
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,200
It will be pretty cool if he gets a wanted poster after whatever's happening here.

1550
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,440
And then he's like, oh, cool.

1551
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:02,240
You want to join the crew or more likely, I think he's going to join the Revolutionary Army.

1552
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,960
Because if Kuma is going to drop in, obviously, Jewelry Bonnie,

1553
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,360
his daughter, they're going to have a thing.

1554
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,800
There's also things that can happen.

1555
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,160
I'm excited to see what's what's going on.

1556
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:19,160
So there's like obviously, immediately, the two strongest guys

1557
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:24,160
seeing each other, Luffy and Luchi, are they going to have a rematch right there?

1558
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,080
Like how the fuck is that going to go?

1559
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,480
So Kuma, he's still like, you know, a mindless robot.

1560
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,880
Like the Revolutionary Army basically like kidnapped him against his will

1561
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:41,040
to try and like undo the conditioning or the program or whatever.

1562
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:46,400
I think it's it's not been made totally clear whether he has.

1563
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,600
Like no sentience, he might just not be able to move.

1564
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,160
Like he might not be like too far gone or anything.

1565
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,720
But yeah, it seems like because there was that part where he

1566
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:08,080
in during the time skip, protected the Straw Hats, protected Sunigo,

1567
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,640
the ship from being attacked for like those full two years.

1568
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,960
And then he left, which seems like somebody programmed him to do that.

1569
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:22,160
Because otherwise he's completely controlled by the the world government and the Marines.

1570
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,280
Oh, I forgot about that.

1571
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,200
Yeah, Frankie or someone just sees him and he's just sitting there and then he stands up

1572
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,760
and he leaves, doesn't say a word.

1573
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:36,960
Yeah, that's fucked up.

1574
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,680
That's really weird that that happened.

1575
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:41,200
Hmm.

1576
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,240
It's probably going to be very sad if he if he arrives.

1577
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,000
I don't know why he's going there.

1578
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,760
But like if he's been like called somehow.

1579
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,280
You think he's going to Egghead?

1580
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,800
I mean, it seems the most logical place.

1581
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,000
Yeah.

1582
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,440
Like he got some sort of notification and he's like zapping himself over there.

1583
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:08,160
And then maybe jewelry Bonnie will see her dad.

1584
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,480
But he won't be able to say anything.

1585
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,400
He'll still be like an automaton, maybe.

1586
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,440
Yeah.

1587
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:20,720
I I mean, I just I just don't know.

1588
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,240
Just don't know what's going on with him.

1589
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,360
I mean, I guess who was it that said that he was an asshole?

1590
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,560
Was it was it?

1591
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,840
Fuck, what's Shark Man's name?

1592
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:30,800
I'm forgetting.

1593
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,600
Jin Bay.

1594
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,440
This Jin Jin Bay was the one that said like he was like a tyrant.

1595
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,320
He was like a douchebag king.

1596
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:44,960
But now he's like now he's a row.

1597
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,520
He's been reprogrammed for the Marines.

1598
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,840
But also he seems to like secretly be working on behalf of the Straw Hats.

1599
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,840
And more like the Revolutionary Army.

1600
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,320
Yeah.

1601
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:56,800
Yeah.

1602
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,040
Which so like maybe from Dragon somehow or Vega Punk.

1603
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:01,840
Yeah.

1604
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,560
Yeah.

1605
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:07,680
Some deep code inside him that allows him to to do good still.

1606
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:13,600
Yeah, we're going to learn a lot more about all that for sure.

1607
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:13,920
Yeah.

1608
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,800
I mean, hype.

1609
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,640
I like I like I think Kuma is pretty cool.

1610
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,360
I'm interested.

1611
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,120
I'm really yeah.

1612
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,760
This these revelations these Vega Punk revelations are pretty pretty cool.

1613
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,240
Pretty pretty exciting.

1614
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,160
Pretty like what's what's his what's his role going to be.

1615
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,120
Yeah, he might I could see him joining the Revolutionary Army for sure.

1616
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,880
So fucking base fucking epic.

1617
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:47,840
It's awesome.

1618
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,320
It's awesome.

1619
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:54,880
I notice in this that one panel where the the the seraphim that they were returning.

1620
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,200
Bear looks like Kuma.

1621
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:57,600
Yeah.

1622
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,560
They called it B Bear or S Bear or something.

1623
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,040
S Bear.

1624
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,760
Like seraphim bear because yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1625
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,600
I do notice that he is shaded is to have darker skin.

1626
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,560
So you were correct.

1627
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,360
I think sometimes sometimes he is.

1628
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,200
It's kind of inconsistent panel to panel.

1629
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,560
Which one are you looking at?

1630
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,120
We'll look at this one.

1631
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,480
He's he's not he's not shaded here.

1632
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,320
I think he is.

1633
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,920
Oh no, he kind of is a little bit.

1634
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:28,800
I see.

1635
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,000
I see it's it's faint, but it's probably like a bad scan.

1636
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:32,720
A bad scan.

1637
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:36,400
Yeah, because like it's not pure white like it would be if it was just, you know,

1638
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:37,760
unshaded.

1639
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,680
I feel like there's a half tone in there.

1640
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,560
Oh wait.

1641
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:45,040
This is like because you see his hair is like white and it's lighter.

1642
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:50,640
OK, this is we're doing we're doing phrenology on this on this Kuma clone.

1643
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,800
Well, this is his hands here look like they might be shaded.

1644
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,360
I'm trying to find one that's clearer because OK.

1645
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:09,040
Well, the point being the the the similarities to King having the black wings

1646
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,080
and the white hair and the darker skin.

1647
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,920
He does have the white hair for sure.

1648
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:14,560
Oh, that one.

1649
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,520
I didn't notice that one.

1650
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,720
Yeah, that's just this one.

1651
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:21,920
He just not looked at all all it's going to take all I need is one panel where it's like

1652
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:30,160
very clearly like they definitely like made a visible like shading to differentiate his color.

1653
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,040
All you need is one example and I'll be like, OK, I'm sold.

1654
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,760
I don't need whoa.

1655
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:39,760
Sorry, I sneezed.

1656
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,880
Did it sound loud?

1657
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,320
Yeah, it did.

1658
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,040
But like muffled distance.

1659
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,360
I muffled it with the with the blanket.

1660
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,120
I think it's probably the case that he looks like a lumarian.

1661
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:59,280
But I feel like I feel like none of these panels show it very well.

1662
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,880
But I'll wait.

1663
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:03,600
We'll wait and see.

1664
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:12,000
Yeah, so like I think I said last time last time we talked to one piece that like

1665
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:17,680
I don't feel like Egg Island is going to be particularly long.

1666
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:20,240
Definitely not as long as one or not sort of feels.

1667
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,520
I mean, we just got here like three chapters ago.

1668
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:23,840
Yeah.

1669
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,000
And the battle is on.

1670
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,920
Yeah, already like Luchi and Luffy are there.

1671
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,560
Fighting is happening.

1672
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,640
And I don't believe anything else is going to come up other than Kuma.

1673
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:45,040
I feel like this is going to be like a short confrontation followed by maybe Kuma arrives

1674
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:50,400
to save the straw hats and blast them away somewhere because Bonnie is with them.

1675
01:29:51,280 --> 01:30:00,480
Yeah, it doesn't feel like they're setting up like a big sort of like sprawling backstory

1676
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:06,000
that all culminates in a big like battle like like they did with, you know,

1677
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,760
a Wano or anything like that.

1678
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,240
Yeah, although I am curious.

1679
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,520
I wonder if like the different.

1680
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,640
Do you think there's anything more to like the backstories of the different

1681
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:23,440
uh, uh, vagabunk pieces that is like or or just not he just made them.

1682
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:32,000
I mean, I think the like the the it's a lot of it's been explained by him saying

1683
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:38,640
this island has some ancient technologies and I derived a lot of my science stuff from what we

1684
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:44,560
found and that's just sort of like that's how he's so smart and has so many good technologies.

1685
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,320
Hmm.

1686
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:50,720
Also, my brain is this giant building and it's gathering information.

1687
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,080
That's also helpful.

1688
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,920
Because what's interesting here that the their ship, the ship zero

1689
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:07,760
fucking ship was eaten by the the the sea beasts, sea beast guys.

1690
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,360
Is that is that what happened to the ship?

1691
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:13,680
Yeah, because Luchi said, I know we won't be able to like

1692
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,000
as soon as we attack our ship will be destroyed.

1693
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,280
So we got to get on that quick.

1694
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,520
And so they they abandoned their ship so that they can get in.

1695
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,720
Did the ship get destroyed?

1696
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:29,520
Yeah, there's a thing with like the what are they?

1697
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,080
What's the word?

1698
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,760
Not real, not manmade sea.

1699
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,640
Artificial.

1700
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:35,920
No, artificial.

1701
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:36,000
Natural.

1702
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,680
Artificial sea beasts.

1703
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1704
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,480
They ate it.

1705
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,520
And then I see them like looming around the ship.

1706
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,160
There's a panel later where it's it's shown.

1707
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:46,480
Okay.

1708
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,520
That they're doing that.

1709
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,240
I believe you.

1710
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:48,960
I believe it.

1711
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,720
Well, just take a little screen grab.

1712
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,760
Yeah, it's it's what's his face?

1713
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,320
You're speaking of Mega Man.

1714
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,560
Some of these guys do look like Mega Man enemies.

1715
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,920
Oh, yeah, these these little robot little robot eyes.

1716
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:04,640
There's two.

1717
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,960
There's two robot dudes among the.

1718
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,240
The Vegapunk people.

1719
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,040
Just some of them look like robot.

1720
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:15,600
No, there's three.

1721
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,200
Well, there's three if you count Daft Punk.

1722
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:22,240
There's Daft Punk and then there's two like the little like clanky like oval men.

1723
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:27,120
Yeah, they're definitely Mega Man people.

1724
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:27,680
Definitely.

1725
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,760
Definitely Mega Man.

1726
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:41,760
Actually, I mean, Daft Punk does look sort of like the Valiant enemies from X4 vials like soldiers.

1727
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:47,600
So, you know, I guess they're all Mega Man, actually, when you really when you really think about it.

1728
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,320
You have to wonder about it.

1729
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:58,240
I have to wonder how strong like Luchi and Kaku have become since water seven and all that.

1730
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:02,240
Yeah, because they're the top level guys.

1731
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:11,360
This is the level of guys that were at Wano with their funny masks playing like Othello or whatever.

1732
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,280
At Wano?

1733
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:20,400
Yeah, there was the two really tall guys holding masks on their face and then the shorter guy

1734
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,920
with just sort of goggles and they were like in a room.

1735
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:25,920
What?

1736
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:38,560
And they were like, hmm, the insurgents have like 3000 strong, but Kaido's army has like 16,000.

1737
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,920
But they're turning the tide of battle.

1738
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:40,720
That's those guys.

1739
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,240
They were like commentating what was happening.

1740
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,160
Wait, who?

1741
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:46,720
Who were they?

1742
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,120
I mean, I remember that scene.

1743
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,400
I remember that scene.

1744
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,000
I don't remember who was saying it.

1745
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:58,240
It was, I mean, I don't know their names, but they're like sheepie zero as well.

1746
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,960
And they interfered with Kaido's battle.

1747
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,120
Oh, oh, yeah.

1748
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,000
Okay, wait, I didn't realize those guys were CP.

1749
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,720
Yeah, that's their hair on special business, but it just so happens.

1750
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:11,440
Oh, you're right.

1751
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,560
All that shit was happening.

1752
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,440
Yes, yes, yes.

1753
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,560
I remember now.

1754
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,240
Okay, okay.

1755
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,280
So these guys, yeah.

1756
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,480
They're the same level.

1757
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,640
So like, they're definitely going to be strong.

1758
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,760
Did we see those guys fight?

1759
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:29,600
There was a part when shit was going down that they had to go and intervene.

1760
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,240
So like one of them died, I'm pretty sure.

1761
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:34,560
Oh, shit.

1762
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,720
They fought, they fought X-Drake.

1763
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,560
I guess somewhere.

1764
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,200
Yeah, yeah.

1765
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,800
There was a few confrontation.

1766
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:41,680
I can't remember exactly who fought.

1767
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,600
X-Drake and Killer?

1768
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:48,160
X-Drake and Apu, I think.

1769
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,200
Yeah, Killer was there.

1770
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,720
They were like forced to team up.

1771
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,800
Killer was fighting against them.

1772
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,200
Or no, Killer was fighting against Kid.

1773
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,640
Why would Killer fight against Kid?

1774
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:05,120
No, he was fighting against, not Dracula Mihawk, the straw guy, the voodoo doll guy.

1775
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:08,720
Yes, Basil Hawkins.

1776
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,080
Basil Hawkins, yes, yes, yes.

1777
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,320
So many fucking characters that you track up.

1778
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,120
There was like a hundred fucking fights in 1-0.

1779
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,880
It's unbelievable.

1780
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:28,000
But yeah, those guys were very strong and they only really,

1781
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:33,680
like if they were completely let loose, they would have done some massive damage.

1782
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:39,120
I think there was like that part where the big ghost, the flame ghost was traveling down and

1783
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:45,040
it blocked off those guys from fighting Usopp or something.

1784
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,960
Oh, the big like goopy flame thing that was burrowing down through the castle.

1785
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,000
Yeah, and it was going down.

1786
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,520
It was going to blow up the big explosives at the bottom.

1787
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,160
I didn't even remember how that was stopped.

1788
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,040
Do you remember how that was stopped?

1789
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,000
No, I don't.

1790
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,280
Yamato was running to catch it, but what did she do in the end?

1791
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,840
I don't remember.

1792
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:18,800
Wait, I think he threw all the bombs down into the floor and then they exploded.

1793
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,720
But like in the middle of the sky, instead of it, I can't remember exactly.

1794
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:29,040
Like it dropped out the bottom of the city and it blew up in the air.

1795
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,880
Yeah, something like that.

1796
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,520
That sounds...

1797
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,000
There was like seven different ticking clocks.

1798
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,200
There was so many fucking...

1799
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,360
If this happens, everyone dies and if this happens, everyone dies.

1800
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,920
But then if this happens, everyone dies and the island falls

1801
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,840
and kills everyone below it as well.

1802
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,240
So we want the first option where everyone dies.

1803
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:54,640
We don't want the second one because there's other even worse things happen as well.

1804
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:58,080
It's not just that everything was going to explode and fall out of the sky.

1805
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:04,640
The island will fall out of the sky, so Momo had to make clouds.

1806
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:12,400
We're talking about the difference between a sky lagoon and a space station Eurasia,

1807
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,760
a space colony Eurasia here.

1808
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,320
Oh, yeah.

1809
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,240
It's tomato tomorrow.

1810
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,200
There's difference of scale.

1811
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:23,040
But then also there was a fire and everything was burning and everyone was going to burn to death.

1812
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:24,320
Yeah.

1813
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,640
And then everyone was going to drown because it was too late.

1814
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:30,560
And it was going to blow up the weapons stash in the bottom of the floating castle.

1815
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,800
Yeah, there was like so many different possible ways that everybody could die.

1816
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,800
And then if Luffy dies, Kaida would come down and kill everyone as well.

1817
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:39,600
Right.

1818
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:41,920
Yeah.

1819
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,280
It's so fucked.

1820
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,520
And then it all happened as well.

1821
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,200
It was honestly really difficult.

1822
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,280
I don't even remember half of these things.

1823
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,880
Oh, yeah, that did happen, didn't it?

1824
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,680
Like, oh my god.

1825
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:01,040
Yeah, I kind of imagined reading it all in one go because week by week it was like,

1826
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:07,200
holy shit, so much happens in one chapter and then whole other sets of things happen in the next.

1827
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,480
I did.

1828
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:15,200
It might have hurt my reading comprehension a bit to binge it, but it's okay.

1829
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,480
I got the gist.

1830
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:24,960
But yeah, this is not setting up to be anywhere near as long just purely because of the amount

1831
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:25,600
of characters.

1832
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:33,200
Like, there's three CP0 and Luchi and Kaku are probably pretty strong.

1833
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,800
Stussy was that whole cake.

1834
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,560
I don't remember if she did anything combat wise.

1835
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,240
The girl?

1836
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:41,360
Is it the silk girl?

1837
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:42,960
No, no, no.

1838
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:43,840
That's Khalifa.

1839
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:49,120
Stussy or Stussy was like, Sussie is better.

1840
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:50,880
Stussy was like-

1841
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,680
Wait, is that the one in the chicken mask?

1842
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,520
Yeah, she's wearing a funny mask.

1843
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,160
I don't know why.

1844
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,880
Oh, I guess she's part of CP0 the whole time.

1845
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,320
Like, she was like-

1846
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:03,040
I don't remember if she does like it all to be perfectly-

1847
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:11,120
She was at the wedding between Pudding and Sanji as an invited guest because she's

1848
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:14,240
a very important person for various reasons I can't remember.

1849
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:20,720
But while she was there, she secretly was being undercover agent for the world government.

1850
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,000
She's CP0.

1851
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
She has knowledge and she let the world government know what happened.

1852
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,480
Because you know Captain Morgan, not Captain Morgan.

1853
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,960
Fuckin' Morgan the Big Bird.

1854
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,000
There could be a Captain.

1855
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,080
Oh yeah, the news guy, the news bird.

1856
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,640
Yeah, Morgan the news bird was there and he spread-

1857
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,480
I love Morgan the news bird.

1858
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,320
Yes, he's so good.

1859
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:46,000
He's like a dastardly devil, Big Bird from-

1860
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,360
He's a dastardly devil.

1861
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:52,960
He's like a freedom of speech guy, but in a good way.

1862
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,520
He's like an actual freedom of speech guy.

1863
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:05,280
Yes, and he spread the news in a way that he wanted it to be spread about Whole Cake.

1864
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:11,760
And that led, I think, to Luffy being branded one of the new Yonko, like the five emperors.

1865
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:12,720
He was one of them now.

1866
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,960
I was like, I'm not sure about that, said everyone.

1867
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,640
Isn't his name literally like News Morgan?

1868
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,640
Yeah, Big News Morgan.

1869
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,480
People just call him Big News.

1870
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:27,680
Should have called him like Big Scoop.

1871
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,880
I like Big News Morgan.

1872
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,000
Not Big News is good.

1873
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,480
But yeah, he was there.

1874
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,960
He spun it the way he did on the newspaper.

1875
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:42,080
But Stussy, Stussy, they're not a saying.

1876
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:42,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1877
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,680
Okay, Lucci's got a chicken sitting on his shoulder.

1878
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:46,720
Is that Stussy?

1879
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,880
No, no, that's the pigeon.

1880
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:49,760
Do you not remember?

1881
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,120
He had a pigeon the whole time back in water seven.

1882
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,120
That's just a pet pigeon that he has?

1883
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:56,480
Yes.

1884
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:01,440
He, if you remember, when he was introduced, he was like, didn't say anything.

1885
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,200
But the pigeon sort of spoke for him.

1886
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,360
And that was his gimmick.

1887
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:09,040
And you didn't know how strong he was until he revealed himself to be a member of CP9.

1888
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,520
And then he started talking and he was evil.

1889
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,720
I do not remember that at all.

1890
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:18,160
Do you remember they worked for, like, they were undercover.

1891
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:21,600
They worked him and Kaku and Khalifa.

1892
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,280
Do they work for Tom?

1893
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:23,600
Or no, not Tom.

1894
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:30,880
They work for Icebar or Iceberg for Galila Company, the shipwrights.

1895
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:32,960
With fucking Pauly.

1896
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,360
And I think that's it.

1897
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,720
There was some other guys.

1898
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,800
Yes, I do remember that.

1899
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,480
Don't remember the pigeon, but okay.

1900
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:45,840
Yeah, the pigeon was there as his, like, I speak through my pigeon thing.

1901
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,920
I don't know why, but like, I guess the pigeon is strong as well,

1902
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,240
because he's got his own fucking tie and hat.

1903
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,120
He would have to be.

1904
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:53,920
He would have to be.

1905
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,800
I don't see, oh wait, no, I see Stussy.

1906
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:03,600
I think in this panel with the kuma facing away, I think I see her like silhouette.

1907
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:09,760
Yeah, she has a few speaking bits, like when Kaku tries to jump

1908
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,760
and then there's the force field, she's got the chicken mask on.

1909
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,040
But like, what's her power?

1910
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,160
What's her deal?

1911
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:22,080
I don't know, but she revealed herself to be a secret government agent

1912
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:26,640
instead of whoever else she was at the whole cake wedding.

1913
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:30,400
When shit went down, she sort of snuck away and she had that bomb.

1914
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,120
I think her briefcase had the bomb in it and the bomb went off.

1915
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,160
Or maybe someone else had the bomb.

1916
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,640
She's the one in like the fluffy feather mask.

1917
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,160
Yeah, yeah.

1918
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:41,440
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1919
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,280
Yeah, what was that bomb?

1920
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,080
Wait, there was a bomb?

1921
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,600
You're talking about Sanji's wedding?

1922
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,120
Yeah, Sanji's wedding.

1923
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:56,800
Do you remember, I forget exactly what I think the briefcase was given to somebody

1924
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:02,320
by fucking the Fishman Island people.

1925
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:06,800
They gave it as a reward or a gift, but it's a bomb.

1926
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:09,920
Oh my God, it's just like bullet train.

1927
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,840
This is the plot of bullet train.

1928
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,240
What even the fuck was that bomb?

1929
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:18,080
I can't remember, but I think she was there when that happened.

1930
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:21,120
I forget.

1931
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:25,920
Yeah, I vaguely remember a briefcase with a bomb in it.

1932
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,120
Maybe, I guess.

1933
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:34,800
Because the big fucking cake, like mountain, the whole cake,

1934
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:40,080
the wedding was being at the top of, that got exploded and it fell down.

1935
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,000
Yes.

1936
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,280
And it was frosting everywhere.

1937
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,320
That feels true.

1938
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:51,440
Agent of CPG, in her cover as an Emperor of the Underworld, that's right.

1939
01:43:51,440 --> 01:44:00,720
She was an underworld person, does shady deals in the similar vein, I guess, to Doflamingo.

1940
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,680
She's just sort of part of the underbelly.

1941
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,440
And so she was invited to this wedding.

1942
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:07,760
Good for her.

1943
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,440
And good for her, girl boss.

1944
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,880
And she is, yeah.

1945
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:12,560
All right.

1946
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,280
Epithet Queen of the Pleasure District.

1947
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,960
Oh, she's like a...

1948
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:17,600
On a whole case?

1949
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,480
Yeah, that's what she was called.

1950
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,400
Or that's what her alias is.

1951
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:27,600
It could be that she is both that and a member of CP Zero.

1952
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,240
Oh, okay.

1953
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:38,960
But that implies that she's like a super rich brothel owner or something.

1954
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,800
She owns every brothel in the world.

1955
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,800
Good for her, girl boss.

1956
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:43,600
Hell yes.

1957
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,080
Hell yeah.

1958
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:55,600
Okay, it's good to review all this stuff because I feel like I've forgotten more than half of it.

1959
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:01,120
More than half of everything that's happened.

1960
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,120
There's always...

1961
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:05,840
I mean, it was always a thing in the podcast as well.

1962
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,680
Nate had a lot of stuff memorized, more than me.

1963
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:10,960
Really?

1964
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:14,720
And whenever I got something wrong, he would say, no, don't you remember?

1965
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:15,520
You fool.

1966
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,760
700 chapters ago, there was this said.

1967
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,600
I think it's because he keeps up with discussions on chapters.

1968
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,200
He probably reads discussion on 4chan.

1969
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,120
Or somewhere else, maybe.

1970
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,960
Where people pool their knowledge and reference things.

1971
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,960
I'm like, I don't really care about all that stuff.

1972
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,800
Just like Vegapunk's giant brain in the egghead loft.

1973
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:37,200
Yes.

1974
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:42,240
Vegapunk's egghead brain knows what the will of D means.

1975
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:46,000
Vegapunk's egghead brain could tell you what Stussy's devil fruit power is.

1976
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,200
He's been paying attention.

1977
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,360
Well, I could read the wiki.

1978
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,080
What's her power?

1979
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,320
Infiltration skills.

1980
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,400
It's not a devil.

1981
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,880
She's so fucking sneaky.

1982
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,040
She can tiptoe like no one's business.

1983
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,320
I mean, I guess if she's CP, she's probably a zoan.

1984
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,080
But you never know.

1985
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,320
Doesn't seem to have any.

1986
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,240
Might have just not been revealed yet.

1987
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,560
Cypherpole doesn't necessarily have animals.

1988
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:17,680
I think that was just like a CP9 specific thing.

1989
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:21,200
BlueKnow was also CP and he did not have zoan.

1990
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:22,000
Get a door fruit.

1991
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,160
He had the doa fruit, yeah.

1992
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:30,880
The doa doa fruit, but he had like long bullhorn hairstyle.

1993
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:35,200
He looked like he was obviously going to have a bull zoan, but then he just didn't.

1994
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,440
Everyone else had a zoan.

1995
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,400
And if you remember Califa, she had the soap thing.

1996
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,040
Yes, yes, the soap.

1997
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:45,760
She made a big like woollen sheep coat of like soap.

1998
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:50,160
And then she put her arms around in like a C shape to look like lamb horns.

1999
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,320
And she did like a pose and she was like a sheep.

2000
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,480
And like Nami was like, cut that shit out.

2001
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,280
That's stupid.

2002
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:55,760
Oh, yeah.

2003
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So like all of them can be an animal.

2004
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,680
They're all like sort of an animal.

2005
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,360
Especially the ones that literally are.

2006
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:09,760
Some of them are literally just are and the ones that aren't sort of pretend.

2007
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,040
Yeah, I love that moment.

2008
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:13,840
That was such a good one.

2009
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:21,920
Yeah, you're feeling me with fond memories of a time when I was surprised and delighted.

2010
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:26,800
It's always a good thing.

2011
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,680
Yeah.

2012
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,440
So what else happened in the chapter?

2013
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,560
Yeah, just they arrived.

2014
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:34,720
CP9 has made their landing and.

2015
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:36,320
Yeah, oh, yeah.

2016
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,440
This is what I was going to.

2017
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,720
This is what I was going to say.

2018
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,760
There's three members.

2019
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,600
It's going to be hard to stop calling them CP9.

2020
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,320
Yeah, CP0.

2021
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,840
There's three members here.

2022
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,520
Presumably they're all very strong.

2023
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,880
Luchi is probably the strongest.

2024
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:51,120
Yeah.

2025
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:57,680
But they're up against the entirety of the Straw Hat crew, which is very strong.

2026
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,600
Like cumulatively.

2027
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,640
They beat him.

2028
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,600
Like individually.

2029
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:03,600
They beat him once.

2030
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,280
And like obviously Luchi is a lot stronger.

2031
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,720
Luchi is probably a lot stronger as well.

2032
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:11,040
But like what chance does CP0 really have to do anything here?

2033
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:13,040
Luchi couldn't fight the whole crew.

2034
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,760
He couldn't fight the whole crew, I don't think.

2035
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:20,080
And he certainly couldn't fight the whole crew plus every Seraphim.

2036
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:26,880
Every Seraphim and all these Vegapunk people who I assume have like crazy powers.

2037
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,920
So like what are they going to do?

2038
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,120
Kuma is going to appear.

2039
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,960
It might be that Kuma turns the tide.

2040
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,960
And if he's working for CP0, he'll like do something real bad.

2041
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,760
Yeah, I don't know.

2042
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,080
Like what even what even could happen?

2043
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,040
That's what we're going to find out the next chapter one piece.

2044
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:51,440
Okay, CP's goal, they're just on an assassination mission, right?

2045
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,280
They're just like assassinate Vegapunk.

2046
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,000
That seems to be their goal.

2047
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Yeah, I suppose it'll be like get Vegapunk out of here.

2048
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:05,920
Because he's like a little, he's an old man.

2049
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,760
He's not physically strong.

2050
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:12,080
He's just got a funny brain double fruit and a lot of tech.

2051
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,680
So if they get him, then he's gut.

2052
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:20,880
Yeah, he's also got like, I guess he, I guess he, did we really,

2053
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,840
did we know that he was just like projecting a hologram this whole time?

2054
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,040
I think we didn't.

2055
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:25,840
No, we didn't.

2056
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:26,400
Oh, okay.

2057
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,000
I don't think so.

2058
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,240
Maybe somebody else was projecting a hologram.

2059
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,560
Someone, someone was projecting a hologram.

2060
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:38,880
I think what it was is like we see him half stuck in something and he said,

2061
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,760
oh no, the teleport didn't work again.

2062
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,480
So it's presumed that he teleported his physical body.

2063
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:49,040
Or it could be that he just has the ability to teleport around his island.

2064
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:54,160
So like he's just doing another teleport and that was his physical body.

2065
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,280
That's how he teleports.

2066
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,120
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

2067
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:06,000
I wonder, would be pretty interesting to see him fight like what,

2068
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,680
what abilities does he have?

2069
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:13,600
Like, or has the, I assume he has made devices for himself.

2070
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,160
He's probably got some devices, some gadgets, some gizmos.

2071
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:23,680
I, I think there's no, there's no doubt, no doubt about the gadgets and gizmos.

2072
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,120
Damn, I wish there was more.

2073
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:36,480
Looking forward to continuing this journey.

2074
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:41,200
You there?

2075
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:42,640
Yeah.

2076
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:46,880
Yeah, I'm just, I'm trying to see like this last image.

2077
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,000
What's her face?

2078
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:50,720
What's her name?

2079
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:53,920
Monster Atlas.

2080
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:55,840
It's Atlas, the big girl.

2081
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,400
The big one.

2082
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2083
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:00,480
I thought that was one of those, I thought that was one of those giant,

2084
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,480
I thought that was one of those giant kids from,

2085
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,760
where were the giant kids?

2086
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:10,880
From punk hazard, the, the experiments that Caesar clown was doing on those

2087
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,560
children because Big Mom wanted to make a race of giants for her family.

2088
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,240
That's the one, that's the one.

2089
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:16,480
Yes.

2090
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:20,400
But I guess she's not, unless maybe she is.

2091
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,840
No, she's just, she's just big.

2092
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:22,720
She might just be big.

2093
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,880
Are they, are they all robots?

2094
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,400
I would assume they're all like entirely artificial.

2095
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:30,240
Yeah.

2096
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:31,200
I mean, maybe not.

2097
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:34,720
I know, I've no reason to believe either way.

2098
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,880
I just assume that they're completely robotic.

2099
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:44,720
Yeah, I guess that's probably a, like, since they're all seemed, they're all a set.

2100
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:49,840
So probably they're all the same type of thing and some of them are definitely robots.

2101
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,920
So probably all of them are robots.

2102
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:53,520
Oh my God.

2103
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:55,360
Like Mega Man.

2104
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:57,600
They're so mega.

2105
01:51:59,600 --> 01:51:59,920
Yeah.

2106
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:00,400
Okay.

2107
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,040
I mean, that makes sense.

2108
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,040
Is Vegapunk a wily or a light?

2109
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,800
Vegapunk, more like Megapunk.

2110
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:06,400
What, what?

2111
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,520
Megapunk.

2112
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,240
Sanji kind of has like,

2113
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,720
we've been seeing Sanji in a second.

2114
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,880
He was with, who was he with?

2115
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:23,680
I forget.

2116
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:24,560
I guess we haven't seen much of him.

2117
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,400
I don't think he was even in this chapter at all.

2118
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:27,360
Yeah.

2119
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,440
No, he's, he's with one of the groups.

2120
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:34,080
I don't think it, yeah, the two on the ship are Zoro and Brooke.

2121
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:35,600
Right.

2122
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,640
They, they haven't done anything.

2123
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:37,760
They've just been chilling.

2124
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:38,320
And then.

2125
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,480
But they probably have definitely heard the explosion.

2126
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:41,600
So we might be thinking.

2127
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:47,840
Here with Vegapunk is Luffy and Chopper and Jinbei and Nami?

2128
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:48,800
Is Nami here?

2129
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,440
Yeah.

2130
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,080
No, Bonnie.

2131
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:51,440
Okay.

2132
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:57,360
So Sanji and Nami and Robin and Frankie are somewhere else?

2133
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,160
And Usopp.

2134
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:58,400
Yeah.

2135
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:58,960
And Usopp.

2136
01:52:58,960 --> 01:52:59,600
What are they doing?

2137
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:04,800
They went up into the place and they were looking around.

2138
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:10,480
Oh, um, what's, Kali, no, the girl, the girl Vegapunk is taking them to go and look at like

2139
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:16,320
the Seraphim chambers or up to see the punk, the punk archives?

2140
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:18,320
Something.

2141
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:18,640
Yes.

2142
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:19,040
Yeah.

2143
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:23,360
They, they met up with, with Daft Punk and he started saying things.

2144
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:24,640
Oh, right.

2145
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:24,800
Yeah.

2146
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,000
They're, they're with Daft Punk.

2147
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:29,840
They're in the control tower.

2148
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,040
And also the evil girl.

2149
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:31,840
Seeing, seeing everything.

2150
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:36,480
Also, is that a, is that a joke like Vegapunk, Daft Punk?

2151
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,320
Is that like, is that a joke?

2152
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,240
Is that on purpose?

2153
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:46,320
I mean, I feel like Daft Punk is famous enough and that design is like similar enough that it was

2154
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:49,280
probably true, like, yes, like a reference.

2155
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,520
Like he, he looks like Daft Punk on purpose, right?

2156
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:53,280
That's not, that's not a coincidence.

2157
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:53,760
Oh yeah.

2158
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:54,240
Okay.

2159
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:54,480
Yeah.

2160
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,040
Yeah.

2161
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,120
Everyone loves Daft Punk robot designs.

2162
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:57,600
Yeah.

2163
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:58,000
Okay.

2164
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,480
Just check it.

2165
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,720
It would be cool if there was like a Mega Man reference in this, in this whole thing,

2166
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,480
you know, like an explicit one.

2167
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:12,560
I, I mean, I would be, I would be, I would soy face.

2168
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:14,960
I would soy face.

2169
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:18,960
Uh, you know, a couple people have said that like

2170
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:24,080
Mega, people have definitely said that Mega Man is just a ripoff of Astro Boy.

2171
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,160
And I've don't, I have never read Astro Boy.

2172
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:30,560
So like, I'm sure that to a certain extent that, that's definitely true.

2173
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:31,920
But like,

2174
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,600
I, I would think a lot of, a lot of the trappings.

2175
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:36,560
Yeah.

2176
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:39,920
A lot of the trappings of the design, like Astro Boy is a young boy.

2177
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:47,280
There's, there's scientists that have like lost a child and turned a, made a robot son.

2178
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:47,600
Yeah.

2179
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:51,760
I forget like how the law, like I haven't read all of Astro Boy.

2180
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:57,760
I mostly know Astro Boy law from the GBA game Omega Factor, which is like the best GBA game ever.

2181
01:54:58,960 --> 01:54:59,280
Really?

2182
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,920
Uh, well, as a game, it's fine.

2183
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,960
But like the, the, it really tugs on your heartstrings.

2184
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,160
The story is really good.

2185
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:06,640
Oh, wow.

2186
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:13,200
And it's, it's because that draws from every Tezuka work ever, every character from his

2187
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,640
entire library of stuff.

2188
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:18,560
And they just make a unique story building with, with all those building blocks.

2189
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:25,520
And Astro Boy does deal a lot with the sentient of robots, humans versus robots.

2190
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:25,840
Yeah.

2191
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:30,560
And like, and power dynamics and, uh, like who should live?

2192
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,600
Who should be like the tough questions.

2193
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,520
So it's, and then there's this cute little boy,

2194
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,680
this cute little boy with an R, a gun on his arm.

2195
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:37,920
Yeah.

2196
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:38,640
It's a space.

2197
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:40,240
Does, does Astro Boy have a gun on his arm?

2198
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,960
He, his arm turns into a gun.

2199
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:43,920
Oh, okay.

2200
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:45,920
So yeah, just like, just like Mega Man.

2201
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:47,040
Yeah.

2202
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:48,800
Cool.

2203
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:51,200
Uh, oh no, I wasted my time.

2204
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:52,160
I wasted my time.

2205
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:55,040
I experienced the derivative work of media.

2206
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:55,840
No.

2207
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:58,240
Gringe.

2208
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:01,840
I love Astro Boy so much.

2209
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,040
I should read everything.

2210
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:03,120
I'm sorry.

2211
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:04,960
I've read like a couple books.

2212
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:09,680
They made, they made a, they made a GBA game that's just like a mishmash,

2213
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:13,120
melange of all of like Tezuka's classic manga characters.

2214
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:14,800
Yeah.

2215
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,680
That sounds amazing.

2216
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:17,600
This, it is great.

2217
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,200
You should play Omega Factor.

2218
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:21,680
I think, I'm intrigued.

2219
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:23,600
I think you would enjoy it.

2220
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,680
Although I mean, I'm not, I haven't really read,

2221
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:28,640
I haven't really read much Tezuka, to be honest.

2222
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:29,840
I don't, I don't know anything.

2223
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:33,200
I didn't know anything about any Tezuka before I played that game.

2224
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,760
But like, it's, it's good.

2225
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,720
There's like Blackjack, the, the surgeon.

2226
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:43,040
And there's fucking Kimba.

2227
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:43,520
That was Tezuka.

2228
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:44,240
Kimba's in there.

2229
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:48,880
Well, it's like cartoon all stars to the rescue.

2230
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:51,040
Yeah.

2231
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:51,840
But, but good.

2232
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:52,960
But good.

2233
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:54,800
It's, it's really good.

2234
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:57,040
People cry.

2235
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:58,640
I cry at the end of that game.

2236
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,240
That's the, that's the sort of,

2237
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,960
that's what they call good story writing.

2238
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,320
That's what you call, that's what you call epic.

2239
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:08,960
I don't know.

2240
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:11,840
I have to pee.

2241
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:13,760
I'll be back.

2242
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:15,040
Okay.

2243
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:18,480
Not to change the subject or anything.

2244
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:23,520
Although going into the bathroom and seeing no toilet paper

2245
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:28,240
just reminded me about my new housemates.

2246
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,800
And it reminded, and I was reminded.

2247
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:35,040
But the other day, one of them mentioned that he was like

2248
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:37,600
thinking about starting a podcast.

2249
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,480
And I was like, oh no.

2250
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,240
You haven't told them, I assume.

2251
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:42,480
No.

2252
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,680
I was like, I can't let this guy know.

2253
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:48,800
I can't fucking let this guy know.

2254
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:54,480
I told one guy that I was working on a YouTube video.

2255
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:56,080
Which you were.

2256
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:56,960
Which I was.

2257
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,120
Yeah.

2258
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,280
Yeah.

2259
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,280
That was a cup like a little while ago.

2260
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:00,560
He asked me like what I do.

2261
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,760
And I said, oh, you know, post stuff on the internet.

2262
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:04,080
I've worked on YouTube.

2263
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,520
Oh, I'm just posting.

2264
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:06,400
I'm just posting.

2265
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,400
Some people are just born posters.

2266
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:14,480
But I didn't mention a podcast.

2267
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:20,400
And this guy, he just offhandedly, he just saw I had a microphone.

2268
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,640
And he asked me like what I use it for.

2269
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:27,520
And I said, oh, you know, I record stuff with friends on, you know, sometimes.

2270
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:28,880
And he was like, oh, yeah, yeah.

2271
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:32,240
I mean, there's something about, I don't remember what he said.

2272
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:35,840
He said something about, he says something about he had a friend who like

2273
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,160
was starting a podcast.

2274
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,600
And he was like, maybe I should start a pocket.

2275
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,360
And I was like, ah, no.

2276
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:46,640
Imagine if it all converged like you're all in your separate rooms,

2277
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:48,720
making podcasts at the same time.

2278
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,480
We become a post.

2279
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:51,360
We're a post-in house.

2280
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,600
We're a post-in family.

2281
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:54,960
We post in this house.

2282
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,880
In this house, we post.

2283
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:59,840
And if you're not posting, then you don't live here anymore.

2284
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:05,680
Yeah, damn.

2285
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,280
Podcasting sure is cringe.

2286
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:09,520
Long.

2287
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,720
Continues podcasting.

2288
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,320
Here we go.

2289
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:17,920
He's, he said on his podcast, he said with his latte, with his soy latte,

2290
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:24,240
he's paid $8 for his Starbucks soy latte, but he won't pay $8 for his blue checkmark.

2291
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:30,800
I haven't seen anyone with a blue checkmark in a long time.

2292
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,360
I guess I don't see them that much anyway, but.

2293
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:37,280
I see them, I see them around sometimes.

2294
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,280
And it's always, it's always cringe.

2295
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:43,040
Honestly, the worst is when I see someone that makes a post that I agree with and I check

2296
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:45,760
and they've got a blue checkmark and I'm like, oh God.

2297
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,640
Did they have that before the paid thing though?

2298
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:51,440
No, there's no way to know.

2299
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:52,560
No, there is a way to know.

2300
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,240
You can, you can, if you hover over the checkmark on their profile,

2301
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:59,520
it'll tell you whether they have it because they're notable or if they just bought it.

2302
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:02,720
So you can see.

2303
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,880
And whenever it's someone that bought it, I'm just like, well,

2304
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,480
I might agree with your opinion on this particular issue.

2305
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:12,240
But like, I'm not, you're, you're DNI.

2306
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:13,280
You do not interact.

2307
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,040
You're, you're dead, I'm sorry.

2308
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:17,600
I'm sorry, we can't be friends.

2309
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,960
That's just how, that's the way the news goes.

2310
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,560
That's the way the big news goes.

2311
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:27,680
Big news, Morgan.

2312
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:29,680
What a, what a dude.

2313
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:32,320
Yes.

2314
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:33,200
Want to see more of him.

2315
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:36,400
I'm sure we will.

2316
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:38,720
He's, he's, he's the news.

2317
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,160
That's the way the news goes, as he says.

2318
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,360
His famous catchphrase.

2319
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:49,280
All right.

2320
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:50,560
Well, what do you think?

2321
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:51,280
Voice mail time?

2322
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:53,760
Yeah.

2323
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:55,280
All right.

2324
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:57,360
Well, let's do it.

2325
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:02,800
I'm looking at and I'm seeing that the first voicemail of the week is called.

2326
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:03,760
Wow.

2327
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:05,440
You see it?

2328
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,360
Yep.

2329
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:08,320
Do you see it?

2330
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:08,560
Okay.

2331
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:13,360
Well, let's, let's hope that my internet is better this week than last week.

2332
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:13,760
Lol.

2333
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:14,160
Okay.

2334
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:15,520
Three, two, one, go.

2335
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:23,520
Ben, by the time I was, I'm sending these, it's a hundred thousand.

2336
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:23,920
Good job.

2337
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:24,880
You did it.

2338
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,200
Oh.

2339
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:25,680
High five.

2340
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:26,640
Yeah.

2341
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,840
Did you, did you high five me?

2342
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:32,880
This was sent a week ago.

2343
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:33,920
Yeah.

2344
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:38,240
The video made a hundred K in just under a week.

2345
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:44,080
And now at the two, it had, it was like, it was at like 200 and like 30 something K

2346
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,000
at the two week mark.

2347
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:49,200
So thanks, thanks.

2348
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:52,320
You know, it's very refreshing.

2349
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:57,600
I have had a couple people finding, find me through the Mega Man lecture

2350
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,880
and they, and they don't know what the PCP is.

2351
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:02,960
They don't know about Sonichu.

2352
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,440
They don't know any of the horrors.

2353
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:07,920
They're free.

2354
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:08,800
Yes.

2355
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,640
Their minds are clean and pure.

2356
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,040
They don't know about Digi Bro.

2357
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:15,200
They don't know about my little pony.

2358
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,120
Imagine being someone like that.

2359
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:20,160
It's so refreshing.

2360
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:21,520
I can't, I can't.

2361
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,040
I have to live through them.

2362
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:26,960
The next one is called clicking a pen.

2363
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,480
Three, two, one, go.

2364
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:32,560
So I just saw that Mega Man video.

2365
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:34,320
True.

2366
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:37,520
And at the 12 minute marker.

2367
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:41,360
So you say, hang on, I'm thirsty.

2368
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:42,720
And that was pretty funny.

2369
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:43,520
Thanks.

2370
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:46,480
That made me laugh, made me laugh really hard for like a minute.

2371
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,280
Thank you very much.

2372
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,600
I liked when I said I'm thirsty.

2373
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:50,720
Anyways, that's not the point.

2374
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:56,160
I was just going to say, I like the video, but when's the Mega Man battle network

2375
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:57,600
one coming out?

2376
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,480
Probably will do one.

2377
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,920
I probably will do that at some point.

2378
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,240
It'll be a good companion piece.

2379
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:08,240
Yeah, I think I might have said this, but I think I do want to do it.

2380
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:10,400
I should do it and I want to do it.

2381
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:11,600
I don't want to do it right away.

2382
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:15,040
I feel like I've had enough Mega Man for the moment.

2383
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,120
For the Mega Moment.

2384
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,360
For the Mega, for the Mega Moment.

2385
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:22,640
I kind of don't want to like play more video games right now.

2386
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:24,800
I'm going to do something else.

2387
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,520
I just released, I just released a damn

2388
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:33,360
Patron's Q&A podcast where I talk about

2389
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:36,720
what I'm going to do for the next lecture and other stuff.

2390
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:44,000
So, um, actually some of it might be a repeat of what I talked about here on last week,

2391
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,520
but don't think about that.

2392
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,200
Don't, don't worry about that.

2393
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:50,800
Next one is called It's a Good Idea.

2394
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:51,840
I stand by it.

2395
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:52,960
Three, two, one, go.

2396
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,720
All right, Ben, your Mega Man lecture is finally out

2397
02:03:56,720 --> 02:04:03,360
and I think it is time for you to move on to your next, uh, large project.

2398
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,360
And I think I've got a great idea for you.

2399
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:06,720
Here's my pitch.

2400
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:12,640
Here's my pitch for the next months long arc of the, uh, the life of Ben St.

2401
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:13,120
I know, I know.

2402
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:14,080
Here we go.

2403
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:19,040
My big idea is you should fuck Jenny Nicholson.

2404
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,480
Hmm.

2405
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:21,520
Think about it.

2406
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:22,560
Make a video.

2407
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:23,600
Make a video out of it.

2408
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:26,320
That's an idea.

2409
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:32,800
You know, maybe there's something, you know, you know, it sounds crazy, but I mean,

2410
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:34,640
it just might work.

2411
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:36,400
You, she can make a video about it.

2412
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:37,840
You could both make content out of that.

2413
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,040
I could make a video about it.

2414
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,400
She could make a video about it.

2415
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:41,440
We could review it.

2416
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:49,520
Hey, Jenny Nicholson, what are you doing in my review of sex with you?

2417
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:56,080
Yeah, I'm all right.

2418
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:58,000
I'll put it on the maybe list.

2419
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:01,520
Now that's content.

2420
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:06,960
Oh, dude, I gotta kick out of that.

2421
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,200
X1 is called right now.

2422
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:14,800
Three, two, one, go.

2423
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:22,560
Ben, now make your brand in your catchphrase whenever you finish a sentence.

2424
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,400
Say, huh, maybe I should make a lecture about that.

2425
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,640
Everyone will love it.

2426
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,080
Your fan base will triplicate.

2427
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:34,240
Triplicate.

2428
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,600
My fan base will triplicate.

2429
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:41,520
It's like a Japanese, one of those anime character, like they end a sentence with a

2430
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:45,360
nyon or a nyodon or something, or they end it with a pya.

2431
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:48,800
But for me, it's maybe I should make a lecture about that.

2432
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,880
I could roll off the tongue pretty well.

2433
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,160
I'll workshop it.

2434
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:59,040
Motivate, and I end every sentence with a till day, till day lecture.

2435
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:00,880
What do you think?

2436
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:02,160
Till day?

2437
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:06,480
Yeah, you know, till day, the squiggly line.

2438
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:08,720
I always pronounce it tilde.

2439
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:10,320
Oh, whatever.

2440
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:12,880
Stupid, stupid.

2441
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:16,560
Never mind.

2442
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:20,000
It's just like tilde swinton.

2443
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:26,160
Yeah, yeah, that's how you spell it.

2444
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:29,120
It's no, it's not.

2445
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,360
No.

2446
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:33,760
Yeah, it's like, no, it's like e.

2447
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:35,760
It's an e.

2448
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:37,600
It's till day.

2449
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:38,800
It's tilde swinton.

2450
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:41,040
Oh, yeah.

2451
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:43,120
Oh, I see.

2452
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:46,720
Mm, swinton, I end my sentences with...

2453
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:50,720
What was that?

2454
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:56,320
Well, okay.

2455
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:59,600
Next one is called, we'll see.

2456
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:06,160
There's congrats on the video ban, congrats on 69k ban, congrats on 100k ban, congrats on 169

2457
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:08,240
ban, congrats on 200k ban.

2458
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:12,400
Haven't hit 269 yet, so I look forward to that.

2459
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:14,160
Congratulations.

2460
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:18,720
Next one is, is lecture better than video essay?

2461
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,240
Question mark, three, two, one, go.

2462
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:29,680
Yo, so I'm listening to episode 337 right now, where Ben is like talking about all the topics for

2463
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:32,080
potential lectures.

2464
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:40,080
And I feel like, yeah, some of these aren't great lecture topics, but I think some of them

2465
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:46,720
would just be nice and short concise, like regular ass YouTube video essays, I don't know.

2466
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,120
If there's something that Ben just doesn't want to do, I would like to know.

2467
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:03,120
I think I said something similar in the, my Patreon post where I talked about this, like,

2468
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:08,560
yeah, some of those things, yeah, would not make for a great lecture.

2469
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:11,760
Like, I think in particular I said the one about phantom horn, like, discussing phantom

2470
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:14,080
horn as a character, like, that's not lecture worthy.

2471
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,240
I could make a video about it.

2472
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:23,120
I don't know, to be perfectly honest, I'm very out of practice at, like, writing essays,

2473
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:28,800
but I think it's something that I would like to pick up and try doing again.

2474
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,720
So maybe I would just try and, like, write a video essay about something like that, that I

2475
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:38,640
want to talk about, but that I don't have, like, a lecture on.

2476
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:50,000
The lecture format, for me, is a bit of a, it's sort of a bit of a, it's sort of a bit of a, like,

2477
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:57,520
I don't know, it's kind of a way to, like, get content out of, like, speaking off the cuff

2478
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:04,000
in, like, a structured way, but that I don't have to, like, prescript and read off of a script about.

2479
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:11,200
I always feel like my, my voice is so weird and stupid when I'm speaking off a script,

2480
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:16,400
compared to, like, speaking off the cuff, it's just sort of like I'm saying something,

2481
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:19,760
and I say it in the way I normally talk, so it's like, it's flows.

2482
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:25,200
When I write a script, I'm not really writing the way I would speak unless I try to.

2483
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:29,520
I, I feel that as well.

2484
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:34,000
I feel like, yeah, like, my writing voice is different from my speaking voice,

2485
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:42,160
and I guess I don't, like, I don't really do scripted content, and wait a minute.

2486
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:49,360
I feel like, am I getting deja vu? Was I talking earlier this episode about, like, how, like,

2487
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:56,240
did I, did I say something earlier this episode about, like, oh, but if I did

2488
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:02,560
that, if I did something, like, would, like, would people still accept me or something?

2489
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:06,160
Am I crazy? Do I have a nightmare? Do I have a waking nightmare?

2490
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:07,440
What you're talking about?

2491
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:10,960
I don't know. I feel, I feel a sense of deja vu, like, I said this already, but anyway,

2492
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:14,480
what I'm trying to say is that, uh, uh, yeah, I feel like I wonder, like,

2493
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:19,280
would I, would, would it be annoying? Would I, would I sound annoying? Like, either my,

2494
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:23,200
my writing voice as in, like, the way that I structure my senses is stuff when I write,

2495
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:28,080
or my delivery, reading on a script. When I, when I hear myself reading off of a script,

2496
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:34,960
it feels awkward and stilted to me, and I wonder if others feel the same way about it, or is it

2497
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:40,160
just that it feels weird to me because I'm not used to hearing myself talk like that?

2498
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:47,760
Um, it could just be you. I mean, I feel that way about my script-speaking voice, and you know

2499
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:54,080
what my videos sound like. I assume you remember, like, hypocrite videos don't sound like how I speak

2500
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:58,640
or whatever. A little, a little different. There's a little difference. It's like,

2501
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,840
I mean, I sometimes- The cadence is a little bit, yeah. A little bit different, yeah.

2502
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:07,280
But you don't think it's like terrible. You just think it's different.

2503
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:16,800
Yeah. I think that probably other people would not think that it sounds as weird as I think it

2504
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:24,080
sounds when I hear myself speaking like that. To me, it sounds unnatural, but also like reading,

2505
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:30,800
reading scripted content is like, that's like most of what people say on, well, that's not true,

2506
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:36,080
because in video, in the video essay genre, like, that's the standard for video essays,

2507
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:43,120
and like, nobody thinks it's weird. So, I don't know. I feel like I should try it. I feel like I

2508
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:47,600
should try, like, yeah, write an essay, read it as a video essay, because I never really did that.

2509
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:52,800
I did the closest thing I did were the rambles and the Winnie the Pooh videos, but those were not

2510
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:56,880
scripted. Those were like, yeah, I was reading off of notes. I was sort of speaking off the cuff,

2511
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:02,240
going off of notes that I wrote. I should at some point try to write a script and deliver it

2512
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:08,480
in script and just see if it sucks or not. Yeah. There's no, like, correct way to do it.

2513
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:16,080
It just whatever ends up being good. Like, I feel like I, unfortunately, I'm not good at

2514
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:21,200
remembering things and keeping on track. So, if I go off the cuff, I need to do a lot of editing

2515
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:28,800
afterwards to make it flow good, but I sound better and more fun when I'm off the cuff,

2516
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:36,000
and I can do more funny bits in between points. I think, yeah, I think that, like,

2517
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,640
the Mega Man lecture, the way that I delivered it off the cuff, but then I, like, cutting it down

2518
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:45,120
into, like, only, like, the parts where I'm, like, speaking animatedly, and I'm, like,

2519
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:52,720
no pauses, no, like, um, um, um. I really think that that captures a lot of, like,

2520
02:12:53,920 --> 02:13:00,320
energy. I really think that makes it a pretty engaging watch. So, I think it worked well.

2521
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:04,400
And that's the same thing. I mean, they did the same thing in the ones that I said,

2522
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:08,560
in the, the, the, the carry can read video and the Mike's Mike video. That's exactly what they

2523
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:15,360
did in those. And I think it worked similarly. So, I think it's a good formula. It's not the only

2524
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:22,400
formula. And I might try, yeah, for some of those other topics, maybe if I want to make that Phantom

2525
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:28,880
Horn video, I might make it as a more traditional YouTube video essay. Yeah. That's a good question,

2526
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,840
though. Good question.

2527
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:38,240
As a quick, a quick aside, what do you think of long video essays, you know, just sort of a long

2528
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:44,800
video essay that has, like, a lengthy, like, musical intro where it tries to be super epic,

2529
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:49,840
and there are, like, titles and stuff? Because I don't like those. I want-

2530
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:50,320
Are there?

2531
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:56,960
I, I, I feel like you can have, like, a flashy video essay documentary or whatever.

2532
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:04,560
But I want to get to the point immediately. I don't like it when there's, like, this implied,

2533
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:08,160
like, reverence for a video I haven't even seen on, and I don't even know if it's good yet.

2534
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:15,440
Can you get, I can think of one or two examples. I mean, the, well, the only thing that jumps

2535
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:18,720
from, some of the action button reviews kind of have that a little bit.

2536
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:25,600
There, there's, it was just sort of, like, I felt very strongly about it when I saw people on

2537
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:29,600
Twitter talking about this specific video. I can't remember what it was about. And they said,

2538
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:33,200
oh, it's so good. It's such a really good video. And I click on it and I'm like, okay,

2539
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:42,560
lay it on me. And it's just sort of, like, slow and, like, epic. And they're not saying anything

2540
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:46,480
yet. And I'm like, okay, this is the big intro for your, like, three hour long video.

2541
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:48,880
You don't remember what the video was?

2542
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:52,560
I didn't watch it because it was like, I was annoyed by the intro and I left.

2543
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:57,360
Do you remember what it was called or who made it or what channel it was on?

2544
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:03,280
No, it was just sort of a passing encounter with, you know, one of those types of videos. I'm like,

2545
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:08,000
I understand that if you know what the video is about and you care about,

2546
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,440
like, if you are making it, you know that it's going to be epic. But like,

2547
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:15,760
I don't know that. I'm just some random person. I see it and I'm like, I get bored immediately.

2548
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:22,560
Action button is the only example I can think of like that, to be honest.

2549
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:27,200
All you really need is a good immediate thing, like summoning salt.

2550
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:28,240
And they're not all like that.

2551
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:33,840
Summoning salts, like video essays about speedrunning. I do, I mean, the formula is pretty

2552
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:39,360
done for me at this point. I don't really care about speedrun world record,

2553
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:45,120
like recaps. They're pretty cool still. But the way he structures the videos has always been good

2554
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:52,640
is that he gets you like he gets the big point off immediately. Then there's the music and then

2555
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:56,480
he goes into like the big the intro. Well, like it's a little bit beginning.

2556
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:04,400
I'm not complaining. It's a little bit like high school essay, the way that he structures them.

2557
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:10,400
Like it's not a problem. It's fine. You know, if it don't if it work, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

2558
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:17,280
But it's a little bit like, since the dawn of time, mankind has wondered how fast can you beat

2559
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:23,600
Mario 64? Today, we will explore the answer. Music plays okay, and then we're in. Like that's the

2560
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:31,120
intro paragraph. Yeah, like it's like it's fine. It's serviceable. I wouldn't say he's like the

2561
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:35,760
best one of it. It's just the first one that comes to my head is like somebody who gives you the

2562
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:44,640
initial what is this video about immediately and then has its intro and then the explanation follows.

2563
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:52,640
I mean, the first few times, I was like, oh, cool. I don't know anything about speed running,

2564
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:58,880
and it's so handy that there is a video that's going to teach me about it. Because like that's

2565
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:06,720
it's hard to at the time he was like blowing up kind of wasn't like a big community around

2566
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:11,840
speedrun, archiving and talking about at least not I mean, it's it's gotten bigger. It's gotten

2567
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:18,640
bigger, like because of him. I mean, maybe maybe it would have anyway. But yeah. Yeah,

2568
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:21,120
there may be were people already doing it, but I just never saw them.

2569
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:28,720
No, he definitely was that like at the forefront of the like, Hey, what if I made videos explaining

2570
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:35,280
speed running? And it's like, it's good content. It's a good formula. It's the kind of video

2571
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:42,000
that like, I can if they make more of them, like I'll watch them because like it's good stuff to

2572
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:49,280
just put on to like, sort of pay attention to the reason I say the formula has gotten old for me

2573
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:58,080
or I'm done with it is just I think a lot of the same tropes are used in the way of telling the

2574
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:03,600
story. Like you've got this character, this gamer who's doing these things. And then suddenly,

2575
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:09,920
somebody found like, this was how the low the record got. But then you discover this gift

2576
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:14,640
that saved a minute. And then people did it. And then there was this new runner and it's like

2577
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:20,720
and then that same guy from before also did it. And then another challenger came. It's pretty

2578
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:26,400
simple, like the beats of the story, regardless of the game, regardless of anything, the whole point

2579
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:32,080
is that it gets the patterns, the patterns, the patterns emerge. Yeah, the pattern, you start

2580
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:36,960
to see the code behind the matrix a little bit, I get you. And so I'm more interested in games

2581
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:43,520
that I care about and know about than just, I don't know, Mario Kart Wii.

2582
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:53,360
I okay, I know that you haven't seen these, but man, I got a little annoyed.

2583
02:18:54,320 --> 02:19:01,280
Because I made, I made some pretty mild criticism of Tim Rogers action button on Twitter yesterday.

2584
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:07,440
And not everyone, you know, some people disagreed with me and that's fine. A couple of people got

2585
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:13,200
really mad and like, were really like angry and defensive and accusatory towards me

2586
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:20,720
for like really, really gentle criticism that I made. Like, basically, I literally just said

2587
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:26,720
that one of his videos was better than a different one of his video. Yeah, I saw the tweet. How mad

2588
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:32,880
were they? I don't, well, one guy saying so much. One guy told me I should die mad. And then he said

2589
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:41,200
that I was accusing Tim of faking a disability, which I was not. People, people said, some people

2590
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:47,680
said I was just projecting. Some people said I was a hypocrite because, yeah.

2591
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:59,120
I don't know. I didn't like it. I really didn't like that attitude. I said that in my, I just said,

2592
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:05,680
I said that the, I didn't like, I didn't really like, I mean, I like the Bokunopiko, not Bokunopiko,

2593
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:11,680
the book, sorry, the Bokunonatsuyasumi video. I enjoyed it. I thought that the vacation

2594
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:18,320
diversion was a bit longer than it needed to be. I kind of don't like, I sort of, I sort of have

2595
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:23,600
the same criticism of the Tokimeki, I like the Tokimeki Memorial video. It feels more unique.

2596
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:29,040
It feels more original. It feels to me like the Bokunonatsuyasumi video was sort of kind of trying

2597
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:34,640
to do the same thing again. And I'm like, okay, this doesn't feel as unique. This doesn't feel

2598
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:48,640
special the second time. And then the, I don't know. That's it. That's it. I like the first one

2599
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:54,960
better because I feel like it was, it's the original version. And like, I don't know, man, I'm sorry.

2600
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:02,800
I don't even know where I was going with that. I like those videos. They're good.

2601
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:08,720
I'm deeply suspicious of Tim as a person, but like whatever, that's neither here nor there.

2602
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:14,880
Why are you suspicious? I don't know. I don't like how self aggrandizing, he's self aggrandizing,

2603
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:21,680
but it's in like a stealth way that I feel like, I'm, I feel like I'm going crazy because I feel

2604
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:27,440
like I'm the only one that notices it. It feels like everyone thinks that Tim is like a very like

2605
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:36,000
self deprecating, self effacing, humble guy. And I think that's like a trick that people are

2606
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,840
falling for. Like, I think he's humble bragging, but he's doing it in a very like,

2607
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:44,960
he's doing it in a very effective way that people are genuinely falling for it. And that makes me

2608
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:50,880
uneasy. I haven't watched any of his stuff, but the only impression I've gotten of him

2609
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:56,640
through people talking about how cool his videos are is that there's a lot of parasocial stuff going

2610
02:21:56,640 --> 02:22:00,960
on. And maybe his videos are good, but they love him when they talk about him.

2611
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:09,040
Yeah. I mean, I would have agreed with that before, but like now seeing, seeing like,

2612
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:15,040
you know, this was just a couple of people, but seeing like a couple people get genuinely outraged

2613
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:24,160
with me over my mild take. It's like these, I don't know. I don't know. I really, all right,

2614
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:29,920
I feel, I feel this way about Tokimeki Memorial and the Boku no Naziasmi videos.

2615
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:36,640
Both of them lean a little too hard into they basically are about Tim. They are more about

2616
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:43,360
Tim than they are about the video, the game. And that's not a sin. That's not a crime. However,

2617
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:49,760
I don't like it. It reminds me. I don't know. I don't, I don't like when I get that feeling

2618
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:54,640
about a video, I feel dirty. And Tokimeki Memorial and Boku no Naziasmi both give me

2619
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:59,360
that feeling a little bit. Like the point here is for Tim to talk about himself. And that makes

2620
02:22:59,360 --> 02:23:08,800
me like gives me a yucky feeling. And then I don't know. I think he talks about himself in a way

2621
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:17,680
that evokes pity while at the same time aggrandizes and mythologizes himself. And

2622
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:24,640
I don't know. Yeah, it feels almost calculate, it feels calculated to evoke

2623
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:32,880
a certain level of devotion of like protectiveness and parasocial devotion. And I feel like that's

2624
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:38,640
what I witnessed yesterday from a couple of these people. And it has, it reinforced,

2625
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:44,640
it reinforced a sort of a sort of creeping sense, a sort of vague feeling that I had about him

2626
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:54,080
has been validated somewhat a bit. Right? Yeah, I mean, maybe, I feel like, I mean,

2627
02:23:54,080 --> 02:24:00,560
the reason I said parasocial was mostly because I didn't know what the appeal was. And nobody would

2628
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:05,120
tell me. They would just say they're so good. They're so good at these videos. I'm like,

2629
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:15,520
but like, why though? Well, I mean, he talks, I mean, he is an interesting guy. And he does

2630
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:20,400
have interesting stories about his life. And like he's he worked in the gaming industry. And he has

2631
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:26,320
genuinely interesting anecdotes to tell about like workplace conversations he had with like

2632
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:32,640
Sony executives and like things that like, you know, people you've heard of like Suda,

2633
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:41,120
like told him in person, supposedly, he, you know, has a lot of insight into the gaming industry.

2634
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:48,480
He has a lot of opinions and he's met people you've heard of like American Johnson.

2635
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:57,200
And he ties a lot of his talk about the game into like stuff about his childhood and like

2636
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:04,480
growing up and like how his school, his, you know, how like one of his older classmates was

2637
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:13,040
Subway Jared. I think his older brother was like friends with Subway Jared for a little while.

2638
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:19,280
Uh, somebody burned down his high school gymnasium when he was like a high schooler. And that's a

2639
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:23,760
whole thing. And he ties that the news hysteria around that he taught uses that to segue into

2640
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:31,520
talking about like the news reporting on video game violence. So you know, he gives a lot of he

2641
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:36,160
gives a lot of very, he gives a lot of very insightful analysis of the game and insight

2642
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:40,720
into the industry and the people in it and the culture around it. And you know, that's all great.

2643
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:46,080
Okay. And then the Tokimaki, the Tokimaki Memorial one and the Boku no Natsuyasumi one

2644
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:50,880
are very much where he sort of take talks about the game in a way that he sort of opines about

2645
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:57,440
like his childhood, his, his, his experience growing up, his experience with like, you know,

2646
02:25:57,440 --> 02:26:04,880
anime and gaming and culture and all that stuff and gets really emotional at times. And like, you

2647
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:13,360
know, I, I enjoy it. I enjoyed those videos. They're good. And I just said that like, and I

2648
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:16,800
just said that one, I just like the, I just like the first, I just like the first time he did it

2649
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:23,280
better, you know, I got the sense that because the Tokimaki Memorial one was the one that got big,

2650
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:27,040
and it was, that's the one that I found first. And it's the one that got the most views. And

2651
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:33,920
it's the one that kind of blew up the channel a bit. I feel like, I feel like he tried to do it

2652
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:42,080
again. He once again, he took a, like a social simulator game and he waxes very, waxes philosophical

2653
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:47,200
about it. He gets nostalgic for his childhood. He goes on a whole, he goes on, goes to visit his

2654
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:51,600
old school and he talks about like teachers he knew when he was a kid and stuff. And you know,

2655
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:58,320
that's fine. I just kind of feel like he did it, he already did it a little bit.

2656
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:03,680
Okay. That's my, that's my, that's my action button rant.

2657
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:12,640
Action butt on. Yeah, more like action butt is how I would summarize my opinion.

2658
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:18,960
Yeah, he seems all right, I guess. He's fine. He's fine. I don't, I don't, I don't begrudge him.

2659
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:25,280
I don't begrudge him any of this. I get it. It just sort of, I guess I'm like averse to

2660
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:32,160
parasocial, like, like getting to know a person. I know it's not unique to him, but like that seems

2661
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:38,720
to be when, when people talk about him, that seems to be a lot of the appeal is that he talks

2662
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:43,600
about himself and he's interesting. And I'm like, I don't want another parasocial person. I don't

2663
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:48,000
want, I don't want that. I don't want to care about another like e-famous person anymore.

2664
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:54,640
I get that. I get that. He is interesting, but also I, he does lean into the,

2665
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:01,280
it's kind of every YouTuber, to a certain extent every, the point of every YouTuber is to talk

2666
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:06,160
about, is actually to talk about myself. I'm here ostensibly to discuss a topic, but really the

2667
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:10,960
point is that I want to talk about myself and make you love me. And Tim is very much that.

2668
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:19,600
It's not like Tim is like egregious. It's just, it's just that I don't go in wanting

2669
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:25,600
like to know people. I care about videos and if they're good, I'll eventually get to know them

2670
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:35,680
anyway. I understand. I feel you. I feel you. I mean, I do think they're good videos. At the end,

2671
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:38,160
at the end of the day, I have to concede they're entertaining.

2672
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:41,360
What's your, what do you think is his best video? I'll watch that.

2673
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:48,160
I would probably say, I guess I would probably say the Tokimeki Memorial one.

2674
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:52,080
Okay. I mean, the Boku no Natsuyasumi one is good.

2675
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:54,880
You've got to watch the Boku no Pika one.

2676
02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:04,080
I mean, I mean, the other ones, those two are more about, are even more about him than the others.

2677
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:10,720
I mean, he talks about himself in every video, like that's a given. Those ones are like especially

2678
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:16,080
like that in the ones like about Pac-Man, the Pac-Man one and the Doom one, I would say like

2679
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:22,640
focus more on the game, the culture around the game and stuff. Yes, it's not like I dislike

2680
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:29,040
YouTube's talking about themselves. I don't know. I feel like that's kind of why I stopped watching

2681
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:32,800
ContraPoints and why I stopped watching Philosophy Tube is because I felt like

2682
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:38,880
it felt a little, it made me a little sick that like, these channels have kind of become about

2683
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:42,560
the person that's making them. A little bit. Not really about philosophy.

2684
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:50,960
I mean, Philosophy Tube had recently a good video about the NHS and how fucked it is with

2685
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:57,680
regards to treating trans women or trans people in general, which was very relevant to me. So,

2686
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:04,560
that was a good one. Sure. Yeah, very personal. ContraPoints hasn't made a video in a while.

2687
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:11,040
No, but her last one. What did she do? I didn't remember. The last one was the one about

2688
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:18,000
Void, the drug, the stuff that you drip into the water. Yeah. And like it was fine. I didn't hate it,

2689
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:22,240
but I was like, this is just a video about how you're struggling with addiction and like,

2690
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:26,240
best of luck. It's a short film. Best of luck with that, but...

2691
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:35,360
It was a nice short film about herself, and that's okay. I guess I'm just not interested in those.

2692
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:45,840
Okay. Yeah, I think we're on the same page. Right. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I have this.

2693
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:51,200
This is something that I feel about many content creators on the web.

2694
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:57,280
I guess it's sort of a thing that I feel about celebrity in general,

2695
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:03,760
is that it's evil. Is that it's evil and bad, and anyone who engages in it in any way should be

2696
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:12,800
cast into the lake of fire. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, if the videos are

2697
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:18,880
good, if the reason they're known, like the stuff they make is good, regardless of like

2698
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:22,640
parasocial stuff. I guess I don't mind. I guess I don't mind being wrapped up in it.

2699
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:30,400
Well, let me... If it works for me. Let me... What did he do? He did the Cyberpunk 2027 one. That one's

2700
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:40,240
like... That one's really big. It's... That one's like... That one's too big. That one's too big.
