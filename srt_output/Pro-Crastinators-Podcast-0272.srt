00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, welcome to another PCP episode. We took a bi-week last week because of all the fuckery with that laser-bought episode getting up, but we're back. It's been two weeks since we recorded. We are ripped, fucked, to go energize. I'm Ben Saint. Gibbontake is here.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And we have the kids from the down the block. We've got some dudes from the Shreddit podcast. Hello. Well, introduce yourselves.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello. I am Reborn Pyro. I am the guy that grabs Ben's reddit post every time he comes on to torture him with.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He grabs my reddit post. Yeah. The one you read on the episode? Oh, sure. Sure. Yeah. Because your podcast is about real. I thought you meant, okay, yeah, no, I got it. Somebody else. Go.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All right. I'm Kai. I'm a kiddie man. Nice. But not really. Deb. Deb. Don't forget that you're basically our audio engineer. That too. Don't tell them that I'm the brains. I'm simply here. I don't do anything.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, gotcha. Who else? Hi, I'm Lumia. I'm the VTuber rep, representative of the group, and they torture me every day with a BDL post. Help me.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No, that's, that's, that's just reborn. Deb. You supported Kai. Fuck you. You're not wrong. Okay, we got one more. Go, go, go. Hello. My name is Aspley. I do the thumbnails and shit talk a lot. Yeah. Yeah.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah. Okay. So the story. Yeah. Go on. Shreddit. You guys are from a podcast called Shreddit. I haven't actually watched an episode yet. Sorry. I'm very sorry.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're fine.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What the fuck is the show about?

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The story with Shreddit, from my perspective, is that Reborn just, I'm eating Brussels sprouts with bacon and eggs, by the way, for the viewers at home. That's, so, you know, you're just going to have to deal with it.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Reborn basically got in the PZP Minecraft server where we do Pixelmon and challenged me to a Pokemon battle. And for winning, he shanghied me into being on the Shreddit podcast. And that's why that happened. And then I did it again one other time.

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Lumia.

15
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Link in the description to their podcast, I guess.

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hell yeah.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If you're interested.

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And shout out to the Chad PCP Minecraft server and the Chad Marin who runs it. He's amazing.

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Patreon, get in the server and have some fun.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I would agree. I would agree with all of that.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But so to answer your question, Gib, so what we do is every week we take on a new subreddit and we have a wacky cast of diverse guests. Every episode has a new guest.

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And every week is a new subreddit. And we all grab posts from that subreddit. What we all personally think to be the stupidest post on the sub. And then we make fun of them and editorialize the posts as the episodes go on.

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Others of us may or may not spend exactly 10 minutes before we start recording to locate posts and or delay it by a few 10, 20, 30 minutes looking for posts. But that, you know, that's neither here nor there.

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I imagine you could see you could spend hours trawling through shitty subreddits looking for posts from weirdos.

27
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We have.

28
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There's no end.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There's no end.

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We do a little trawling.

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There's no end to the amount of time you could spend just like digging up weird shit on there if you wanted to.

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And sometimes there's so much just good posts that you could make fun of and it's hard to pick between the ones you want. So you spend time.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Quote unquote.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, which is the worst.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I haven't been on Reddit in a donkey's age.

38
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
A donkey?

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I haven't been on there in an age of time.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a certain amount of time I haven't been on there.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're lucky.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're very lucky.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't go.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's not any better than what it was.

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've exclusively used it for Shreddit.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'd never use Reddit.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's just for looking for terrible posts.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's my experience with this.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I used to look for like local events on Reddit.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I found one or two back in the day, but I haven't done that in a while.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
At my experience with Reddit, I'm like, hi, I never used it before Shreddit, but I knew it had a really bad reputation.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's funny.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Since starting Shreddit, we've actually had a few moderately famous micro-internet celebrities reach out to us,

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and there's a huge consensus of almost all of them universally just hate Reddit.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It seems like most people hate Reddit, which is good for us.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's great when you join somebody that's kind of famous and you join their Discord and you start shilling your show,

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and then they go, oh, shit, you guys make fun of Reddit based.

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let me on.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Dude, me too.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is there anyone that actually likes Reddit?

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There must be.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
People still post in there.

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
True, but I've never met anyone that likes Reddit.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Every social, not every website or every community has their own kind of bad reputation.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I use Twitter.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Twitter is the only one I use, but I don't like it, and everyone knows that it's bad for various reasons.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, because there's people on there.

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, yeah, for starters.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Although, I guess maybe the people that use Facebook don't mind Facebook because they're all boomers and they don't know any better.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So maybe that's different.

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Everyone who does mind Facebook left Facebook a while ago.

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, true, but the alternatives are just not that good.

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you're willing to leave Facebook, you're probably not going to be happy anywhere.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're going to be more of a nomad.

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I've used Reddit a little bit in the past, like branching off from browsing like,

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I can has cheeseburger.com looking at cat memes.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's a meme place.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You go to Reddit for other memes, but I never really got into the habit of using it recreationally.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I only went back to like, shill my channel, and then I learned that shilling is bad, so I just never used it.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The rule system about that is very weird, like you yourself are not allowed to shill anything,

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but if you create an alt account and then just go, hey, check out this show, it's okay and encouraged.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I mean, I've done that.

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, I mean, different subreddits have different rules or whatever about it, different rules of enforcement.

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I've, sometimes, I've gone on Reddit to like, oh, I spammed the Jennifer Diane writes lecture, like, all over like 20 different subreddits when it came out.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I mean, I don't know if it like got much attention anywhere.

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
When you don't even check, you're like, just in case.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, I mean, what does it matter?

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Like, if it gets views, if it doesn't get views, it's not like checking on my posts.

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I completely agree.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's not like you care about your reputation on said subreddit.

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No, not at all.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's about getting eyes to YouTube, where I make, where I make my, my, my pittance in ad revenue.

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Always sell, always sell merch.

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't sell ads.

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I like selling ads.

99
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't have to think about it.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You could sell ads if, if you're like doing a contract with the actual company, because then you can get like decent cash payments and you can like keep most the margin.

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you, if you're willing to do the, do the legwork, but like selling merch is hard.

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You have to actually sell it.

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You have to actually convince someone to buy it.

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I mean, I'm, I'm speaking from a position of privilege as someone who actually has like a couple of videos that get regular traffic, the lecture videos.

105
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So like from my perspective, I love that ads run on there because it's, it's just like, it's just like a little, a little bit of money.

106
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Just kind of, just kind of passively trickling into my, into my hands.

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's what we call passive income.

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's what we call passive income.

109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's, it's great.

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not that much, but I'm like, oh, this is, it's kind of the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.

111
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You know what?

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll just say it.

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No cap.

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No, no, no word of a lie.

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's the best thing that's happened.

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's the game.

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You just got to keep doing that until you have enough money that you go, you ain't got to do shit.

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You just leave those videos up and you're good.

119
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's why, that's why it's been such a huge mistake that I have made and continue to make to not post the Sanchu lecture volume too.

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But at this point, I'm in for a penny in for a pound and I've made up my mind that I won't post until the game is done.

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So I just have to live with the consequence of that.

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You got to do the big brain move and just cut it up into like 20 minute chunks and then have a bunch of different videos, all of which getting ad-rev.

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
No, that's not how it works anymore.

124
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now the algorithm is about watch time.

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, it's technically about a watch session.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So if you go from one video to another to another to another and you continue to watch it, all of that entire duration is applied to that first video and the rest of them.

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, but like splitting the video up with-

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I feel, yeah, like people's patients would like, I got to click on another one.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You piece of shit.

130
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm bored.

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The YouTube meta.

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Allow them to passively continue to watch the one video.

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The YouTube meta used to be 10 minute chunks to maximize views and that was when-

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And I remember that because that's when we were doing a fucking on T-Bap, me and Nate did Equestria Bound and we did like 200 fucking episodes of that game.

135
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And yeah, it broke it up into like 10, 15 minute segments.

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
How much money did you get from that?

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Like nothing.

138
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Was that like a super profitable-

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No.

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No, of course not.

142
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I remember the views were like a few, like maybe a few thousand.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No.

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
On Equestria Bound?

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Wait, actually-

147
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, T-Bap was pretty big in the pony sphere.

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I mean, for a pony channel, it was modestly-

149
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I wouldn't even call it large.

150
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I would say it was medium.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He had a few videos with hundreds of thousands.

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Did we?

153
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, but that was gonna-

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I would have CPMs of like a dollar though, right?

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Jeez.

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
T-Bap plays Equestria Bound.

157
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let me see how many views-

158
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The trailer for T-Bap plays Equestria Bound got 2,000 views.

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The first episode of T-Bap plays Equestria Bound got 3,000.

160
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And I have to imagine-

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay, so that's actually more than I thought.

162
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
T-Bap plays never even hit 2,000 subscribers.

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So, oh man, I wonder what the drop-off was.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I wonder what the drop-off was, hundreds of episodes later.

165
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Is there a playlist here?

166
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Ten viewers.

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Two viewers.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I would be shocked.

169
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
T-Bap, okay, I'm gonna go.

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm gonna find the numbers.

171
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I have to know.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I remember watching the entirety of your-

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Let's play of the-

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It was like a Game Boy game, Pony-

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Legacy of the Pony.

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's so good.

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That was fun.

179
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Honestly?

180
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But I got so bored of the other ones.

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah, I can see that.

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Like, I mean, Legacy of the Pony.

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Like, to this day, I think about it and I'm like,

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
damn, there were some really great like little fucking personal project

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
like game mods Pony theme.

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like the Pony dev scene.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I mean, it wasn't anything like professional,

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
but like for a little-

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Fuck.

190
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Like for a little fucking-

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, thank you.

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Take a game and mod it to make it a Pony thing

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and put it out into the world that people can play.

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It was amazing.

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The quality was insane and there was so much of it.

196
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Ponyvania, Equestria Bound, Mega Pony,

197
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Legacy of the Pony, Genius.

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Legacy of the Pony only had 12 episodes.

199
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay, okay.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
By episode 100, less than 200 people,

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
less than 200 views per episode on Equestria Bound.

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh, no.

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The drop-off was immense.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah.

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I didn't realize there was that much Pony content.

206
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Say what now?

207
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I missed that.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What'd you say?

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I just said I didn't realize that there wasn't-

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that there wasn't or was so much Pony content out there.

211
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What do you mean?

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
My first-

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, you must be new around here.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That was my first contact.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I've said this before.

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
My first contact with MLP fandom was on Newgrounds.

217
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Someone made the game called Story of the Blanks, I think.

218
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it's about-

219
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Was that the scary one?

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, the kind of scary one about Apple Bloom in the forest.

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The forbidden forest?

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
She gets fucking murdered.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That was too hard.

224
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I couldn't beat that.

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I did beat it.

226
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What's the forest called?

227
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The evil forest near Ponyville?

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I think that's-

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Everfree Forest?

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

231
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I think it was the Everfree Forest, yeah.

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That was it.

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Pony games, man.

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And you know what?

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And I'm making another one.

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Phantom's Revenge will be the last and greatest Pony game ever made.

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Fun fact, Aspoi is new here.

238
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't think he heard of the PCP before us.

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No.

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Lucky him.

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He's from the chains that bind him.

242
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Another fun fact.

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This shredded actually started in a PCP server.

244
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I mean, I had a feeling.

245
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like Lumia, I've seen you in servers around.

246
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I've seen you in servers around.

247
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Like Lumia, I've seen you in servers around.

248
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
In particular.

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, I'm in a lot of several PCB servers.

250
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm very active in Minecraft.

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I kind of got the-

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Or was.

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Poddy casking represent, yeah.

254
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Poddy casking.

255
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I recognize Reborn from the poddy casks server.

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, I mean, since since since you got me on shredded by challenging me to a

258
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Pokemon battle in the PCP Minecraft server.

259
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, that makes that makes sense.

260
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're not the only podcast to start out of out of a discord server out of a PCP

261
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
discord server.

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So how does it feel to not be unique?

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Hold on.

264
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Are we the first one that started in a PCP discord server and actually got on the

265
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
PCP?

266
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No, I think that the pro and on get on here.

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I guess they kind of-

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, well, Eleazar, I don't know if Eleazar really counts.

269
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He was kind of friends with them and he became our editor.

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So does it count?

271
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Does it count in the like, oops, all guests episode?

272
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How many people are in there?

273
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I feel like there was a whole like a bunch of pro.

274
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah, some some of the yeah, some of the pro and on people were in there.

275
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There was also the crow masticators.

276
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Everyone forgets about the crow masticators.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I think even they forgot about themselves.

278
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There's so much stupid lore.

279
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, there's the teen CP.

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I've been I've been seeing spiral spirals been going through his his rewatch of the

281
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
show and taking extensive notes.

282
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And yeah, one of the things that came up was like, oh, yeah, anyone remember the

283
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
pro mask?

284
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The pro crow crow masticators.

285
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't remember them.

286
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't even know what that is.

287
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And I'm scared.

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't worry about it.

289
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't know either.

290
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The name is the only people or people that eat crows.

291
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm not really sure.

292
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Well, it's based.

293
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean, they were supposed to be like our rivals or our enemies or something.

294
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think it started off as a joke on on our show.

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah, like all the rivals of the PCP, the crow masticators, like stupidest name we

296
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
could come up with and people like, yeah, let's roll with that.

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Nice.

298
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Do that.

299
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
This is going to be big.

300
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah.

301
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, I don't know whether they made anything actually, but I know people said they were.

302
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think.

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
YouTube has the answers.

304
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We can find out.

305
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Chrome masticate tours.

306
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I feel like you might be getting something you might not want.

307
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No, because it's kind of similar to crow masturbators.

308
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And I don't know.

309
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There was a channel called the crow masticators to choose her.

310
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I think there's one video.

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's nothing wrong with chewing.

312
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
There's a there's a there was a crow masticators fan meetup.

313
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I mean, the timing is right.

314
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes.

315
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes.

316
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This.

317
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is it's real.

318
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Okay.

319
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The chrome the first it's really wasn't a fever dream.

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Look at this.

321
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
No, I'll prove it.

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'll prove it.

323
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Look right right there.

324
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
They made their own version of the logo and everything.

325
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They had a look.

326
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
They had a fucking fan meetup.

327
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Man, they spent a whole minute to like export it and everything.

328
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh, my God.

329
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The audio quality is terrible.

330
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They did interviews.

331
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is a whole fucking thing.

332
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This is a whole fucking thing that you could argue the sketchy people podcast is a PCP off

333
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
shoot because they were all fans of the PCP and met through that.

334
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

335
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Now they've got like a like all thing going on.

336
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
They I think, yeah, they did all meet because they were PCP listeners.

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I think so.

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, that probably counts.

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I mean, I guess arm retrieval counts in a way.

340
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't know.

341
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Actually, no, no, that's a much larger project.

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah, I wouldn't say that counts.

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Looks like I did not know my history.

344
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I mean, there's a lot of it.

345
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, Spiral is the lower master now.

346
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He remembers it so we don't have to.

347
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I think he's compiling it.

348
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He's compiling a images like screenshots of all our quotes.

349
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think he's going to make a big like Imgur album with like a chronological list of like all the all the stupidest things we ever said.

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't.

351
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't know.

352
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't know if it's going to beat the.

353
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The potty.

354
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The potty is cord one.

355
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That one's so good.

356
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah.

357
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's the best Imgur album I've ever seen.

358
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What's in it?

359
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So on the podium scored.

360
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
There is a guy named Greg.

361
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's just his discord name.

362
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And every time someone said something stupid in the discord, he screenshots it and uploads it to the Imgur album.

363
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He's been doing this for two years.

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I never knew about that.

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's good.

366
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Am I in there?

367
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I do not think so.

368
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Hold on.

369
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No, you would never say anything stupid.

370
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No, I've said stupid things.

371
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I swear.

372
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No, I don't believe it.

373
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't believe it.

374
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, here.

375
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Here.

376
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll share it.

377
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I have a bookmarked.

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay.

379
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I love this thing so much.

380
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There you go.

381
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Enjoy.

382
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll have a little look.

383
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Because you'll probably know some of these people.

384
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Reborn's in it.

385
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He's on the second one.

386
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Man, pug.

387
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Anyway, enough about the PCP.

388
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Enough about the PCP.

389
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I've had enough.

390
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Enough with the procrastinators already.

391
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Who even are these losers?

392
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm like 364 more images.

393
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay, well, I'll look over that in my own time.

394
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah, it's a thing to do when you got time.

395
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Would this be a good time to give our deep lore origin story?

396
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Please.

397
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Okay.

398
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So about a year and a half ago, a guy named Soyboy Theories.

399
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You might recognize the name.

400
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, you're going way back.

401
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Soyboy wanted to play D&D with me.

402
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So I joined his campaign.

403
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Just don't make this a mere logic hour long story.

404
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
No, no, no.

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is quick.

406
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This is quick.

407
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm just setting it up.

408
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Hey, if you're logic, if you're listening, fuck you.

409
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He's actually mad that I'm on.

410
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, wait, no.

411
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I forgot, but you're the guy who introduced me.

412
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes, he's mad that I'm on this show right now.

413
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I forgot about that, but you're the one that got him to come on in the first place.

414
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That guy sucks.

415
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Did I explain how YouTube works to him and he called me a Jew?

416
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Because you explained how YouTube worked?

417
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, just how the algorithm worked.

418
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
He just said I was Susan Schill or something like that and then stopped talking to me.

419
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Fascinating.

420
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's exactly very classic mere logic move.

421
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
All right.

422
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So Soyboy and AfiSama, another big YouTuber.

423
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I was playing D&D with them and it was the first time I ever played D&D,

424
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
so I made an ass about out of myself.

425
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And one of the other players named Sean Breezy made a Reddit post making fun of me.

426
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He made five.

427
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
A few months later, a big YouTuber, CrickCrab, picked up the story and started making videos.

428
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So I joined VC in the podium squad and I have everybody else join and we start making fun of CrickCrab in the Reddit post.

429
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Kai randomly joins.

430
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This is the first day I met Kai and we spend about an hour making fun of the post again,

431
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
except this time with Kai and we were like, let's make a podcast out of this.

432
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah.

433
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I mean, what else are you going to do?

434
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What else are you going to do with that?

435
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Nothing.

436
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Meanwhile, I passively actually know how like audio engineering and stuff.

437
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So I'm like, yeah, we could do that.

438
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Amazing.

439
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Amazing.

440
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And look how far we've come.

441
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yes.

442
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What's that about?

443
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We're sure doing this.

444
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Sure am reading Reddit every week.

445
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Damn, you're on the procrastinators.

446
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This is like that episode of The Simpsons when Lisa's thinking about what school she wants to go.

447
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
When I went to the procrastinators podcast.

448
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This is just like when Homer Simpson was a guest on the procrastinators podcast.

449
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
This is just like when Lisa's thinking about what school she wants to go to.

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And she wants to go to Harvard and someone suggests Brown and she's like Brown and then Otto.

451
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's like, hey, hey, don't worry, don't sweat it, kid, kiddo.

452
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I went to Brown and look at me.

453
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Now I drive the bus.

454
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And it's like, that's you right now.

455
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's like, now you drive the bus.

456
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You're on the PCB.

457
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Hell yeah.

458
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You've moved up.

459
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Life goes on.

460
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Wait, does Otto do that twice?

461
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Because I thought that moment was like Bart gets an F where he's like, oh, I'm going to have to repeat the fourth grade.

462
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And it's like, Otto's like, I repeated the fourth grade myself twice.

463
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Now I drive the school bus.

464
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You're right.

465
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I was mixing up the episode.

466
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't know.

467
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The Simpsons retcons a lot of things.

468
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I remember.

469
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Now that you say it, I'm sure that you're right.

470
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's the Bart gets an F episode.

471
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That isn't a fire episode.

472
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That's the episode where there's that sweet moment between him and Mrs. Krabapal when she lets him pass because he just barely failed.

473
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But she gives him the one extra point he needs because he really proved that he was willing to put the work in or whatever.

474
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's a good episode.

475
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I don't even want to fucking pray through it.

476
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Camp crusty or whatever.

477
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You know what's really weird about the PCP?

478
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
All kinds of things.

479
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We have a strange overlap of fans.

480
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Like even people that randomly find us, I have talked to them and they've mentioned, oh yeah, I was a fan of the PCP and I saw you guys and recommended.

481
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I mean, I knew we started in a PCP server, right?

482
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So there was going to be a little bit of overlap.

483
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
There's that.

484
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
There's that.

485
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And I mean, there's also the fact that I was on, I was a guest.

486
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So maybe if they found you.

487
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, that's true.

488
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So that doesn't really surprise me very much.

489
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
YouTube will recommend your videos based on the viewing habits of the people who currently watch you.

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So that makes sense.

491
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And if like actually like 100 or 200 or so all have that in common, it'll just start showing up in everyone's recommended feed.

492
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah.

493
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yes.

494
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yes.

495
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It just makes sense.

496
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It is Mother Brain AI Bolshittery.

497
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Fascinating.

498
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
See, this is why Kai is the big brain of our group.

499
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You know, he just knows these things.

500
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Ben, I owe you an apology from like a year ago.

501
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I agree.

502
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah.

503
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Do you remember when the PCP Danielson was coming out and then a week before the demo came out, a shitty fan made game came out that didn't work?

504
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
A shitty fan made game?

505
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Well, it worked.

506
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But it was like really shuttly put together deliberately.

507
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh, it was like a parody of the dating sim.

508
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah.

509
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, that's my fault.

510
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's your fault that I didn't work on that.

511
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I was the programmer behind that.

512
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Damn.

513
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I like forgot.

514
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I like forgot that that happened.

515
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I do remember now that you mentioned it.

516
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Because there was like a school shooting ending with Mumkey.

517
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah.

518
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
No need bro.

519
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Oh, fun fact.

520
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:20,000
No need bro makes us send all of our audio files to the email address they made for the spoof of the PCP Damage Sim.

521
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah, you're like, all right, where do I send my audio files?

522
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You're like, it's at the real PCP dating sim and fucking Gmail.

523
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I can never.

524
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Because of that.

525
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, and everyone's like, is this really where I send it?

526
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yep.

527
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That's our editor's email.

528
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Whoever controls the PCP dating sim, I think they still log in occasionally.

529
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I think they retweeted the Tales of the Laserbot interview announcement, which was pretty nice of them.

530
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm not sure who it is that runs the account, but I sure it's one of the devs.

531
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What a period in history.

532
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, speaking of like PCP stuff that exists for some reason, did I mention on the episode yet that I finished writing the Road to Radcon Chapter 5?

533
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Or was that before that I mentioned?

534
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
No.

535
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah, I want to...

536
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That was pre-episode.

537
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah, so I just want to take a minute and be like, yeah, so viewers, you've probably all forgotten this.

538
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But during the Radcon 4 Kickstarter campaign, the promise was that Trixie would write five chapters of the thing if the goals were hit.

539
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
All the goals were hit.

540
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And then if we hit another goal, we would print it and give $100 plus backers the printed version of Road to Radcon.

541
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We hit that goal.

542
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So she only wrote four.

543
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So I wrote the fifth chapter.

544
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's the longest chapter by far.

545
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's probably also the best.

546
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Honestly, I can't judge.

547
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I feel reading back through it.

548
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I read it and I'm like, hey, I kind of like what I wrote.

549
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I kind of like...

550
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I think it's funny, but I can't judge my own writing, so I have no idea if it's good.

551
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It amuses me.

552
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
That's all I can say.

553
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And then, yeah, so I guess we'll probably be making a Kickstarter announcement soon that like, hey, if you pledged $100, you know, either let us...

554
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:31,000
If you've changed your address or something, let us know your new address or otherwise we'll just be sending out those books to like everyone's same old addresses.

555
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But I'm sure a few people have probably changed address.

556
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So I don't know.

557
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We'll make an announcement.

558
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's been like seven years.

559
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's been a year and a half since Radcon 4.

560
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's been probably over a year since like the other merch went out.

561
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yeah, I've been getting...

562
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I got Michi, Michi Fossard.

563
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I got her to make the cover art and she's been sending me sketch sample.

564
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I showed you guys a little before the call and it looks so good.

565
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It is going to look so great in like pamphlet form.

566
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm not exactly sure what format it's going to be in.

567
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's going to be a little booklet or pamphlet or zine or something.

568
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It will arrive in the mail for everyone to enjoy.

569
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Maybe we can sell extra copies on Gumroad.

570
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah, I mean, if we...

571
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
For $100.

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yeah, you have to order them in bulk.

573
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
We can figure it out later.

574
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
How many what?

575
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I looked it up.

576
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I was wondering how many hundred becas there are.

577
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I counted it up before.

578
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It was 126.

579
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Okay.

580
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So probably I'll make like 150 or maybe 200 copies and there will be a few extra.

581
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Just for fun.

582
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah, I counted that out before because I was looking at local print shops and thinking like,

583
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
it might be cheaper for me to just get it printed at a local print shop if it's just a zine or something.

584
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Instead of...

585
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Because you know, the comic printing service that I use for the comics,

586
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I feel like there are probably cheaper ways to print a text only booklet

587
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
than something that is meant to print like high resolution images like a comic book.

588
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I think, I suspect.

589
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Someone must be using like a...

590
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What's the word?

591
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Like a movable printed type printing press.

592
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Who was the inventor of the printing press?

593
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I was going to...

594
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Mr. Print.

595
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
No.

596
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Inventor of...

597
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Mr. Press.

598
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yes, that's it.

599
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Technically it was the Chinese.

600
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Johannes Gutenberg.

601
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Someone must be using like have like an old Johannes Gutenberg gas movable printed type machine

602
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
that will just let me use for free.

603
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I hope.

604
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah.

605
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Anyway, I'm excited.

606
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm excited about that.

607
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The cover looks great.

608
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Me, she's a very, very good.

609
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Very good drafts person.

610
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Will you be distributing them signed by you?

611
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That sounds labor intensive.

612
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'll fucking...

613
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
God, if someone gives me some money, I'll do that.

614
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, whatever.

615
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If someone gives me money, I'll do anything.

616
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'll do anything for money.

617
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yeah.

618
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I mean, if someone wants...

619
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
If someone...

620
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That we didn't offer that as like a reward, but if someone is like Ben, I will...

621
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I will just send you $20 through PayPal.

622
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If you just signed my copy before you put it in the envelope, I'll do it.

623
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's right.

624
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Those...

625
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Those...

626
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That's my promise to you.

627
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So I hope...

628
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So since you asked, I assume that's something you'd be interested in.

629
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yes.

630
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I was not a hundred dollar backer here.

631
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'd have to buy the book itself and then pay you extra to sign it.

632
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I would pay the $20 and he sends it to you, never having sent the original hundred.

633
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh, you know what?

634
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You know what?

635
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

636
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Since I'm sure we'll have extras.

637
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah, I bet there are at least a few people who would find it amusing to have a copy of it.

638
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And yeah, I'll probably offer them on like Gumroad or something.

639
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Why not throw more into the PCP coffers, I guess.

640
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Hell yeah.

641
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You know, about Kickstarter's, I just had one.

642
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh my God.

643
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It was pretty good.

644
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It was really good.

645
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Can we talk about the...

646
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Can we talk about the ending?

647
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Can we talk about the hype as fuck ending?

648
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

649
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So for the month of the Kickstarter, I had been...

650
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I decided I was going to stream with my little VTuber punk avatar.

651
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's just like to build up hype, to build up like hype moments.

652
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Just to get people thinking about it so they can chill it constantly.

653
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The Kickstarter as it was going on.

654
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And right at the end, I was playing Hollow Knight as I had been.

655
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'd beaten the game already, and I was doing a new save file on SteelSoul,

656
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
which is like one death and your save file is deleted.

657
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And I was just...

658
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I initially did it.

659
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Jesus.

660
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah.

661
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Initially, I did it just as a little thing.

662
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Like, oh, well, I beat the game.

663
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
What else can I do?

664
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's like pretty good at video games.

665
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It has like a weird knack for like hardcore games.

666
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I mean, Hollow Knight is just so fun.

667
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's so fun to play and it's good.

668
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
True.

669
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But yeah, I...

670
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
SteelSoul Run did not expect to get to like the third boss or whatever,

671
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
but just sort of casually playing through it.

672
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The final day, I was like, okay, let's just play it.

673
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Let's see how far I can get.

674
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Turns out, near the end, there's a feasible...

675
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
There's like a...

676
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's feasible for me to actually complete the game,

677
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
because I have enough of the things I could go to the boss.

678
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It wouldn't be like 100% completion,

679
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
but I could beat the final boss to get to the credits

680
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
within the last like 20 minutes of the Kickstarter ending.

681
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
The time on screen.

682
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It was like 15 minutes away from the Kickstarter ending,

683
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and you were like, okay, I'm going to do it.

684
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And then you started like doing last minute preparations

685
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and doing your badges and whatever.

686
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah, like I needed to get one more Dreamer,

687
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and then that was it.

688
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I could just go to the final boss

689
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and try and win on a like no death run.

690
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And it was like the biggest hype moment,

691
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
because obviously a one mistake would mean that

692
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
all of the hype deflated right at the end of the Kickstarter.

693
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It would have been really upsetting.

694
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It was so tense because you did kind of fuck up a few times

695
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and it kind of looked like you were going to lose.

696
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I kind of thought you were going to lose.

697
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You were on one health when you beat him.

698
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I thought you were going to lose.

699
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I was on one health.

700
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I made a clip of it.

701
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's the coolest thing ever.

702
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's really good.

703
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah.

704
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Like when you beat him,

705
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I see like the explosion animations

706
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and I'm like, I don't...

707
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm not sure if like,

708
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
whether that means it's over

709
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
or if there's like another phase or something.

710
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So he starts blowing up and I'm like,

711
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Pog?

712
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Is it Pog time?

713
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
God yeah.

714
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh yeah.

715
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You beat him with like,

716
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I think there was literally like two minutes left

717
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
or something.

718
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It was four minutes and 20 seconds

719
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
when the credits were rolling

720
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and that was funny.

721
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Blaze it.

722
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And then the Kickstarter.

723
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

724
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The Kickstarter was like,

725
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
it was doing really well the whole time

726
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
in that last day

727
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and it was just sort of like,

728
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
everything that could go correctly did.

729
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Including the fact that we did not hit

730
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
the 666 amount of pounds on the Kickstarter

731
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
which would have summoned the devil

732
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
which would probably be a bad thing.

733
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Narrowly avoided the summoning the devil.

734
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Thank God.

735
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It would have been an absolute travesty.

736
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It was a lot of explaining to do.

737
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It was like only like 50 pounds away or something.

738
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It was pretty close but no devil.

739
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
We can all breathe a sigh of relief.

740
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Delicious.

741
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah.

742
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So I had a good month

743
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
doing playing that game

744
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
for the first time by the way,

745
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
the first playthrough

746
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and then the second playthrough

747
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
was the Steel Soul Run.

748
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It was just unbelievable.

749
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And then the Kickstarter hit all the stretch goals

750
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and even some joke ones

751
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
that I had to come up with.

752
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's great.

753
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And now I have to do a lot of stuff.

754
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Did you already show me the graph,

755
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the final graph?

756
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Or I think you might have showed it to me

757
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
like the day before.

758
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Do you have the final money graph?

759
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah, let me have a look.

760
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I love the money graphs.

761
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
A Patreon shows you a little graph

762
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
of how your total pledges progress over time

763
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and it's always like,

764
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
it shoots up at the beginning

765
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and then it kind of like levels off

766
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and then towards the end it like,

767
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
up at the, as FOMO kicks in

768
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and everyone's like,

769
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
oh, I guess it's now or never.

770
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I got a pledge.

771
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah, it was like,

772
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I was so worried before the Kickstarter

773
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
because I'd had a Kickstarter fail.

774
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Look at that.

775
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Hell yeah.

776
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
D.

777
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Initially,

778
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I did one stream.

779
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Goal was hit within two hours

780
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
of me making it live

781
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and it happened on stream.

782
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
That was fun.

783
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And then, you know, it slowed down

784
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
as people who were already,

785
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
you know,

786
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
people who really wanted it got it immediately

787
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and then slowly,

788
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
but surely it creeped up

789
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and then I announced the plush,

790
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
the Lord of Ghost plush tier

791
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
would be possible

792
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
if we got like a few backers.

793
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And I did all the calculations

794
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
for the costs of the delivery,

795
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
which is really, really expensive

796
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and it's annoying,

797
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
but it's how it works with packages

798
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
overseas, I guess.

799
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But then that's the spike

800
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
that happens around the 11th,

801
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
12th of July,

802
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
is when I opened that up

803
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and then each big pledge,

804
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
all of the big fans

805
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
got the plush

806
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and it's like 25, 31 plushes I need to get.

807
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
All the plujers.

808
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
All the plujers.

809
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The fucking plujers.

810
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Wait, I'll post it in the chat.

811
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The one to 99 year old

812
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
blue chair.

813
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That was oblivion.

814
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Oblivionfall made the joke in the chat.

815
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
He said,

816
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm gonna pluge and I just,

817
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I just thought that was the funniest thing I'd ever heard.

818
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So I had to go and make this immediately.

819
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
With only like an hour left,

820
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
but it was worth it.

821
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
He's based.

822
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I've already ordered the pins from China.

823
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So those are flying in.

824
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Did you use the company that I recommended?

825
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't think so.

826
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I just shopped around

827
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and found like one that was good

828
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and on Alibaba.

829
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yeah.

830
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And I just got to, you know,

831
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
get a hundred and fifty or a hundred.

832
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I can't remember how many pins, but enough.

833
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Shit is so damn cheap on Alibaba.

834
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Holy fuck.

835
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah, that's good.

836
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That's because they get you with shipping.

837
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Like have the prices.

838
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Try to ship things.

839
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
A little bit.

840
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah.

841
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
A little bit, but like pins are so light.

842
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
They could, and you know, bulk order.

843
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That's the cheap that the shipping is all in the in the costs.

844
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It's like getting pins, getting pins made.

845
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Okay.

846
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, the shipping is a bit of a bitch,

847
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
but like getting pins made in the UK

848
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
from the company that I had make the Puba pins.

849
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It was like the cost was like three dollars,

850
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
like two or three dollars a pin.

851
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Getting them made in China

852
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
through Alibaba, they were like 40 cents a pin.

853
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And like, yeah, they did charge me a little for like having,

854
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
they made the mold and they charged me like a mold making fee.

855
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But when you're, I was ordering the hundreds of them,

856
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
so it was still like by far, it was by far cheaper.

857
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I probably saved like a thousand dollars or more

858
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
just by ordering from there.

859
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
All the benefits of not having a minimum wage,

860
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
but none of the actual consequences

861
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
because I don't live there.

862
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
They have, they must, they have, they must.

863
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
They must have a minimum wage.

864
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That's anti-China.

865
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah, we have a minimum wage.

866
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Do you mean in the UK?

867
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Of course we do.

868
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
No, he's talking about China.

869
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Yeah, China is like absurdly like open market.

870
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And it's a little, it's an issue.

871
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I haven't looked it up, but they must have something.

872
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
There must be some kind of bottom floor.

873
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
They are remarkably capitalistic

874
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
for as like imperialistic as they are.

875
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It is, it is, it is a weird mismatch.

876
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't know, I don't know why you say those are,

877
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
are those a contradiction?

878
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I thought you were gonna say they were weirdly capitalist

879
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
for how they call themselves communists.

880
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That too.

881
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Yeah.

882
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That's what I thought you were going with that.

883
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's about what I was going with.

884
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I mean, we're imperialists.

885
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We love that shit.

886
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
We love, we love empire building.

887
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah, not wrong.

888
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
United States empire.

889
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Do I love Age of Empires?

890
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah, we love our forex.

891
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's good.

892
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Actually, I suppose imperialism specifically,

893
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
it does tend to be a, yeah, you know what,

894
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
a recanted, recanted.

895
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Okay.

896
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Okay.

897
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We've all learned something.

898
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I've got also the red man comic.

899
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
The zine.

900
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But in putting the, putting yes, the zine for those,

901
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
for the, because that was one of the stretch goals is a,

902
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
along with the Lord of Ghost comic,

903
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
every physical tier will get a red man comic free of charge.

904
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
No need to increase your pledge.

905
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And those are looking pretty good.

906
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
They're so stupid.

907
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I put a few like authors commentary under a few of them.

908
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And it's funny because they were just put on Twitter.

909
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It's half of them are like jokes I came up with half of them are

910
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
just like things I was thinking in the form of like the same

911
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
format as a joke.

912
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So it's like, is this a, I don't see the punchline.

913
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I don't get it.

914
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And that's why I find it so funny.

915
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yeah.

916
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Cause there's no punchline.

917
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Red man's like kind of a terrible standup comedian.

918
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Nobody knows what he's doing.

919
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Neither does he.

920
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Did you, did you say that you were going to make like the cover

921
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
and the back cover are just like also going to be red man comics,

922
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
but they're going to be.

923
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah.

924
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Every, every part of, every part of the comic, the,

925
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
yeah, the zine is going to be a red man comic.

926
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So the cover is just going to be like a red man comic with red

927
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
man saying, oh my God, it's the red man comic.

928
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You're reading the front.

929
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Hey, hi.

930
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You know, some, some stupid thing.

931
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah.

932
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I said before that like, I love the red man comics, but

933
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
they're all buried on Twitter.

934
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
To read them, I would have to like scroll back through posts

935
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
and posts and posts and find them.

936
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And I'll never do that.

937
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So the only way I'll ever see them again is if,

938
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
is if I get the, the zine and now I'm getting the zine.

939
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So, you know, it's a happy ending.

940
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah.

941
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It's a lot of work coming up.

942
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I've, I've got, I've got to, to like put together the red man.

943
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I've put all of the pages that already exist.

944
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And I'm thinking I should, I should write some new ones and

945
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
like add some like value to people.

946
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Like if they want to see exclusive red man comics,

947
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I can't think of anything.

948
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That's how I felt.

949
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I felt with vapors, the vaporettes.

950
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I was like, uh, I guess I got to write like something to happen.

951
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Uh, okay.

952
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I felt that way as well for the Lord of Ghost stories,

953
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
that the ghost stories that are in the Lord of Ghost comic.

954
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
God, I haven't started working on mine, but I came up with like,

955
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
moving soon and then I will work.

956
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I will work.

957
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I promise.

958
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah.

959
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Don't worry about it.

960
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'll have to, I'll, I'll kick people in the behind and

961
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
about that in a little while.

962
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But for the moment I need to, I need, I have my own things to do.

963
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So I got to, I got to prepare.

964
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
You got to like get the packaging.

965
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
That's a whole lot of stuff.

966
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I sure hope I don't fuck it up.

967
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah man.

968
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That would be, that would sure would suck.

969
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
If you have fucked it up.

970
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah.

971
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
No, it's good.

972
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It's going to be good.

973
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's going to be good.

974
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I pledged and I've never, I'll never regret it.

975
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
What else?

976
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Did it?

977
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Okay.

978
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Here's a thing.

979
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Here's a thing that happened this week.

980
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Did anyone play the Google Doodle for the Olympics?

981
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
No.

982
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
No.

983
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The what?

984
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Oh my God.

985
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
What's that?

986
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I hope it's still go, I hope it's still like this by the time this episode airs.

987
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You know like how Google will make its logo something different?

988
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Uh-huh.

989
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Well, damn.

990
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I'm, I'm.

991
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Oh, I can see.

992
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Now I think this might blow your minds.

993
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
The Google Doodle this week, it's a whole video game.

994
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It's like a big video game that you can play.

995
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
This is Pog.

996
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah.

997
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
It's awesome.

998
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It ruled.

999
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
What the fuck?

1000
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's got an animated anime intro.

1001
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Yeah.

1002
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It's got like cutscenes and stuff.

1003
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's, it's a whole fucking like adventure game.

1004
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Apparently there was another one.

1005
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
There was like a Halloween one that they did a previous year.

1006
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Like the same, the same company or the same developer made like another Google game.

1007
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
But this is, I guess the second one.

1008
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And yeah, you're this little cat who is going to some island and like it's an Olympic thing.

1009
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So it's like you go into like become the champion and all these different sports.

1010
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You go around and you like do quests and like, you know, solve people's problems and stuff.

1011
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It rules.

1012
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It's amazing.

1013
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm just watching this intro.

1014
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
This is, this is great.

1015
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh, this is fun.

1016
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It's just a bunch of games.

1017
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Oh, okay.

1018
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I, I don't know if I 100% of it.

1019
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Like I think there might have been some events that I didn't find.

1020
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But I did do all of the like side quests, like all of like the, the story side quests where

1021
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
you got to find someone's lost key to the basement or whatever, like all that shit.

1022
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So I feel pretty good about it.

1023
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I just wanted to, I just thought I'd mention that because like someone told me, damn, who was it?

1024
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Was it someone on the stream?

1025
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
No, we didn't stream this week.

1026
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Oh no, I think it was one of our roommates.

1027
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
One of my roommates told me like, Hey, do you see the Google Doodle today?

1028
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I was like, no, it's like, you should check it out.

1029
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's pretty good.

1030
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's like, okay.

1031
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Then I went and I found it.

1032
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I was like, wow, my God.

1033
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And then I spent like three hours playing it that I should have been writing Road to Radcon.

1034
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But I got it written in the end anyway.

1035
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So it's fine.

1036
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It all, it all worked out.

1037
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah.

1038
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So now, all right, let's take a break, break from the podcast for everyone to go play that

1039
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and we'll convene in two hours.

1040
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Base, base, base.

1041
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It's called, it's called like the summer games or something.

1042
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Champion Island, Champion Island is what it's called.

1043
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And it's fucking rules.

1044
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I liked, I liked the race.

1045
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I liked the racing event the best.

1046
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Which race did you like the most?

1047
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I don't, wait, actually, the climbing one is really good too.

1048
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
The climbing one is pretty fun.

1049
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Although the second, because they have like a basic one you have to do to like call it complete.

1050
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But then there's like a secret, I think every sport has a secret second and third like harder

1051
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
version of the sport that you can find.

1052
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And I didn't, I don't think I found all of those.

1053
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:16,000
But I was like screaming at the like harder version of climbing and running.

1054
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Those ones, I think the other ones I found very easy, but those two I like had to play

1055
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
them like a dozen times each to actually beat them.

1056
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
They're fricking, they're fricking hard, bro.

1057
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm team blue, by the way.

1058
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I'm the team with the buff minotaurs living in the city area.

1059
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I thought that was cool.

1060
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I think we're way behind, there's like a leaderboard.

1061
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's like, yeah, there's like a global leaderboard and like you can join a team.

1062
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And then I think probably how well you do, like your high scores in the different sports will like contribute to your team.

1063
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Yeah, yeah, there's like a global, it's like a global, it's like slime.

1064
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Crowdies versus killers, like global slime counter.

1065
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
That's pretty pug.

1066
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Yeah.

1067
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's so pug.

1068
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Is this going to disappear?

1069
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
This game.

1070
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Probably.

1071
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Damn.

1072
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I think it will disappear, but I feel like it'll be archived somewhere.

1073
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I hope so.

1074
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
This is really cool.

1075
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I kind of want to go and find the old halloween game that they apparently made for a previous halloween.

1076
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Can we look up the game developer?

1077
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Made it.

1078
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Maybe they'd have it.

1079
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Google champion island developer.

1080
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
You know, maybe it was like an in-house, maybe it was like just an in-house Google.

1081
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Okay.

1082
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Well, the animated scenes were animated by Studio 4C.

1083
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Google champion.

1084
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
What if I tried Google champion island halloween?

1085
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Hmm.

1086
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Okay.

1087
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I guess it was Google Doodle Halloween 2020 full game.

1088
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Okay.

1089
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
This is like a video walkthrough.

1090
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I think so.

1091
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
This isn't the actual game, but this is proof that it's real.

1092
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Yeah.

1093
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Okay.

1094
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It looks, it looks different though.

1095
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
It's not like a walker out pixel spray.

1096
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Are the characters references to other media, do you know, because I was just playing it

1097
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
while we were talking about it and I got to the archery minigame and the guy looks almost

1098
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
exactly, has the same facial design as the guy from Ger and Lagann, the one with the purple

1099
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
eye shadow.

1100
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Wait, the archery guy?

1101
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah.

1102
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
He looks like Leron.

1103
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Is that the name of the guy from Ger and Lagann?

1104
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I don't remember.

1105
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
No, he doesn't.

1106
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's the eye shadow.

1107
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
What are you talking about?

1108
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It's the purple eye shadow.

1109
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
That's outrageous.

1110
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You're, you're on, off your rock.

1111
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It won't let me play.

1112
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You're cracked.

1113
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Dude, it's a deer.

1114
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That sucks to be you, Kai.

1115
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's Undertale.

1116
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I had Deltarune.

1117
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's, wait, what's that other Undertale Deltarune?

1118
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
The one where you're, you're the cat and you have to carry the light bulb around?

1119
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
One shot.

1120
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh, I haven't played that, but I have.

1121
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
One shot.

1122
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I, yeah, I played it and then I never got the like true ending.

1123
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I, I, I wanted to.

1124
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
That game was pretty good.

1125
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I played it on stream a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time ago.

1126
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Oh boy.

1127
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
All right.

1128
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I can't play a video game on a podcast.

1129
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Yeah, it's, it's, it's not like, I'm, this was a mistake.

1130
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Bring it up.

1131
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I hope, I hope and think that probably the Halloween one must be around somewhere.

1132
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Although I'll be, I'll be honest, just the fact that this like Olympics one is a like

1133
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
top down sprite graphics walk around game.

1134
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Yeah.

1135
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Just makes me like it.

1136
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Like that's, that's just my favorite kind of game.

1137
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah.

1138
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So I'm sure that this other one's not as good.

1139
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Also, I don't like Halloween that much.

1140
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh, that is fucking fair of you.

1141
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But then again, I don't like the Olympics that much either.

1142
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So whatever.

1143
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
That's a wash.

1144
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Yeah.

1145
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You lose one cool point for not liking Halloween, but you gain it back for not liking the

1146
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Olympics.

1147
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You're at a net pot.

1148
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
You're at a net neutral right now.

1149
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Okay.

1150
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Okay, I'll take it.

1151
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Oh man.

1152
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I got really into Hollow Knight during the month of streaming to the point where I wanted

1153
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,000
to try after I beat the steel soul, like I felt so cool and I was like, you know what?

1154
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I am the best.

1155
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm going to speed run as my third playthrough.

1156
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm going to do a world record attempt and it was going quite well actually because I

1157
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
had been watching a lot of like Hollow Knight YouTube.

1158
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I'd really just gotten completely into Hollow Knight in every aspect.

1159
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Wait, what is the world?

1160
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It's one of my favorite games.

1161
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Oh, any percent.

1162
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's like 45 minutes, I think.

1163
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I can't remember.

1164
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
There's lots of different world records, but you have to be quite quick and you have to

1165
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
be able to do skips, platforming tricks and skips to get past areas earlier than you should

1166
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
be and I couldn't do those things really.

1167
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,000
You have to do weird pogo attacks off of explosions but without getting hit by them so that you

1168
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
can bounce up into an area that you shouldn't be able to get to and stuff like that, but

1169
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I had watched all of these and I'm like, yeah, you know, I could fucking do that.

1170
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I beat steel soul on my second playthrough.

1171
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm the guy who did that and I tried it.

1172
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I got pretty far.

1173
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I died three times in the same place and I rage quit, deleted the save file.

1174
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It was the biggest idiot mistake of all because it was a really good run other than that small

1175
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
mistake.

1176
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Ben said I have a neck for really difficult games.

1177
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Maybe I do.

1178
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You beat Dark Souls like your first try without even trying.

1179
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I did level up a lot.

1180
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I've never steel soul Hollow Knight.

1181
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I've tried to do that and I just can't get over the time loss of each run and I'm also

1182
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
trash so I die within the first hour and then it's like trash.

1183
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,000
My first playthrough of Hollow Knight right now and I'm crying everywhere I go.

1184
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I'm shit.

1185
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Speaking of Hollow Knight, when is Steel's, what's the sequel called?

1186
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Silksong.

1187
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Silksong?

1188
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I asked this.

1189
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It's like nobody knows.

1190
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
They haven't announced a release date yet so definitely not this year and probably not

1191
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
even next year.

1192
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I feel like so with Hollow Knight there's two or three Kickstarter pledges that the devs

1193
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
really wanted to get to like two fully fleshed out areas that they were just that they didn't

1194
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
hit the goal to include and they talked about how they wanted to include it really bad.

1195
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I feel like with Silksong, since it's not a backed game, they are just trying to include

1196
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
everything.

1197
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Like every time they think they're about to get the game finished they're like, but wait,

1198
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
what if we add this area?

1199
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
They have so much money they can kind of just sit on it and work like as long as they need

1200
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
on the new game.

1201
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I mean, I can respect that.

1202
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I guess I'm somewhat lucky that I haven't been waiting this whole time for Silksong.

1203
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Having only just got into Hollow Knight now.

1204
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I could be waiting for years afterwards.

1205
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
They set up a whole thing.

1206
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
They have trailers and everything.

1207
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yeah, I've seen gameplay like little demo things.

1208
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You can't play them though.

1209
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Maybe they'll just like drop it out of nowhere one day.

1210
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
That would be Pog.

1211
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I could see them doing that.

1212
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
They seem like the kind of studio that would.

1213
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Gabe, are you going to keep streaming?

1214
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I've heard that they, you know, I kind of want to.

1215
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I guess I should.

1216
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
There's a lot of the days where I'm like, man, I got work to do, but it's not really

1217
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
that much work.

1218
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And for the Kickstarter, a lot of things I have to wait for things to be delivered or

1219
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
people to draw the ghost stories.

1220
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
There's going to be points where I'm not doing anything in particular.

1221
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So yeah, I feel like I could.

1222
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I would continue to stream Hollow Knight though.

1223
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I would be doing speed runs and just raging like extremely.

1224
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm not shy about rage quitting.

1225
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I do it all the time.

1226
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I was thinking because I'm still really excited to create the sun in Noida and

1227
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Shekels for Heckels.

1228
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I guess hopefully by the time this comes out, I will have already done so.

1229
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Hopefully.

1230
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm hoping to be able to do it on the next stream.

1231
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It might take two streams depending on how it goes.

1232
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:22,000
But I was thinking like, I don't want to just stream Noida on Shekels for Heckels.

1233
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I do want to go back to the Minecraft stuff.

1234
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But I was thinking like, why not?

1235
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I want to keep playing Noida.

1236
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
And when I looked at all the in-game achievements that there are, there's like 30 achievements

1237
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
in the game that I have never gotten.

1238
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Like I made a list of them here and like there's tons and tons of them.

1239
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So like after I make the sun, I might just go, I might just, if I'm going to play Noida,

1240
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
because I'm going to play Noida one way or another.

1241
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I might just start like streaming when I play it.

1242
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Just because why not?

1243
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And because it would be fun.

1244
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Because like I want to, I don't know, I want to show it off.

1245
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And like there's a, even after making the sun, there's more stuff.

1246
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Like you, you got to make the dark sun.

1247
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And then apparently if you bring the dark sun and the dark and the regular sun together,

1248
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
you can like collide them and some shit happens.

1249
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
And I don't know.

1250
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
That sounds pretty neat.

1251
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I have a deliberately, yeah, I was like, I should do that on.

1252
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
They have a sibling rivalry.

1253
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I should do that on my Twitch, I guess.

1254
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Um, Gib, since we started in the podium squad, they would flame me alive if I did not ask you

1255
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
if you have any updates to the podium cast.

1256
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Oh yeah.

1257
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I asked Nate a while ago.

1258
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Hey, we've, it's been a while since we did a podcast.

1259
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
When are you free to record?

1260
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
We could do one on the God, when did I ask him?

1261
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Let me look.

1262
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Let me look at the DMs.

1263
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Um, he basically replied saying, uh, sure, I'm a little busy with stuff right now, but

1264
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I'll get around.

1265
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I'll, I'll, uh, we, we, yeah.

1266
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
The June 27th is when I asked and he said, don't have much spare time.

1267
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I'm going to be busy for at least a week.

1268
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And, uh, yeah, I guess we haven't followed up on that because it's been more than a week

1269
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
or I think it has.

1270
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Um, did you hear about the mutiny?

1271
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Um, I don't know about anything pertaining to the part of the discord because I left.

1272
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

1273
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
So yeah.

1274
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Um, there was a mutiny.

1275
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Um, so big got big the person that you modded.

1276
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And everyone was upset that there was a mod.

1277
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Uh, he got his discord account banned.

1278
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Um, for promoting violence from discord.

1279
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Yeah.

1280
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
For promoting violence.

1281
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Lol.

1282
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Um, okay.

1283
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So he made a new one.

1284
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Fucking idiot.

1285
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
He made a new one, rejoined the server and he asked Nate if he could be remodded and

1286
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
apparently Nate told him no.

1287
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Perfect fucking chaos.

1288
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I mean, that's typical.

1289
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Um, wait, he got, he got banned for promoting violence for what?

1290
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
He didn't say why he won't tell anyone why.

1291
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
He just says in another server.

1292
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Was it?

1293
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Or is it?

1294
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It was in another server.

1295
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
We have no details.

1296
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
If he's asked.

1297
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
So he says a secret double life of, of like, I don't know, the double life.

1298
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
According to him, he woke up to an email from discord saying that his account was now banned

1299
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
for promoting violence.

1300
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
La now.

1301
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Sad, but true.

1302
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So there's no, there's no mods anymore.

1303
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Yeah.

1304
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Except Nate.

1305
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Chaos reign supreme.

1306
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Well, Nate never did any moderation.

1307
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
That he actually has broken that and did some moderate.

1308
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Wait, what happened?

1309
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
There was a mutiny.

1310
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Um, a guy named veil.

1311
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I don't know if you guys have heard of him.

1312
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
He's a veil.

1313
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Veils that decided to make a server called the podium scored two.

1314
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And he started telling people to spam fire emoji spam.

1315
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
We're burning down the ship in the podium scored.

1316
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So a bunch of people spam.

1317
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
There was a bunch of that everyone's and then Nate turned on slow mode.

1318
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So you can only send a message once every 60 seconds.

1319
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Wow.

1320
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
This sounds like a fail.

1321
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
All right.

1322
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I, the thing with the podium scored is that the, there's a patreon.

1323
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So the, the higher tier chats are like safe ish from like the big spam of the larger user base of the, you know, the show.

1324
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yeah.

1325
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's just politics.

1326
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Yeah.

1327
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And yeah.

1328
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
So I would have thought, is it slow mode everywhere or just in the major?

1329
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
It was just, well, I, I'm not a patron.

1330
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I don't know.

1331
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I do know most of the patrons were on board with the mutiny to join veil server,

1332
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
which was the funniest part.

1333
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Like a lot of the blue names just turn white.

1334
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I mean, there's no new episodes.

1335
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
So like if it's, it's fair enough, I guess, what else are they going to do?

1336
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Yeah.

1337
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
It's fan fire emojis in main chat.

1338
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Um, I am really glad that they remembered to turn off slow mode though because a bunch of people were worried that he just forget that he turned it on.

1339
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
That, that sounds like something he would do.

1340
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Yeah.

1341
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Um, but yes, that, that was the great mutiny of the podium scored.

1342
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:44,000
And now the server's dead because both, they split the, it's active user base in half.

1343
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Wow.

1344
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Tragedy.

1345
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Tragedy.

1346
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
How's the sequel server going?

1347
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Uh, it's also dead.

1348
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Oh.

1349
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Okay.

1350
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Based.

1351
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Um.

1352
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It's a real pirate war.

1353
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Yeah.

1354
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:12,000
As, as captains has had, um, we weren't, we were like, hold up in our, in our captain's quarters and we weren't communicating with the crew.

1355
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And they're like, where are we going?

1356
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
We don't know.

1357
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
We're just sailing into, into like dangerous waters.

1358
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
This is no direction.

1359
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
We need direction.

1360
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
We need a new video.

1361
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
We're pirates.

1362
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
We need, we need a one piece.

1363
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
We need rules.

1364
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
We need rules and regulations to follow.

1365
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,000
If we don't get Gibbs nuance take of this one piece chapter, we're burning the ships down.

1366
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I still, I like, there's no, like, it, there's no, like, it's over.

1367
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It still could happen.

1368
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I just need to keep pestering Nate about it and we can get together and record.

1369
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I think Nate was busy because he was working on that video that he dropped the nickel.

1370
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
He's also got the, the, the radcon.

1371
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
He needs to work on the OVA.

1372
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
He needs to finish the OVA.

1373
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:04,000
That's after, well, after a road to radcon, there's just that and then the dojin, which is, I don't know.

1374
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Is the music video even out yet?

1375
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Oh, that was done.

1376
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
No, the song, I think, I thought he said it was done.

1377
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
The song came out.

1378
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Oh, it did.

1379
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Was there a reason why the music video didn't come out yet?

1380
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Was it?

1381
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Oh, it was waiting for the lecture, but the lecture's out.

1382
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah, I feel like that should be out, but it's not.

1383
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
No, you're right.

1384
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Okay.

1385
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
That's another thing that's really got to get done.

1386
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I guess lots of, lots of things to pester Nate.

1387
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I would, I would, I would love to complain.

1388
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I would love to complain and say like, oh, why don't we just, why doesn't he just get that done?

1389
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
But like, it took me a month and a half to get around to actually writing the, the radcon chapter.

1390
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So like, I'm not any better.

1391
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Yeah.

1392
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It is what it is.

1393
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Yeah.

1394
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Imagine it all being done.

1395
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Imagine road to radcon being finished.

1396
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I can't deliver.

1397
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I know.

1398
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I know it's a curse.

1399
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It is a curse.

1400
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I felt the same way after radcon three, when it took a year to get the fucking, the t-bap resurrection done.

1401
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I felt like, like I was under a curse the whole time.

1402
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
And I feel that way again, even stronger now.

1403
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And I can't wait to be free.

1404
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I feel like this must act like has to be the most confusing series of conversations for us, boy.

1405
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Having not known.

1406
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Oh yeah.

1407
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I am entirely lost.

1408
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
No, that's his problem.

1409
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I am entirely lost.

1410
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Talk about basically everything.

1411
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Yeah.

1412
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Like every, like offshoot thing related to the show.

1413
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
It has been inside baseball for an hour.

1414
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Yeah.

1415
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Have we, have we been going for an hour?

1416
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah.

1417
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
At least.

1418
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Hour seven minutes.

1419
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Time flies when you're having fun.

1420
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
True.

1421
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
All right.

1422
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So let, so shred it, right?

1423
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Shred it.

1424
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,000
What is, what is a subreddit that you guys have heard of that is horrible?

1425
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah.

1426
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Like what would be a subreddit worth?

1427
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
We said we were going to cover.

1428
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It would make you go, holy shit.

1429
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I need to see this.

1430
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I hate that subreddit.

1431
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I was, I was, I mean.

1432
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Procrastinate as podcast.

1433
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Honestly, if you did one about our subreddit, that would be really funny.

1434
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Uh, I was reminded by YMS the other day of, I think it's gone.

1435
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I don't think it exists anymore, but like there was one called like watch people die.

1436
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I think it was a real subreddit or it was something like that.

1437
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And it was really just like videos in which people are killed.

1438
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Jesus.

1439
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Uh, obviously it doesn't exist anymore, but it did at one point.

1440
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Um, let's see.

1441
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I mean, shit.

1442
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Uh, I haven't used Reddit in a long time.

1443
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
So, uh, I mean, I don't know if there's a lot of good content to come from this, but

1444
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I remember, I don't know what it was called, but I remember the, when I was doing my hypocrite

1445
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
reviews, I was looking for places to show them to show off like, oh, I make video game reviews.

1446
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Guys, look at them.

1447
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:59,000
And there was this one Reddit I came across, which was, you know, a bunch of, of wannabe

1448
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
video game review channels posting their video game reviews.

1449
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And, you know, every single one of them, no upvotes, no comments, no likes, no nothing.

1450
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Uh, because nobody was there to watch them.

1451
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
They were all there to promote themselves.

1452
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Yeah.

1453
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So it was, it was, it was sad.

1454
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I posted my thing there and I was like, you know what?

1455
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I don't want to be here anymore.

1456
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Yeah.

1457
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Like, yeah.

1458
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
So it was like just a weird promotional.

1459
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
There's, there's, there's all kinds of places.

1460
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
That's the exact opposite of r slash vTubers.

1461
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Cause it's just, oh, that's just like literally like every, like all like these are virtual

1462
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
YouTubers, just like helping, supporting each other.

1463
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That's why it sounds like the exact opposite.

1464
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I don't believe you.

1465
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Oh, yeah.

1466
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I don't, I don't believe you.

1467
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
A little bit.

1468
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Game reviews.

1469
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
When we started Shreddit, there was a sub that the podium scored, begged us to do and

1470
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
it was called r slash horse walkers.

1471
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Uh, a week into Shreddit's existence, that subreddit got permanently pruned, deleted.

1472
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
No, you fools.

1473
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Oh man.

1474
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And can you find archives or something?

1475
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I have not found anything.

1476
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I just know it existed and it got the, it got banned from Reddit because people were

1477
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,000
just posting pictures of them having sex with horses and it was disgusting.

1478
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Oh, it was just people having sex with horses.

1479
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Yes.

1480
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And people talking about their experiences.

1481
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Well, it's advertising is on point.

1482
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yeah.

1483
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I mean, it just sounds like a Mr. Hands fan club.

1484
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but like, that's not illegal, right?

1485
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Like pictures of pictures of you fucking the horse are not, are not illegal.

1486
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I think it depends on the state.

1487
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Hmm.

1488
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Why Ben?

1489
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
What do you want?

1490
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I mean, wait, like, I'm not going to get in trouble.

1491
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Am I?

1492
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I don't know.

1493
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I just like, wait, what was it banned for?

1494
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Was it banned?

1495
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Is it, is it simply, is it a crime to fuck a horse and take pictures of it in America?

1496
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I mean, I didn't think it was, but maybe.

1497
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I don't know what I'd be able to spot.

1498
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
If not, like, what was it deleted for?

1499
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I think you, I would assume this like animal cruelty laws.

1500
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I think you're not supposed to have a discord server that's more than like a certain percentage pornography.

1501
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I think that's a rule somewhere.

1502
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Wait, it was a, wait, it was a discord server.

1503
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I thought it was a subreddit.

1504
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Oh, but same thing.

1505
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I don't know why it's a.

1506
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Okay.

1507
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Okay.

1508
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Um, I don't actually know.

1509
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I don't know if that's true.

1510
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
There was also r slash incels.

1511
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
No, that doesn't make sense.

1512
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
That's definitely not true because there are dedicated porn subreddits.

1513
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Should I mention I don't use Reddit.

1514
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
You, you, you have said so.

1515
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Okay.

1516
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
No, that, that can't be a reason why.

1517
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
There's like hundreds of that.

1518
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Like, I feel like a lot of Reddit's user base is just people going to specific, like porn Reddit places.

1519
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Where they get the specific porn that they want.

1520
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
You know, I wouldn't know.

1521
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yes, I would.

1522
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It's nice to, I mean, they segment it into, you know, highly, highly specific.

1523
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Misha's catering to every, every taste.

1524
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Like horse fucking.

1525
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Like horse fucking for instance.

1526
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yeah.

1527
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Speaking of highly specific there, we wanted to do an episode on the incel subreddit because

1528
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
obviously making fun of them is just easy.

1529
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Sure.

1530
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Too, too easy.

1531
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
But there was a specific subsection of our slash incels was banned two years before it started.

1532
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
There was another subreddit that we were like a week from covering and it got banned.

1533
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And I forgot it was something like Asian hoppers or hoppers something.

1534
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Hoppers?

1535
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And it was a subreddit for Asian incels.

1536
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
What is a hopper?

1537
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Is it just an incel?

1538
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I don't know.

1539
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Shit.

1540
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I remember this.

1541
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I can't remember what it is.

1542
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I think it's H-A-P-P-A.

1543
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I think I've heard it before, but I don't know what it means.

1544
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:03,000
All I know is that it was a very specific niche of incels who were Asian and believed

1545
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
they were superior to other races and that girls should be Asian men.

1546
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Sure.

1547
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
But also that they were involuntary celibate because they're just so bad even though they

1548
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
have an advantage.

1549
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Well, it's because Western, it's because Western media has disseminated, you know, the Jewish

1550
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
global homo security that has made them all want to date, to miscegenate and date black

1551
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
men to weaken the white race and also the Asian race.

1552
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
What are you?

1553
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Natters.

1554
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Natters.

1555
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I'm just spitting facts is what I'm doing.

1556
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And that's what I would say.

1557
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Dude, I could be a hopper.

1558
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I could get on there.

1559
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
God, I hope that's not a slur or something.

1560
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I hope that's what I think it means.

1561
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I mean, they call themselves that, so I don't think so.

1562
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Okay.

1563
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I don't know.

1564
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm just saying, I think I could blend in.

1565
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I know how they think that anything can be a slur if you try.

1566
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I mean, do you want the definition?

1567
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I looked it up on Urban Dictionary.

1568
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So I mean, it's Urban Dictionary.

1569
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Why don't you read us the Urban Dictionary?

1570
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Classic.

1571
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Classic.

1572
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Man, he's just bringing it back.

1573
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
He doesn't even know about the peace.

1574
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
He's a natural.

1575
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yeah.

1576
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Yeah, true.

1577
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
A Japanese term for people who are half Asian and half white.

1578
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It means half in Japanese.

1579
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Usually they have big almond brown or hazel eyes.

1580
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
North Asian hoppers are pale whereas Southeast Asians are extremely tan.

1581
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Most have freckles.

1582
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I knew it.

1583
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I was going to say this, but then I was like, oh, it must not be what I think it is.

1584
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I thought the word for that was like, when you said a hopper, I was like, wait,

1585
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
isn't that the word that means you're half Japanese?

1586
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
No, that must be like, I thought it might be like hafu or hafa or something.

1587
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
But yeah, okay.

1588
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah.

1589
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So it's about mixed race, Asian people.

1590
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
And they had their own.

1591
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Who think that?

1592
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Who think that?

1593
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Wait, they think that white girls should date Asian people.

1594
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Yes.

1595
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
That's the idea.

1596
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Okay.

1597
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
They think Asians are better, but maybe they curse the non-Asian side of them.

1598
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I'm not sure.

1599
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I mean, I'm not sure if they curse the Asian side or the non-Asian.

1600
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
They're definitely cursing one side.

1601
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Are they cursing one side or are they cursing the other side?

1602
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Or are they there because they believe in hapa supremacy?

1603
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
They're like, I'm the best of both worlds.

1604
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I'm a genetic perfection.

1605
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I combine the two things that are good.

1606
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Why aren't the girls, why you don't the girls understand this?

1607
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
You see, this is why Reddit should not ban subreddits.

1608
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
They should just archive them so everyone in the future can just make fun of them.

1609
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Stop people from posting, but because now we'll never have those questions answered.

1610
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
But that takes up server space.

1611
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Really?

1612
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Is there no wayback machine archive of any of this stuff?

1613
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I have a very late man, but there probably is.

1614
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
You might want to give the wayback machine a try.

1615
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm just saying that's the first thing I would try if I were looking for old deleted shit on the internet.

1616
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
We still have a ton of subreddits though.

1617
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I mean, sure.

1618
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
It's not like you're running out of material.

1619
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Yeah, no.

1620
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I do kind of want to infiltrate some of the private Reddit communities,

1621
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
because there are some communities that know they're toxic and know they're bad.

1622
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
So they're private.

1623
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Do you know what FDS is?

1624
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
No.

1625
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
FDS, no.

1626
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Female dating strategy.

1627
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Oh, no.

1628
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Imagine women with the charisma of themselves.

1629
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
So it's for women that can't get a date?

1630
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
No.

1631
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,000
It's for women to say, oh, I don't need to get a date because all the men in my life are no value and I cannot use them.

1632
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
So therefore, I am a strong independent woman.

1633
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
So why is it called dating strategy?

1634
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
That's a good question.

1635
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
It was probably started off.

1636
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Maybe it started as, yeah.

1637
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Well, they do kind of like something different.

1638
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
If a girl joins the subreddit and she starts posting about how she has a date,

1639
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
they give quote unquote advice by saying that, oh, if he plays video games, dump him.

1640
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

1641
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
That kind of like really stupid, just generalizations.

1642
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
You got to go for them HVMs.

1643
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
You don't want an LVM.

1644
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
You want that high value mail.

1645
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Oh, yeah.

1646
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That's some video games.

1647
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:30,000
That's some pretty hardcore, some basic LDM behaviors right there.

1648
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Make sure he has a bed frame.

1649
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
If he doesn't have a bed frame, you got to walk out.

1650
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
You got to, you don't want to fuck with that.

1651
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
What is so great about bed?

1652
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I saw a tweet about this today.

1653
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
There's more bed frame discourse.

1654
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
What is so important about bed frames?

1655
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Why does everybody love bed frames?

1656
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
What is the, what is the deal?

1657
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Is it bed frames or is it the Olympic sex bed debacle?

1658
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
No, no.

1659
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I'm talking about when ladies say like,

1660
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
uh, men, why are you 25 plus and still don't have a bed frame?

1661
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Like get, get serious.

1662
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
If you want a girl to come in your bedroom, you better have a bed frame.

1663
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
That is the exclusive reason I have a bed frame.

1664
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
What is a bed frame?

1665
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I'll be honest.

1666
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Woman.

1667
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
What do they mean by bed frame?

1668
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Do they mean just like support for the mattress so that it's not touching the ground?

1669
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Yeah.

1670
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,000
You know, you know, the thing, the wooden structure that you put your box spring and mattress on.

1671
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I mean, you got to get off the ground.

1672
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You got to get like one with a headboard.

1673
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
If you're going to go for it, you got to make it obvious that like, ah, yes, I am.

1674
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
What does anyone need?

1675
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
What does anyone need a headboard for?

1676
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I think it's just aesthetics.

1677
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I think it's, it's a, it's a form of peacocking to be like, to be completely honest.

1678
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Honestly, honestly, it seems like it's just a decorative thing that is just like a status symbol.

1679
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And it's just like, it's just like people that unironically buy into like the fucking bed frame meme.

1680
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
They're like, it's just something you got to have just to show that you're not a loser.

1681
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And if you don't have one, you're a loser.

1682
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
It just makes you look a little more like, you know, what you're doing.

1683
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Even though it doesn't actually mean anything.

1684
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
The one thing that I can, like, yeah.

1685
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:15,000
If that, like, I can see it like the headboard being the thing that you like, oh, that's the status symbol.

1686
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But the bed frame is just like a utility thing.

1687
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
The one thing, the one thing.

1688
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Is it just more comfortable to sleep on a mattress on a bed frame than it is on the ground?

1689
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I don't think so.

1690
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:33,000
The one thing that I know that it does do that I can understand the utility of a bed frame is that it gives you more floor space and you can store stuff under your bed.

1691
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And like, I get that.

1692
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Isn't it also a sex thing so the bed doesn't, you know, go too far off the box spring, you know, it has a frame to keep it centered on the box spring?

1693
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Um, I guess.

1694
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I mean, I mean, I guess that's potentially an issue.

1695
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Sex or no sex.

1696
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Uh, I guess.

1697
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I don't know.

1698
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
How far does your fucking mattress slide?

1699
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It just feels like such a normal utility, like part of a bed.

1700
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You get a bed, that's it.

1701
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
That's part of the bed.

1702
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
It's like saying, oh, I'm gonna get it like a microwave without a door.

1703
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Why would you get a door?

1704
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I think that's where the controversy comes in because it's such a basic thing that not having it, I guess, is notable.

1705
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
How is it?

1706
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
How is it?

1707
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It can't be that notable because I feel like it's not that uncommon for you.

1708
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I have not met a single person who has a bed frame.

1709
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
If you, if you can't tell, I'm very defensive because I also do not have a bed frame.

1710
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1711
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And I have a big problem.

1712
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
That wasn't obvious.

1713
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
This post was made by no bed frame gang.

1714
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I mean, if I didn't have one already, none would be on the floor.

1715
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

1716
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I don't have a bed frame and I just, I don't know why I would want one.

1717
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I don't see how my life or my situation or even just the aesthetics of my room would be improved by having one.

1718
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Yeah.

1719
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And so I was like, ladies, he better have a bed frame.

1720
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I was like, what?

1721
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Why?

1722
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Explain why?

1723
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Just give me one good reason why you, you wish for a bed frame.

1724
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
What would having a bed frame provide you?

1725
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And I have, I have yet to see an explanation.

1726
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I genuinely just think it's like a peacocking.

1727
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Like it's just something you're supposed to have.

1728
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Yeah.

1729
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Just because.

1730
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Well, I guess I never thought about it before, but I'm not exactly going to go out of my way to not have one.

1731
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I don't know.

1732
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I feel like bed, I've never seen.

1733
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Well, yeah, like, I mean, I have never been in a house that doesn't have a bed with a bed frame.

1734
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:35,000
To be honest, the way that my room is like one, one side of my room has like an angled, you know, ceiling.

1735
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It kind of tapers down and my bed is under the tapered down part.

1736
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
If my, if I had a bed frame, my bed would actually be like kind of too high up.

1737
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And I think I would feel claustrophobic because like the angled ceiling would be sort of like right there.

1738
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And I would be, I mean, I could probably still sit up, but I might feel like, oh, I got to like avoid the ceiling.

1739
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I don't know.

1740
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I kind of think I like it just the way it is.

1741
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I think I do actually, even if I had a bed frame, I might not set it up.

1742
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I might take it apart and put it away.

1743
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
It's like, no, I don't have the space for it.

1744
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I don't have the vertical space to spare.

1745
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
You just put the headboard up.

1746
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
You leave the rest.

1747
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
That's all you did.

1748
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Just lean it against the wall and push your mattress up against it.

1749
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It's not connected to anything.

1750
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
You just, you just drill it.

1751
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
No, no, you just drill it right into the wall itself.

1752
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Let's get some bungee cords.

1753
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Just rig it up.

1754
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Just hang it from the ceiling.

1755
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
All about the headboard.

1756
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Got to make it look like maybe some duct tape.

1757
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
You got to make it look just terrible.

1758
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Now we're talking.

1759
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
The worst, the better.

1760
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I don't know why this scenario popped into my head, but I'm thinking like you got your mattress on the floor.

1761
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And then, you know, you bring like, I don't know, some soup in to have a meal at your computer.

1762
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And then whoops, you spill it.

1763
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
It goes on the floor and then it goes straight onto it, like rolls over to the mattress.

1764
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
It's on the mattress.

1765
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
If you had a bed frame, it'd be on the floor instead.

1766
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And the mattress would be okay.

1767
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I know that's a straight.

1768
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I don't like the idea of the mattress.

1769
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
That's a very specific situation, but I think it's just that reason.

1770
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I think I might have to get a bed frame now.

1771
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Suspend your mattress by using cables and pulleys.

1772
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Anchors on the floor.

1773
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I mean, that works.

1774
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
That sounds cool.

1775
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
It's just like a really heavy hammock.

1776
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Hammocks are good.

1777
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I should get a hammock.

1778
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:39,000
The biggest reason for bed, brought to you by bed frame gang is that when standing up,

1779
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
you are, your ass is at normal ass level when standing, like when sitting.

1780
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
So it's like getting up in the morning is no work at all.

1781
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
You don't have to like try to like get up and shit.

1782
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
You can just like roll over and you're up.

1783
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Are you kidding me?

1784
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
It's great.

1785
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

1786
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Like, oh, I struggled to stand in the morning.

1787
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Do you have gravity on my side or I can't do it?

1788
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I smoke.

1789
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Give me a fucking break.

1790
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Give me a fucking break.

1791
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Give me a break.

1792
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I was going to say this earlier, but one of the things I want to really start doing is

1793
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
infiltrating those subreddits like FDS.

1794
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
They have a private subreddit.

1795
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Now this is where they talk about the real dating strategy, the strategy that if they

1796
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
made public would get them all in a lot of deep shit.

1797
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And in order to get in, you first have to be verified as a woman on their discord server.

1798
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
You also have to be a verified feminist.

1799
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I have to.

1800
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I got to imagine.

1801
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I have a feeling they probably don't like trans women do they?

1802
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Half of the mods don't.

1803
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
So there was some discourse when we covered their option.

1804
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Am I going undercover?

1805
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
You have to do six interviews.

1806
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I think it was in order to get into like it's this lengthy process.

1807
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
You should record them all.

1808
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
You should record all of them.

1809
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I'll put my sister to this record the whole process.

1810
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Yeah.

1811
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Just like make it like a deep dive highly edited video about the secret subreddit.

1812
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
That's so terrible that you have to jump through these many hoops to get it.

1813
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,000
It would be like a documentary about like how I joined the the Scientology culture something.

1814
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Yeah.

1815
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:42,000
There are a lot of subreddits like that and that people recommend like, hey, I heard this subreddit is really bad, but it's private.

1816
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
So I don't know how to get in and then you look it up and it's some lengthy.

1817
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
The FDS one is by far the worst example.

1818
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
They are really strict about who they let in.

1819
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:03,000
But there are some other ones that do similar things where they require you to send like IRL photos and pictures of ID before they've been considered letting you in.

1820
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
For a show like Shreddit, I feel like those would be the...

1821
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
How do we know they're women?

1822
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Huh?

1823
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Those moderators.

1824
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Oh my God.

1825
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
What if they're just men running a racket because they want they want pics?

1826
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Oh my God.

1827
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Oh my God.

1828
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
For the next interview, you have to show your feet.

1829
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
No!

1830
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Yeah.

1831
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:33,000
But yeah, I feel like if they are so bad that they recognize the fact that they need to be private to avoid major backlash.

1832
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I feel like those would be the best subreddits to make fun of.

1833
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
It feels like it's like months to do.

1834
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Yeah.

1835
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
That makes sense.

1836
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:49,000
You know, just thinking about it, I do imagine a lot of it is just extreme turf-y, like ranting.

1837
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
A lot of it's got it.

1838
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Probably.

1839
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I know that they have a sister subreddit called r slash fds leveled up and fds leveled up.

1840
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Leveled up?

1841
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I'm so reddit.

1842
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:11,000
So it's where you look into the personal life of some of the most active fds users and they post about routines they do.

1843
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And it's all dumb.

1844
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
It's all dumb.

1845
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
We made an episode on that.

1846
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
They're really stupid.

1847
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
But I do know one of the rules on the fds was like no trans people.

1848
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Oh shit.

1849
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Yeah.

1850
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Yeah.

1851
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
That's what I said.

1852
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
That's what I was saying.

1853
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
It's like half and half because on the regular subreddit they don't have that rule.

1854
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
You know what I mean?

1855
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:44,000
So it's like this probably sister subreddit is like they are down with trans people who hate themselves, I'm guessing.

1856
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Possibly?

1857
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Well, who isn't?

1858
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Trans and hating yourself?

1859
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Who isn't down?

1860
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Who isn't down?

1861
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I was referring to the Blair White types.

1862
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
The Blair White types?

1863
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Blair White?

1864
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
The Blights.

1865
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Someone posted, I think it was like a Blair White version of another meme that the meme is like, hey, I saw you posting about how trans suck.

1866
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
And you know, despite being trans myself, I know, right?

1867
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I totally agree with you.

1868
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
You know, I'm one of the good ones, you might say.

1869
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's like not like other girls, but a trans, a Blair White version.

1870
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Blair White is just like a grifter, right?

1871
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Like, there's no question.

1872
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Absolutely.

1873
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Absolutely.

1874
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
She is like openly said.

1875
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:50,000
She's like said like, yeah, like a bunch of the other like conservative grifters that I talked to, like a bunch of them don't even believe what they say.

1876
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Like they're all, she made a video that was like, a bunch of these other people don't even believe what they say.

1877
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Yeah.

1878
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
They're just grifting, they're all just grifting.

1879
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And then, and like, I don't know, she's just like that.

1880
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I think she was talking about Steven Crowder.

1881
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
She made a video saying like, Steven Crowder is just drifting.

1882
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
He doesn't even believe his own bullshit.

1883
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And then just never mentioned it again and nobody cared.

1884
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Nobody, nobody acknowledged it.

1885
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I remember during the time on the dark internet where Gamergate happened, Blair White, I remember her existing around then and she basically said, hey, I'm trans.

1886
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
So I have the correct opinion.

1887
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Listen to me.

1888
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
All this hate is good.

1889
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Dab.

1890
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
It's a persuasive argument.

1891
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
It's a persuasive argument.

1892
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
It was like, who the fuck are you?

1893
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Why do I care?

1894
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Yeah.

1895
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
How did we get on this?

1896
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Don't remember.

1897
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Oh yeah.

1898
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Oh yeah.

1899
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
FDS.

1900
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
FDS.

1901
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
The horrible subreddit that is FDS.

1902
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
And there are many spinoff sequel subreddits and their private subreddits.

1903
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I think, I think it would be funny if you went through all the rigmarole to infiltrate FDS and then write a, write a memoir about it.

1904
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I don't know.

1905
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Write a book.

1906
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
No, no, you write a spy thriller.

1907
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
All you do is you just review some of them on your stupid show.

1908
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
That's, that's what you do.

1909
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
That's the move.

1910
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
I mean, you could do, you could do so many things.

1911
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
You could do so many, honestly, I think like if you recorded a process of actually getting in, I think that would be interesting too.

1912
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But yeah, also, and then you have access, do you have secret access to all of this fucking bullshit?

1913
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1914
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I love it.

1915
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
It becomes, it becomes a running monthly Patreon podcast.

1916
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
A little mini podcast.

1917
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
A little mini podcast.

1918
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Hey, yes, to do it.

1919
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
For this exclusive content.

1920
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Oh.

1921
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
After, after we save a couple hundred posts and then just like out ourselves and then.

1922
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Well, you don't, well, or just don't out yourself and like they'll just know like that.

1923
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Yeah, there's a spy in here.

1924
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
We don't know who they are.

1925
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Ooh.

1926
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
They have a fight amongst themselves.

1927
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Get a backup.

1928
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
They have to decide the imposter.

1929
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
They'll only throw in each other out the airlock.

1930
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Ooh.

1931
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Accusing each other.

1932
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
It could be fun.

1933
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Like a game.

1934
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
How would, how would it be like to be sus in the FDS?

1935
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
What if we, what if we both were sus in the FDS subreddit?

1936
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And we were both girls in the real world.

1937
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Commencing operation sus.

1938
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It's become like an actual spy for the government.

1939
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Yeah.

1940
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I can't wait to be sus when I grow up.

1941
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Sounds, sounds pretty exciting.

1942
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Think, think of the intrigue.

1943
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Oh my God.

1944
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
One of these people is not like the other.

1945
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
It's a spy.

1946
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I do James Bond is so sus.

1947
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
He, I mean, yeah.

1948
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Shut up.

1949
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Shut up.

1950
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
He did some raping, right?

1951
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I think he's done some raping.

1952
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Which binds?

1953
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Well, they're all the same.

1954
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Sean Connery specifically.

1955
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Yeah, true.

1956
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
One of the, doesn't one of them like Rufi, some, some lady?

1957
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Or am I thinking of someone else?

1958
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I'll be honest.

1959
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I've only seen the most recent run of James Bond movies.

1960
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I have not seen much James Bond.

1961
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's been a minute since I've seen the movie.

1962
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
The only James Bond movies I've seen are the, um,

1963
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
who was it before the current guy?

1964
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Pierce Brosnan.

1965
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Pierce, the only ones I've seen are the Pierce Brosnan ones.

1966
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I don't know why I watched them.

1967
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
So tomorrow never dies.

1968
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
GoldenEye.

1969
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Uh, there's another one that he did.

1970
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I guess.

1971
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Um, the only, the only thing I know about old school James Bond

1972
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
was there was a movie called Octo Pussy.

1973
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And it wasn't a movie.

1974
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
A character was named Octo Pussy.

1975
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Five year old Brazos.

1976
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Seven Vajanas.

1977
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Is that what that means?

1978
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Like the aerial, like the vanilla,

1979
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
the Neal C.C.Riga aerial cartoon.

1980
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Yeah.

1981
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
When she's got seven Vajanas.

1982
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Eight legs.

1983
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Seven West Virginia's.

1984
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,000
The, the, the, the, the aerial, the little mermaid one.

1985
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Uh, the, the, the butler tells Prince Eric

1986
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
eight legs, seven Vajanas.

1987
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Right.

1988
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Yes.

1989
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Yes. Genius.

1990
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
You got it.

1991
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I got it.

1992
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Woo.

1993
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Great.

1994
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I want to complain.

1995
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I want to complain about last week

1996
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
and about why the episode didn't go up

1997
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
and we got content, uh, uh,

1998
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
was it community guidelines struck

1999
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
and we couldn't upload for a week

2000
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
because I said this on Twitter

2001
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
or I said it, I said it in the comments of last episode,

2002
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
but I'll say it again here.

2003
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
The reason why the episode couldn't,

2004
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
it went up for a moment and then it was taken down

2005
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
and we had to re-upload it the next week

2006
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,000
was because we talked about a rule 34 piece of fan fiction.

2007
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It was, um, Spike the dog, fucking Jerry or Tom, Tom.

2008
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
No, Tom, Tom the cat.

2009
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
With that face.

2010
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
With that, with that famous like unnerved Tom face.

2011
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And we, we linked to a piece,

2012
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
we linked to the rule 34 link to that fan art in the description

2013
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
and that link got flagged as porn

2014
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
and the video was given a, a content,

2015
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
a content violation strike.

2016
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And, uh, yeah, and we couldn't upload for a week.

2017
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
That's the point.

2018
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And it's funny because that's not even the first time that happened.

2019
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
There was another video that we,

2020
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
we talked about Shad Man

2021
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
and there was a Shad based link in the description

2022
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
and that it didn't get us a community violation strike,

2023
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
but it did get like, it got some,

2024
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
it got like a warning, I think,

2025
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
which is maybe the thing that happens before that.

2026
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So yeah, we've been warned for this exact same reason before,

2027
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
but we didn't listen.

2028
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Oh my God.

2029
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I mean, it was a while ago.

2030
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
That was, that was like a long time ago.

2031
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Yeah.

2032
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I think, you know, I, I think, um,

2033
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
now that this, once the, once the strike is like gone,

2034
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I think I'm going to dispute that because like,

2035
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I don't know why I didn't do this before.

2036
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
All we had to do was just take the link out.

2037
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Yeah.

2038
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
And, and there's a link to dispute.

2039
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I can just be like, hey, dispute, the link's gone.

2040
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Can you please be unwarranted?

2041
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Oh my God.

2042
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Yeah.

2043
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I mean, a warning doesn't do anything.

2044
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
It would probably work like that.

2045
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
But, um, I actually had something set up for next,

2046
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
for last week and I was really sad that didn't pan out.

2047
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Um, I'm so sorry.

2048
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Kai here is a big fan of Tom Oliver.

2049
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Why am I getting involved?

2050
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
He has the exclusive merch here on Tom's Patreon.

2051
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
So I messaged Tom and I was like, hey, Tom, you know,

2052
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Kai, your biggest fan,

2053
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,000
he would fangirl for about an hour if you came on the PCP episode this Sunday.

2054
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Is this a bit?

2055
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
No, it's not a bit.

2056
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And Tom said, yes, he would come on.

2057
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
He was like, yes, he was like, oh, I know Kai.

2058
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Yeah, I'd love to come on and make a fangirl.

2059
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Oh, you're lying.

2060
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
You're lying.

2061
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
This isn't real.

2062
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
This didn't happen.

2063
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Hold on.

2064
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
So I am.

2065
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Okay.

2066
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Well, if that's true, then why didn't you just ask him to come on this?

2067
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I did.

2068
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
He just never responded.

2069
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Okay.

2070
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I am.

2071
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
In fact, I see the guy,

2072
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
the first one who started giving him that money.

2073
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
So I'm like, oh, no one's doing that tier.

2074
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I'm like, hmm, so I could get some cool shit.

2075
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
So I started doing it.

2076
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Amazing.

2077
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Here.

2078
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Amazing.

2079
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I have a lot of Izumi shirts.

2080
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Check your DMs.

2081
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Leak screenshots, epic drama.

2082
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Oh, no.

2083
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Yeah.

2084
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
He said he'd try to be on.

2085
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
But we skipped the week.

2086
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I'm sorry.

2087
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I'm sorry.

2088
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It just, it just didn't work out.

2089
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
We could have, we could have tried to tell him again.

2090
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
We eat.

2091
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Yeah, we eat.

2092
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
We could have, we could have just said.

2093
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I was trying to make it a surprise.

2094
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
You could have just asked him.

2095
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I was trying to make it a surprise.

2096
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I mean, on the other hand, on the other hand, he did say I'll try to be on this week, which

2097
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
is not, which is not exactly a guarantee.

2098
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
So who knows.

2099
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Yeah.

2100
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Who knows if he even would have shown up.

2101
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
He did.

2102
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
We'll never know.

2103
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
We'll never know.

2104
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Another timeline, perhaps.

2105
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Yeah.

2106
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And a better timeline.

2107
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
That was when, that was when the timeline split.

2108
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Yes.

2109
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Not coronavirus.

2110
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
It was that.

2111
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It was Tom.

2112
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It was, it was the content ID strike on the laser bot episode of the procrastinators

2113
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
podcast would split the, the universes.

2114
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Um, I have one more thing I wanted to mention.

2115
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:30,000
During this, this part of the show, which is yesterday, you'll never guess what I did

2116
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
yesterday.

2117
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
You went to Reddit.

2118
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I went.

2119
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
No.

2120
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I went to a show.

2121
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I went to a live musical performance at which our friend of the show, Zen Huxtable

2122
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
performed as part of a band.

2123
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
And it was great.

2124
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
It was based.

2125
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
It was based.

2126
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
It was based.

2127
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
That's it.

2128
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
That's all I have to say.

2129
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
It sounded great.

2130
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I had a great time.

2131
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I was there with, uh, huh?

2132
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
What, what, what, uh, kind of music was it?

2133
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I don't know.

2134
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I guess it was kind of synthy, pop, punk rock kind of, kind of music.

2135
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Uh, yeah.

2136
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Rock.

2137
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
You know, rock, you know, normal music.

2138
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
The band.

2139
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Human music.

2140
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Human music.

2141
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Um, it sounded great.

2142
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I was there with Kazi, uh, and, uh, yeah, good, good times.

2143
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Oh, uh, so I don't know.

2144
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I just wanted to brag about that because, uh, you all, nobody else went.

2145
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Nobody in the audience went or even knew that that happened.

2146
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
But I know, you know, I know all kinds of things, all kinds of secrets.

2147
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I, I sure should.

2148
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Don't.

2149
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Yeah.

2150
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
True.

2151
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,960
Speaking of music, uh, it's been talked about, but nothing has been

2152
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,960
done yet, but we have been thinking about doing a Shreddit album where every song is

2153
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:58,960
a parody of a famous song and it's just making one specific subreddit.

2154
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,960
It was just you and me talking about this late at night.

2155
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,960
The other one, the other member is, it doesn't know what you're talking about.

2156
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:07,960
What the hell?

2157
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:13,960
Kai is barely online, so everyone's aware of things but him.

2158
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:17,960
Um, I, I dropped like $200 on a banner.

2159
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:21,960
And Kai didn't even know it was going to be a thing.

2160
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:22,960
You're not wrong.

2161
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:23,960
You're not wrong.

2162
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:31,960
You're like, oh, I got brand new like, like drawings of new logos and avatars and everything

2163
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:32,960
just overhaul everything.

2164
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,960
And I'm like, oh, uh, cool.

2165
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:36,960
Uh, I just posted it.

2166
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,960
It does look amazing.

2167
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,960
Shout out to Alexi Millian.

2168
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:41,960
Persona.

2169
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:46,960
I am glad I have, I have fellow hosts who can just do other things.

2170
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,960
And just get things done.

2171
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,960
That's pretty, that's pretty, that's pretty Pog.

2172
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,960
What is FSCF?

2173
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,960
Uh, free speech correctional facility.

2174
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:02,960
Because we free speech, free speech, because free speech.

2175
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,960
Uh, that is a reference to the time where we were covering a subreddit and there was

2176
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:12,960
a post that enraged ass boy and it enraged him to the point where he started making

2177
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:13,960
credible threats.

2178
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,960
So we had to cut the episode.

2179
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,960
So he is forever in free speech.

2180
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:20,960
Okay.

2181
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,960
Yeah.

2182
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,960
Like there are too many credible threats of violence.

2183
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,960
And if I cut them all out, the episode's gone.

2184
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,960
So like this is it.

2185
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,960
It makes sense.

2186
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,960
Very upsetting.

2187
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:34,960
Yeah.

2188
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,960
This looks great.

2189
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,960
Who drew Alexi Millian?

2190
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,960
I don't, I don't know.

2191
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,960
I will link their Twitter.

2192
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:45,960
He's amazing.

2193
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,960
They are an inspiring manga artist.

2194
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,960
They plan on going to Japan to enter Shonen Jump's contest.

2195
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,960
You forgot he already, Alexi already worked on a manga.

2196
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:01,960
Like he was like an editor or like he did like support drawings for like a manga.

2197
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:03,960
I forgot which one.

2198
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,960
There you go.

2199
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:07,960
Pog.

2200
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:09,960
There you go.

2201
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:10,960
Pog.

2202
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,960
He is really good at art.

2203
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:14,960
It looks good.

2204
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:15,960
I love works.

2205
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,960
It's really good.

2206
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,960
Dirt.

2207
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:19,960
Shit.

2208
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:20,960
Fuck.

2209
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:23,960
I'm out of, I'm out of, I'm out of stuff to say.

2210
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:25,960
I put a thing on a manga.

2211
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:32,960
I sent my, well I didn't put it in there, but I sent the, the Clarissa thing to Shonen

2212
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,960
Jump contest, the Tezuka thing.

2213
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:37,960
That was fun.

2214
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,960
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

2215
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:46,960
I, I know that Etra Oda laid his eyes on Clarissa Gunsmoke and I'm sure he liked it.

2216
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,960
I was, I was tempted, I was tempted to like put in one of my old comics in there, but

2217
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,960
I, I couldn't do it because like I felt wrong.

2218
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,960
I didn't draw this for the thing.

2219
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,960
I drew this like two years ago.

2220
01:40:58,960 --> 01:40:59,960
I can't do it.

2221
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:02,960
Yeah, you'd have to do a dedicated thing, wouldn't you?

2222
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:06,960
It would just feel, it would feel stupid if you, especially if you want.

2223
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,960
It would be, it would be a little scummy.

2224
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,960
I mean, I don't even know if it would be scummy.

2225
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:12,960
I don't know.

2226
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,960
I, I kind of, I couldn't really even think of like, why not?

2227
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,960
Like I probably should have done it like just because, but I just didn't because it just

2228
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:21,960
felt wrong.

2229
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:30,960
And then I could say Etra Oda laid eyes upon something I drew, but alas, it will never

2230
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:31,960
be.

2231
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:39,960
Do you think the artist for the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series has ever sent his comment?

2232
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:40,960
What's his name?

2233
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:41,960
Like Craig something?

2234
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,960
I thought it was Jeff Kaplan.

2235
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,960
No, that's the Overwatch guy.

2236
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:50,960
Wait, no, Craig is, um, Craig is the guy who writes the Captain Underpants.

2237
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,960
Craig McCracken.

2238
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:52,960
Oh yeah.

2239
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,960
Um, put on Diary of a Wimpy Kid.

2240
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,960
There is Google for this.

2241
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,960
I still, um, I, I follow.

2242
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,960
Oh yeah, it's Jeff Kinney.

2243
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,960
Jeff Kinney.

2244
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,960
Jeff Kinney.

2245
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:15,960
Uh, for some reason I still, I follow, um, I made a tweet about some books that I used

2246
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:16,960
to read as a kid.

2247
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,960
My teacher is an alien and the guy who wrote them, Bruce Coville.

2248
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:22,960
Those books were based.

2249
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:23,960
Do you read them too?

2250
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,960
Yeah, I don't know if I read all of them.

2251
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:26,960
I just read them.

2252
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:27,960
I think like all of them.

2253
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:28,960
That's so fucking good.

2254
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,960
I think my school's library only had the first three.

2255
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:34,960
I made, um, I read, I think there's five.

2256
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,960
Um, I read them all as a kid and I made like a little Twitter thread where I was like sort

2257
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,960
of reminiscing about them and Bruce Coville responded.

2258
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:46,960
And now I, I still see his, uh, his tweets, everyone, I followed him and I see his tweets

2259
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,960
every once in a while.

2260
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:51,960
He's a, he's a very, um, you know, he's, he's very boomer Democrat.

2261
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:56,960
He's very much like, uh, you know, it's not, it's not that exciting really, but I, I

2262
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:57,960
appreciate him.

2263
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:03,960
Uh, he tweeted about reefer madness, the movie musical.

2264
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:05,960
There's a musical reefer madness.

2265
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,960
Oh my God.

2266
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:08,960
I'm not surprised at all.

2267
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,960
Bruce Coville says that.

2268
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,960
Oh, he's, he's very much complaining about, uh, you know, how the, the GOP failed in

2269
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,960
their response to COVID, which is true.

2270
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:22,960
Of course, uh, uh, complaining about Tucker Carlson.

2271
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:23,960
Yeah.

2272
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:24,960
Good.

2273
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:25,960
Good.

2274
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:26,960
You know what?

2275
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:27,960
Keep doing what you're doing.

2276
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:28,960
You're doing a great job.

2277
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:29,960
Yeah.

2278
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:30,960
He's only, he's only got like five.

2279
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:35,960
He's got less followers on Twitter than me, but he's also got like a publishing career.

2280
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:36,960
Oh, get him on PCP.

2281
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,960
Honestly, what if I fucking did?

2282
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,960
What if I fucking did?

2283
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:41,960
Ah.

2284
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:42,960
Oh man.

2285
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:43,960
Oh.

2286
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:44,960
Um, shit.

2287
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,960
Well, I mean, uh, anything, anything else?

2288
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,960
Any other topics for discussion?

2289
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:49,960
I have a swipe sign.

2290
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:50,960
Oh, you don't mind?

2291
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:51,960
I am a.

2292
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,960
What's up?

2293
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,960
So I got a model from Mage for my, uh, for my live 2D and I'm debuting that soon on August

2294
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,960
6th and that's exciting for me.

2295
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:01,960
Fascinating.

2296
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,960
When you say a model for me.

2297
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:07,960
Oh, so, uh, for V tubing, as you know, you got like a, you got the model and then you

2298
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,960
get someone to rig it.

2299
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:14,960
Sometimes you get both and I had been a wanting me to do my model cause I love her art and

2300
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,960
I love her model cause she, she made a new model under REM.

2301
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:19,960
Kaushmar.

2302
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:20,960
Yeah.

2303
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:21,960
Yeah.

2304
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:22,960
Rem.

2305
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:23,960
Rem Kaushmar.

2306
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:24,960
Rem Eleazar.

2307
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:25,960
That's your new model.

2308
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:26,960
Oh, that's right.

2309
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:27,960
You haven't seen it.

2310
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:28,960
I've shown you it off.

2311
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:29,960
I'm in love with it.

2312
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:30,960
Yeah.

2313
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:31,960
Yeah.

2314
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:32,960
It looks man.

2315
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,960
I don't pay attention.

2316
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:34,960
I can tell Mage.

2317
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:35,960
Okay.

2318
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:39,960
I imagine that when she makes this, she has to draw everything on its own layer.

2319
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:40,960
Yeah.

2320
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,960
Right.

2321
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,960
And then you give it to a, the rigor and then you give it to a, the rigor and then

2322
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:51,960
you give it to a, the rigor and the rigor like, you know, programs it or gives it like the

2323
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:52,960
logic of how it.

2324
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:57,960
They pretty much animated the logic of where would it be where your face and eyes are.

2325
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:58,960
Yeah.

2326
01:44:58,960 --> 01:44:59,960
Yeah.

2327
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:00,960
I don't understand the rigging process.

2328
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:01,960
It's confusing.

2329
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,960
The whole, the whole rigging thing.

2330
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:09,960
I like, if you've seen my VTuber, it's, it's like the base, most basic thing of all.

2331
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:14,960
It's just, it opens its mouth when it hears audio and it blinks occasionally.

2332
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:19,960
I, I tried to do the whole rigging thing, but the webcam just can't see my eyes properly.

2333
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:22,960
I try to always be fucked up.

2334
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:27,960
I tried to make and rig a very simple VTuber model and it kind of worked.

2335
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:32,960
Like it pretty much did work except the one thing that I couldn't get it to do was that

2336
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,960
it's eyes were like, it wouldn't track my eyes very well.

2337
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:37,960
Apparently.

2338
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:38,960
And it's pupils were like jittering.

2339
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:41,960
It's pupils were like kind of like jittering and shaking all the time.

2340
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:44,960
I was like, I couldn't figure out how to make it stop doing that.

2341
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:50,960
If you want like eye tracking that doesn't suck, you basically have to have like an

2342
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:55,960
iPhone X or newer and use the iPhone tracking.

2343
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:59,960
Like it has a bunch of hardware on it that you can hook up to.

2344
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:02,960
Like that's what the big VTubers use.

2345
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:08,960
Like they have to use an iPhone because apparently the tech doesn't exist for less than like

2346
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,960
thousands of dollars.

2347
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:16,960
It's just, it's a lot of, it's too much.

2348
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:23,960
I'm going to find a clip of me beating like Hollow Knight and you can see the punk VTube

2349
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,960
thing, how it works.

2350
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,960
And it's just, it works.

2351
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,960
It's really good.

2352
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:30,960
It just works.

2353
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:37,960
And I can press a button to like change the sets of like frames so I can be angry.

2354
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:38,960
I have to go.

2355
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:44,960
It's like a little more involved, but like the barrier to entry has been significantly

2356
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:45,960
lowered.

2357
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:51,960
I feel like most people trying to get into VTubing are like bombarded by so much technical

2358
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,960
and like money stuff.

2359
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:58,960
That's why there's a lot of PNG VTubers, which is pretty nice entry level.

2360
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:04,960
Oh, it's just they just people who like have a picture that lights up and close turns off

2361
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:08,960
while they like get a model ready normally.

2362
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:14,960
Normal VTubers also use that when like, like they don't have a very good rig or they're

2363
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,960
playing like a game, right?

2364
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,960
That's very work intensive and they don't want to have to also be like rendering their

2365
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,960
model and stuff.

2366
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,960
So they'll, they'll have it light up.

2367
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:24,960
Yeah.

2368
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,960
VTuber stuff is interesting.

2369
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,960
It also gets very expensive.

2370
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,960
That's a commission thing.

2371
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:37,960
I mean, I know Mary said that he paid like thousands of dollars for his model and his

2372
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,960
that makes sense.

2373
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:45,960
I've thrown about 900 in for everything.

2374
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:46,960
Yeah.

2375
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,960
Incredible.

2376
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:48,960
Yeah.

2377
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,960
I mean, I can tell how work intensive it must be.

2378
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,960
I mean, and if you're, you know, the rigging processes must be very complicated and like,

2379
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:02,960
you know, it takes like a certain degree of expertise to get it working really, really

2380
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:03,960
well.

2381
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,960
So it's worth it.

2382
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,960
I've seen how the model works.

2383
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:12,960
I'm still like getting everything set up for the debut, but it's like, I'm a super excited.

2384
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:13,960
It looks beautiful.

2385
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:14,960
Hmm.

2386
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:15,960
Hmm.

2387
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:17,960
Based.

2388
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:18,960
Oh, yeah.

2389
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,960
Where, where can we see it?

2390
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,960
I'll drop a link to my Twitch.

2391
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,960
I don't have, I don't have the thing.

2392
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:24,960
Based.

2393
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:27,960
It's not ready yet.

2394
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:31,960
If you give me like a few minutes, I can go pull up the YouTube studio.

2395
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,960
It's still, I still have some bugs.

2396
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,960
I'm at my teacher's working.

2397
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,960
Drop a link to the Twitch.

2398
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,960
Thank you.

2399
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,960
Link your Twitch and when it's ready.

2400
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:42,960
Well, yeah.

2401
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,960
There we go.

2402
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:45,960
There she is.

2403
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:46,960
Hell yeah.

2404
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:47,960
Yeah.

2405
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:50,960
Um, well shit.

2406
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,960
Yeah.

2407
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:52,960
Okay.

2408
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,960
Okay.

2409
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:58,960
Can we talk about how the collab meta is the best meta on YouTube to grow?

2410
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:01,960
No, it's not the best.

2411
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,960
Currently shorts are the best.

2412
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,960
Oh, are there shorts still the best?

2413
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:07,960
What are you talking about?

2414
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:08,960
Shorts are crazy.

2415
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:09,960
You said YouTube?

2416
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:12,960
If you wear shorts, people love this is true.

2417
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:13,960
What?

2418
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:16,960
I don't, I genuinely don't know what any of you were talking about.

2419
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,960
There's a new thing I've seen.

2420
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,960
I don't know much about how good it is, but like you put hashtag shorts in your title

2421
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:27,960
or somewhere and it turns into like a,

2422
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,960
Oh, it's like Tik Tok, right?

2423
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,960
It's like a YouTube Tik Tok.

2424
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:30,960
Yeah.

2425
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:31,960
Tik Tok, Tik Tok asks.

2426
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:34,960
So like it's a normal upload, but it appears as though Tik Tok.

2427
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:39,960
If you're on the mobile app, it, it feels pretty much it's just sort of like 15 seconds

2428
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:40,960
of,

2429
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:41,960
There's a couple of rules.

2430
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:46,960
It has to be less than a minute long and it has to be either a one to one or taller

2431
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,960
aspect ratio.

2432
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,960
And you don't actually have to put hashtag shorts in it.

2433
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,960
Like there's, they're pumping in like extremely old videos.

2434
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,960
We're talking like 13 year old just clips that someone threw up.

2435
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:06,960
They, they didn't put hashtag shorts or anything in, but it's still getting ported in.

2436
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:10,960
And you can get like, it's weird.

2437
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,960
The views you get on it, you're not, you don't get directly paid form from it,

2438
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:19,960
but like the sub gain and just the mere exposure to your channel itself is actually

2439
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:21,960
like, it's rather crazy.

2440
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:25,960
Like if you're willing to put in the work and just make a ton of them.

2441
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:30,960
It's like, that's the meta at the moment because it's new and it's still going.

2442
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,960
Yo, that sucks.

2443
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:34,960
That's cringe.

2444
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:35,960
I hate that.

2445
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:37,960
Just make stuff, make stuff that nobody watches.

2446
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:38,960
It's more fun.

2447
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:39,960
Yeah.

2448
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:40,960
Woo.

2449
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:43,960
That's the PCP way.

2450
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:45,960
God.

2451
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:49,960
I hate when they change platforms.

2452
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:51,960
I hate when things are different.

2453
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:53,960
Oh no, that's just one aspect of it.

2454
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,960
That's just a new thing.

2455
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:58,960
They have so many working parts.

2456
01:50:58,960 --> 01:50:59,960
YouTube is pretty Pog.

2457
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,960
They got so much going on.

2458
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:02,960
That's not Pog.

2459
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:03,960
No, that's not Pog.

2460
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:04,960
Don't call it Pog.

2461
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,960
It's not Pog's friends.

2462
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,960
Ben, let me ask you this.

2463
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,960
Do you know, do you know what's going on with tags nowadays?

2464
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:13,960
No.

2465
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:14,960
Tags?

2466
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:15,960
Look at me.

2467
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,960
Tags?

2468
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:17,960
Who do you think you're talking to?

2469
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,960
Of course I don't know what's going on with tags.

2470
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:22,960
Tags are no longer important, almost at all.

2471
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:23,960
It's all about description.

2472
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:28,960
YouTube now pulls its metadata from the description, the first 10 seconds of the video, and the

2473
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:31,960
title, way more than tags.

2474
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:36,960
Basically, nobody cares about the tags anymore, especially the algorithm.

2475
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,960
You can also detect what is in your thumbnail.

2476
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:42,960
A little rudimentary, a little rudimentary.

2477
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:51,960
Wait, I remember a time where people would, in the description, post a bunch of keywords

2478
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,960
to gain the algorithm that way.

2479
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:57,960
Is that now more effective than it has been?

2480
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:59,960
But that can be a scream.

2481
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:00,960
I'm going to scream.

2482
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:05,960
There's nothing I hate more than fucking YouTube shop talk.

2483
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:08,960
This is why I'm glad that Nate and Digi aren't on tricks.

2484
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,960
This is why I'm glad that Nate and Trixie aren't here anymore, because all they would

2485
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:15,960
ever talk about is YouTube shop talking, how the algorithm works, and tags.

2486
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:16,960
Fuck off.

2487
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:17,960
It's so boring.

2488
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:20,960
This is why we're in logic called Kaiju.

2489
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:21,960
Yeah.

2490
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:22,960
You know what?

2491
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,960
Maybe he was on his own.

2492
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:26,960
Deal.

2493
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:27,960
All right.

2494
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:28,960
I'm sorry.

2495
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:29,960
I had to say it.

2496
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:30,960
Let's continue.

2497
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:31,960
I'll suffer through it.

2498
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:39,960
We've had this conversation so many times, and if anyone cares, they probably already

2499
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:40,960
know.

2500
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,960
It's fine.

2501
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:42,960
It's fine.

2502
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:43,960
It's fine.

2503
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:47,960
I'm just fucking over it.

2504
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:52,960
Don't feel too bad my eyes have already glazed over.

2505
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,960
It's like what?

2506
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,960
Don't feel too bad about it my eyes have already glazed over.

2507
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,960
Hey, I think Gibb's phone just died or something.

2508
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:07,960
No, I was talking over them, so I was silent.

2509
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:08,960
Okay.

2510
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:13,960
No, I was just going to make a joke, and now it's the timing's off.

2511
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:14,960
No, no.

2512
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:15,960
Say it.

2513
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:16,960
No, timing.

2514
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:17,960
No, who cares?

2515
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:18,960
The timing doesn't matter.

2516
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:19,960
All right.

2517
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,960
You know what?

2518
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:21,960
I'll sacrifice the timing.

2519
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:22,960
Okay.

2520
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:26,960
In the future, the way to get YouTube views is you've got to post an image, a thumbnail,

2521
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:31,960
and then that's exactly whatever you'll be doing.

2522
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:32,960
Oh my God.

2523
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:33,960
Ass boy.

2524
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:34,960
Your timing has come.

2525
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:35,960
No.

2526
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,960
So fun fact.

2527
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:38,960
Finally.

2528
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,960
I made this joke in our little private server, but there was a thumbnail, right?

2529
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:48,960
And it was the last thumbnail Kai ever did because he was just done with making thumbnails

2530
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:49,960
and being the editor.

2531
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:55,960
So what he did is he found a one-piece Dozen porn and put it in the thumbnail itself.

2532
01:53:55,960 --> 01:54:01,960
Like, dude, shout out to my boy Bartolomeo Bari.

2533
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:07,960
Don't link it because apparently it's fucking your shit removed.

2534
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:10,960
But he draws some pog-ass porn.

2535
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:11,960
Find him on Twitter.

2536
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:12,960
He's cool.

2537
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,960
But I made the-

2538
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:15,960
You know I will.

2539
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:16,960
I made the joke.

2540
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,960
That was like a virgin PCP.

2541
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:21,960
Links porn in description.

2542
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,960
Gets community strike.

2543
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:24,960
Chad shred it.

2544
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:27,960
Puts porn directly in thumbnail.

2545
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,960
You know, strike.

2546
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:30,960
Yeah.

2547
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:31,960
Yeah, true.

2548
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:34,960
I mean, I don't understand it.

2549
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,960
I don't understand it at all.

2550
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,960
You took it off anyway, you bitch.

2551
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:40,960
Yeah.

2552
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:41,960
The second you said-

2553
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:44,960
The second you guys posted there, you guys got a strike, I was like, all right, we need

2554
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,960
to remove this before it eventually catches up to us.

2555
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:49,960
No, they'll just-

2556
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:50,960
They might get you later.

2557
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,960
Yeah, that was how it was with the shad-based link.

2558
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:53,960
They didn't strike us.

2559
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:54,960
Well, they never struck.

2560
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:55,960
They didn't warn us for it immediately.

2561
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:01,960
It was years or a year or two years after we posted it.

2562
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:05,960
All of a sudden one day we just got a like, this has been removed and you've been issued

2563
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:10,960
a community guidelines warning for having porn, for posting like adult content.

2564
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,960
They're like, oh, okay, I see.

2565
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:19,960
It's like the way YouTube works is that they send out like a shockwave of like new rules

2566
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:24,960
and they're just like robots like call you out for things that were fine before and

2567
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:25,960
now they're not.

2568
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:26,960
Yeah.

2569
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,960
And then some people just get completely fucked in an instant.

2570
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:37,460
One day, one day it'll happen and some rule change at YouTube will mean that my lectures

2571
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:39,960
no longer are monetizable.

2572
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:47,960
And that small trickle of passive income that is just such a treasure will disappear.

2573
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:54,960
And one day, I know one day it'll happen, but I'm just bracing for the shockwave.

2574
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:55,960
No, not today.

2575
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:56,960
Please, not today.

2576
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:01,960
Every time I log into YouTube and look at my analytics, please don't let it be today.

2577
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:04,960
It hasn't come yet, so I'm happy.

2578
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:09,960
I'm waiting for the day that filthy Frank loses his channel.

2579
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:11,960
Oh, retroactively.

2580
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:14,960
He's already lost like most of his videos.

2581
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:19,960
I think they've, I don't know how his channel has been up because it's been more than three

2582
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:24,960
and I gotta imagine each of those is a strike, but YouTube has like been taking them down

2583
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,960
slowly, but surely.

2584
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,960
Sometimes it's not a strike.

2585
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,960
Sometimes they'll remove content, but it's not a strike.

2586
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,960
Yeah, I mean, they did that with us.

2587
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:44,960
That's the end of Ava and Galli or the end of YouTube episode got removed.

2588
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,960
I don't remember why that one got removed, but it's not on the channel anymore.

2589
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,960
I don't think for some reason, but it wasn't a strike.

2590
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:51,960
We didn't get in trouble.

2591
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:53,960
They just deleted it.

2592
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:58,960
Luckily, we've got it on theprocrastinators.com where, oh, by the way, I want to say this,

2593
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,960
people were asking for the MP3s.

2594
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:04,960
We had been posting the episode MP3s in a Google Drive folder.

2595
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:08,960
I'm going to stop listing the Google Drive folder because I don't want to update it anymore.

2596
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,960
And all the MP3s are on the website.

2597
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:15,960
If you go to theprocrastinators.com, we have all the episodes there, including downloadable

2598
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:16,960
and MP3 form.

2599
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:20,960
So from now on, if you want the MP3s, just go get them from the website.

2600
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,960
I don't want to deal with the folder anymore.

2601
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:24,960
There's no point.

2602
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:25,960
There's no reason.

2603
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:31,960
We have a website for sure, but we've just been too lazy to actually upload the episode.

2604
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:38,960
Imagine being the person who edited most of the episodes and then just never getting

2605
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,960
around to making an RSS feed or any of that bullshit.

2606
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:44,960
Someone Zug from RFCK.

2607
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:50,960
Someone from RFCK messaged me the other day, be like, Ben, did you know that the last chapter

2608
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:53,960
of Slime and Punishment is just not up on webtoon?

2609
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:56,960
It's up on Topastic and it's up on your website.

2610
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:03,960
But I just forgot to put the last two chapters, I think, of it on webtoon.

2611
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,960
It's where you just say fuck it.

2612
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,960
Because I don't want to.

2613
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:11,960
I mean, I don't get much traffic on those websites.

2614
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:15,960
There's not really even much reason for it to be there because no one reads it there.

2615
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:18,960
But I guess a few people do and someone was like, hey, why isn't it up there?

2616
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:19,960
Okay.

2617
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:20,960
Yeah.

2618
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:21,960
I just forgot.

2619
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:24,960
I just got lazy to put it there.

2620
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:27,960
I'm the same with The Lord of Ghosts.

2621
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:31,960
I have all of it on Gibbentake.site.

2622
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:37,960
But for Topastic and webtoon, I was updating it initially and it's only the first three

2623
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:40,960
chapters or sets of pages.

2624
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:46,960
The champion did get featured on Topastic one time and it got some views once.

2625
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:53,960
But other than that, my stuff on those comic websites are just double digit views.

2626
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:56,960
It's like, ugh, what's the point?

2627
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:02,960
So for the past six months, I was tasked with creating an RSS feed so we can put our show

2628
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:10,960
on Spotify and I just am lazy and have not.

2629
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:15,960
I am also supposed to be uploading the episodes on our website, but again, I'm lazy.

2630
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:23,960
And a certain hub, a certain p-hub, I'm also supposed to be uploading there as well.

2631
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:24,960
Why?

2632
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:25,960
The toilet?

2633
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:26,960
No.

2634
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:27,960
So what had happened was...

2635
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:28,960
That's base though.

2636
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:33,960
It was funny because I saw a Call of Duty streamer uploading his content there.

2637
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:40,960
I was like, I wonder if I apply to be a p-hub content creator and affiliate with them.

2638
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:41,960
A partner.

2639
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:42,960
I doubt it.

2640
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:43,960
A partner.

2641
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:48,960
I put in the application, hi, we make fun of Reddit.

2642
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:52,960
We're probably going to get mass flagged by Reddit one day and taken down.

2643
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:57,960
We just want to bully Redditors and I got a response immediately approved.

2644
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:04,960
Apparently the guy read my reasoning and said based.

2645
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:06,960
Are you sure they don't just auto-approve everyone?

2646
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,960
I don't see why they wouldn't let you make a porn.

2647
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:14,960
No, because I'm not just uploading stuff on there.

2648
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,960
I have fan club features.

2649
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:20,960
I have like the whole nine yards.

2650
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:25,960
I am a verified content partner.

2651
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:28,960
Well, congratulate a lot, Eda.

2652
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:29,960
Currently p-hub.

2653
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:31,960
I never even made Twitch partner.

2654
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:32,960
That's great.

2655
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:39,960
But yes, I'm supposed to be uploading there as well and I haven't done it in like two months.

2656
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:42,960
Well, I'm sure you'll get around to it.

2657
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,960
We've been going for two hours now.

2658
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,960
We just passed the two hour mark and I feel like we should move on to voicemails soon.

2659
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:54,960
So, I don't know, anyone got anything they want to say real quick before we do that?

2660
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:55,960
Or can we...

2661
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:56,960
Aspoi.

2662
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:57,960
Aspoi.

2663
02:00:57,960 --> 02:00:58,960
You have been quiet.

2664
02:00:58,960 --> 02:00:59,960
Do you have anything you'd like to say?

2665
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,960
Any shredded deep lore that you'd like to get into?

2666
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:06,960
Any wisdom?

2667
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:07,960
Okay.

2668
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:08,960
This is like...

2669
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:09,960
Okay.

2670
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:10,960
I got nothing.

2671
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:11,960
Check this out.

2672
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:12,960
Check this out.

2673
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,960
The first voicemail is not a voicemail.

2674
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:14,960
It is an image.

2675
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:19,960
And here it is.

2676
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:22,960
I like it.

2677
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:23,960
I like it.

2678
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:24,960
It's true.

2679
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,960
It's absolutely...

2680
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:27,960
Also, I'll be honest.

2681
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:30,960
I never really understood this meme.

2682
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:33,960
Like, you've seen this format before, right?

2683
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:34,960
I haven't.

2684
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:42,960
Yeah, I think it's a joke on the Schizophrenics because I know the original is the UN busting

2685
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:47,960
into a room and then a troll face hiding behind a counter going, I hate the Antichrist.

2686
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:49,960
I hate the Antichrist.

2687
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:51,960
So, I think it was a...

2688
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:56,960
Yeah, I don't really get what the format means.

2689
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:58,960
But, I mean, whatever.

2690
02:01:58,960 --> 02:01:59,960
I still like this.

2691
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:00,960
I'm laughing.

2692
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:06,960
I like the fact that I'm not having an episode, but there I am still with dual pistols ready

2693
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:07,960
to shoot.

2694
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:12,960
Is it supposed to be that the person behind the table is having a Schizophrenic episode

2695
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,960
and they're being barged in by...

2696
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:15,960
I think so.

2697
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:16,960
Detain...

2698
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:17,960
Is that what it is?

2699
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:18,960
Okay.

2700
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:19,960
I hate the PC.

2701
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:25,960
It's the cyber pigs or the whatever, the hogs, the whatever, the squeal.

2702
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:28,960
The voicemail ghost pigs up here.

2703
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:31,960
Yes, the scary pigs.

2704
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:32,960
Cool.

2705
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:33,960
Next...

2706
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:34,960
All right, next voicemail.

2707
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:37,960
This one, I will put it in the chat right here.

2708
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:44,960
This one is called Enlightened Skeptics Be Like.

2709
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:45,960
All right.

2710
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:49,960
Let's play it in three, two, one, go.

2711
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:53,960
It's always equal parts funny and infuriating when people who are, say, skeptical of the

2712
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:58,480
validity of trans identities express that idea by saying they don't think gender exists

2713
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:02,320
as a separate concept from sex in the first place because they don't seem to realize how

2714
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:05,680
much broader that statement is than what they intended.

2715
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:10,420
Sex is a classification based on physical characteristics and then gender is just an

2716
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:14,960
umbrella term for the social and internal implications of being ascribed one of those

2717
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:15,960
classifications.

2718
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:18,560
Like, that's how the words are used in academia.

2719
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:24,160
So to dismiss the latter is to suggest either that you don't believe there are any such

2720
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:29,160
implications from being, say, a man or a woman, which is just patently absurd, or that you

2721
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:34,000
don't understand what the word agenda means and you should probably listen to some experts

2722
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,560
on the subject themselves before dismissing it out of pocket.

2723
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:39,560
Yeah.

2724
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:40,560
True.

2725
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:41,560
True.

2726
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:46,560
I agree.

2727
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,280
I was thinking about this.

2728
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:56,240
I was thinking about this this week as, and I thought, because I don't believe the gender

2729
02:03:56,240 --> 02:03:57,240
is real.

2730
02:03:57,240 --> 02:04:02,160
And I was thinking maybe that being the case, maybe the right thing to do, maybe the ethical

2731
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:07,200
thing to do is to be, is to be a they them, no gender.

2732
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:13,440
But then I was like, yeah, maybe, but I kind of just don't want to, I selfishly just don't

2733
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:18,600
want to do that because it sounds hard and like it would be work.

2734
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:22,480
And I would gain no material benefit by doing so.

2735
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:24,480
That is the most base take.

2736
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:25,480
Yes.

2737
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:26,480
I wholeheartedly agree.

2738
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:27,480
Oh, yeah.

2739
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:32,880
My entire issue with the pronoun ish thing is that it is so much work to keep track of

2740
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:33,880
who's do, who's what.

2741
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:34,880
It's literally just easier.

2742
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:35,880
It's just easier.

2743
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:40,400
And I'm like, can I just like, like, I don't care.

2744
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:44,360
I'm literally, I'm literally just not willing to put the work in.

2745
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:45,360
I'm too lazy.

2746
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:52,400
My pronouns are anime and Japanese colloquialism.

2747
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:57,040
That is so brave.

2748
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:58,040
This is awful.

2749
02:04:58,040 --> 02:04:59,540
This is the worst.

2750
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:00,540
Why?

2751
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:01,540
I'm not joking.

2752
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:02,540
I'm not joking.

2753
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:03,540
No.

2754
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:06,840
I don't like it.

2755
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:07,840
I'm cringing.

2756
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:10,280
I don't think gender is real.

2757
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:15,480
So when I say, so when I'm, when I'm a he, I don't think that means anything.

2758
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:18,400
I really don't.

2759
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:22,480
But I'm going to, it's just going to keep doing it because it's easy and I don't, and

2760
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:23,480
I don't care.

2761
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:24,480
Time isn't real either.

2762
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:28,600
It's, it's as real as time, the concept of, it's less real.

2763
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:30,160
We keep track of it though.

2764
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:33,520
Time is, time is more real, I think.

2765
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:34,520
It's money.

2766
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:35,520
No.

2767
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:36,520
It's about this.

2768
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:37,520
It's about as real as money is real.

2769
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:38,520
Well, yeah.

2770
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:39,960
Money is real.

2771
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:45,880
They're all equally like made up by humans for the convenience of living in a society.

2772
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:48,520
We come up with time, money and gender.

2773
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:49,520
Yes.

2774
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,760
We come up with all these things.

2775
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:52,760
Yes.

2776
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:53,760
That's true.

2777
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:54,760
No.

2778
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:55,760
No, I disagree about time.

2779
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:56,760
Yeah.

2780
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:57,760
Time is, time is real.

2781
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:58,760
Yeah.

2782
02:05:58,760 --> 02:05:59,760
Yeah.

2783
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:04,760
No, see, we did invent time because we invented time travel 400 years in the future and then

2784
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:12,760
we went back in time to say, hey, 400 years.

2785
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:17,840
We time traveled to Rome and gave them a modern day calendar and said, here, just base the

2786
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:21,640
months off of your names.

2787
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:27,760
And then we, and then we went back and we gave the Mayans their ziggurats and all kinds

2788
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:28,760
of all kinds.

2789
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:33,760
We went to the Mayans and we said, hey, you want to play an epic prank on people 200,000

2790
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:41,760
of course, and they said, of course we do.

2791
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:46,760
What do you take us for?

2792
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:47,760
Okay.

2793
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:48,760
Next.

2794
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:51,760
I don't really understand what's said, but I'm annoyed now.

2795
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:52,760
Why?

2796
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:53,760
Why are you annoyed?

2797
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:54,760
I don't know.

2798
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:55,760
I'm not joking.

2799
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:56,760
I can't explain.

2800
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:57,760
Okay.

2801
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:04,760
Next voicemail is enlightened skeptics addendum.

2802
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:05,760
Okay.

2803
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:06,760
Uploading.

2804
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:07,760
Okay.

2805
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:08,760
Here we go.

2806
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,760
Three, two, one, go.

2807
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:15,400
I also forgot to say that accepting the academic definition of gender does not preclude you

2808
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:17,760
from thinking trans identities are invalid.

2809
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,440
Like those are separate questions.

2810
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:23,640
It just allows you to articulate that position in a way that is intelligible to people who

2811
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:25,920
actually know the definitions of words.

2812
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:29,600
So really, whether or not you treat it as a sticking point just serves as a litmus test

2813
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:34,920
for whether or not you actually are trying to be informed on the subject.

2814
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:37,920
All right, buddy.

2815
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:38,920
All right, buddy.

2816
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:39,920
Okay.

2817
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:40,920
Calm down.

2818
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:43,920
You all got too much time.

2819
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:45,920
I mean, it's like, I don't disagree.

2820
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,040
I mean, I don't think I'm big brain enough to know what the point he's actually trying

2821
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:51,040
to get across.

2822
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:55,840
But you know, I was, he's as much to do about nothing.

2823
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,400
This is what that was.

2824
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:01,760
I feel, I feel, I feel like the first voicemail was sufficient.

2825
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:08,520
Now, I'm just thinking about like the way that I have to defend my existence all the

2826
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:09,520
time.

2827
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:10,520
It's just, it's exhausting.

2828
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:11,520
So I don't like it.

2829
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,520
Yeah.

2830
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:15,160
No, I'm annoyed by the whole, by everything.

2831
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:18,040
I'm, I'm sure, I'm sure it is.

2832
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:25,800
You know, I mean, people, snow snowflakes, snowflakes cringe about like, oh, I'm gonna

2833
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:30,080
They, they make us, they make us memorize their pronouns.

2834
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:32,880
Oh, they make us use different pronouns.

2835
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:38,720
And I'm like, how it's calling someone else pronouns is so easy compared to like, imagine

2836
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:43,240
if you had to be like, Hey, actually, you know, I prefer they them, you know, actually

2837
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:46,280
I don't, I'm not a, I'm not a boy.

2838
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:47,280
Please don't call me he, him.

2839
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,280
I don't like it.

2840
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:49,280
That's not, that's sad.

2841
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:50,280
Yeah.

2842
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:52,320
Where you have to, you have to remember to like correct people.

2843
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:53,320
I'd forget that so.

2844
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:55,360
As a certain point, yeah, I just gave up sometimes.

2845
02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:06,400
Yeah, it sounds really, really hard and like irritating and like, I'm glad, I guess I'm

2846
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:12,720
glad, I'm glad that I don't feel, I'm glad that I don't feel uncomfortable being a he,

2847
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:20,680
him or whatever that, that I'm like, feel like I need to make the effort to like, I need,

2848
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:23,120
I need to do something, but I need to correct this.

2849
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:24,120
It's not a problem.

2850
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:27,720
I guess, I guess what's annoying me about this whole just thinking about all this is

2851
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:36,880
that I, like it, like I similarly find it an annoyance to change things, but not changing

2852
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:39,560
them causes me pain mentally.

2853
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:46,240
So I'm like, okay, well now my whole life, like being trans and transitioning is so fucking

2854
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:50,720
like time intensive and stressful in and of itself, just all of the stuff you need to

2855
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:51,720
do.

2856
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:52,720
Yeah.

2857
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:56,000
Or like, you know, it's not like the same for everyone, but the stuff you feel like you

2858
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,120
need to do all the stuff that would make you feel better.

2859
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:03,760
It's a whole lot of extra stuff you have to take care of now.

2860
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,520
I would prefer to just be comfortable with how I was before.

2861
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:10,640
It's so much easier and I just, it's annoying.

2862
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:16,640
I, I of course, as a cis person have no room to talk on anything, but I have a lot of respect

2863
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:21,920
for trans people because it, I'd imagine the amount of like work and mental stress it is

2864
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:23,720
just to change everything like that.

2865
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:27,880
No, I mean, of course it's for a good cause to feel more comfortable in your skin, but

2866
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:32,800
I just respect the amount of dedication and hard work it takes to get to a point where

2867
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:36,280
you're happy.

2868
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:41,320
It just really annoys me when there's like, you know, the whole like, oh, you're pretending.

2869
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:45,280
Like if I really was pretending, why would I put myself through all this?

2870
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:47,480
Hard work and I'm lazy.

2871
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:49,480
Yeah, I want to do it.

2872
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:58,600
Uh, I mean, I mean, yeah, exactly, uh, uh, it's the, I don't know, since, since I don't,

2873
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:02,960
since I, since I understand that it is all a social construction.

2874
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:06,560
I'm like, well, you can't ever, everyone's pretending.

2875
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:10,520
Every, every gender is just a game of make believe.

2876
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:16,200
That's where I'm like, I'll just, I just, I just fucking, I'll make myself a girl

2877
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:18,120
out long hair, we fine.

2878
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:22,320
Where would I want to fucking have stuffed animals if I want to be shit?

2879
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:23,000
Fuck you.

2880
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:25,400
That's my standpoint.

2881
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:25,920
That's the.

2882
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:30,600
Are we ready to go to the next one?

2883
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:33,960
Okay.

2884
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:35,680
Next one is call.

2885
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:36,880
Next one is Janess.

2886
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,800
Three, two, one, go.

2887
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:43,800
The earlier PCP episodes taught me how to become a productive artist.

2888
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:50,440
How the later PCP episodes, especially the last 20 or so, taught me how to be a

2889
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:51,240
more patient.

2890
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:56,080
I mean, I'm glad you're getting something out of it.

2891
02:11:56,080 --> 02:12:00,880
I don't, I would pause it that maybe roast it, maybe it's.

2892
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:04,480
Oh, I guess that is a roast is a roast.

2893
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:07,680
I guess that, I guess that is, or I didn't even catch it, but it's, it's a bit of a

2894
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:08,400
roast.

2895
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:10,200
10 out of 10.

2896
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:10,640
I don't know.

2897
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:12,320
I don't know if that's the intention though.

2898
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:15,320
Well, what does, what does patient artist mean though?

2899
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:22,920
Like, like being patient, like it would be a roast if they said the newer ones, you

2900
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:28,160
know, they make me teach me how to be patient, like implying that we do things too

2901
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:31,520
slow or whatever, but they're talking about their own artistic endeavors.

2902
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:31,920
So I don't know.

2903
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:33,000
That's what I took it as.

2904
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:33,760
That means.

2905
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,280
Um, it.

2906
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:38,840
I don't know.

2907
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:43,200
I honestly, if I don't know how we're making you more patient, I would, if you're

2908
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:47,680
becoming more patient, I would pause it that maybe, maybe it's coming from inside

2909
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:50,160
yourself and it has nothing to do with us.

2910
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:54,880
Uh, uh, no, uh, take credit.

2911
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:57,800
Always take credit even, even when not deserved.

2912
02:12:59,280 --> 02:12:59,840
You're right.

2913
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:01,960
When someone asks you, are you even when it's bad?

2914
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:04,240
Ever.

2915
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:07,040
First thing anyone wants to know is who is responsible for this?

2916
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:08,360
Never take responsibility.

2917
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:12,200
Uh, why is it?

2918
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:16,640
Simsie says God tier starter voicemail and CC says no.

2919
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:18,160
Why?

2920
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:23,520
There is this, this, this episode is in its recording phase and there is already an

2921
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:24,960
argument in the comments.

2922
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:28,280
I don't, I don't know what, I don't know why they're arguing.

2923
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:33,200
The next one is called question about Jojo's bizarre adventure.

2924
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:34,640
Three, two, one, go.

2925
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:36,320
Is Jojo good?

2926
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:36,960
Yes.

2927
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,200
Jojo is one.

2928
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:39,000
Sure, Jojo.

2929
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:41,560
No, I've only seen the only good.

2930
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:42,920
So that's the only one I can really.

2931
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:44,800
Okay.

2932
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:46,440
I didn't even finish it.

2933
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:47,480
I watched like half of it.

2934
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:49,400
Oh, it was good.

2935
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:49,920
I liked it.

2936
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:50,360
That's good.

2937
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:56,320
Uh, Jojo is weird because it's the only, it's one of the only series that I could

2938
02:13:56,320 --> 02:14:01,480
think of where they make the German Nazi party explicitly, the Nazi party, the good

2939
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:03,520
guys and nobody gave a shit.

2940
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:10,520
The anime came out in 2014 for part two and everyone was just like, oh, the Nazis

2941
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:11,400
are the good guys.

2942
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:13,320
They are the heroes in this show.

2943
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:16,920
Oh, babe, I don't understand.

2944
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:19,920
You were fighting, it's the Nazis in the Undead Vampires.

2945
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:21,560
Well, naturally we're with the Nazis.

2946
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:21,920
Got it.

2947
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:26,360
Oh, I think Simsie and CeCe are arguing about whether Jojo is good.

2948
02:14:26,360 --> 02:14:27,400
I think that's what they're.

2949
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:28,680
Oh, it started.

2950
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:35,800
They're having their own text based podcast in tandem with this one.

2951
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:40,760
Only there were only we are privy to if only, man, someone should invent the text

2952
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:41,760
based part.

2953
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:48,600
It's just like, it's just like one of those old school video games where you

2954
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:51,760
type in a walk to the door and then it says you walk to the door.

2955
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:56,840
The next point is the type of listen to podcast.

2956
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:58,080
You listen to the podcast.

2957
02:14:58,120 --> 02:15:01,760
And it starts you hear bad Jojo and then you type done at the end and that's the

2958
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:07,080
end. The next voicemail is called Mohammed three, two, one, go.

2959
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,880
Mohane.

2960
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:13,400
Mohane and the Hades.

2961
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:14,880
That was amazing.

2962
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:18,720
I'm blown away.

2963
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:23,920
Next voicemail is called Violet Neon.

2964
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:26,960
He they minute 20.

2965
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:27,720
Jesus.

2966
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:29,360
What did we say about long voicemails?

2967
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:31,160
Three, two, one, go.

2968
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:34,760
Kill the code to comrades given saint.

2969
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:38,560
Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble, but I run the game DevCorp in Wellington

2970
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:40,520
and I just thought for a couple of quick tips.

2971
02:15:41,480 --> 02:15:43,920
Number one, cops are pretty easy to implement into a

2972
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:46,000
pre-consisting limited liability structure.

2973
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:49,720
Most of the time it just involves updating your company's constitution to align

2974
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:51,120
with a company's act regulation.

2975
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:56,120
I translate and how your nominal share value I would translate if this motherfucker

2976
02:15:56,120 --> 02:16:00,400
wasn't speaking at an average volume of negative 40 fucking decibels.

2977
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:03,680
Dude, are you kidding me with this?

2978
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:08,320
You're going to put all this effort into just this crazy long whatever the fuck

2979
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:12,800
you're doing and then I can't even hear you because you're like you're lower

2980
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,080
than like my room noise.

2981
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:16,120
What in the hell are you doing?

2982
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:19,720
Is he is he is he responding to something that I genuinely don't know

2983
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:21,960
a cop or finding one to participate in?

2984
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:24,120
Well, who cares about that?

2985
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:31,120
Wait, give is called a piece so she can listen to it.

2986
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:35,480
I don't I don't know.

2987
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:36,520
We're we're moving on.

2988
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:38,840
We give now we're moving on.

2989
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:40,680
We're moving on.

2990
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:42,520
No, no.

2991
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:43,560
Next one is called.

2992
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:45,920
Next one is called PCP bad comments.

2993
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:47,600
Oh, we can't do this one without give.

2994
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:48,560
Give your back.

2995
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:51,760
We stop. We stop listening because it was a bad was it good?

2996
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:56,360
Well, it was about forming a co-op.

2997
02:16:56,360 --> 02:16:59,720
I don't know whether he was talking about like us as comic creators

2998
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:02,080
or a podcast or something.

2999
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:05,200
It sounded like it sounded like he was talking about programming stuff.

3000
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:07,880
Oh, well, then I completely have no idea.

3001
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:12,040
I could have listened to the voicemail in all this time, but I'm not sorry

3002
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:14,000
that I get louder next time.

3003
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,440
I couldn't fucking hear it.

3004
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:16,640
Piece of shit.

3005
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:18,720
I don't know.

3006
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:19,800
You got it together.

3007
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:22,200
Audio levels between negative twelve and negative six.

3008
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:23,720
Don't at me.

3009
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:24,760
It was also quiet.

3010
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:26,760
It had it had that as an issue as well.

3011
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,640
Next one is called PCP bad comments.

3012
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:32,520
A word show number two hundred sixty nine.

3013
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:35,480
Three nice three, two, one, go.

3014
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:43,880
Hello, I'm the comment critic.

3015
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:46,560
I find bad comments and then shove them in your face.

3016
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:51,240
And there weren't any particularly bad comments on episode two hundred sixty

3017
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:52,880
nine of the PCP.

3018
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:56,240
Sure, there was some assorted bad advice and work life balance and low

3019
02:17:56,240 --> 02:18:00,560
effort non-statements and lamenting to the void about departed PCP members.

3020
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:01,920
But nothing with that oomph.

3021
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:05,400
Nothing that makes you feel, wow, that was a shitty comment.

3022
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:10,240
So I'll just be using this opportunity to give a lifetime achievement award.

3023
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:13,440
Put your hands together for S.H.C.W.

3024
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:15,840
No, Nate, no, watch.

3025
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:16,800
See you next week.

3026
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:18,160
Classic. Well, you've earned it.

3027
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:20,280
Well deserves well deserves.

3028
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:24,360
I would be really curious on what this guy picked as the worst comment

3029
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:27,240
for the Merle logic episode.

3030
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:29,280
He wasn't doing them back then.

3031
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:33,760
So he he only he started doing this maybe like a month ago.

3032
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:37,560
So yeah, although I think he might work backwards.

3033
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,800
I'd be curious about that, too.

3034
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:43,720
If you if you listen in, please get the worst comment on that video.

3035
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:48,360
I heard Merle logic replied to every single comment religiously.

3036
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:50,520
Yes, he did. He did.

3037
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:53,240
Yeah, he was amazing.

3038
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:59,040
He's a what goes on in that man's mind is is is a mystery.

3039
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:05,920
Next voicemail is called unauthorized made tapes.

3040
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:08,320
Number four, M.A.Y.D.E.

3041
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:11,720
tapes. Number four, three, two, one, go.

3042
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:15,760
I always grab my stick when an earthquake.

3043
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:21,040
And my hand automatically strokes.

3044
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:25,080
I feel as if I have sex with the earth.

3045
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:29,560
The fear takes away.

3046
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:31,120
This is crazy.

3047
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:32,000
This is crazy.

3048
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,640
Wow. Chad Chad.

3049
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:34,720
She is relatable.

3050
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:38,920
No, no, no, he looks he goes to his group of friends and his guys.

3051
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:39,920
Guess what goes?

3052
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:41,520
I just had sex with the earth.

3053
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:44,160
See you later, virgins.

3054
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:46,920
This is this is this is I wish my hope.

3055
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:49,320
I dig my dick gets big as the Eiffel Tower

3056
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:51,920
so I can fuck the world for seventy two hours, right?

3057
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:53,720
Isn't that a Kanye?

3058
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:55,680
I know it's a lyric.

3059
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:58,120
I don't know if it's like it might not be Kanye.

3060
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:00,680
I don't it might not be Kanye, but it's someone.

3061
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:02,720
It's definitely said by a person.

3062
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:08,360
Hold on, remember, I like the idea that during an earthquake,

3063
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:12,200
usually you have to try and like, oh, I've got to be safe.

3064
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:16,280
Nah, I'm going to wrap my hand around my dick.

3065
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:21,560
So the weather, the weather, the weather told me not to crumble below me.

3066
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:22,880
Yeah, around me.

3067
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:24,680
The building collapses.

3068
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:28,280
Still go shredded research department has reached out to us

3069
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:31,400
and it's informed us it is a Kendrick Lamar freestyle.

3070
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:34,200
OK, Kendrick Lamar.

3071
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:37,640
All right, I am of ignorance.

3072
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:47,720
Next voicemail is unauthorized, made tapes number five, three, two, one, go.

3073
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:55,080
I went to take a piss while still wearing my microphone.

3074
02:20:55,800 --> 02:21:00,720
And the whole conference heard me call the year and all

3075
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:03,000
a thirsty boy.

3076
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:09,840
Oh, that was god to you.

3077
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:15,800
R. Kelly, I hope the microphone also had that effect on it.

3078
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:17,920
Yeah, it was auto tuned in.

3079
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:20,160
He just does a conference like their business meeting.

3080
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:21,560
R. Kelly be like, I'm trying.

3081
02:21:21,560 --> 02:21:24,200
I'm trying to use gender neutral pronouns when I don't know.

3082
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:29,800
Yes, the whole conference heard them thirsty, boy.

3083
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:31,600
I can't do it. I can't figure it out.

3084
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,320
R. Kelly be like.

3085
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:41,120
OK, next one is unauthorized, made tapes number six.

3086
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:42,560
Let's let's finish them off.

3087
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:44,880
Three, two, one, go.

3088
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:46,640
Whoopie, the scoop.

3089
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:47,960
Scoop, they do.

3090
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:49,920
Whoop, they scoop, they do.

3091
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:51,520
Face and gamer peeled.

3092
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:52,680
I have learned a lot.

3093
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:57,440
That was definitely the most informative of that was like Joe Joe.

3094
02:21:57,440 --> 02:21:58,840
Part two was the best part.

3095
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:02,960
That was the best trilogy ever made by God.

3096
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:07,600
I appreciate it.

3097
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:09,080
Earthquake pissing neck.

3098
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:11,080
The whoop.

3099
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:13,560
Next one is called.

3100
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:16,600
It's another gen S three, two, one, go.

3101
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:20,920
If you want to understand capitalism and socialism in a more

3102
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:25,040
easy to understand way, then I recommend the YouTube channel.

3103
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:29,040
Second thought, I recently discovered him and he explained

3104
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:36,400
current events in a easily accessible mainstream way, not the academic jogging.

3105
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:39,960
So I recommend that you watch him sometime.

3106
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,000
Second thought.

3107
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,120
Oh, he's big. He's a million.

3108
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:44,640
He's a million sub boy.

3109
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:46,640
There are a million sub person.

3110
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:49,920
They need the shout out or such a big penis.

3111
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:52,480
I don't know.

3112
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:54,440
I don't know. I'd never heard of him.

3113
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:59,520
OK, consider second thought plugged, recommended.

3114
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:03,520
Next one is, yes, it's true.

3115
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:05,720
Next one is called.

3116
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:06,560
Here we go.

3117
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:10,960
How to discord bot three, two, one, go.

3118
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:15,720
So discord bot is sort of like a Minecraft server.

3119
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:20,280
It's an actual program you have to have running on a machine somewhere.

3120
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:24,400
So you can run it on your own machine or you can get like the free cheap.

3121
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:29,000
Oh, AWS, I don't remember why we're talking about discord or something like that.

3122
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:32,440
But it just has to run on some machine that has internet access.

3123
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:37,520
OK, I did vaguely remember the reason the making the bot was difficult

3124
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:41,480
was because it only works when my computer is on, otherwise I need a server.

3125
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:42,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3126
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:44,400
To be running it.

3127
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:48,920
I had, yeah, I ran into that issue as well when I when I was still thinking

3128
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:53,040
that I could I could run endless war, I could build it all myself well now.

3129
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:56,680
Oh, no, that was because when it during endless war,

3130
02:23:56,680 --> 02:23:58,920
I was running bots that were the mega slimes.

3131
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:02,000
Like every time someone made a mega slime, I would make a new bot

3132
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:06,240
that was a mega slime and it would be like an NPC bot

3133
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:07,960
that was running in a certain server.

3134
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:09,960
But they would disappear when my computer was offline

3135
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:14,080
because I had to keep my computer running or the bots would stop running.

3136
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:18,200
And it was a big that's why I stopped doing that is because, well,

3137
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:20,600
I don't want to fucking keep my computer running

3138
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:25,160
and I don't want to fucking pay for server space for these totally inert bots.

3139
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:30,080
And also slime inflation is happening and millions of slime are no longer a lot of slut.

3140
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:34,320
So, you know, the issue solved by the way,

3141
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:38,800
if any Chad listener wants to send a voicemail

3142
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:43,200
or comment on how to create an RSSV, too lazy to look it up.

3143
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:48,160
Bruh, it would be appreciated.

3144
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:50,480
I don't understand RSS.

3145
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:56,320
I've been for years, like websites have like an RSS button.

3146
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:58,600
It's like, oh, yes, subscribe to our RSS feed.

3147
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:02,200
And I I have no I mean, do people still use it?

3148
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:03,760
I use RSS feeds.

3149
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:07,280
It is only used, I think, by the majority of people to get their show

3150
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:11,000
on Spotify and iTunes because that is the only requirement to get on them

3151
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:14,640
to get on their platforms is what is an RSS feed?

3152
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,040
Well, shit, we're on iTunes.

3153
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:21,520
Really stupid system is what it is on iTunes.

3154
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:23,040
So we must have an RSS.

3155
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:25,480
No, well, iTunes changed that before.

3156
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:27,640
It was you had to sign up and that was it.

3157
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:30,600
Now you have to have an RSS feed.

3158
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:36,480
RSS feed is just is just like a word document that it pulls updates from.

3159
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:43,200
And then it's just different programs will just read that document

3160
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,680
and then be able to port in episodes of stuff.

3161
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:47,200
It's that's all it is.

3162
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:49,560
So you know how to you know what they are.

3163
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:51,000
I assume you know how to make one.

3164
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,120
Why don't we have one?

3165
02:25:52,120 --> 02:25:54,720
Kai had this conversation many, many times.

3166
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:56,720
I am even lazier than you.

3167
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:02,480
We'll try to ever be on Spotify.

3168
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:04,480
Find out never.

3169
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:08,440
No, probably not.

3170
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:10,680
OK, next next voicemail.

3171
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:11,520
I already put it there.

3172
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:15,960
It's called its PCP bad comment award show number 270.

3173
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:20,160
And by the way, 269 was the Hollow Knight and Lord of Ghost Kickstarter

3174
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:23,640
episode 270 was Vax Millions.

3175
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:26,600
I'm pretty sure it was the Vax Millions.

3176
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:27,920
Yes, episode. So here we go.

3177
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:29,640
Three, two, one, go.

3178
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:32,040
Kramer, are you the one who wrote this comment?

3179
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:33,240
What comment, Jerry?

3180
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:34,600
What are you talking about?

3181
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:36,920
This comment on my podcast, it's terrible.

3182
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:39,200
It's the worst comment on this episode.

3183
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:40,800
Well, what's to say?

3184
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:43,400
Give funding in an even more than usual this episode.

3185
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:45,320
The Patreon can't run dry fast enough.

3186
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:46,120
Let the dog die.

3187
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:47,640
Can't you hear its pain?

3188
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:49,880
No, Jerry, why would I say something like that?

3189
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:51,240
I don't know, Kramer.

3190
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:54,480
Why did you threaten to lynch an audience member at the Laugh Factory?

3191
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:56,800
Oh, come on, Jerry.

3192
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:58,640
That was a long time ago.

3193
02:26:58,640 --> 02:26:59,520
Uh huh.

3194
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:05,280
It's like I'm there watching the episode.

3195
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:09,120
You know, I mean, that's a that's a mean comment,

3196
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:11,920
but I wouldn't say it's a bad comment.

3197
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:15,320
I mean, I guess it's bad because it's you agree with it.

3198
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:18,880
I do. I mean, I, you know, he's he makes a strong argument.

3199
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:20,720
But you know what I mean, there's different.

3200
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:24,480
It's it's it's not it's not like a stupid comment

3201
02:27:24,480 --> 02:27:26,160
that is like pointless or annoying.

3202
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:27,960
Like, I don't obviously don't like it

3203
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:30,520
because it expresses an opinion contrary to my own.

3204
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:35,800
But in terms of like it does exactly what it was trying to do.

3205
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:39,160
So I don't know if I would call that a bad comment per se.

3206
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:42,440
Well, the argument is silly, isn't it?

3207
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:45,320
Like they don't like the show anymore.

3208
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:46,720
And so we should delete it.

3209
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:48,840
That's always been the stupid like he.

3210
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:52,160
Why would we stop it if we don't mind continuing?

3211
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:54,640
Well, I think it's a little more than that

3212
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:57,080
because he doesn't say stop doing the show.

3213
02:27:57,160 --> 02:28:00,120
He says that he hopes that our Patreon runs dry.

3214
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:01,840
He he wishes ill upon us.

3215
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:05,040
He hopes the show loses all its support and is destroyed.

3216
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:08,640
And as someone who wishes ill on my enemies,

3217
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:13,680
I I can understand where he's coming from.

3218
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:17,160
I have to respect it.

3219
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:20,160
I have no choice.

3220
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:22,880
But fair, I understand the selection.

3221
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:25,640
Um, next voicemail.

3222
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:27,960
I haven't put it in the here.

3223
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:29,520
Here we go. There it is.

3224
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:34,040
It is called flanged silicone three, two, one go.

3225
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:38,400
Does anyone else think that the flanged

3226
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:42,040
Ben icon on Twitter looks kind of like a butt plug?

3227
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:44,200
I think about it every time I see it.

3228
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:49,760
I have a friend who wants to know where to get

3229
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:53,920
a flanged Ben brand of butt plug and maybe some keto lubricant.

3230
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:57,480
That's really hard to say.

3231
02:28:57,480 --> 02:28:59,040
There you go.

3232
02:28:59,040 --> 02:28:59,920
There you go.

3233
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:01,360
I don't. There you go, Aspoye.

3234
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:03,680
There's a good thumbnail.

3235
02:29:07,240 --> 02:29:08,760
I've almost done with it.

3236
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:10,640
I can't start over now.

3237
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:13,680
Fortunately, by the time we listen to this,

3238
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,640
I have already changed it.

3239
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:18,960
I'm no longer flanged Ben on Twitter.

3240
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:20,280
Just in time.

3241
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:21,720
I think I think this is the point

3242
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:23,920
when you know that it's run its course.

3243
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:25,960
So I did it.

3244
02:29:26,320 --> 02:29:31,600
OK, next voicemail is called rest in podcast three, two, one go.

3245
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:37,200
PC poopers, it's been a week and there's no soda.

3246
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:40,280
Yep, I know it's 1 a.m.

3247
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:42,560
And there's no episode PC poopers.

3248
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:43,960
Where is it?

3249
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:46,480
I've already explained, but your confusion is.

3250
02:29:46,480 --> 02:29:48,120
Where is it?

3251
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:52,000
Hopefully now, you know, just just just disappointment.

3252
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,800
I mean, where is the episode?

3253
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:58,200
Why? I explain this on Twitter.

3254
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:00,800
You couldn't say.

3255
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:03,400
If you if you don't know what's going on with the thing,

3256
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:06,560
you just got to check one of check my Twitter alpha.

3257
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:08,440
And that's that's my advice.

3258
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:13,120
But now, you know, OK, sorry to cause you such grief.

3259
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:16,640
Next voicemail is called tarbuck transom,

3260
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:20,480
the fan pilled hot pocket three, two, one go.

3261
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:24,000
So at Archway six, a.k.a.

3262
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,280
our apartment, the air conditioner is really loud.

3263
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:28,160
Just constantly remind the surfs that they live

3264
02:30:28,160 --> 02:30:29,800
in a state of perpetual wealth extraction.

3265
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:32,720
And that means that if I want to record anything downstairs,

3266
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:33,840
I have to turn it off.

3267
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:37,440
Well, I had forgotten to turn it back on when I went upstairs

3268
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:39,960
to do computer things for the next 12 to 14 hours.

3269
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:42,280
And I noticed that getting a little warm.

3270
02:30:42,280 --> 02:30:44,200
So I switched on the new nine inch fan.

3271
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:46,120
I illicitly acquired hashtag shop.

3272
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:50,560
And it was surprisingly effective at keeping me cool to the point

3273
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:52,800
where I didn't even notice until the following morning

3274
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:54,840
that I didn't turn the air con back on.

3275
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:58,160
It costs less to operate and it works way better than I thought it would.

3276
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:02,320
Kind of makes it seem like spending a bunch of money and energy

3277
02:31:02,320 --> 02:31:06,120
to cool the entire air mass is a little bit wasteful.

3278
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:07,440
What do you guys think?

3279
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:10,440
Don't don't tell me that a fan works as well as an air conditioner.

3280
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:13,440
I keep my house at 64 degrees, sir.

3281
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:15,560
A fan is not going to do it.

3282
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:17,360
No, no, no, no.

3283
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:19,520
If you're really hot and you need to cool off,

3284
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:23,440
the best thing to do is to put your face near a toilet and flush it

3285
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:27,080
so that the cool air blows on you.

3286
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:29,320
That's a reference to my shredding episode.

3287
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:30,800
That was one of the posts.

3288
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:33,360
You just need to go to your local amusement park,

3289
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:35,160
stick your head in the toilet and flush.

3290
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:37,080
It works. Go to the.

3291
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:39,480
It's just refreshing.

3292
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:42,440
I will say, though, there is a fan.

3293
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:46,920
It's at Best Buy and I have been thinking of grabbing one myself.

3294
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:50,360
You take your own implication,

3295
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:52,560
but it doesn't have a spinning spamblade.

3296
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:55,840
What it does is it has a it has a hole in the back,

3297
02:31:56,240 --> 02:32:00,960
oval hole that vacuums in air and then hits it with a freon coil

3298
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,920
and then shoots it out the other side.

3299
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:05,120
So it's technically a fan,

3300
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:08,520
but it's like a glorified air conditioning and it's cheaper than an air

3301
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:12,280
conditioner and it's sometimes better because you could just point it at you

3302
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:15,800
when you're really hot and it's like, well, the whole room's not cool,

3303
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:17,560
but I feel better.

3304
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:18,960
It sounds pretty.

3305
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:20,440
It sounds pretty poggers.

3306
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:23,960
Yeah, if it were, it just sounds like a many air conditioner.

3307
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:25,760
Yeah, kind of just.

3308
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:27,240
Isn't that what an air conditioner is?

3309
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:28,480
It's just an air conditioner.

3310
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:31,000
It's just called a fan because it's shaped like a fan.

3311
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:35,800
You would an air conditioner has to have somewhere for like an air conditioner.

3312
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:38,920
Yeah, hold on.

3313
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:41,480
I'll post a picture of what I'm talking about.

3314
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:45,080
They are very expensive.

3315
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:50,520
The OK, Dyson Humid.

3316
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:53,600
No, wait, does that mean it's not cost effective then?

3317
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:54,840
Wait, yeah.

3318
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:56,760
Is it more expensive than an air conditioner?

3319
02:32:57,120 --> 02:32:59,200
Jesus, holy shit.

3320
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:01,120
Where? Where? Where does the hot air go?

3321
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:02,280
That is an air conditioner.

3322
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,800
Where does the hot air go?

3323
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:05,120
I don't know how it works.

3324
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:07,080
There's no physical fan.

3325
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:08,280
I think it is.

3326
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:10,000
Is it literally just a is it literally?

3327
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:12,120
I mean, I mean, I've wait.

3328
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:15,240
I've seen these like air like holes.

3329
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:18,240
I've seen these like holes that blow air without blades.

3330
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:20,240
I know these are. Oh, wait, no, these suck.

3331
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:21,000
Yeah, these suck.

3332
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:24,280
These are. I think this is a different product than fans for the money.

3333
02:33:24,280 --> 02:33:25,240
I've never used one of these.

3334
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:26,760
I think this is specifically for like.

3335
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:28,080
They're louder.

3336
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:30,080
They're louder than rotary fans.

3337
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:35,360
They take more electricity and they don't significantly increase the cooling.

3338
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:37,920
It's just more. It's just more worse.

3339
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:39,920
It's just eight hundred dollars.

3340
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:42,400
Uh, it looks funny.

3341
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:43,280
It looks. But that's it.

3342
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:45,800
It does look fancy.

3343
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:46,680
The next OK.

3344
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:48,280
The next voicemail.

3345
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:51,240
I already posted it there above the the Dyson link.

3346
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,160
It's called. Well, it comes with this link to.

3347
02:33:56,360 --> 02:34:01,680
GitHub audacity and its air actions we propose to take on the PR number

3348
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:04,120
eight, three, five, three, five.

3349
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:10,600
Subsequences of it's like a technical issue about audacity, whatever.

3350
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:12,640
OK, voicemail. Here we go.

3351
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:14,800
Three, two, one, go.

3352
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:18,840
Remember when the developers for audacity had the audacity

3353
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:20,640
to announce a telemetry update?

3354
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:24,240
Well, there was such an overwhelming backlash to the telemetry update

3355
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:27,240
that they responded, fine, guys, no telemetry.

3356
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:29,520
Jesus, shut up.

3357
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:30,200
We did it.

3358
02:34:30,200 --> 02:34:31,160
Bling works.

3359
02:34:31,160 --> 02:34:32,200
Bash the bash.

3360
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:33,320
This has been tarmac transom.

3361
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:35,080
You are beacon of truth in the dark.

3362
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:36,000
I don't know what's a limit.

3363
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,480
OK, so basically I got the rundown.

3364
02:34:38,480 --> 02:34:40,640
I don't have to use. I don't have to use.

3365
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:43,680
So audacity released an update

3366
02:34:44,480 --> 02:34:47,720
where they said they will do three things and you have to agree

3367
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:51,040
to these three things to continue to use audacity's newest version.

3368
02:34:51,800 --> 02:34:56,800
First of all, anything you recorded will get will get stored as data

3369
02:34:56,800 --> 02:34:59,920
and possibly be sent to law enforcement if requested.

3370
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:06,120
OK, number two, they reserve the right to listen to any data

3371
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:08,480
that you record using audacity.

3372
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:11,160
Oh, this is that audacity spying on you thing

3373
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:13,240
that oblivion false that is not real.

3374
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:14,680
Well, it's in their terms of service.

3375
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:16,560
So, yeah.

3376
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:19,560
And the third most important thing that pissed a lot of people off

3377
02:35:19,560 --> 02:35:23,000
was it said that, oh, we can also sell any data we keep.

3378
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:26,120
So any date.

3379
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:29,120
Yeah, so they could sell your recordings without your permission

3380
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:31,080
if you use the newest version of audacity,

3381
02:35:31,080 --> 02:35:33,920
at least in their terms of service, who knows if they'd actually do it?

3382
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:39,080
Oh, OK.

3383
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:43,240
Should surely data means like analytics about what you record,

3384
02:35:43,240 --> 02:35:45,360
not literal recordings of your voice.

3385
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:47,560
I mean, that's a fun thing about these.

3386
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:50,800
No, that's what that's what oblivion false said.

3387
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:53,400
It's like it's not recording you and sending the data.

3388
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:57,120
Some if that would be a lot of data, it's just it's recording like.

3389
02:35:57,480 --> 02:36:00,520
Yeah, when you use audacity files are fucking gigantic.

3390
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:03,480
Yeah, it can't it can't be sending your like.

3391
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:06,880
Yeah, your whole audacity file.

3392
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:10,200
OK, I honestly, I don't really care about this.

3393
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:16,120
Next voicemail is is called my anti gay agenda.

3394
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:18,800
Only straight people can know.

3395
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:23,640
Oh, I hope three, two, one, go.

3396
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:31,640
Oh, I can't make a really interesting point.

3397
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:34,960
You on? Oh, shit.

3398
02:36:35,360 --> 02:36:38,040
You know, did you guys agree?

3399
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:41,120
Yeah, they they made a really persuasive argument

3400
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:44,960
back to my facts and data can't can't can't agree more.

3401
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:49,360
This this this guy should this guy should to have a fucking podcast.

3402
02:36:49,360 --> 02:36:50,960
This guy should be on this guy.

3403
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:53,160
The voice is very deep and smooth.

3404
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:57,160
It sounds like it sounds like a ethnic Markiplier deep and smooth.

3405
02:36:57,160 --> 02:36:59,920
That's right. Deep and smooth. 100% deep.

3406
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:00,920
Oh, OK.

3407
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:06,080
Why did you say it like that so many times?

3408
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:08,640
And next voicemail next voicemail is.

3409
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:12,560
Wait, oh my god, there's another.

3410
02:37:12,560 --> 02:37:15,480
All right, well, here's the here's the fucking link.

3411
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:18,440
And here's a link to.

3412
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:22,200
I don't think this I don't think the whole link works.

3413
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:24,200
I think they get they posted a broken link.

3414
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:28,040
I assume you just add an end to the end of that link.

3415
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:29,320
What?

3416
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:31,600
Court court probation.

3417
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:33,440
Maybe.

3418
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:35,440
No, it's court probation.

3419
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:37,120
Court probation.

3420
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:39,400
It's a Colorado judicial branch.

3421
02:37:39,400 --> 02:37:42,000
Well, who cares?

3422
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:43,960
Yeah, I don't know.

3423
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:45,720
OK, let's listen to the voicemail.

3424
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:47,840
Three, two, one, go.

3425
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:54,280
OK, Ben, I will forgive you for not joining the Anamorphine

3426
02:37:54,280 --> 02:37:59,080
Time Discord because, you know, you didn't ask me to send you

3427
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:04,200
an invite in March when I asked you if you wanted to join it.

3428
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:07,040
I'll forgive them. Fuck it. We're done. We're past it.

3429
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:07,800
Fuck you.

3430
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:09,000
Uh huh.

3431
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,920
Did you all hear about Mark Redwine?

3432
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:12,120
No.

3433
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:16,720
This dude killed his son in 2012 or something

3434
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:22,240
and was just convicted and he killed his son

3435
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:26,000
because his son found pictures of him in a red bra

3436
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:30,040
eating shit out of a diaper.

3437
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:34,040
And I kind of relate to that like rage.

3438
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:37,400
Because, I mean, what?

3439
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:41,840
This is this is funny because I know the person who sent this.

3440
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:43,160
I recognize his voice.

3441
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:45,200
It's fucking pie whip.

3442
02:38:45,240 --> 02:38:48,240
He didn't know we were going to be on, but the biggest meme of Shredda

3443
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:50,520
is that we make fun of the ABDL community.

3444
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:55,000
I see. Yes.

3445
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Yeah.

3446
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,320
No, I haven't heard about this Mark Redwine.

3447
02:38:58,320 --> 02:39:00,120
He says very relatable fellow.

3448
02:39:00,120 --> 02:39:02,440
Obviously. Listen, listen, listen.

3449
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:05,120
I didn't know if he meant I relate to the son or the dad.

3450
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:05,960
Listen, it's OK.

3451
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:10,480
He looks like his files got sealed or something because it's OK.

3452
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:13,360
He just had a heater game and he just had a heated gamer moment.

3453
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:15,560
We all have them.

3454
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:17,200
Yeah.

3455
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:19,320
Eating shit.

3456
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:21,480
Was it the son's shit?

3457
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:23,240
Was the son like he would have been fine with it?

3458
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:25,000
But he's like, wait, that was my shit.

3459
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,600
Dad.

3460
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:29,440
That's what you've been doing with my shit all these years.

3461
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:32,680
I don't want to I don't want to think about this one anymore.

3462
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:34,720
OK.

3463
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:37,440
Next voicemail is called.

3464
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:38,800
What is it called?

3465
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:41,240
It is called Read One Piece.

3466
02:39:41,240 --> 02:39:43,920
Please, Ben, three, two, one, go.

3467
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:47,720
OK, guys, I need help.

3468
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:50,440
I need you to choose one for me.

3469
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:52,560
Berserk or Homestuck?

3470
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:55,200
Homestuck. Choose one.

3471
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:56,800
Sorry. I read.

3472
02:39:56,800 --> 02:39:58,000
I only know Berserk.

3473
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,640
Sorry. It's my default.

3474
02:39:59,640 --> 02:40:03,720
I hate to do it, but Homestuck is more is more important to me.

3475
02:40:03,720 --> 02:40:04,920
I see.

3476
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:07,800
I wanted to have to get into Homestuck,

3477
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:11,120
but then somebody told me not to because the third arc

3478
02:40:11,160 --> 02:40:13,600
adds a self insert character or something like that.

3479
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:14,640
And it just becomes bad.

3480
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:16,040
So stupid.

3481
02:40:16,040 --> 02:40:17,640
That's literally the dumbest.

3482
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:18,760
What that doesn't even mean.

3483
02:40:18,760 --> 02:40:21,680
I mean, I was like, oh, my God.

3484
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:22,240
Who?

3485
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:23,000
Whoever? Who?

3486
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
There's plenty of things to complain about with Homestuck.

3487
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,240
Whoever told you that doesn't know what they're talking about.

3488
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:28,880
That doesn't make any sense.

3489
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:31,720
Oh, dude, do you know that Berserk had like a girl in it?

3490
02:40:31,720 --> 02:40:33,040
You shouldn't read that one.

3491
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:35,160
It sucks.

3492
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:38,320
The third arc added a self insert character.

3493
02:40:38,320 --> 02:40:40,120
Don't remember which member it was,

3494
02:40:40,120 --> 02:40:43,160
but it was one of the pro-anon people that told me that.

3495
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:45,840
Whoever told you that can't fucking read.

3496
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:47,920
They can't read.

3497
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:48,880
That doesn't make any sense.

3498
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:50,160
They must have been fucking with you.

3499
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:53,560
I don't know what I haven't read it because they said that.

3500
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:56,440
Oh, my God.

3501
02:40:56,440 --> 02:40:58,480
Imagine listening to anyone.

3502
02:40:58,480 --> 02:41:01,240
That's so that's literally that's literally

3503
02:41:01,240 --> 02:41:03,520
the like the dumbest Homestuck take I've ever heard.

3504
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:10,440
Yeah, the author, the author does appear in the story

3505
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:16,160
occasionally to give like a recap and it's like a total like non event

3506
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:18,480
and it doesn't impact anything.

3507
02:41:18,480 --> 02:41:21,720
Imagine what a weirdo you did.

3508
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:23,200
Just it's just weird.

3509
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,520
It's just like a weird thing to not like about it.

3510
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:27,240
It has like no bearing at all.

3511
02:41:27,240 --> 02:41:28,600
Oh, my God.

3512
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:30,280
Obnoxious. That's obnoxious.

3513
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:36,040
It's it's hard to compare the two to say like choose one.

3514
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:40,400
I don't know how I could choose between them.

3515
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:41,760
It's easy Homestuck.

3516
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:43,840
I like it better.

3517
02:41:43,840 --> 02:41:45,640
I like them so much, both.

3518
02:41:45,640 --> 02:41:47,360
I guess.

3519
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:48,480
Berserk is unfinished.

3520
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:49,400
I haven't read either.

3521
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:51,000
The Homestuck guy is

3522
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:54,600
is the winner because he is still alive.

3523
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:59,920
Berserk is unfinished versus Homestuck did finish.

3524
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:01,160
But the ending was bad.

3525
02:42:01,160 --> 02:42:05,080
So shit, like yeah, the ending was bad

3526
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:07,520
and the epilogue was exhaustingly terrible.

3527
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:09,520
Yeah.

3528
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:12,360
Berserk is also only good.

3529
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:14,960
Well, you know, Homestuck has risk.

3530
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:16,960
True, that's that's a that's a big point.

3531
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:18,480
That's at least real here.

3532
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:20,960
Berserk is only good during the Golden Age arc.

3533
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:22,960
It drops off hard for after that.

3534
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:26,000
Yeah, I mean, that's it.

3535
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,240
I being a big question mark

3536
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:31,760
in everyone's head, like, oh, what's going to happen with Griffith?

3537
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:34,360
What's going to happen with this whole thing?

3538
02:42:34,360 --> 02:42:35,880
You know what? It's it's fun.

3539
02:42:35,880 --> 02:42:38,560
Just assume that those two, they're both awake.

3540
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:41,640
They're they're just going to they're just like she has her memories.

3541
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:44,920
They're just going to, you know, do their own thing.

3542
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:48,240
Just just that's where the that's where the story ends.

3543
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:50,200
I it's it's great.

3544
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:52,200
Leave it.

3545
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:53,480
I can't choose just one.

3546
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:55,680
I just can't do it.

3547
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:57,960
The Golden Age arc is so sad.

3548
02:42:58,040 --> 02:43:00,280
It's a good it's really good.

3549
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:01,600
Golden Age arc is really good.

3550
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:05,880
I really like the whole Kushan arc ending with the giant

3551
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:09,800
like demon tree thing so fucking.

3552
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:15,680
So fucking the in the imagery that it shows

3553
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:18,280
just conjures up so many things.

3554
02:43:18,280 --> 02:43:20,360
I mean, it's it's super influential for a reason.

3555
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:24,680
And it's just

3556
02:43:25,560 --> 02:43:27,240
it can't do it.

3557
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:28,600
It's it's yeah, won't do it.

3558
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:30,600
It's not a fair. It's not a fair, obviously.

3559
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:31,640
But I mean, this is the point.

3560
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:34,800
The point of this question is to make us discuss and discuss we have.

3561
02:43:35,480 --> 02:43:38,920
Well, this I mean, if I really wanted to get down to it,

3562
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:42,920
I wanted I would want to like go on it for like an hour and I can't.

3563
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:46,080
I can't draw that out for just one voice now.

3564
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:48,720
Hold on. I do have a no.

3565
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:50,760
The moral of the story is yeah.

3566
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:53,760
So about the title, Ben, why haven't you read one piece?

3567
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:55,680
What's going on, buddy?

3568
02:43:55,680 --> 02:43:57,160
Yes, I'm just one piece game.

3569
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:59,120
I'm just letting it I'm just letting it build up.

3570
02:43:59,640 --> 02:44:02,040
I'm just letting it build up until

3571
02:44:02,040 --> 02:44:03,640
and I'm just binge it at some point.

3572
02:44:03,640 --> 02:44:05,040
I said this on the over.

3573
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:08,200
I said this on the stream and I'm not trying to step in any toes

3574
02:44:08,360 --> 02:44:11,400
because if Nate is going to do pot, podi cast,

3575
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:13,520
then that's fine.

3576
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:17,320
But like if Nate doesn't intend to continue the podi cast,

3577
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:22,080
I would consider taking it over base, base, base.

3578
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:26,800
That's only that's only if that's only if his intention is not to to do it.

3579
02:44:27,280 --> 02:44:30,840
If he intends if he's going to keep doing it, then then then, sure.

3580
02:44:31,880 --> 02:44:33,760
So now the offer is on the table.

3581
02:44:35,640 --> 02:44:37,720
Next voicemail is

3582
02:44:39,480 --> 02:44:43,840
it's my IQ Mima Q A

3583
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:47,880
would you to be to OK,

3584
02:44:48,440 --> 02:44:50,800
wait, yeah. OK. Three two one go.

3585
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:53,540
God, that new Nate video was ass.

3586
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:56,540
I didn't watch it.

3587
02:44:56,540 --> 02:44:58,140
It was very confusing.

3588
02:44:58,140 --> 02:45:01,180
To be to be honest, his name made a video.

3589
02:45:01,300 --> 02:45:02,100
He did.

3590
02:45:02,100 --> 02:45:06,580
To be honest, I didn't watch it because I heard people talking about it.

3591
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:11,000
And I got the impression that I might find it annoying.

3592
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:15,340
And I didn't want to watch a Nate video that would make me annoyed.

3593
02:45:15,700 --> 02:45:20,340
So I was just kind of like, OK, I think I think I get what it's about

3594
02:45:20,380 --> 02:45:23,580
from what people are saying about it.

3595
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:25,080
I'll just I'll just let it be.

3596
02:45:25,080 --> 02:45:27,840
It was just it was a it was sort of like a.

3597
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:35,580
A series of video game industry opinions about how games are

3598
02:45:36,540 --> 02:45:43,580
the the hype culture, you know, expectations for developers,

3599
02:45:44,140 --> 02:45:46,580
how games should be good or worse or.

3600
02:45:47,380 --> 02:45:50,380
But they weren't like cohesively linked together.

3601
02:45:50,380 --> 02:45:52,180
They were just sort of one after the other.

3602
02:45:52,180 --> 02:46:00,920
But it had a a veneer of a cohesion in the the title nickel acronym,

3603
02:46:01,620 --> 02:46:06,220
which is so confusing because it's sort of like a formula,

3604
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:11,220
a mathematical formula that is supposed is supposedly to link

3605
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:15,580
all of these things together in a single term that you can use.

3606
02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:20,380
But it has no like conceivable use.

3607
02:46:21,220 --> 02:46:23,280
I don't know how you would even use it in a sentence.

3608
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:25,320
And it's hard to even explain right now.

3609
02:46:25,320 --> 02:46:32,020
I saw the equation and it seemed like the only I mean, the equation is just.

3610
02:46:33,220 --> 02:46:37,320
Anything that like asymptotically approaches a limit,

3611
02:46:38,220 --> 02:46:43,020
which is like a very normal thing for a for an equation to do.

3612
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:50,380
I don't I don't I don't like Nate.

3613
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:56,820
But OK, I watched a video because our based editor for Shredda is no need.

3614
02:46:56,820 --> 02:46:58,680
And he's also Nate's editor.

3615
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:03,120
And every time I watch a Nate video, I'm like, God, I'm glad we still no need.

3616
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:06,320
He has talent.

3617
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:10,520
So wait, this entire thing, he just explains like the 80 percent rule.

3618
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:12,180
That's what I say.

3619
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:15,320
It's something that 80 percent of where you need it to be.

3620
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:16,780
It's good enough.

3621
02:47:16,780 --> 02:47:20,680
Like that's that's that's the that's just parts of it are about that.

3622
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:24,120
Other parts are completely not about that, but they're still under

3623
02:47:24,120 --> 02:47:28,520
the umbrella of that term, which has no bearing on the thing he's talking about.

3624
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:31,380
He just has a lot takes 10 minutes to explain just that.

3625
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:33,920
Jesus Christ, it's an hour long video.

3626
02:47:35,220 --> 02:47:39,220
Well, it's I think I think he said that

3627
02:47:40,420 --> 02:47:42,020
people told him it could be shorter.

3628
02:47:42,060 --> 02:47:42,860
And he agreed.

3629
02:47:43,060 --> 02:47:49,760
Yeah, yeah, I mean, at the end, yeah, at the end, he does admit

3630
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:54,020
that he it was it was like a difficult script to write because he was trying

3631
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:56,520
to think of a way for all of these things to connect.

3632
02:47:57,160 --> 02:48:00,260
But I feel like the problem was they inherently do not connect.

3633
02:48:01,060 --> 02:48:05,160
They are different topics that maybe you should should just make a different video.

3634
02:48:07,520 --> 02:48:08,820
They should have been we Aguas.

3635
02:48:08,820 --> 02:48:11,820
I really think that a good 10 minute video

3636
02:48:11,820 --> 02:48:15,960
is better than like like six good 10 minute videos is better

3637
02:48:15,960 --> 02:48:19,360
than like a bad, weird hour long video like.

3638
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:24,360
You know, in theory, in theory, I guess I guess so.

3639
02:48:24,360 --> 02:48:28,060
Well, I mean, I don't know how many hours of content

3640
02:48:28,060 --> 02:48:33,560
is the Christine Chan documentary, and would those be better split up as well?

3641
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:34,460
You mean you mean the gene?

3642
02:48:34,460 --> 02:48:35,860
You mean the Geno Samuel documentary?

3643
02:48:35,860 --> 02:48:36,660
I think so.

3644
02:48:36,660 --> 02:48:38,260
The one where there's like 50 something.

3645
02:48:38,260 --> 02:48:40,360
But those are those serve a different purpose.

3646
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:42,900
Those are I mean, there's so fucking many of those.

3647
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:47,000
I fucking hate that guy, by the way.

3648
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,700
I hate every fucking historian.

3649
02:48:48,700 --> 02:48:50,400
They all suck.

3650
02:48:50,400 --> 02:48:52,760
They all they all misgender her.

3651
02:48:52,760 --> 02:48:56,300
They're all a bunch of like dipshits and they all like mutualese people.

3652
02:48:56,400 --> 02:48:59,260
People in my comment section, I see comments that are like,

3653
02:48:59,800 --> 02:49:02,700
you shouldn't call Chris a she because she's just a fake trans.

3654
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:06,200
And my evidence is Geno Samuel made a video explaining

3655
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:08,300
about why Chris is a fake trans.

3656
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:10,700
So, you know, you're actually just hurting women

3657
02:49:10,860 --> 02:49:13,700
when you use those pronouns, Ben, fuck you.

3658
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:18,500
So the fuck horrible, horrible community full of horrible people.

3659
02:49:20,300 --> 02:49:23,200
But it is what it is by criticism of them.

3660
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:27,060
Is they is they always tend to side with the trolls like, oh, yeah.

3661
02:49:27,060 --> 02:49:30,400
So this troll did something really funny or this troll got into it.

3662
02:49:30,400 --> 02:49:33,860
And it's like, why are you making the troll seem like the good guy?

3663
02:49:33,860 --> 02:49:36,760
Wouldn't this be better content has like the depressing story

3664
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:38,160
of the Internet taking advantage?

3665
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:42,220
To be honest, I have never actually I have never actually watched the Geno Samuel.

3666
02:49:42,220 --> 02:49:44,360
I have only watched like what I've heard.

3667
02:49:44,360 --> 02:49:48,860
I don't like of all the like of a single part just because.

3668
02:49:50,100 --> 02:49:53,660
Ben Ben's lecture is all the Saundra content I have seen.

3669
02:49:57,220 --> 02:49:59,120
I think I think I read the comic.

3670
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:00,960
I actually like it's fun.

3671
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:03,620
It's fun and silly parts of it are fun and silly.

3672
02:50:03,620 --> 02:50:06,460
It is very hard to understand at times.

3673
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:08,360
Yeah, that's the fun part.

3674
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:11,900
Yeah, like what in the fuck are they trying to get across here?

3675
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:13,620
It's great.

3676
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:17,360
I mean, when when you know that the whole like

3677
02:50:18,360 --> 02:50:24,860
the the Jerkop Tastropai is just an extended reference to an episode of Excel Saga,

3678
02:50:25,220 --> 02:50:27,520
then you kind of are like, oh, I get it.

3679
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:29,520
It is kind of funny in a way.

3680
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:33,560
But you would never know that unless unless someone told you.

3681
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:37,820
Um, yeah, um, but I agree.

3682
02:50:37,820 --> 02:50:39,220
It is it is kind of funny.

3683
02:50:39,220 --> 02:50:43,660
I've heard I've heard there's fun if you like crossover episodes on TV.

3684
02:50:44,260 --> 02:50:45,060
I mean, I do.

3685
02:50:45,060 --> 02:50:49,220
Like what's on like if you were a big fan of the Jimmy Timmy power hour,

3686
02:50:49,220 --> 02:50:53,160
I've heard you will like Saundra to just because of the idea of all these characters.

3687
02:50:53,320 --> 02:50:56,620
I don't I don't agree with that.

3688
02:50:56,720 --> 02:50:59,120
I think that's that's true of tales gets trolled.

3689
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:03,680
But Sonich Sonichu is not a conventionally good story.

3690
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:09,180
It's sad, but true.

3691
02:51:10,780 --> 02:51:18,620
Anyway, next voicemail is wait, fuck, I didn't I didn't put it next voicemail is message for Ben.

3692
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:22,080
Wait, I missed one, but it's OK.

3693
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:24,780
This one is message for Ben.

3694
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:26,420
No, no, let's OK.

3695
02:51:26,420 --> 02:51:28,520
Play the one before this, the three, four, five, nine.

3696
02:51:28,520 --> 02:51:31,220
This one is called It's All Dust.

3697
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:33,420
OK, three, two, one, go.

3698
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:39,660
And the new major deal so made I remember when I could talk to people

3699
02:51:39,720 --> 02:51:43,760
in the pod, the discord of my favorite manga, One Piece.

3700
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:47,460
Yeah, now it's just a desolate wasteland.

3701
02:51:49,460 --> 02:51:51,660
They're dying like Dennis Frogman.

3702
02:51:51,660 --> 02:51:56,260
My people are dying coming in now was was this.

3703
02:51:57,260 --> 02:52:03,500
Was this like during the lockdown, like the podicast lock lock on the 19th?

3704
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:07,900
Let me let me just search the fire emoji in the one piece for really quick.

3705
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:10,400
OK, yeah, please.

3706
02:52:10,400 --> 02:52:12,100
Oh, my God, the rebelling again.

3707
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:14,000
Oh, my God, it's still going.

3708
02:52:15,900 --> 02:52:16,800
Oh, no.

3709
02:52:16,800 --> 02:52:19,000
So is it going to get locked down again?

3710
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,060
Is that was that who started this?

3711
02:52:21,060 --> 02:52:22,200
Why is it happening?

3712
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:26,000
It's so unfortunate because I've heard that the people

3713
02:52:26,140 --> 02:52:28,540
this court, it was so busy.

3714
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:33,040
It was so it was I've heard that the I've heard that the people.

3715
02:52:33,140 --> 02:52:35,240
I mean, you should just you should just kick the spammers out.

3716
02:52:35,240 --> 02:52:39,400
You should just kick out people that spam there are no mods.

3717
02:52:40,400 --> 02:52:44,540
Well, yeah, so the rebellion happened on the fifth of this month.

3718
02:52:44,540 --> 02:52:46,740
So 20 days ago.

3719
02:52:46,740 --> 02:52:49,440
Oh, OK, so that was that was well before.

3720
02:52:49,440 --> 02:52:53,340
Yeah, I wonder why.

3721
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:57,240
OK, well, all right.

3722
02:52:57,240 --> 02:53:01,100
Next voicemail is called Message for Ben three, two, one, go.

3723
02:53:09,900 --> 02:53:11,100
I don't speak Morse code.

3724
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:14,640
I don't know how to read Morse code.

3725
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:17,300
And I feel like it would take a long time for me to translate it.

3726
02:53:17,300 --> 02:53:20,140
So viewer, fuck you, fuck you.

3727
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:22,540
It's assumed it said to read one piece viewer.

3728
02:53:23,500 --> 02:53:26,300
I bet it's like a I bet it's like a slur.

3729
02:53:26,500 --> 02:53:30,640
It would be it would be kind of funny in a shitty way if it was like a slur.

3730
02:53:31,040 --> 02:53:34,380
But like, I'm just going to be like viewer, figure out what it means on your own.

3731
02:53:34,580 --> 02:53:38,540
And then at home, you work it out and it's the n word or whatever.

3732
02:53:38,540 --> 02:53:41,340
And you go, oh, they said it. Oh, they slipped one through.

3733
02:53:41,380 --> 02:53:45,480
Well, I mean, wouldn't you know by like the third letter, you're like, OK, OK.

3734
02:53:45,480 --> 02:53:47,780
Well, yeah, I mean, by then it's too late.

3735
02:53:47,780 --> 02:53:49,480
I don't know.

3736
02:53:49,480 --> 02:53:51,940
It's I mean, it can't be more than like a single word, right?

3737
02:53:51,940 --> 02:53:55,300
There's just not that many letters. I bet I mean, I don't know.

3738
02:53:56,380 --> 02:53:59,080
Commenters, let us know if you translate it.

3739
02:53:59,080 --> 02:54:00,180
Let us know what it says.

3740
02:54:00,180 --> 02:54:01,280
Give me two words.

3741
02:54:01,280 --> 02:54:04,280
So, oh, I heard it.

3742
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:06,140
I heard there was a gap.

3743
02:54:06,140 --> 02:54:08,240
So I don't know that's just going too quick.

3744
02:54:08,240 --> 02:54:10,580
I don't know how people listen to that and like hold on.

3745
02:54:10,840 --> 02:54:15,280
Understand when the when the when the letters are finished.

3746
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:18,880
I don't want to translate it right now.

3747
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:21,480
But it's big break.

3748
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:23,380
No, no brain.

3749
02:54:23,380 --> 02:54:24,980
We're a no brain podcast.

3750
02:54:24,980 --> 02:54:27,120
Next voice. I don't care.

3751
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:32,320
Next voicemail is called simp off three, two, one, go.

3752
02:54:32,880 --> 02:54:35,820
What's worse, a jigger or an eight head?

3753
02:54:35,820 --> 02:54:37,620
It says fuck. I would say a jigger.

3754
02:54:37,620 --> 02:54:42,620
Oh, I would say that's where, you know, what is what is what?

3755
02:54:43,480 --> 02:54:45,720
A ye a ye a yeeg head.

3756
02:54:45,720 --> 02:54:48,920
I would say you can find. Oh, oh.

3757
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:52,560
You it doesn't exist.

3758
02:54:52,560 --> 02:54:56,560
Like it's a terrible has the channel name, but the net her and Riley break up.

3759
02:54:56,760 --> 02:54:58,360
Well, the.

3760
02:54:58,360 --> 02:55:02,260
Well, I mean, the they are the group is split up.

3761
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:04,400
The channel is still called that.

3762
02:55:04,400 --> 02:55:09,660
So technically, Yeeg Studio is continuing, but it's basically just.

3763
02:55:10,760 --> 02:55:16,060
All I mean, it's all the stuff that she said the channel is going to do.

3764
02:55:16,400 --> 02:55:17,560
I mean, they haven't said this,

3765
02:55:17,560 --> 02:55:19,460
but it's pretty obvious that it's all canceled.

3766
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:22,160
It's just it's just a.

3767
02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:26,700
Even if you're talking about anime again, I feel I feel like the channel

3768
02:55:26,700 --> 02:55:29,160
is just the same as it was.

3769
02:55:29,160 --> 02:55:31,160
You're like, oh, it's all changing and stuff.

3770
02:55:31,160 --> 02:55:33,260
I'm like, not really.

3771
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:37,300
It seems the same because because it's because she just let

3772
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:40,360
she just let Riley run the whole thing and tell her what to do.

3773
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:42,000
And he told is terrible marketing.

3774
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:45,860
And he told her and he told her, do this, make the channel this.

3775
02:55:45,900 --> 02:55:50,500
And she said, OK, and then and then flipped out at me for it.

3776
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:53,060
When I told her, like, this is stupid, you're ruining the channel.

3777
02:55:53,260 --> 02:55:55,140
Rage quit the PCP over it.

3778
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:57,600
LaMau get fucked.

3779
02:55:57,600 --> 02:56:01,760
And and and now it's just like, oh, yeah,

3780
02:56:02,400 --> 02:56:04,060
lol, none of that's happening.

3781
02:56:04,060 --> 02:56:05,500
It was all a stupid idea.

3782
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:09,600
I'll just make I'll just make anime videos where I summarize a Wikipedia

3783
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:11,800
article and get like 3,000 views.

3784
02:56:12,340 --> 02:56:16,440
Do you think Trixie is going to rebrand soon since, you know,

3785
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:18,800
the split happened? Yes.

3786
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:21,880
Hard to say. I could maybe, maybe not.

3787
02:56:22,100 --> 02:56:22,540
I don't know.

3788
02:56:22,540 --> 02:56:28,240
They have a very long track record of constantly rebranding.

3789
02:56:28,240 --> 02:56:30,980
That's true. That's true.

3790
02:56:30,980 --> 02:56:33,280
It'll be real. It'll be really funny this time, though.

3791
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:37,280
Yeah, it'll be a more shameful one.

3792
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:38,980
I think so.

3793
02:56:38,980 --> 02:56:41,120
Just considering the.

3794
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:42,520
Yeah. Yeah.

3795
02:56:42,520 --> 02:56:47,020
A few, a few too many torches have been applied to a few too many bridges.

3796
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:48,380
So so are we in it?

3797
02:56:48,380 --> 02:56:52,160
Yeah. So are we in agreement that that Yig heads are worse than I am?

3798
02:56:52,480 --> 02:56:53,360
I would say.

3799
02:56:53,360 --> 02:56:55,480
Kids.

3800
02:56:55,480 --> 02:56:56,760
I suppose so.

3801
02:56:56,760 --> 02:56:58,320
I don't I don't interact with either.

3802
02:56:58,320 --> 02:57:01,820
People who are interested in specifically the Yig studios,

3803
02:57:01,820 --> 02:57:05,960
Riley, Void, Gazer's content, then yes, those are worse.

3804
02:57:06,160 --> 02:57:06,660
Yeah.

3805
02:57:06,660 --> 02:57:09,640
Nate heads are just sort of normal anime losers.

3806
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:12,240
Nate heads are Nate heads are very.

3807
02:57:12,540 --> 02:57:13,460
I mean, Nate heads kind of.

3808
02:57:13,460 --> 02:57:15,400
I shouldn't say those are. That's no some.

3809
02:57:15,400 --> 02:57:17,940
OK, they're not all like this, but a lot of them are losers.

3810
02:57:18,260 --> 02:57:21,600
A lot of them are like weird, like what's the word?

3811
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:23,940
Like like unsocialized.

3812
02:57:23,940 --> 02:57:25,640
They're just mean.

3813
02:57:25,640 --> 02:57:28,500
I think a lot of them are no, genuinely, I think a lot of them are

3814
02:57:28,500 --> 02:57:31,800
unsocialized weirdos who legitimately like need

3815
02:57:32,440 --> 02:57:34,440
like a father figure or something.

3816
02:57:34,440 --> 02:57:38,220
And like they've like they think Nate is like they've read him

3817
02:57:38,220 --> 02:57:44,180
as like a like a like a model of masculinity, which is like very, I don't know.

3818
02:57:44,580 --> 02:57:48,620
Not to say he's entirely unmasking or anything, but like, I don't know.

3819
02:57:48,980 --> 02:57:52,680
I think I think I genuinely get the feeling that some of these weirdos

3820
02:57:52,680 --> 02:57:54,480
really like take him as like a role.

3821
02:57:54,480 --> 02:57:56,380
Yeah, I I find that.

3822
02:57:56,380 --> 02:58:00,320
And I find that I was going to say, you know, a lot of times

3823
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:03,840
because he has this whole thing is he has the bravado of best guy ever.

3824
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:05,340
You know, he has the confidence.

3825
02:58:05,340 --> 02:58:07,420
He says it without holding back.

3826
02:58:07,580 --> 02:58:08,680
That's that's the message.

3827
02:58:08,680 --> 02:58:09,980
Yeah. Yeah. But yeah.

3828
02:58:09,980 --> 02:58:13,620
And that gets people like, oh, my God, I wish I was more confident

3829
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:16,220
can do that. And they start seeing it as a role model.

3830
02:58:16,420 --> 02:58:20,380
I've seen it happen to like a lot of like secular online communities.

3831
02:58:20,380 --> 02:58:26,220
It's just it's just it's just that like it's weird because Nate's not here.

3832
02:58:26,280 --> 02:58:29,780
He doesn't make like self improvement content.

3833
02:58:30,380 --> 02:58:33,080
And yet people, some people, it seems like they sort of.

3834
02:58:33,880 --> 02:58:37,620
Imagine that like his content is meant to improve them.

3835
02:58:37,780 --> 02:58:42,220
Like he is some like he is presenting some sort of model to aspire to like.

3836
02:58:42,220 --> 02:58:44,520
And like he that's just not what he's doing.

3837
02:58:45,020 --> 02:58:46,020
I don't know. I don't know.

3838
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:49,580
It could be what could be a sort of thing like, oh, my God,

3839
02:58:49,580 --> 02:58:52,120
somebody that's into anime is actually cool.

3840
02:58:52,120 --> 02:58:53,580
Maybe I could be.

3841
02:58:54,980 --> 02:58:56,880
I guess. I mean, I guess so.

3842
02:58:59,420 --> 02:59:01,580
Sure. Whatever.

3843
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:06,460
OK, next voicemail is is called

3844
02:59:07,080 --> 02:59:09,320
I am sans undertale.

3845
02:59:09,320 --> 02:59:11,020
Here, let me put it in the chat.

3846
02:59:11,020 --> 02:59:13,360
OK, three, two, one, go.

3847
02:59:13,960 --> 02:59:16,060
I am sans undertale.

3848
02:59:16,060 --> 02:59:17,260
It's true.

3849
02:59:17,260 --> 02:59:20,360
You see, I don't own a copy of undertale.

3850
02:59:20,960 --> 02:59:24,060
Therefore, I am without I understand.

3851
02:59:25,860 --> 02:59:27,320
Impact of logic.

3852
02:59:27,320 --> 02:59:29,820
Does does the sands have a signature laugh?

3853
02:59:30,120 --> 02:59:31,820
In the Patrick Star laugh.

3854
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:34,820
Yeah, yeah, it is.

3855
02:59:34,820 --> 02:59:37,820
Yeah, kind of a little bit.

3856
02:59:37,820 --> 02:59:40,720
OK, the next voicemail is not a voicemail.

3857
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:42,960
It is an image.

3858
02:59:42,960 --> 02:59:44,960
This is the image.

3859
02:59:47,760 --> 02:59:51,060
Virgin voicemail and the Chad picture.

3860
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:54,300
This is nicely drawn. I like this.

3861
02:59:54,300 --> 02:59:58,660
Although it reminds me that this week I saw a tweet and I retweeted

3862
02:59:59,100 --> 03:00:02,900
a tweet that I agreed with strongly, which is that the Virgin versus Chad

3863
03:00:03,060 --> 03:00:04,900
meme has been bastardized.

3864
03:00:04,900 --> 03:00:10,640
It was originally now it has become bad thing left, good thing right.

3865
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:14,700
But it was originally the thing on the left is like normal.

3866
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:19,600
And the thing on the right is like hyper masculine insanity,

3867
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:22,500
like something like the original Chad, like he's a freak.

3868
03:00:22,500 --> 03:00:27,260
Like he takes like beetle like strides and he's perpetually in counterpost.

3869
03:00:27,300 --> 03:00:29,160
And he's he's barely even human.

3870
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:32,700
And like the other the other like, you know, the early versions of it were him

3871
03:00:32,700 --> 03:00:36,260
like like like pissing in a like like shitting in a toilet.

3872
03:00:36,260 --> 03:00:39,140
And like he like bends over and like squirts of a shit stream

3873
03:00:39,140 --> 03:00:43,440
like across the entire bathroom and like piles it up inside the toilet and overflows it.

3874
03:00:43,440 --> 03:00:45,400
Right. Like it's like that's the the Chad.

3875
03:00:45,400 --> 03:00:47,140
It's like, yeah, like just excess.

3876
03:00:47,140 --> 03:00:49,840
Yeah, excess like explosive.

3877
03:00:50,400 --> 03:00:51,960
And it's like, yeah, that's good.

3878
03:00:51,960 --> 03:00:54,860
But it's like the joke is that it's kind of is it's ridiculous.

3879
03:00:54,860 --> 03:00:56,900
You would not want to shit all over the bathroom.

3880
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:58,400
That and it's true.

3881
03:00:58,400 --> 03:00:59,840
I do feel like it's been bastardized a little bit.

3882
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:03,340
That being said, I'm guilty of this and I still like this.

3883
03:01:03,340 --> 03:01:08,240
Like I drew the the Virgin Yerk versus Chad and the light picture for Tom's lecture.

3884
03:01:08,600 --> 03:01:11,240
And like, I don't know, it's I like it.

3885
03:01:11,240 --> 03:01:13,500
It's it can also be funny in its own way.

3886
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:19,340
Let's let's let's go through the Virgin voicemail versus the Chad picture.

3887
03:01:19,580 --> 03:01:22,400
The Virgin voicemail takes three minutes to say nothing.

3888
03:01:22,840 --> 03:01:25,040
Needs expensive audio equipment to record it.

3889
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:30,340
Cares about being part of the PCP Canon threatens to fuck Nate.

3890
03:01:30,480 --> 03:01:31,180
Doesn't.

3891
03:01:31,340 --> 03:01:32,180
Oof.

3892
03:01:32,180 --> 03:01:32,920
That's a big one.

3893
03:01:32,920 --> 03:01:34,340
Devastating.

3894
03:01:34,340 --> 03:01:37,540
The next the Chad picture can be understood in seconds.

3895
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:40,080
The only equipment you need is talent.

3896
03:01:40,080 --> 03:01:45,580
Harkens back to yield drawcast days defeats the only point of an audio podcast.

3897
03:01:45,780 --> 03:01:48,340
Ben is too big to do it.

3898
03:01:48,340 --> 03:01:49,540
I have no defense.

3899
03:01:49,540 --> 03:01:51,840
I can't I can't stop.

3900
03:01:51,880 --> 03:01:55,940
That I think is this the same person who drew that Sarah Z.

3901
03:01:56,340 --> 03:01:57,680
I think so.

3902
03:01:57,680 --> 03:02:00,180
I think because they're holding that image.

3903
03:02:00,180 --> 03:02:03,080
Well, well, like it's a Chad is holding that image, isn't it?

3904
03:02:03,080 --> 03:02:04,640
Well, this isn't.

3905
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:06,340
Wait, the Sarah Z.

3906
03:02:06,440 --> 03:02:08,080
Image was not drawn for the PCP.

3907
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:10,080
Someone edited it for the PCP, right?

3908
03:02:11,380 --> 03:02:13,340
I thought somebody sent it in.

3909
03:02:13,340 --> 03:02:14,240
Am I crazy?

3910
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:17,180
Did they did they send the original to?

3911
03:02:17,180 --> 03:02:18,080
Yeah, maybe right.

3912
03:02:18,080 --> 03:02:19,940
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3913
03:02:19,940 --> 03:02:21,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3914
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:25,540
OK, yeah, I think I think this is that guy, whoever they are, that person

3915
03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:27,680
trying to stay gender neutral.

3916
03:02:27,680 --> 03:02:32,040
Well, I mean, they're just right.

3917
03:02:32,140 --> 03:02:32,740
They're just right.

3918
03:02:32,740 --> 03:02:35,340
And I can't rebut any of this.

3919
03:02:35,340 --> 03:02:38,840
I hope that Eleazar shows the images on screen.

3920
03:02:38,840 --> 03:02:41,440
I think he does some of the time.

3921
03:02:41,440 --> 03:02:43,640
I hope he does this one.

3922
03:02:43,640 --> 03:02:46,300
I really I mean, I really hope this is on screen

3923
03:02:46,300 --> 03:02:50,180
and that you don't have to go down to the to the links and link to it.

3924
03:02:50,180 --> 03:02:52,320
That would be lame.

3925
03:02:52,320 --> 03:02:53,980
Well, well done.

3926
03:02:53,980 --> 03:02:55,320
Well, well said.

3927
03:02:55,320 --> 03:02:56,380
Yeah.

3928
03:02:56,380 --> 03:03:00,480
Next voicemail is called Quentin.

3929
03:03:00,480 --> 03:03:02,520
There it is in the chat right there.

Three, two, one, go.

3931
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:07,580
Hi, Ben St.

3932

And give and take.

3933
03:03:09,880 --> 03:03:13,420
Yes, I hear there used to be other people on this podcast.

3934
03:03:13,420 --> 03:03:16,920
That's true. What happened to that?

3935
03:03:17,060 --> 03:03:18,260
Dead, killed him.

3936
03:03:18,260 --> 03:03:20,660
You see, what had happened was

3937
03:03:21,960 --> 03:03:26,960
there there was a time passed and people moved on to other projects.

3938
03:03:28,360 --> 03:03:29,860
It is a yes.

3939
03:03:29,860 --> 03:03:32,560
The the Virgin gone first, the Chad here.

3940
03:03:32,560 --> 03:03:36,320
Now, yeah, the Virgin past versus the Chad present.

3941
03:03:36,320 --> 03:03:38,260
Yeah, there we go.

3942
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:40,360
Exactly.

3943
03:03:40,360 --> 03:03:45,160
I can't I this isn't a serious question, right?

3944
03:03:45,160 --> 03:03:47,400
Because I'm not prepared to answer it seriously.

3945
03:03:49,160 --> 03:03:53,700
Listen, listen to the entire history of the podcast and you will know

3946
03:03:54,700 --> 03:03:58,460
next voicemail is called let me put it here.

03:03:58,460 --> 03:04:00,500
It's called Ben's best friend.

3948
03:04:00,500 --> 03:04:02,460
Three, two, one, go.

3949
03:04:03,760 --> 03:04:04,600
Hello, Ben.

3950
03:04:04,600 --> 03:04:07,300
I'm sorry, I haven't sent a voicemail in a while.

3951
03:04:07,400 --> 03:04:09,760
It's OK, but things have been rough.

3952
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:12,100
I hope things are going all right.

3953
03:04:12,100 --> 03:04:13,800
Please have a good day.

3954
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:15,100
Thank you.

3955
03:04:15,100 --> 03:04:16,540
I'm having a good day.

3956
03:04:16,540 --> 03:04:18,340
That was it.

3957
03:04:18,340 --> 03:04:20,640
This. Hey, this guy is nice of him.

3958
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:21,640
This is a solid guy.

03:04:21,640 --> 03:04:23,140
I want I'm having a pretty good day.

3960
03:04:23,140 --> 03:04:27,640
I'm so glad that I got the the rat road to Radcon chapter five done.

3961
03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:29,040
Happy to be moving on with that.

3962
03:04:29,040 --> 03:04:32,640
I have about a week before I have to move house and I'm going to try

3963
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:35,940
and use that week to do work on my video game.

3964
03:04:35,940 --> 03:04:38,440
So that's all pretty base.

3965
03:04:38,440 --> 03:04:40,600
Thanks for asking.

3966
03:04:40,600 --> 03:04:43,040
Next one putting here is called.

College.

3969
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:07,840
You know, cool.

3970
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:08,840
Sure. Sure.

3971
03:05:08,840 --> 03:05:10,340
Yeah. Sure.

3972
03:05:10,480 --> 03:05:12,540
Of course, I guess.

3973
03:05:12,540 --> 03:05:13,740
Yeah, I agree.

3974
03:05:13,740 --> 03:05:15,480
I agree. I concur.

3975
03:05:15,480 --> 03:05:16,240
We did it.

3976
03:05:16,240 --> 03:05:21,280
I will say this week, I'm happy to see that almost all of these voicemails

3977
03:05:21,280 --> 03:05:22,980
are under 30 seconds.

3978
03:05:22,980 --> 03:05:25,980
I feel like people actually listened and took it to heart when I said,

3979
03:05:26,780 --> 03:05:27,880
keep your voicemail short.

3980
03:05:27,880 --> 03:05:29,780
I don't want your fucking minute long voicemail.

3981
03:05:29,780 --> 03:05:31,080
They they actually did it.

3982
03:05:31,080 --> 03:05:33,340
There's only been like one or two that have been over a minute.

3983
03:05:33,340 --> 03:05:34,340
Thank you.

3984
03:05:34,340 --> 03:05:36,180
Voicemailers genuinely.

3985
03:05:36,180 --> 03:05:37,040
Thank you.

3986
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:41,000
Nobody wants you do not have a minute's worth of content of you

3987
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:42,940
do not have a minute's worth of thoughts to share.

3988
03:05:42,940 --> 03:05:47,980
I promise next voicemail is called by the way, we're almost done.

3989
03:05:47,980 --> 03:05:53,400
Actually, we're like three more next voicemail is called feelings.

3990
03:05:53,400 --> 03:05:54,400
We're hurt.

3991
03:05:54,400 --> 03:05:56,480
Three, two, one, go.

3992
03:05:58,340 --> 03:06:02,900
You guys didn't play my whole voicemail where I asked you guys a question,

3993
03:06:02,900 --> 03:06:05,840
but you guys fucking play the whole voicemail where the guy just fucking

3994
03:06:05,900 --> 03:06:08,340
piece for 40 minutes.

3995
03:06:09,900 --> 03:06:11,540
What the fuck's up with that?

3996
03:06:11,540 --> 03:06:13,240
It's bonus content.

3997
03:06:13,240 --> 03:06:14,640
It's my accent.

3998
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:15,600
It was your accent.

3999
03:06:15,600 --> 03:06:16,940
Yeah, Paul.

4000
03:06:16,940 --> 03:06:19,540
That's what Taylor guy was just cooler.

4001
03:06:19,540 --> 03:06:20,940
What do you want?

4002
03:06:20,940 --> 03:06:21,500
Damn.

4003
03:06:21,500 --> 03:06:23,540
Well, I guess feelings were hurt.

4004
03:06:23,540 --> 03:06:25,880
And that's just something we have to live with.

4005
03:06:25,880 --> 03:06:29,280
Look, piss is just good at revenue generator.

4006
03:06:30,340 --> 03:06:32,780
People tune in for that.

4007
03:06:32,780 --> 03:06:33,740
The poop, though.

4008
03:06:33,740 --> 03:06:34,400
That was a joke.

4009
03:06:34,400 --> 03:06:35,180
Don't do that.

4010
03:06:35,240 --> 03:06:36,440
Don't actually piss.

4011
03:06:36,440 --> 03:06:37,620
It was we did play.

4012
03:06:37,620 --> 03:06:40,720
Didn't we play the piss one, but we didn't play the poop one, right?

4013
03:06:41,020 --> 03:06:43,120
I I did not want the poop one.

4014
03:06:43,280 --> 03:06:45,480
The poop one is a lot if it's real poop.

4015
03:06:45,480 --> 03:06:48,920
If that's a real poop from a real audience member, that's uncomfortable.

4016
03:06:48,920 --> 03:06:50,920
And I don't like it.

4017
03:06:50,920 --> 03:06:52,880
But I mean, I'm sure that was the point.

4018
03:06:52,880 --> 03:06:55,920
Next one is called sad.

4019
03:06:56,420 --> 03:06:58,720
Three, two, one, go.

4020
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:03,220
Also, being able to hear about Simon Hanselman comics,

4021
03:07:03,460 --> 03:07:05,860
Meg Morgan, and now it's good.

4022
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:07,560
I think we're going to like Meg Morgan now.

4023
03:07:07,560 --> 03:07:12,260
Yes, I have I have heard of Meg Morgan now.

4024
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:15,760
Well, I'll post I'll post an image.

4025
03:07:15,760 --> 03:07:18,400
Meg, Mog and Al.

4026
03:07:18,860 --> 03:07:22,360
Yeah, I see this this witch around sometimes.

4027
03:07:24,620 --> 03:07:28,160
I don't know if it looks good or not.

4028
03:07:28,860 --> 03:07:29,860
Maybe it does.

4029
03:07:29,860 --> 03:07:32,460
I've I've seen a few that are really funny,

4030
03:07:32,520 --> 03:07:35,460
but I need to look at it like read the whole thing.

4031
03:07:35,460 --> 03:07:37,860
Yeah, I've never really been taking the time.

4032
03:07:37,860 --> 03:07:39,860
So I don't know. Yeah.

4033
03:07:40,660 --> 03:07:45,000
Um, I should probably check it out.

4034
03:07:45,400 --> 03:07:47,600
I've had a few other people recommended to me.

4035
03:07:47,600 --> 03:07:52,900
So there's what was the one is like, Al really needs to get inside

4036
03:07:53,060 --> 03:07:55,400
because he needed to pee or needed to take a shit.

4037
03:07:55,740 --> 03:07:58,440
And and Meg and Mog were looking at him

4038
03:07:58,540 --> 03:08:00,540
and they just like, hey, I don't open the door.

4039
03:08:00,540 --> 03:08:02,800
And that was the whole comic is just a series of events

4040
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:04,540
when we like, please let me in.

4041
03:08:04,540 --> 03:08:07,000
I think I think that that was really funny for some reason.

4042
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:11,340
I think the the indie comics that I've been recommended the most

4043
03:08:11,340 --> 03:08:14,880
that I have kind of been sort of meaning to read are this.

4044
03:08:14,880 --> 03:08:17,700
Meg, Mog and Al and Crow Killers.

4045
03:08:18,140 --> 03:08:21,440
You know, Crow Killers by Kate Woods. No.

4046
03:08:22,180 --> 03:08:25,480
Uh, I don't know. Oh, I've heard of Kate.

4047
03:08:25,480 --> 03:08:29,380
Words. Yes, I've heard of any relation to Bill.

4048
03:08:30,320 --> 03:08:33,320
No, Bill. Who is Bill?

4049
03:08:33,320 --> 03:08:37,620
Words is the guy who made the words is the history of Japan video.

4050
03:08:39,020 --> 03:08:41,420
Oh, yeah, probably not.

4051
03:08:41,420 --> 03:08:42,780
And the music and the stuff.

4052
03:08:42,780 --> 03:08:44,580
And he made lots of things.

4053
03:08:44,580 --> 03:08:46,680
They were all dank.

4054
03:08:46,680 --> 03:08:50,720
Wait, Bill, that's not the my spoon is too big guy.

4055
03:08:50,960 --> 03:08:55,000
My spoon is that the guy who made those movies.

4056
03:08:55,100 --> 03:08:58,260
I think my spoon is too big.

4057
03:08:58,260 --> 03:08:59,100
I think that is Bill.

4058
03:08:59,100 --> 03:09:00,600
Words as well.

4059
03:09:01,620 --> 03:09:04,960
No, Don Hertzfeld. No, it's Don Hertzfeld.

4060
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,100
Words, words, spells.

4061
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:10,000
Yeah, OK, that. Yeah.

4062
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:11,500
Yeah, Kate, words.

4063
03:09:11,500 --> 03:09:13,460
I have a furry friend who likes Kate words.

4064
03:09:13,460 --> 03:09:16,700
And you can see they have a strong aesthetic.

4065
03:09:17,860 --> 03:09:19,420
Wait, that's not.

4066
03:09:19,460 --> 03:09:20,520
Is that a Kate?

4067
03:09:20,520 --> 03:09:22,660
That doesn't look like her usual style.

4068
03:09:22,660 --> 03:09:25,320
It's got her name on it.

4069
03:09:25,320 --> 03:09:28,960
OK, but that doesn't look like her style.

4070
03:09:28,960 --> 03:09:30,420
Hold on, Kate.

4071
03:09:30,420 --> 03:09:33,060
Let me just like stuff stuff stuff like this.

4072
03:09:33,060 --> 03:09:36,220
Words is like this shit.

4073
03:09:37,660 --> 03:09:40,720
Yeah, yeah, OK.

4074
03:09:40,720 --> 03:09:43,160
Yeah, this this fucking kind of.

4075
03:09:45,020 --> 03:09:46,920
Yeah, OK, maybe that first one is just

4076
03:09:46,960 --> 03:09:50,460
she doesn't usually draw furries while.

4077
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:53,720
I think we got one more.

4078
03:09:53,720 --> 03:09:55,020
Yeah, we got one more voicemail.

4079
03:09:55,020 --> 03:09:58,620
This is the last one unless some unless someone send the last one

4080
03:09:58,620 --> 03:10:00,120
last minute in.

4081
03:10:00,120 --> 03:10:02,060
Let me check if that happened.

4082
03:10:02,060 --> 03:10:08,120
No, this one is called guests suggestion three, two, one, go.

4083
03:10:08,860 --> 03:10:11,960
OK, guess you guys might be able to pull now that you had

4084
03:10:11,960 --> 03:10:14,760
the creator of this guest role on the podcast.

4085
03:10:14,800 --> 03:10:17,400
Now you have this fucking street crowd cloud.

4086
03:10:17,400 --> 03:10:20,860
You guys could have cloud, baby.

4087
03:10:20,860 --> 03:10:22,360
The guy who created Mr.

4088
03:10:22,360 --> 03:10:25,160
Boop, he probably knows about him.

4089
03:10:25,160 --> 03:10:27,200
He probably knows about things that get through.

4090
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:30,000
I don't think we can get out of the podcast now.

4091
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:31,560
I don't think we can get him.

4092
03:10:31,560 --> 03:10:35,460
You know, JQ, Rebecca Sugar's husband.

4093
03:10:36,160 --> 03:10:38,160
He knows about Sonichu.

4094
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:42,760
So he probably also knows about things that throw that would be funny.

4095
03:10:42,760 --> 03:10:44,800
Why would we want Rebecca Sugar's husband?

4096
03:10:46,260 --> 03:10:48,200
We need the best guy ever.

4097
03:10:48,900 --> 03:10:52,000
OK, dude, do you think we can get the best guy ever?

4098
03:10:52,400 --> 03:10:52,900
I don't know.

4099
03:10:52,900 --> 03:10:55,800
He's got 100,000 subscribers.

4100
03:10:55,800 --> 03:10:57,600
He's pretty based.

4101
03:10:57,600 --> 03:10:59,960
I don't know if he's he would grace us.

4102
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:03,360
I will say that.

4103
03:11:03,360 --> 03:11:06,600
Oh, God, man.

4104
03:11:06,600 --> 03:11:11,500
I just looked at Rebecca Sugar's fucking Wikipedia.

4105
03:11:13,400 --> 03:11:19,060
And I see that they're 34 years old, which is basically my age.

4106
03:11:19,560 --> 03:11:23,360
And they've already fucking they've already rocked the fucking entertainment industry.

4107
03:11:23,460 --> 03:11:25,860
And I've fucking done shit with my life.

4108
03:11:25,860 --> 03:11:27,100
So that that's great.

4109
03:11:27,100 --> 03:11:31,700
Hey, hey, voicemailer, thanks for ruining my mood by reminding me of Rebecca.

4110
03:11:31,700 --> 03:11:33,360
This is my whole week down the drain.

4111
03:11:33,360 --> 03:11:34,160
You know what?

4112
03:11:34,160 --> 03:11:35,860
How am I supposed to work on the game now?

4113
03:11:35,860 --> 03:11:36,660
Huh?

4114
03:11:36,660 --> 03:11:38,320
Don't blame the voicemailer.

4115
03:11:38,320 --> 03:11:39,560
Blame Rebecca Sugar.

4116
03:11:39,560 --> 03:11:41,060
Blame everyone.

4117
03:11:43,200 --> 03:11:46,860
Oh, cringy.

4118
03:11:46,860 --> 03:11:49,600
Anyway, what are we talking about?

4119
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:55,500
Oh, yeah, I wanted to say, oh, yeah, Cybershell said he would like to be a guest on more episodes.

4120
03:11:55,500 --> 03:12:00,900
And in particular, he said he wants to do a guest episode with Gamer's Tavern.

4121
03:12:01,260 --> 03:12:09,060
So I think one of the pretty soon, I will probably suggest that the two of them be on a guest episode together soon.

4122
03:12:09,060 --> 03:12:11,300
Maybe maybe two episodes from now.

4123
03:12:11,800 --> 03:12:15,700
I think I've got another guest in mind for next week.

4124
03:12:16,400 --> 03:12:17,600
Dur.

4125
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:21,900
Um, I would like to I would like to have Cybershell on a little more often.

4126
03:12:21,900 --> 03:12:26,100
He's he's we have a so Ben before before all this.

4127
03:12:26,100 --> 03:12:27,600
What's up?

4128
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:31,500
Um, yeah, your previous episode of Shreddit, we didn't get to the A.B.

4129
03:12:31,500 --> 03:12:34,300
Dale post of the week because I couldn't find a good one.

4130
03:12:35,700 --> 03:12:37,500
I have a last minute voice.

4131
03:12:38,100 --> 03:12:41,100
Oh, okay.

4132
03:12:41,100 --> 03:12:41,700
You know what?

4133
03:12:41,700 --> 03:12:43,500
That's fair.

4134
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:45,100
Oh, my God.

4135
03:12:45,100 --> 03:12:48,900
Hello, everybody, and welcome back to the best part of Shreddit, a A.B.

4136
03:12:48,900 --> 03:12:50,300
D.L. post of the week.

4137
03:12:50,300 --> 03:12:52,500
Yeah, Ben, take it away.

4138
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:53,500
Uh-oh.

4139
03:12:53,500 --> 03:12:55,900
You want me to wear it?

4140
03:12:55,900 --> 03:12:57,900
And this is where we don't get into the back.

4141
03:12:57,900 --> 03:12:58,700
Here we go.

4142
03:12:58,700 --> 03:12:59,300
Here we go.

4143
03:12:59,300 --> 03:13:00,600
Good run, guys.

4144
03:13:01,100 --> 03:13:01,900
Hey, everyone.

4145
03:13:02,900 --> 03:13:05,500
Now, nobody better clip this out of context or anything.

4146
03:13:06,100 --> 03:13:10,500
Uh, hey, every forced to wear diapers tagged as NSFW.

4147
03:13:10,700 --> 03:13:11,500
Hey, everyone.

4148
03:13:11,700 --> 03:13:15,900
About a month ago, I introduced myself and spoke about going 24 seven.

4149
03:13:16,100 --> 03:13:18,500
And it's now been a few months since doing so.

4150
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:21,100
A few weeks ago, I hit a snag, though.

4151
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:24,200
The desire faded as it often does being A.B.

4152
03:13:24,200 --> 03:13:25,600
D.L. with ups and downs.

4153
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:31,900
But since then, my wife has not just become used to me in diapers, but now says

4154
03:13:31,900 --> 03:13:33,800
she finds me more attractive.

4155
03:13:34,800 --> 03:13:38,400
So I went a few days without wearing and she said she didn't like it.

4156
03:13:38,900 --> 03:13:42,900
She now checks every morning and every night that I have my diaper on and

4157
03:13:42,900 --> 03:13:46,800
does regular checks and tells me if I need a change or decides to change me.

4158
03:13:47,400 --> 03:13:51,100
There's even been moments when I said I didn't feel like wearing and she said

4159
03:13:51,100 --> 03:13:52,100
that it's not up to me.

4160
03:13:52,400 --> 03:13:55,100
And as of last week, she's taken away my underwear.

4161
03:13:55,600 --> 03:13:59,700
I now have to ask for underwear when seeing family and friends and most of

4162
03:13:59,700 --> 03:14:03,100
the time, unless it's very close quarters for extended periods, she says

4163
03:14:03,100 --> 03:14:05,700
no, it makes me wear a more discreet diaper.

4164
03:14:06,300 --> 03:14:09,400
To be clear, I asked for this when I started down this path.

4165
03:14:09,800 --> 03:14:13,600
What I did not expect was that she would truly enjoy keeping me diapered

4166
03:14:13,900 --> 03:14:17,800
and that I would and that I feel required to wear diapers now to wear diapers

4167
03:14:17,800 --> 03:14:22,200
now versus figured she'd just do it to support me, but I could still decide

4168
03:14:22,200 --> 03:14:24,000
not to TLDR.

4169
03:14:24,200 --> 03:14:28,500
I no longer have a choice in being 24 seven and my wife keeps me in diapers

4170
03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:30,400
and it's a dream come true.

4171
03:14:30,900 --> 03:14:32,700
Anyone else out there forced to be kept.

4172
03:14:36,500 --> 03:14:40,500
I could honestly, I couldn't tell how he felt about it until the Stockholm syndrome

4173
03:14:40,500 --> 03:14:40,800
does.

4174
03:14:41,900 --> 03:14:45,900
I kind of thought I kind of thought he was saying like, guys, I was just

4175
03:14:45,900 --> 03:14:46,600
fucking around.

4176
03:14:46,600 --> 03:14:49,700
I'm in too deep and I want out like this is scary now.

4177
03:14:49,700 --> 03:14:53,300
But no, I thought this was going to be like and now she wants to divorce

4178
03:14:53,300 --> 03:14:55,100
because I don't want to wear a diaper anymore.

4179
03:14:55,100 --> 03:14:56,300
I thought it was going to be sad.

4180
03:14:57,300 --> 03:14:59,100
I thought it was going to be good for him.

4181
03:14:59,100 --> 03:15:00,000
I thought it was going to be.

4182
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,700
I want to divorce because now she's too into it.

4183
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:05,900
She's too into my thing and I don't like it anymore.

4184
03:15:08,100 --> 03:15:11,600
And it's a dream come true.

4185
03:15:11,900 --> 03:15:14,900
Honestly, honestly, I don't believe it.

4186
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:16,300
I think this is a fantasy.

4187
03:15:16,600 --> 03:15:20,700
I think this guy is just he's just writing his fantasies out on his Reddit

4188
03:15:20,700 --> 03:15:21,200
account.

4189
03:15:21,400 --> 03:15:26,700
I mean, possibly with the ABDL a lot of times you get weird posts like this.

4190
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:33,000
Like I saw one where a guy was like I wear a diaper and no pants to my

4191
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:36,700
office building and everyone loved it and high fived me.

4192
03:15:38,100 --> 03:15:38,900
No.

4193
03:15:41,100 --> 03:15:44,900
Yeah, they want they want to for some reason they want to act like that

4194
03:15:45,100 --> 03:15:49,700
it's more accepted in society than it is, which I mean, I can see

4195
03:15:49,700 --> 03:15:53,400
wanting it to be more accepted if you have a really niche fetish or something.

4196
03:15:53,900 --> 03:15:58,700
I bet for some people that's part of it where it's like part of the fantasy

4197
03:15:58,700 --> 03:16:04,700
is like, what if everyone could just see my diaper and just think it was cool?

4198
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:06,800
Like, what if they liked seeing me?

4199
03:16:08,500 --> 03:16:11,500
No, no, it's like what if what if the diaper was accepted?

4200
03:16:11,600 --> 03:16:15,600
What if everyone just appreciated the diaper and like, I don't know.

4201
03:16:15,600 --> 03:16:20,100
I bet I bet that that has an appeal all its own to some of these people.

4202
03:16:20,100 --> 03:16:24,400
Now, Gib, you do not have to read this, but I also got you on.

4203
03:16:26,700 --> 03:16:27,400
Oh, bro.

4204
03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:29,700
Above and beyond.

4205
03:16:32,400 --> 03:16:32,700
Yeah.

4206
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:33,200
All right.

4207
03:16:33,200 --> 03:16:33,800
Why not?

4208
03:16:34,400 --> 03:16:38,300
Little's bro needs you to answer a very important question.

4209
03:16:38,300 --> 03:16:38,900
Click me.

4210
03:16:38,900 --> 03:16:46,900
Smiley face and SFW and let me just emojis is a rose and there's two genies.

4211
03:16:47,500 --> 03:16:51,700
If you had your very own genie and this genie could give you two wishes instead

4212
03:16:51,700 --> 03:16:58,600
of three, what might I wish or what might you wish one for big life and one for

4213
03:16:58,600 --> 03:17:03,100
little go flowering genies?

4214
03:17:03,100 --> 03:17:03,900
See, told you.

4215
03:17:04,900 --> 03:17:05,600
What is this?

4216
03:17:05,600 --> 03:17:06,500
I don't understand.

4217
03:17:06,800 --> 03:17:10,000
So I hate that I can interpret what this is.

4218
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:14,700
I hate one one for big life and one for little the genie will give you two

4219
03:17:14,700 --> 03:17:19,100
wishes, but one wish is like, what would what would your normal big self

4220
03:17:19,100 --> 03:17:19,500
want?

4221
03:17:19,700 --> 03:17:21,200
And the other one is what is it?

4222
03:17:21,200 --> 03:17:23,500
What wish would your little self want?

4223
03:17:24,200 --> 03:17:29,000
Oh, that's the name of the so that people who wear the diapers, they talk of

4224
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:33,500
themselves as they're the little CS versus the CG is the caretaker.

4225
03:17:33,500 --> 03:17:36,500
It's when it's when you it's when you it's when you are in it's when you are

4226
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:37,500
in the mode.

4227
03:17:37,500 --> 03:17:40,500
It's when you're in the mode, you enter little space and you become and you're

4228
03:17:40,500 --> 03:17:41,400
your little self.

4229
03:17:42,300 --> 03:17:45,100
That why do they got to come up with like your fantasy?

4230
03:17:45,100 --> 03:17:47,300
Just, you know, just like fucking younglings.

4231
03:17:48,600 --> 03:17:51,300
There's always a different term for it.

4232
03:17:51,500 --> 03:17:57,900
Um, they have like a killed all the little lot of weird terms.

4233
03:17:58,300 --> 03:17:59,000
All of them.

4234
03:18:00,600 --> 03:18:02,700
What's hmm.

4235
03:18:04,300 --> 03:18:09,700
Be is miniscule's nano particles quarks.

4236
03:18:09,700 --> 03:18:11,200
Is this okay?

4237
03:18:11,800 --> 03:18:15,400
So this is from this is from the ABDL board.

4238
03:18:15,400 --> 03:18:20,800
Okay, because I know I know that not all littles are into diapers and not all

4239
03:18:20,800 --> 03:18:24,000
diaper lovers are our littles.

4240
03:18:24,200 --> 03:18:26,000
Yeah, some people like shitting on the floor.

4241
03:18:26,300 --> 03:18:28,400
Yeah, no, they call it messing.

4242
03:18:30,200 --> 03:18:31,800
No, I thought that was a joke.

4243
03:18:31,800 --> 03:18:33,200
That is not a joke.

4244
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:35,600
That is actually reality.

4245
03:18:36,100 --> 03:18:36,300
Nope.

4246
03:18:36,300 --> 03:18:37,900
Some of them get bad.

4247
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:39,400
I did picked one.

4248
03:18:39,400 --> 03:18:45,400
I was, I was, but I figured it was too far and I'm like, I'm like, bro,

4249
03:18:45,500 --> 03:18:48,100
could you not honestly do these?

4250
03:18:48,100 --> 03:18:51,600
Did you have what do you stockpile them?

4251
03:18:51,600 --> 03:18:53,300
Do you have a folder full of them?

4252
03:18:53,400 --> 03:18:54,500
Why are there more?

4253
03:18:55,100 --> 03:18:55,900
Well, okay.

4254
03:18:55,900 --> 03:18:56,200
Okay.

4255
03:18:56,200 --> 03:18:59,600
Well, I was posting this as an example of them talking about messing,

4256
03:18:59,600 --> 03:19:03,400
but I was going through and I was trying to find one and I put out three

4257
03:19:03,400 --> 03:19:06,500
that would possibly be funny and I was going to use two.

4258
03:19:06,900 --> 03:19:09,300
I didn't use messing because we'll been funny.

4259
03:19:09,300 --> 03:19:14,300
I'm sure the PCP audience is not prepared to read this one.

4260
03:19:14,300 --> 03:19:15,000
I'll read this one.

4261
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:15,800
Oh, no, no, no.

4262
03:19:15,800 --> 03:19:16,800
Enjoying messing.

4263
03:19:16,800 --> 03:19:17,400
No, here we go.

4264
03:19:17,400 --> 03:19:17,800
You don't have to.

4265
03:19:17,800 --> 03:19:18,300
Here we go.

4266
03:19:18,500 --> 03:19:18,900
Hi.

4267
03:19:18,900 --> 03:19:20,900
I don't know why I didn't listen to this.

4268
03:19:20,900 --> 03:19:25,000
I'm an AB and I use diapers, but when I'm in them, whether while I'm in my

4269
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,800
little space or big, I never want to mess them.

4270
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:34,000
And if I do parentheses forced by my mommy due to suppositories.

4271
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:38,900
Oh God, I instantly want out of them and I was wondering how I could enjoy

4272
03:19:38,900 --> 03:19:40,800
the feeling of them rather than hate it.

4273
03:19:44,400 --> 03:19:45,600
I think you're not into it.

4274
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:46,200
I think that's what I mean.

4275
03:19:46,200 --> 03:19:47,000
Oh my God.

4276
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,300
I naturally hate shitting myself.

4277
03:19:49,300 --> 03:19:50,800
What can I do to fix this?

4278
03:19:50,900 --> 03:19:53,900
It's weird because like I love shitting myself, but like when I do it,

4279
03:19:53,900 --> 03:19:58,200
like it's awful and bad and I'm like, I just don't understand.

4280
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,400
I love the idea of shitting myself.

4281
03:20:01,400 --> 03:20:02,600
I don't actually like.

4282
03:20:02,600 --> 03:20:04,600
I feel like in a, in a previous.

4283
03:20:04,600 --> 03:20:05,300
Why would they?

4284
03:20:05,300 --> 03:20:05,700
Yeah.

4285
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:12,300
Why would they preface that like while whether in little space or big, like,

4286
03:20:12,300 --> 03:20:17,100
is there a subset of like messers who do it in adult mode?

4287
03:20:17,100 --> 03:20:17,900
Probably.

4288
03:20:18,900 --> 03:20:23,500
Like there's there's probably some who only do it in little space and this guy

4289
03:20:23,500 --> 03:20:26,600
is saying, yeah, sometimes I'll do it in big space as well.

4290
03:20:26,600 --> 03:20:29,100
It's a it's a white color or something.

4291
03:20:29,100 --> 03:20:29,500
No, no.

4292
03:20:29,500 --> 03:20:31,100
See, there's a specific difference.

4293
03:20:31,100 --> 03:20:34,100
Uh, I hate the fact that I know this.

4294
03:20:34,200 --> 03:20:34,700
I got it.

4295
03:20:34,700 --> 03:20:35,800
I got a prefaces.

4296
03:20:35,800 --> 03:20:40,400
I hate the fact that this irony is going to eventually become.

4297
03:20:40,400 --> 03:20:42,100
I mean, we do a show that has it every week.

4298
03:20:42,100 --> 03:20:46,000
No, no, no, that's how it always starts.

4299
03:20:46,200 --> 03:20:49,300
But I have, I have seen people talk about, right?

4300
03:20:49,900 --> 03:20:53,700
Some of them enjoy being in big space, messing themselves

4301
03:20:53,700 --> 03:20:57,600
and just soaking it in, sitting on it for hours, not doing anything.

4302
03:20:57,600 --> 03:21:01,400
But I feel when you're, when you're in little space and you do it,

4303
03:21:01,800 --> 03:21:05,000
you get off on the idea of being changed and treated like a baby.

4304
03:21:06,200 --> 03:21:11,700
I think that like on a previous, I think maybe on like the, no, I wasn't

4305
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:14,700
on the fetish cast, but on one of like the previous, an old PCP,

4306
03:21:14,700 --> 03:21:16,400
I think we talked about ABDL stuff.

4307
03:21:16,800 --> 03:21:22,600
And I think someone said that some people will like shove like oatmeal up

4308
03:21:22,600 --> 03:21:26,600
their ass and then like, and then shit it out so that they can sit

4309
03:21:26,600 --> 03:21:28,900
in the oatmeal and it feels like shit.

4310
03:21:29,100 --> 03:21:32,100
It feels like they're sitting in shit, but it doesn't smell like shit.

4311
03:21:32,400 --> 03:21:35,800
And it doesn't like, you know, cause the fucking legions and infections

4312
03:21:35,800 --> 03:21:36,800
from sitting in shit.

4313
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:41,000
So I would, if I were on this board, I would suggest that to this individual.

4314
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:44,900
My, I think I think he could get real results that way.

4315
03:21:44,900 --> 03:21:46,900
That's I'm a problem.

4316
03:21:46,900 --> 03:21:48,400
I'm a problem.

4317
03:21:50,400 --> 03:21:52,500
Be scared of this part of every episode.

4318
03:21:52,900 --> 03:21:54,100
Jesus Christ.

4319
03:21:54,700 --> 03:21:58,100
I genuinely, I genuinely have advice for this person.

4320
03:21:59,900 --> 03:22:02,100
Maybe you're the one that's in 2D.

4321
03:22:02,100 --> 03:22:03,200
You know too much.

4322
03:22:03,200 --> 03:22:06,800
I just remember, I remember hearing that and being like, wow, you know,

4323
03:22:07,300 --> 03:22:10,600
I guess it would kind of feel like you're shitting, but without like all the,

4324
03:22:10,900 --> 03:22:13,300
without most of the terrible, fascinating.

4325
03:22:13,300 --> 03:22:15,200
What, what do they think of next?

4326
03:22:16,200 --> 03:22:18,400
Technology has come so far.

4327
03:22:18,900 --> 03:22:20,900
Jesus Christ.

4328
03:22:24,900 --> 03:22:25,900
Holy fuck.

4329
03:22:26,900 --> 03:22:28,400
What a way to end an episode.

4330
03:22:28,400 --> 03:22:33,900
I think that's going to do it for this episode of the pro-crastinators podcast.

4331
03:22:33,900 --> 03:22:34,900
Crastinators podcast.

4332
03:22:34,900 --> 03:22:36,900
Unless anyone's got any last words.

4333
03:22:36,900 --> 03:22:40,400
I have some, I have some required things to say.

4334
03:22:40,400 --> 03:22:41,400
Okay.

4335
03:22:41,900 --> 03:22:44,400
Number one, Marin Pan is again amazing.

4336
03:22:44,400 --> 03:22:45,900
I promised him a shout out.

4337
03:22:45,900 --> 03:22:46,900
He's one of the best.

4338
03:22:46,900 --> 03:22:50,400
We run a streaming channel with him called shredded a fickle and it's only spelled

4339
03:22:50,400 --> 03:22:52,400
shredded a fickle because I spelled official wrong.

4340
03:22:56,400 --> 03:22:57,400
Check out our channel.

4341
03:22:57,400 --> 03:23:01,400
We do, we have an ABDL segment at the end of every episode, but of course that's

4342
03:23:01,400 --> 03:23:02,400
not the main draw.

4343
03:23:02,400 --> 03:23:04,400
The rest of the episode is funny too.

4344
03:23:04,400 --> 03:23:08,900
It's just that the ABDL, there's always a stupid post on there.

4345
03:23:08,900 --> 03:23:13,400
Like you just go on the website and within three seconds you found like a perfect post.

4346
03:23:13,900 --> 03:23:16,400
This person is just terrible.

4347
03:23:17,400 --> 03:23:22,400
Especially when they talk about sneaking in public and then relieving themselves in like

4348
03:23:22,400 --> 03:23:24,400
a public area and then just leaving it there.

4349
03:23:25,400 --> 03:23:29,400
That's when it turns into, okay, we're not kink shaming, we're making fun of somebody

4350
03:23:29,400 --> 03:23:30,400
who deserves it.

4351
03:23:32,400 --> 03:23:35,400
When you're a public nuisance, that's when we cross the line.

4352
03:23:35,400 --> 03:23:36,400
Yeah.

4353
03:23:36,400 --> 03:23:38,400
Check out Lumia Stargazer.

4354
03:23:38,400 --> 03:23:39,400
She's an amazing VTuber.

4355
03:23:39,400 --> 03:23:41,400
She's also our fourth host.

4356
03:23:41,400 --> 03:23:43,400
Aspoi is our thumbnail artist.

4357
03:23:43,400 --> 03:23:46,400
Kai is our big brain.

4358
03:23:46,400 --> 03:23:48,900
He doesn't do anything anymore.

4359
03:23:48,900 --> 03:23:49,900
Okay.

4360
03:23:50,900 --> 03:23:52,900
I have outsource.

4361
03:23:53,900 --> 03:23:55,900
That's a real big brain move.

4362
03:23:56,900 --> 03:23:58,900
That's the four hour work week.

4363
03:24:02,900 --> 03:24:03,900
Anyway, continue.

4364
03:24:03,900 --> 03:24:07,900
Oh, and then just a Lexi million on Twitter.

4365
03:24:07,900 --> 03:24:09,900
Links below, hopefully.

4366
03:24:09,900 --> 03:24:10,900
He did our new banner.

4367
03:24:10,900 --> 03:24:11,900
He did our logo.

4368
03:24:11,900 --> 03:24:13,900
He does really good art.

4369
03:24:14,900 --> 03:24:15,900
You forgot one more.

4370
03:24:15,900 --> 03:24:16,900
That's all my shilling.

4371
03:24:16,900 --> 03:24:17,900
Yeah, check out.

4372
03:24:17,900 --> 03:24:18,900
I forgot.

4373
03:24:18,900 --> 03:24:20,400
I'll check out the peace fee Minecraft server.

4374
03:24:20,400 --> 03:24:22,400
Mariners does an amazing job.

4375
03:24:23,400 --> 03:24:24,400
I'm giving you another one.

4376
03:24:24,400 --> 03:24:25,400
I already did that.

4377
03:24:25,400 --> 03:24:26,400
I already did that.

4378
03:24:26,400 --> 03:24:27,400
That's true though.

4379
03:24:27,400 --> 03:24:33,400
That leads into my plug, which is patreon.com slash the procrastinators for bonus episodes,

4380
03:24:33,400 --> 03:24:42,400
including the big bonus episode coming out with me and Cybershell having a intimate discussion.

4381
03:24:42,400 --> 03:24:43,900
Not really, but it's funny.

4382
03:24:43,900 --> 03:24:44,900
It's a funny.

4383
03:24:44,900 --> 03:24:46,900
We just fucking went all day.

4384
03:24:46,900 --> 03:24:52,900
And also you have bonus episodes and you get access to the PCB Minecraft server where

4385
03:24:52,900 --> 03:24:58,900
you can fucking challenge me to a Pokemon battle and Shanghai me onto your podcast.

4386
03:24:58,900 --> 03:24:59,900
Maybe.

4387
03:24:59,900 --> 03:25:00,900
Yes.

4388
03:25:00,900 --> 03:25:02,900
It worked for some people.

4389
03:25:02,900 --> 03:25:04,900
Yeah, there's really cool stuff on that server.

4390
03:25:04,900 --> 03:25:08,900
Like they have gyms for like every PCP member.

4391
03:25:08,900 --> 03:25:11,900
It is kind of a masterpiece.

4392
03:25:11,900 --> 03:25:15,400
The PCB Minecraft server is kind of a masterpiece.

4393
03:25:15,400 --> 03:25:18,400
Mostly thanks to Marin.

4394
03:25:18,400 --> 03:25:20,400
Yeah.

4395
03:25:20,400 --> 03:25:24,400
Okay, are we concluded?

4396
03:25:24,400 --> 03:25:25,400
Yes, I think.

4397
03:25:25,400 --> 03:25:27,400
Okay, send a voicemail if you want to.

4398
03:25:27,400 --> 03:25:28,400
That's it.

4399
03:25:28,400 --> 03:25:29,400
Goodbye.

4400
03:25:29,400 --> 03:25:30,400
The end.

4401
03:25:30,400 --> 03:25:31,400
Goodbye.

4402
03:25:31,400 --> 03:25:32,400
Bye.

4403
03:25:32,400 --> 03:25:33,400
Okay.

4404
03:25:33,400 --> 03:25:34,400
Goodbye.
