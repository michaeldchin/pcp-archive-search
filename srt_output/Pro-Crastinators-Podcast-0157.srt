00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Yesterday, I had the Thomas the Tank Engine theme song stuck in my head all day.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,500
Why?

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Now it will be in your fucking brain throughout the entire podcast.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Well, maybe it will be in your head.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,500
It's always in my head. My name is Thomas.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Percy was such a cunt.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Hum that again. I haven't heard it in so long. I need to go back.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,300
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,300
Oh yeah, oh yeah, Thomas. You're my first love. My only love.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,300
Hey Jessie, we're starting.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,300
Wait, we started recording, but we haven't started, started so-

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,300
We haven't synced. Can you hear us?

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,300
We hear you.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,300
E. Hello?

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,300
Oh.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Hello?

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Duh.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Wait.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Sorry.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
That wouldn't count.

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Is Jesse like ten seconds behind?

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Oh, no.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Poor Jess.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Okay.

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I mean, if you feel that's appropriate, then fair enough.

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Fair enough.

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Okay.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Take care, Jess.

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
All right.

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
See you later, dude.

31
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
All right.

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Later.

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
For the viewers at home, his internet is bad.

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
He can't do it.

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
That's why.

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Okay.

37
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Cause this is all stand-in.

38
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Cause this is all stand-in.

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
I mean, just cut that out.

40
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
No, no.

41
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
This is all stand-in.

42
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
This is all stand-in.

43
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
This is all stand-in, dude.

44
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
This is all stand-in, dude.

45
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
This is what the people want.

46
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
They want inside baseball.

47
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
This is what the people want.

48
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Confusing messes.

49
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
I don't think they do.

50
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Uh, but that's just me.

51
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I have no idea.

52
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,780
I can't wait to give this to our new editor and just be like, here's the mess of the

53
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,780
beginning.

54
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,780
You have to try and find a way to sync it up.

55
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Yes, Zach.

56
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
Good luck.

57
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Beautiful.

58
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
Perfectly fine cutting it.

59
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,780
No.

60
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,780
Okay, whatever.

61
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,780
On that note, I guess the episode started.

62
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,260
Uh, welcome one and all to the inaugural episode.

63
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,420
Really organized, well thought out content cluster.

64
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,420
The PCP, the piece of crap podcast, back at it again with another episode.

65
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,380
All of the life and soul is drained from you, Nate.

66
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,500
You just look like you got to have a wood chipper.

67
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,620
I feel like I'm climbing into a wood chipper and I can't wait.

68
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,500
Here's the deal, people.

69
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
It's time.

70
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Jesus.

71
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
The time is finally here.

72
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
The time is now.

73
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,700
The time is come and so have I.

74
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,860
I forgot what I was talking about.

75
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,860
Oh, right.

76
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,620
Uh, the editor contest.

77
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,020
So you, okay, here's your challenge.

78
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
Here's your challenge.

79
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,060
I'm getting my life back.

80
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,220
Do not scroll down and notice in the description where it says you edited.

81
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,700
Don't do that because as you probably could tell, we got the new editor.

82
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,380
Got a new editor, baby.

83
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,540
And it's time to announce it.

84
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,540
What'd you say?

85
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,540
What?

86
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,540
We got to say some, some honorable mentions.

87
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
Is that the plan?

88
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,540
Oh, okay.

89
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,780
So here's what we're doing, people.

90
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,780
So we got it.

91
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,740
We're going to let you know who did well, everybody who entered.

92
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Thank you so much.

93
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,660
We're sorry to keep you waiting all so long and jerking you around.

94
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,060
But we are going to tell you some of the people who did a fine job in this here contest.

95
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,820
So here's our 11 top picks, our top 11, because we're like the nostalgia critic and we like

96
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,740
to go that one step further.

97
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,900
One step beyond you fucking fake fan.

98
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Is that what he says?

99
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,740
We, we, we used a, we used a first pass the post voting system or something.

100
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,220
I don't actually know what that means.

101
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,220
Something like that.

102
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,100
It was a point, a way to point system.

103
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah.

104
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,100
Yeah.

105
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,660
We use social credit to determine how much each vote was worth.

106
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
So, okay.

107
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,660
So this is what we did.

108
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,660
These were our top guys.

109
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,660
Um, okay.

110
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,020
So, so, you know what, uh, this is not in point order, uh, specifically because I have

111
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,300
to obscure who's the winner and who's the loser here.

112
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,300
So this is totally unordered.

113
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:50,900
Uh, here we go, uh, John Kano, Donasaur, you Caterpillar, unusual Caterpillar, Ed, Kulik

114
00:03:50,900 --> 00:04:00,780
64, Alden, Green Fleshy Flowers, Calazar 321, those Tismis, those, those Timmy's, those

115
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
Timmy's.

116
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
Oh, those Timmy's.

117
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,780
Okay.

118
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,780
Right.

119
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,180
And Eleazar and Oblivionfall.

120
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,220
Those were our finalists, ladies and gentlemen.

121
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,620
And if you are on that list, um, get ready because you're going to find out whether or

122
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,020
not you edited this episode.

123
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,020
Indeed.

124
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,220
Fingers crossed every point.

125
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,700
You know, we, we, we could announce that right now, you know, we could let them know

126
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,100
like the landmark announcement of their entire youth, you know, let them know, you know,

127
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,340
what will define their lives for the next like 10, 20 years, but you know, you know,

128
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,300
what if we just, we'll just dilly-dally for a little bit, you know, what if we just twiddled

129
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,340
our clip for, you know, um, 20 more seconds right here, you know, what, what, you know,

130
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,340
why, why be too hasty?

131
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,340
You know, why do you be too hasty?

132
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,340
Well, you're going to give some honorable mentions, right?

133
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,740
And even want to shout out your peeps you liked.

134
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,740
Um, no.

135
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,020
I'm 64, your pizza-chan, therefore I hate you.

136
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
Yeah.

137
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
Sam.

138
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,580
Um, oh, Pete, you, I don't know.

139
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,300
There were a lot of like, I don't know, I don't fucking remember any of them.

140
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,060
I voted in a drunken rage.

141
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,180
Everybody on that list could do the job as far as I'm concerned.

142
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
So that's cool.

143
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,180
Yeah.

144
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,420
Um, definitely, definitely.

145
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,940
The people who gathered to, to, to choose the finalists, we had such a hard time to

146
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,940
choose who.

147
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
We, indeed we did.

148
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,300
That's why it took like three years.

149
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
Um, it was a nightmare.

150
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,700
We had to have one of these patented, awful, Nate, quote unquote, fair processes no one

151
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
likes.

152
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Exactly.

153
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
So, you know.

154
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,420
It wasn't a dictatorship and that was truly our downfall.

155
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,420
Man.

156
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,420
Okay.

157
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,740
So there were a lot of like really creative like layouts and like art styles that went

158
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,380
into a lot of these.

159
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,500
And personally, what I would like to do and what I plan to do is, um, okay, well, what

160
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,740
we did was we recorded like a 15 minute sort of test script or a test episode and gave

161
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,860
it to the editors to edit together.

162
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,500
And what I plan to do is take a bunch of those hang on, Ben, if you say it, maybe you'll

163
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
never make it.

164
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,100
Do you want to just hold on and make the thing?

165
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Or do you want to let people know?

166
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
No, let them know.

167
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,700
Like I basically, it'll be like piece by piece, putting the episode together, but composed

168
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,780
out of like what everyone made.

169
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,940
I think it was in particular, I had like a really cool like layout and like, even though

170
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,260
we didn't end up picking it for the winner, I think it deserves to be shown.

171
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
Wait to spoil.

172
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,100
Ben, you just spilled the beans about shot him down.

173
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Okay.

174
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
He's, it's all right.

175
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
He's a smart boy.

176
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
He figured it out.

177
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
Sensor that.

178
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
Sensor that.

179
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,460
Oh my God.

180
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,460
Oh my God.

181
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
No, it's okay.

182
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,460
Sensor everything.

183
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
All those.

184
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,460
Okay.

185
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
All right.

186
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,460
Let's re-sync.

187
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
Let's re-sync.

188
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
Let's start over.

189
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
No.

190
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
No, we're keeping it in.

191
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,460
Sensor it will save us.

192
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
We're keeping that in and we'd censor it.

193
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,460
You hear that editor?

194
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,460
You're censoring those things.

195
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
It's crucial.

196
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,460
It's like the worst way could have possibly have gone.

197
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,180
We spent like literally an hour just like, like dictate exactly like the minute details

198
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,580
about how we would announce it, win, and what like order we would announce the finalists

199
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
and the winner.

200
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,620
And we're just, oh, fucking, you know, there's some people here.

201
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,620
Keep all that in.

202
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
Keep all that in.

203
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,620
Sensor that.

204
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,620
Sensor that.

205
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Look, it was not my fault.

206
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,260
I fought for a real start.

207
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,620
You people overthrew me.

208
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
You people.

209
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,620
Yeah.

210
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,620
You people.

211
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
All right.

212
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
I was just saying, he's not the only one.

213
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,420
Hey, a bunch of them have like really cool layouts and I want to show them off and I want

214
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,140
to let people see the work because a lot of these, a lot of people put a lot of work

215
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,740
into the submissions and I'm going to, we're going to, we're going to feature them in a

216
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
thing.

217
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
I am committed to this.

218
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Okay.

219
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Well, cool.

220
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
We'll hold you to it then.

221
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,740
And so will they.

222
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
Yes.

223
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Please hold me to it.

224
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740
Ha ha.

225
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Anybody, anybody else want to shout any honorable mentions that you liked?

226
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Oh, by the way, there was like 50 entries, I should say.

227
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,300
I believe there was exactly 50.

228
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Were there?

229
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
Yeah.

230
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
Yeah.

231
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
I think so.

232
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,100
It's hard to say because some of them were questioned like oblivion falls was in particular

233
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,820
was like, we didn't think it was a real submission until we like specifically asked

234
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,180
like, Hey, do you want us to consider this like for real?

235
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,700
I mean, yeah, that's true.

236
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
That's true.

237
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
And there was another one too.

238
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,900
So another guy finished his and submitted it and said he was doing like when we said,

239
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,260
when we did our hilarious update and said like, Hey guys, you actually feel free to

240
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,060
like make fresh visuals and whatnot.

241
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,060
This person kind of, it's on the charts on the bottom.

242
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,940
Like they said, like, I'm going to make a new one.

243
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,500
And then they're like, I actually don't have time.

244
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,780
So please just don't count.

245
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,580
Like day one, he turned in a submission and they just didn't, you know, then he realized

246
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,740
I don't have time to do this, which I totally respect.

247
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
That's totally cool.

248
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,740
Better to realize it now.

249
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
What the fuck is it?

250
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
I've got it right here.

251
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,260
It is, it is scroll down.

252
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
God damn it.

253
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
Fucking one spar.

254
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,260
That's who it was.

255
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
A good old one spar.

256
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,260
Oh, that guy.

257
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,260
We all know that guy.

258
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
Yeah, that guy.

259
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
He's iconic.

260
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,060
Whatever happened, whatever happened to one spar, whatever happened to one spar weekly.

261
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,460
I had my finger on the pulse and now I don't.

262
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,460
Good question.

263
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,460
Good question.

264
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,260
Are one spar and center point 3000 the same person?

265
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
I think so.

266
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
I don't think so.

267
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
I don't think it's distinct, but similar.

268
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,820
Might as well be the same.

269
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,260
Well, center point was another contributor.

270
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,820
He was another entry, so unless the same person entered under two different names, I don't

271
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,820
think so.

272
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Unlikely.

273
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,820
Rest in peace, center point.

274
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,580
Center point starred in my hit video, feeling closer to death, so appreciate that.

275
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,340
One spar is struggling right now with multiple systems, you know, he's got multiple personalities

276
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,740
in his head and they all have different Twitter handles.

277
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
You know how it is.

278
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
You know how it is.

279
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,420
I thought you were going to say multiple sclerosis and I was going to be like, oh, and

280
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,420
tug my collar.

281
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,580
No, no, did not.

282
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
Was not going to go that dark.

283
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,780
Guys, my joke that we that we wouldn't get to the finalist was turned into reality.

284
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
I should have known.

285
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,620
Listen, we can't give the people waiting any longer.

286
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
That's true.

287
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,300
Wait, let me just say the other honorable mentions.

288
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,780
I just had a fellow human.

289
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,260
I picked top 10 whatever.

290
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,420
Fellow human person was good.

291
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,700
Everything was moving a lot, like almost too much, but there's a lot of movement.

292
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,700
I appreciate that.

293
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,540
It stimulated my lizard brain.

294
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,180
So Dell, Dell was up there and also zero and hoodie.

295
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,060
Those are all my top 10 in addition to the others that were picked.

296
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,540
But OK, that being said, let's move on.

297
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,780
Let's actually announce the real winner, ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be eviscerated.

298
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:58,900
And the winner is Oblivion Fall wins Oblivion Fall came in with the animator chops, the

299
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:09,060
editing, audio quality, copyright strike, just so people know the full story with him.

300
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,620
He made his submission said not to be counted up front and he made it just to flex on everybody

301
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,620
else.

302
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,180
He said it was just a flex to prove that he was the most powerful and he was the most

303
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,700
powerful from the start.

304
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,860
It's very true.

305
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,740
And then when we're at the end, we were like, Hey, are you sure you don't want to because

306
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
this is really good.

307
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,340
And he was like, No, OK, I'll do it.

308
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,900
So yeah, I told him I knew it.

309
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,140
I knew he was a filthy liar.

310
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,140
It was almost unfair.

311
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,140
Yep.

312
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,580
So Oblivion Fall, welcome to the PCB family.

313
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,580
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

314
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,580
Yes.

315
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,580
Hello.

316
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
Yeah.

317
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
Sorry.

318
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Call from corporate guys.

319
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
The contest is canceled.

320
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,260
We still have to edit ourselves for another eight years.

321
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,260
Also you're adopted.

322
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,260
Uh-oh.

323
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
Uh-oh.

324
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,740
We didn't make enough on patreon.com slash the procrastinators to pay an editor.

325
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,420
So looks like you're on ice.

326
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
You're on ice, buddy.

327
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,420
Yeah.

328
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,420
That's that's support us.

329
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
Please.

330
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
Please pay us more.

331
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,340
I'm just saying, if you feel bad about editors not getting paid enough, give us more money

332
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,780
so that they get a larger share.

333
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,580
If you don't want to give us money, think of Oblivion Fall.

334
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:16,020
Think of poor Oblivion Fall slaving away, you know, like whittling away at his podcast

335
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,060
episodes, slaving away on his cuphead animations, like, like, like a, like a, like a, like a

336
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
pro.

337
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,060
Indeed.

338
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,180
Just trodden under the boot of society.

339
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
Uh-oh.

340
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,420
As our newest ward soon Oblivion Fall will blossom into Oblivion Summer.

341
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,020
Wait, after fall comes winter.

342
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,020
Don't say that.

343
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
No, don't say that.

344
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,020
Don't say that.

345
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Oh no.

346
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,020
Winter is approaching.

347
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,300
I think, I think you gotta, you gotta admit though at the end of the day Oblivion Fall

348
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,220
being the winner does make the most sense thematically because because he procrastinated

349
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,340
the entire contest and then decided right at the very end he was going to take it seriously.

350
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,900
And in a way he procrastinated, although he made like an amazing entry, you know, early

351
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
on.

352
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,900
But okay, I get your point.

353
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
I get your point.

354
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
It's brand recognition.

355
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Right.

356
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Good point.

357
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
Yeah.

358
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,220
Although you could say that he fulfills the other spirit of the procrastinators by perhaps

359
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,820
procrastinating on his many other like animation jobs to take the time to make the editor submission,

360
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,460
which is the spirit of procrastination, you know what I'm saying?

361
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,660
I think the real winner of the editor contest were the friends we made along the way.

362
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,020
I was, I was, I was expecting that.

363
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
That's fair.

364
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,020
It's just so true.

365
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,020
And you know what?

366
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
It's just so true.

367
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
It's unironically true because a lot of great people submitted.

368
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,180
Eleazar, I think Eleazar learned how to edit apparently for this contest and I'm just

369
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,460
going to tell you, he was tied for number one with green fleshy flowers.

370
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,100
Eleazar overrated.

371
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Green fleshy, for me, there's no, for me, it's all about that green fleshy flowers.

372
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
Just for those who are curious.

373
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,340
And that unusual caterpillar and that Q like 64 baby.

374
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Indeed.

375
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,020
I'll give you the top 10 according to our voting.

376
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,020
Okay.

377
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,860
Eleazar and green fleshy tied for first.

378
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,140
Alden in third place, unusual caterpillar in fourth, Donasaur in fifth, John Kano sixth,

379
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,380
Ed seventh, Kula 64 eighth, Kalazar three to one and ninth and those Timmy's in tenth.

380
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,460
Oh, look at those Timmy's baby.

381
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,820
Oblivion fall wasn't on it because he said it was a joke, but then just.

382
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,500
So what you're saying is that after we procrastinated all that time and like try to do all these

383
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,860
things and spend all this time dividing like a voting system, none of that mattered in the

384
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
end.

385
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
Of course it mattered.

386
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
100% mattered.

387
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,660
I mean, if it didn't matter, it was because oblivion fall, you know, misled us with his

388
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
liberate.

389
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,140
It's just a prank, bro.

390
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,140
So you know, get mad at him if I fucking got us good.

391
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Shit.

392
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,500
I feel, I feel pretty pranked.

393
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,460
You know, a lot of people or a lot of the submissions were pretty much, they didn't have a lot of

394
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,780
like editing per se, like a lot of motion, but a lot of people did have like a just sort

395
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,840
of do like a cool sort of their own art style interpretation of it, like they just sort

396
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,120
of drew our heads in their own style or like did like a pixel art style.

397
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,040
I remember a chuck chucklehead 95 had like a cute pixel aesthetic and like retro PK.

398
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
So just drew us in his own little thing.

399
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
I don't know.

400
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
This is why.

401
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,600
PK his art was great and I love the layout of that.

402
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
It was really nice.

403
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Big, big, big fan.

404
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,560
I was pretty impressed by Dona sores just like really pleasing like, I don't know, there's

405
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,880
like a video of like plants in the background with like some waveforms going on and stuff.

406
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,400
I thought that was real neat, but very Zen unusual caterpillar and some cool like eighties

407
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,680
aesthetic thing going on.

408
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
I think that as well.

409
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,560
I think unusual caterpillar and Qlex both did like an eighties like vaporwave kind of.

410
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Yeah, I think so.

411
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,680
Which I really liked both of I forget Alden's off hand.

412
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
What was Alden's again?

413
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
Alden's.

414
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,280
Oh, he didn't he do do do like the drawings and like I was a butterfly, wasn't that the

415
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
one?

416
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Yes, that's the one.

417
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Oh, yeah.

418
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
That was weird.

419
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
That was just weird looking.

420
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
I don't know about that.

421
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:55,400
You guys all loved it, but I liked it enough, but I didn't like the air raid segment.

422
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
I just in my notes.

423
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh, yes.

424
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I remember that.

425
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
In my notes.

426
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,960
I put down just like no more of that, please.

427
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,560
Green fleshy flowers had like a really cool thing where like it was it was it was in like

428
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,840
a basement or like a room full of like TV monitors and the TV monitors like turned on

429
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
with our faces on.

430
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
I like that so much.

431
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,400
That was a really cool idea that we may rip off.

432
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Yeah, it's great.

433
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,040
Who was the one who there was one where like the whole screen was like a soundboard and

434
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,280
it had like our waveforms on it and like in the waveform you could see our like logo.

435
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I can't remember who that was.

436
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
I remember that.

437
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,440
God damn it.

438
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,080
I really liked some like green fleshy definitely did this where like there were multiple screens.

439
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,880
So like if you have images to edit like big fat mama as she was, you know, famous in

440
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,520
that episode, which I've heard a thousand times now, like, you know, images like that,

441
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,040
like there was a designated screen for them to like go on to.

442
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
It was a cool touch.

443
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Oh, yeah.

444
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Yeah.

445
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
The like front screen.

446
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,000
But then again for visibility, the thing about green that was interesting was like I didn't

447
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,960
actually know if that was necessarily for the best because those are kind of small and

448
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
there was a lot.

449
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I don't know.

450
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,680
I liked it and I was impressed by it obviously.

451
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,560
But some of the layout choices were conflicting.

452
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,120
Now, now of course, if like green was our only.

453
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Oh, wait, it was John Cano.

454
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,920
John Cano was the one where everything was like the whole screen was like an audio mixer

455
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
layout.

456
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Oh, yeah.

457
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Pretty sure.

458
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Yeah.

459
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Okay.

460
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Again, like all of these things were great and we could have worked with any of them,

461
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,560
but yeah, just lucky to have very talented people.

462
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:33,520
So, you know, it was it was truly an embarrassment of riches we were faced with picture me with

463
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:40,280
that DJ Khaled holding my head and with suffering from success across the top of the of my new

464
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
album.

465
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
All right.

466
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Is that what his album is called?

467
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Yeah.

468
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Does he even make albums?

469
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
He's a producer.

470
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
So, I think so.

471
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
I think he raps a little.

472
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
No, I think he's just a producer.

473
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
I don't know if he raps.

474
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Yeah.

475
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Okay.

476
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,080
Anyway, any final thoughts because I think we're ready to move past this forever and

477
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
be done with it.

478
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,800
I'm glad it's finally over.

479
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,040
The fucking Herculean effort that I observed and did not participate all that actively

480
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
in is finally behind.

481
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Indeed.

482
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,040
But I'm sure it was really stressful to watch other people try and really hard on.

483
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Yeah.

484
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Because like I was just watching from on high.

485
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,880
I've been like, do I have to intervene and fucking save these peasants from themselves?

486
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,080
You all know with Tom's guiding hand, it would have been done with a slickety split in a

487
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
smack.

488
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Exactly.

489
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,960
Well, he did have to listen and vote on them.

490
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
So, fair enough.

491
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Well did.

492
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Uh, except.

493
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Except me?

494
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
I think.

495
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Except me.

496
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Except me.

497
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Munchies didn't give a shit.

498
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
I didn't vote at all.

499
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Completely abstained.

500
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Yeah.

501
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Munchies spat on every participant individually.

502
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,720
That's 50 spits he did one at a time.

503
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,600
Because deep down, Munchies still mad because from if we go rewind all the way back to like

504
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,840
PCP episode like 10 when we talked about the redesign and Munchie was always saying he

505
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
was going to do it.

506
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,080
And now it's out of his hands and out of pure spite.

507
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Oh God.

508
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Remember that?

509
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,440
Time for me to give my top three overrated editor submissions that everyone liked even

510
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,720
though they sucked shit.

511
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,000
Eleazar Alden, Donasaur.

512
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Get fucked.

513
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,040
Everyone else voted for them except me.

514
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Wait, no.

515
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Digi didn't.

516
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Jesse didn't.

517
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Okay, it's not entirely true.

518
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
I didn't.

519
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Uh, whatever.

520
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Okay, so there's other people of good taste as well.

521
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
I just, I just resent.

522
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Oh, wait, wasn't true.

523
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,760
It was actually just needlessly mean for no reason.

524
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Oh, shit.

525
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Oh, God.

526
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Oh, fuck.

527
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,040
No, I just, I just, I resent everyone who made it into the top 10 who I didn't personally

528
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
vote for.

529
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,320
I'm a pained appearance without some shade being thrown.

530
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,720
You're, you're encroaching on my safe space.

531
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,600
Uh, and I just wanted to thank our top six guys.

532
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
We sent them all questionnaires to give us like extra info.

533
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,640
I very much appreciate you guys doing that for us because we, we took you guys all seriously

534
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
and we're really thinking about who'd be the best choice.

535
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Yeah, we did.

536
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Yeah.

Appreciate all the effort.

539
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
We did not underestimate you.

540
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,680
Yeah, like I said, it was very difficult to choose between the finalists.

541
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Yup.

542
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
And don't, we appreciate all the work.

543
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,940
Which is why, which is why I procrastinated on brands so long before I voted.

544
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,140
took me forever to get around to because I just didn't want I didn't want to crush the dreams of

545
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,540
all those those delightful shining faced young people out there who just who just want to who

546
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,260
just want to you just want to reach out and be a part be a part of this grand project known as the

547
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:15,260
procrastinated listen uh listen to Ben's new album that's uh suffering from kindness that's him you

548
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:24,460
know sadly looking down he's too kind just too kind to help anyone uh well oh you also

549
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,940
DeVoo didn't vote but he's been AWOL so yeah that's fair you want to talk about how DeVoo's dead

550
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,580
I mean there's not much to say he's just doing other shit I guess mayor may come back one day

551
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,860
I don't know it was just literally AWOL well he uh you know he he tweeted about it I don't know I

552
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,540
think it's interesting I think it's relevant okay talk about here sure apparently he whoa hold on

553
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,660
there buddy boy what what what did he say in the tweet because you might be about to say something

554
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,500
he didn't say in the tweet no I'm not gonna say what you said what I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

555
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,100
reveal your secret cache of knowledge just saying he's like he's like just going yeah just just going

556
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,540
completely AWOL it's not a huge change from the internet to work on his stuff or is it just his

557
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:11,740
game in hardcore with his game or not he's he's focusing on on other aspects of his life other

558
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:18,780
he said he's going to go he said he's gonna work on getting a real job and okay and something in his

559
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:24,940
tweet longer said something about like trying to use that experience to like hopefully build

560
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:31,020
like a game dev career in the future that's like more sound sounds like he's going home

561
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,940
to be a family man now go home to be a family man I've always put forward that it's perfectly

562
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,300
I mean it's easy to do the PCP and you know anything else it's a once a week commitment

563
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,980
and I guess the not even you don't even have to show up to all the episodes yeah but I think

564
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,700
it's more that he just doesn't want to you know he wants to get his baggage out of behind him and

565
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,260
I don't know be a real person in the real world or something hey god bless him you know whatever

566
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,660
fair enough sure whatever man I mean I don't want to do it but if he does cool whatever makes

567
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:08,220
him happy yep man more power to him well although I know I know every every every once in a while

568
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,540
there's an outcry there's an outcry in the comments of where's DeVoo I mean that's true that's

569
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:19,500
true DeVoo does have a he has a loyal a vote is a vocal I wouldn't even say a vocal minority

570
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,740
because it's not even that small yeah there's a vote there was a segment of the PCP population

571
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:30,060
there's a vocal community yeah that is vocally that vocally craves craves more of that DeVoo sauce

572
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,700
they think back to the virginity cast and they want get me some more of that sir I want an

573
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,220
extra heaping of that business over here and I don't blame him no it's fascinating indeed indeed

574
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,460
he's doing well you know I've at least talked to him and he's doing well uh so this isn't

575
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,300
they're sad enough this isn't uh you know he's not leaving on a bad note here but just you know

576
00:21:52,380 --> 00:22:00,300
can we get a lowercase o and seven in the comments a little salute he talked he talked to me on

577
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:07,580
discord very briefly about uh eating too much sugar and I advised him to look into stevia

578
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:14,060
or sucralos and that's like that's how much I've interacted with him in the last like six months

579
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:22,060
yeah get a ping over here and then we talk briefly that's fine hello yeah oh no oh my god

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,660
beans on toast oh the what's that your cheek what's that on your little bit of a cheek right there

584
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,700
you got a little bit of a chip on the cheese did you put cheese on it did you have cheese on it

585
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,380
uh no that's not just cheese it's not good ew and beans and toast gross do you put cheese can

586
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,300
we just like ban cheese cheese is illegal uh as far as I'm concerned uh I've learned to love cheese

587
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,020
I've learned to love cheese because it's keto it shouldn't be it should be banned is what it should

588
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,180
be what what do you got against cheese Nate there are two states of being for things in this world

589
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,940
keto and ban this one needs to shift to bang what's right tell me tell me your cheese grievances

590
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:21,100
your cheese while while cheese may while cheese may be keto and those with the correct uh knowledge

591
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,060
and power to use it effectively I'm sure it can do good things but that's not how it's used especially

592
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:32,220
out in Ohio where you buy fucking chili you buy a fucking salad and it comes piled high there's

593
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,460
like more cheese than salad yeah on that fucking thing this is it's a misuse of the power of cheese

594
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,580
and it's fucked up and I'm just ready to cut the cord you know when I when I used to you know before

595
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,700
I got into keto in the times in the past when I tried to like you know lose weight tried to like

596
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,620
do a traditional diet like a low-fat diet like cut my calorie intake I would always for go cheese

597
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,220
because I was like well okay yeah like I'm gonna eat a burger right well I can eat a hamburger or

598
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,540
I can eat a cheeseburger and the cheeseburger is like an extra like 150 calories and it doesn't

599
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,740
like huge you know some people will fight me on this but I don't think that like adding cheese to

600
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,420
like a burger like hugely increases the enjoyment of it I don't think it's like a game changer or

601
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,140
anything so I was I was always fine like I'll have the normal thing cut the cheese that cuts like

602
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,900
you know a third of the calories cut the cheese guys am I right in what I'm saying I'm losing to a

603
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:32,140
bird but now but you know now that I'm keto now that I've got the all the powers and privileges

604
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,100
associated with that I've got a flipped a flip the script on cheese are you like are you like a vegan

605
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,740
man from scott pilgrim with your superpowers I was yeah exactly only only with vegan man

606
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:47,820
you get weird like psychic powers with with keto with keto you just get pure kidney stones it's

607
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,900
just pure kidney stones ladies and gentlemen at light speed would you like to relate to us that

608
00:24:53,900 --> 00:25:00,140
story then well yeah so the way I found out about this is we were going to record a stream

609
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,660
on rowdy fuckers cop killers and then you message me early that morning say I can't do the stream

610
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:11,020
today I've got another kidney stone oh my god I didn't know there was a second one there was yeah

611
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:17,340
on Friday you know you know first you know fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on

612
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,860
kidney stones slash keto so what do you have to what how are you going to repent this obviously

613
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:29,900
terrible lifestyle you're leading um listen I might have kids drink more water yeah yeah I'm

614
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,140
gonna drink a lot more water I think that's okay like I people say like soda people say

615
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,100
energy drinks people say caffeine I've here I've heard these things I you know I gotta look more

616
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,100
into this because I did some cursory googling and not exhaustive by any means but I actually

617
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,740
found an article saying that caffeine intake is actually linked to a lower instance of kidney

618
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:57,980
stones so caffeine sure but maybe it's like the so isn't it sodium deposits generally so I mean

619
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,900
well the caffeine might help maybe the sodium could be calcium calcium I don't know see I don't

620
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,580
know enough I need to find out more before I could form like a really solid opinion but I

621
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,060
definitely should be drinking more you should you should check to see if if the articles that you

622
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:19,020
read have sources that are like to oh like coke by bang like this one this this one this one I'm

623
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,060
talking about was specifically like an academic like journal was it peer reviewed the association

624
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,700
of modern-day potion chemists yeah yeah it was pretty good this was very official but I need to

625
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,900
buy the point that I need to find out more um anyway so yeah I woke up on Friday at like 5 a.m.

626
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,820
feeling a certain pain being like oh god oh god and it got worse over the course of like half an

627
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,580
hour and I'm like yep here it is again and I'm like okay I'm gonna go to the doctor no because

628
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,780
going to the doctor is really expensive and I don't want to do it and all they really did last time

629
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,860
was give me some well they gave me morphine for a little while and then they just sent me home

630
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:00,300
with some percocet and I was like well I've still got a bunch of that percocet so I guess I'll just

631
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,980
try that and I did so for the rest of the day what I did was I would take a bunch of percocet

632
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,580
try to sleep fail like 15 minutes later the pain would be too bad I'd wake up however I discovered

633
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,980
that taking a hot shower made the pain mostly go away so I would take a shower for like 40 I would

634
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,700
sit in the shower for like 45 minutes try to sleep for like 15 minutes not be able to take

635
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,740
another shower for another like 45 minutes and then I just repeated that cycle for like 26 hours

636
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,340
straight um perhaps some sort of warm compress would have you know been a good water bottle maybe

637
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,100
not it's not a bad idea it could have worked maybe but uh the shower was good trying to sleep

638
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:45,740
through it made the time pass faster and it only lasted I think at around like 3 a.m. the next morning

639
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,460
or no maybe like 6 a.m. the next morning I woke up feeling a little better and I was like I think

640
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,500
it's over I think it's done well Ben I got some sad news for you because the pain was the least of

641
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,900

it was way too long it's only suey guys that's what I got in pain on the new day

672
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,780
sorry oblivion fall I'm sorry you have to edit through this mess this is your inaugural episode

673
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,100
I was actually interested Tom uh in your discussion of movie theater well well the

674
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,380
interesting thing I was going to say is that I'm going to go see the movie tomorrow but I'm going to

675
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:16,380
the theater in my hometown which is like a fucking time machine because you go in there it hasn't

676
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:21,420
changed in like 20 years I've been here so it still has the shitty seats it has none of the

677
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:26,300
recliners has none of the new services like you you still have to like bomb in and like hunt for a

678
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,700
seat you don't get to reserve your seat or any that shit so it's just like going back to like the

679
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:36,060
90s and it's just like disgusting you know when I was young we used to go till it was like the

680
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,020
it was like uh I forget what it was called but there was a movie theater that would specifically

681
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,780
play like movies that were like out of the main cycle Patriot cinema Patriot cinema yeah Patriot

682
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:49,180
cinema there was like a dollar fifty oh yeah we went to the zeotrope that they did that the

683
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,580
zeotrope the zeotrope that was called but did the same thing were they growing like were they

684
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,500
growing aliens and like tubes underneath uh no well maybe they're gone now so maybe they

685
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,780
went home uh they were just fun trying to fund their reason I haven't been to the cinema in like

686
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:10,940
over a decade no no less than a decade hippo tell me tell me how are theaters nowadays made you

687
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,180

688
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:22,780
like go to the movie theater something productive I haven't been to a theater uh I think since

689
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:29,660
star was the force awakens and uh back then it was just like your average like reg you know

690
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:35,260
the the normal sort of theaters where yeah there's no big I mean I think I've been to one cinema

691
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:42,380
where they had the big funny chairs the big funny leather chairs I have only been to yeah the the

692
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,620
last cinema I remember going to was with my friend and it was like it it was like in this

693
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,860
really small building that was like someone's house at some point I feel it was like the

694
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,820
tiniest cozy little cinema and it was pretty neat I wish I remembered one movie we watched though

695
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,540
I don't remember I only ever went to one theater that had the big cushy chairs and stuff and it

696
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,820
was also the last time I ever went to the movie theater and it was with it was with uh digi

704
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:57,660
the the weird lines your chin is a tattoo uh I love a life of duality you see because like most

705
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,780
things outside I'm only gonna do it if I'm with someone else right like I'm not gonna like go to

706
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:08,460
the movie theater alone like I'd rather kill myself than do that than face the consequences I've

707
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:14,540
done that multiple times I don't give a shit fuck it so there are two there are two circumstances on

708
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,740
which I go to the movie theater one my local friends are back in town from a back a back uh

709
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:25,980
from being away from their college dorms or I'm in Boston oblivion please play the boys are back in

710
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:33,820
town and no no you said same are you pro or anti going to the movies alone uh well I generally go

711
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,220
with people but I'm absolutely if no one wants to go I will 100 go myself I don't give a shit I

712
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:43,340
mean I wouldn't be against it if like I was really into movies just I can't remember that last time

713
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:49,020
there was a movie that I was so excited about that I would go see it without making it without it being

714
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,740
like the thing we were doing that's another question the embarrassment was a cover-up and a joke and

715
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,100
not real the real reason is because it would be boring and I would have no reason to do because

716
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,660
I hate movies no I disagree fuck people I'm there for the for the story in the mood okay anyway sorry

717
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:07,340
go on anyway so so I'm either in San Diego or I'm in Boston when I watch a movie and San Diego

718
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,660
experience is far different so with Boston you got you know you got the liquor you've got the

719
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:18,220
watermelon rind you've just got people zigzagging and bopping and fucking just all over the place

720
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:23,340
semen drenching my eyeballs when I'm at the movie theater in Boston you get to watch like

721
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:29,980
jibbly movies there it's crazy just the height of luxury well they were doing a thing there was

722
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,460
like a that was like a national a national event it was an event unfortunately it ended I was

723
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,820
I was really hoping to see porco remember that that classic jibbly line I just don't understand

724
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:46,300
how we black people starting I went to a party these nice white folks they had slices

725
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,900
one white woman she said she said to me oh I didn't I didn't think you black folks ate watermelon

726
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,260
like that no more

727
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,020
link below I said lady you just trying to get me to cut up all the guts so you can keep all the good

728
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:13,020
part for yourself oh pete green where'd you go pete green uh so so in San Diego there is a

729
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:19,100
there's an iconic mom it was a staple of san jacan culture and all you locals choose a man

730
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,460
friday I'm talking to you hoarding plaza iconic getting torn down our place with office buildings

731
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,460
so this dilapidated once iconic mall is just in shambles and in there there is an amc and it is

732
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:37,420
a huge theater but no one gives a shit because their days are numbered and last time I think I

733
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,140
just tried to have spider-verse I snuck into the theater with my friends and then stole the 3d

734
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,340
glasses from the trash that's what every experience is like watching movies there of course you know

735
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,060
just walk in you you don't ask anyone you don't pull out a ticket you just walk fucking in

736
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,380
fish whatever essentials you need out of the trash like you do and then watch your movie in peace

737
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,420
walk out the door and you know it's it's sticky it's terrible I have a photo I have a photo that I

738
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:07,180
took I forget even I think it was the Grinch CGI Grinch that I took and it's my friend just in front

739
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:13,100
of like a completely empty row of seats I'm gonna try if I can get out put in the show notes link

740
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:18,700
on screen right now to look at it just no one's here it's my own personal playground to just fucking

741
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:24,460
suck and it's great but you know it's a fast and different experience and then you know it's fine

742
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,500
I try when I go to the movie theaters I try to optimize the time that I go so that nobody will

743
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,740
be there like that's why I'm going yeah I'm doing Q&A's at the point you know I love at the movie

744
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:40,220
in general what's up guys just defeated Thanos I'm ready for a Q&A yeah they're asking questions

745
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,060
about what movie you're watching and what's going on and you're just like live commentating just

746
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,140
live instagraming during the movie and that's why I gotta make sure nobody's around because I can't

747
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,300
you know gotta have a little bit of respect on the sub on the subject of yeah on the subject of

748
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:58,380
pete green uh-huh I just want to let you all know that pete greens autobiography laugh if you like

749
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:06,300
ain't a damn thing funny was published in 2003 and he and green was portrayed by Don Cheadle in the

750
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,860
2007 film talk to me which was inspired by his life and career wow yeah that's great I don't actually

751
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,980
know what his career is I mean I know he had he had like a Washington DC area like like morning

752
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:23,100
talk show and that that clip of him getting really angry about people eating watermelon the wrong

753
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,620
way yeah is the funniest thing I've ever linked in the show notes I have placed it there yeah okay

754
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:34,460
excellent um and yeah and apparently you can see Don Cheadle play him in the 2007 biopic so there you

755
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:40,300
go uh munchie who's this modern day ghoul that you've posted in the person when I saw uh Grinch

756
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,660
2018 with the best movie ever made by the way Jim Carrey's Grinch how could it even compare to you

757
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:55,740
know story anyway so I saw it with this guy and uh I uh I took during the entire you know when you

758
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,580
go to the movies and you get there like early because you know you're a good boy you're a good

759
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:06,620
you want to see yeah you know Roman Catholic uh and they just have like the bizarre like please

760
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:13,340
god by our procs movie theaters are dying do all this weird gimmick shit so uh there is literally

761
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,700
an app that was advertised in the previews of this no there weren't like movie previews there were

762
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:26,300
just like app previews and this was for an app called new v not joking new v for the in new

763
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,700
movies wait a minute audience uh well the first there was new goal now we've got new

764
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:36,140
v's left right and center it's just like was was like this app bought by new goal just like

765
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:41,900
youtube was bought by google they just try to mirror their movements I can only imagine so what it is

766
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:49,340
it's do you guys remember face Raiders on 3ds yeah no no so literally face Raiders but for movies

767
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,940
so there would be like on screen and be like without your phones without your tm new v's

768
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:05,980
app and start clicking right now three two one go I don't know so maybe you could like

769
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,620
choose the ending like do you want the Avengers to a no no no so what will happen is there will

770
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,820
just be like a like a stock photo of a movie theater you know where you are right now just a

771
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:21,900
sock like of the concession stand and I'll whip out new v to see the creatures to see the critters

772
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,780
run and you look at the new v app like of course we did we scrambled we like we like ripped out our

773
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,260
phones we almost broke it like like fidgeting with it tried to open it as fast as we possibly could

774
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,740
desperate to get it open and then there and there were like little creatures little UFOs little

775
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,420
aliens tried to invade get into our ears maybe plant some eggs you know to shoot them yeah they

776
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,500
were like AR what I'm trying to say they they were right right right okay objects that were in

777
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,780
your phone screen you had to shoot them you don't only see them if you're pointing them at the screen

778
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,940
would this like pause the movie to happen no this happened before the movie okay so so is this

779
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,340
are you saying there's there's there you're in the movie theater right i'm just trying to paint

780
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:04,060
the picture for myself so the screen is displaying a generic movie theater that's empty and then if

781
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:11,340
you point your phone at the generic picture it will show items on top of the generic picture but

782
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,740
not in the actual environment you're actually really sitting in the actual movie theater it's only

783
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,780
the picture of the movie theater indeed indeed in AR i'm very confused that is the most retarded

784
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:27,260
thing i've ever heard in my life no no it's engagement it's it's entertainment god damn it

785
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:35,740
i was entertained and i was engaged can you imagine one isn't enough but both this sounds

786
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:41,900
like this sounds like the ubisoft presents dog pals rip off of nintendox which is face raiders

787
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,460
all right this sounds like a blame it sounds great something gets way better so that's what the

788
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,620
movie theater experience is like in in horn plans are just decrepit literal mummies mummies

789
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:58,700
roaming about like actual dead people i saw some dude piss in the movie theater uh like

790
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,780
i said rummage through the trash or there was a lot of like you know birth control in there you

791
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,540
just not a good time just not a good time but you know it's worth it as long as i got to see

792
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:14,620
Superman spider-verse fucking suck uh hey i've got a thing of note now i do not

793
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:19,340
want to make this overly political however it is interesting but i hate the current president

794
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,860
no i don't want to yet i want to call out everyone in the comments like okay what do

795
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,620
everyone in the comments ever on the show everyone in the world who's against this i was

796
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:33,020
trying to avoid this okay me me and you talked about what was it last week we talked about some

797
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:38,700
like slut oh we were just we were talking about the um marcess man versus peterson debate

798
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,700
yeah that's right very briefly briefly and everyone's still in the comments like it's too

799
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,500
political we were i think it's a mean we were barely even talking about because people are tired

800
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,580
of any mention of politics i think they have a negative association which you know what their

801
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:56,780
fucking brains are broke and they need to fix it ironically unironically i think because you two

802
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:03,020
are like on you know somewhat on opposite sides politically um and and you like talking about it

803
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:08,540
with each other i really think you should bring back t-bap but replace ponies with politics

804
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:14,220
you know what literally the name doesn't have to change i don't even think that's a terrible idea

805
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:20,140
it would be really funny do it so you don't have to do it here look i yeah i get that okay but

806
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,740
none of what i say will consider this none of this has to do with what i was about to say which

807
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:30,380
is just that so like an hour before we started recording or whatever pewdiepie uploaded a video

808
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:37,100
called ending the subscribe to pewdiepie meme and i watched this video before and basically this is

809
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,820
this is troubling implications for me personally um basically what he says is like hey guys so

810
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:46,140
subscribe to pewdiepie was really great it was really fun i never expected to last as long as it

811
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:52,380
went but here's the thing i got like 90 million subscribers now and some bad apples have crept

812
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:59,100
in and like you know only now only with that last couple million did a few bad apples creep in

813
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,220
that's exactly the point i mean i'd argue he's not response okay but okay let me finish i mean

814
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,340
okay whatever go on okay the point is he just said like so and obviously he addresses like

815
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,660
the christ church shooter yeah who says subscribe to pewdiepie and so obviously this he said like

816
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,940
this is really weighed on me like personally this has been like an issue and i didn't want to

817
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,940
acknowledge i didn't want to say anything publicly except on twitter his disavowal because like i

818
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,620
didn't want to like draw any attention and it wasn't about me so like you know we didn't want to do

819
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,260
that okay but now he's saying but like but i want to end the subscribe to pewdiepie meme whatever

820
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,660
t-series has passed me and i don't want to make hitting a hundred million be like because i'm trying

821
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:39,420
to beat someone else so okay now look the message is fine the thing that troubles me about this and

822
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:45,180
i'm curious if you guys agree disagree or whatever is that like basically what i'm taking away from

823
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:51,180
this among his perfectly reasonable points is that all he takes is one bad apple and like i know

824
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,060
there's more than one but like he really drew the christ church guy if you have 90 million followers

825
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:04,300
if you have one bad follower it's your like you bear responsibility like you are the guy who what i

826
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,820
don't know encourage this like you have to stop what you're doing like oh this is just it reminds me

827
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:16,380
so much of like if there's any accusation of any wrongdoing by anyone to anyone today that enough

828
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,340
seems like that seems like that's enough these days to like stop any like campaign whatever

829
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:26,540
approaches tracks but i don't think he bears that responsibility is there anything i don't i think this

830
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:33,660
is more of just a personal thing the pewdiepie is like some killer was spouting a meme that had

831
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,060
his name in it and that's just sort of fucked within a little i don't think this is like people

832
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,620
are campaigning to destroy pewdiepie because he endorses killers because he obviously doesn't

833
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:48,700
maybe it's not you know that could be true but however like i'm just saying if i agree that like

834
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:56,300
pewdiepie can allow or anyone you can let a meme be tainted by some bad actors then like every meme

835
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:01,420
has bad actors like i don't know pepe obviously has tons of like racist stuff about him but like

836
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,020
do you have to let that be the way that you appreciate the joke or the character i mean i don't

837
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,580
you don't have to let subscribe to pewdiepie be tainted by what if your pewdiepie yeah like

838
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:18,380
imagine your pewdiepie and you know the tea yeah dude yeah pretty sick dude pretty sick

839
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:24,220
fist bump um so your so your pewdiepie and this this t-series things happen and you know it's

840
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,300
kind of it's like a fun thing it's like healthy competition it's growing your channel by a lot

841
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,540
and it's really exciting you're like yeah you know what this is cool i didn't like do this on purpose

842
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,620
but it happened organically and i'm just gonna run with it yeah it's fine and then at some point

843
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:43,020
this thing happens and now like you're seeing the same meme and you're seeing you're seeing your name

844
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:50,140
be you know propagated in with you know with with association to this horrible thing that like people

845
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,420
you know whether you didn't do it but like people are associating you with this thing now like

846
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:01,180
i could i can understand why he'd want to be like let's not let's take that let's try and take that

847
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:06,140
element out of it like maybe maybe not like yeah maybe maybe if i pushed the subscriber

848
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:11,180
pewdiepie i mean even harder maybe i'd hit a hundred million faster but yeah isn't it better

849
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:17,180
to hit it later and have like less of that poisoning the water yeah i think you know that

850
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:22,380
this was like maybe he was kind of getting tired of it and and like event and this was sort of

851
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,020
like the last straw because he did you know it's sort of like said like you mentioned a few other

852
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:32,540
reasons why he's sort of stopping it uh that that was one of you know one of the reasons but not the

853
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:40,540
main reason um i have a somewhat similar experience like on a very much smaller scale and not as you

854
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:49,260
know so uh horrible i guess um back in my pony days i used to do like this whole touch face thing if

855
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,860
you guys remember and it was like oh how could how could we forget how could anyone in our audience

856
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,660
everyone touch face for mage down in the comments time for the simpler days it was it was touch

857
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:06,060
facing in the comments oh no no stop no the point is like i i started doing it because i thought it

858
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:11,900
was uh funny and kind of cute and it's just like something weird you know um people took a liking

859
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:17,340
to it and it sort of became a little bit of a meme in my sort of circle of friends in the community

860
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:23,020
a bit and whenever people started seeing me online and so the first thing they would say is like hey mage

861
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:29,740
touch face and like it got really annoying after a while because that's all it was to those people

862
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:37,100
that's all they said to me in like group chats and stuff and yeah and like people assumed they knew

863
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,860
me just because they knew this one meme that related to me and like i stopped doing the touch face and

864
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,260
i think it took like maybe a year almost maybe two for people to sort of caught on the caught

865
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:52,860
catch on that i'm not doing it anymore because they kept doing it yeah and i i feel like pewdiepie

866
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:57,020
and you know the subscribed to pewdiepie isn't going to die just because he said to yeah that's

867
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:02,380
what i was gonna say like the fact of the matter is he can't stop it like if you know but i think

868
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,500
if people want to keep doing it they're gonna people i think people who do respect pewdiepie

869
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:13,420
and his wishes and pay attention they will stop just because you know he asked nicely but people

870
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:18,140
who don't care and just want to meme on people and be mean i guess will continue to do so but

871
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:24,140
eventually i don't think you have to even be mean like i straight up i mean yeah you certainly don't

872
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:30,220
have to have malice to choose to not like agree to end a meme because i mean that's pretty artificial

873
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:37,100
anyway to go to your main point about like i think it's just the nature of the world and the

874
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:47,580
interconnected nature of the society that we live in um that words change um things get hijacked

875
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:57,340
and you know labels and and stuff like that gets tainted and it's i feel it's naive to just ignore

876
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:03,740
the fact that the public perception of those things can shift to something that you don't like

877
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:10,540
or don't agree with it's it's unfortunate and it sucks but like if you use a word and then like a

878
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:15,100
year later the word means something completely different stubbornly continuing to use it in

879
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:21,020
that sense is just gonna be confusing when you have when you make a meme it can easily grow out of

880
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:26,940
your hands as it did for touch face as it did for you know subscribe to pewdiepie and when you know

881
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:34,060
if that meme which you've started has you know turned into something else and he's used primarily

882
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:38,940
by people that you don't like that can be a discomforting fact that can be even if just in

883
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:44,140
the hands of a few people who you disavow i don't it can still be like you all this all of this point

884
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:50,860
is assuming that these things are tainted and like it's just so easy just let's just seed ground forever

885
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:56,540
just give up everything god like i don't know it's it's a personal there is no objective amount of

886
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,700
which something needs to be tainted for it to be like quote unquote tainted i think it's really

887
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:06,620
just down to public like a perception of the word in who you know whoever's thinking about it if you

888
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,940
don't believe that varies between bubbles though i mean yeah i mean i don't know what's what's your

889
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:16,460
objection they well here tom did you want to say something i'll say that afterwards um i mean i just

890
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,500
think in my perspective i don't think it's about like being tainted or anything i just think it's

891
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:26,620
pewdiepie has been the punching bag of the mainstream media and like like for what like four

892
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:31,340
five years now like he's just the guy they point to of saying like he's this problematic guy causing

893
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:36,140
all this fucking shit and like you read it like i haven't read it but i've heard like people summarizing

894
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,580
the christ church shooters manifesto and like all of this was designed to increase tensions on purpose

895
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:46,060
like he didn't actually give a fuck about subscribe to pewdiepie he said it to piss off liberals you

896
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,140
know because they knew they hated pewdiepie and they had this whole nazi agenda against him you

897
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:55,580
know and he's he just the entire thing was constructed to increase tensions between the

898
00:51:55,580 --> 00:52:00,220
left and the right and it worked perfectly like he fucking played everybody you know that that's true

899
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:05,260
but when people when people have raised that point as like a way to like like you silly sjw i'm not

900
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:09,100
even really i kind i basically agree but like when people say like you silly sjw's like you're playing

901
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,740
right into his hands i mean like yeah but like what's the option here just the sjw's it's everybody

902
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:18,220
you know like every everybody on both sides but like that's my point is that like even i'm part

903
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,500
of the pro i wish i didn't even have to say it because like that's what i would do except that

904
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,140
pewdiepie himself has basically given ground and says that he agrees it's problematic now i don't

905
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:30,700
even think that he's given ground at this point i think it's just the fact that like because he's

906
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,780
been in the crosshairs for so long like this is just a way of like trying to like get some of the

907
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,860
heat off of him yeah i think they've beaten him down i need to broken his spirit a little bit

908
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:43,900
that would be my argument i mean even if even if it has nothing to do with it like i if putting

909
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:50,060
myself in his position like even if it is just for the memes like and and like was done you

910
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:55,020
know as like a way of like manipulating culture to have yourself even like you know remotely

911
00:52:55,020 --> 00:53:00,380
connected to a shooting is fucked and like that of course it doesn't it doesn't matter like what

912
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,860
the reasons were that will make you feel like ass and i'm sure like that feels like shit yeah like

913
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:11,580
i think i think the discussion you sort of want to have maybe pewdiepie wasn't like the best

914
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:19,180
to be to to choose because like i feel like his situation is a little bit it's a little bit different

915
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:24,540
due to the shooting it's kind of been loaded loaded of a situation so it's a little hard to

916
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:29,100
that's just an extreme version i mean now fuck that i don't associate a subscribe to pewdiepie

917
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:34,540
with that guy at all i mean that guy is trying to latch himself on to a movement uh but i mean

918
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:38,780
look i know the guy because i read the fucking manifesto he doesn't believe it at all like i

919
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:43,340
don't know he probably loves that pewdiepie is white but like i don't know that's not pewdiepie's

920
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:49,020
fault that's uh you know it's all in this guy's head and and like here's the thing like i i have

921
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:55,180
such a reject i feel it burning inside this feeling of like like i was saying like giving

922
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:01,260
ground and just allowing people to just take and take and take these ideas and like okay right now

923
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:07,820
let's say another shooter whatever shoots up a church somewhere and says like i love pcp baby

924
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:13,660
i was high on pcp i listen to the pcp haha uh it's like we're the reason people are dying baby

925
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:19,020
black black black you're describing the wildest fantasies right now real real situation that

926
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:23,580
happens that could happen we've got thousands of listeners we've got tens of thousands one of them

927
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:29,500
could be a shooter absolutely but do we like what do we do then is our brand tainted do we need to

928
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:34,780
shut down the show because one person is insane it's not about like shutting down shutting down

929
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:39,580
that's not what that's not what pewdiepie is doing either he's shutting down the meme the idea is being

930
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:44,140
shut down he didn't he didn't even make the meme in the first place he didn't engineer subscribe to

931
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:50,620
pewdiepie like if if somebody just likes the pcp we're not going to stop doing the pcp because we

932
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:56,460
obviously don't rebrand though like let's say the entire mainstream isn't even rebranded he's just

933
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,420
look he's ended he's ending a meme it's the same way that the guy who made pepe basically disavowed

934
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:05,340
pepe and killed the character and you know i don't even blame it he can do whatever he wants it's his

935
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:10,860
character pewdiepie doesn't want to do this but he's being forced to for damage control purpose i

936
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:17,020
mean that's the nature that's the nature of being an incredibly famous individual that has to

937
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:22,620
like compromises have to be made i'm not saying any of this is like the best way for the world to be

938
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:27,180
i'm just saying it makes sense for him to do that and i don't begrudge him that i feel like i just

939
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:31,740
i feel like roar shock from watchmen i feel like i'm just witnessing bad things happening

940
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:36,220
and everyone's like yeah you gotta be pragmatic dude okay i'm just like but it's wrong but it's not

941
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:41,260
right so is your problem that what pewdiepie is a coward for for killing the meme is that your

942
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:46,700
problem he he gave in yes he gave in and i was i don't like it but it was his choice in the end

943
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:52,060
to do it he was i'm guessing like this i'm just guessing but i think he was just tired and he

944
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:58,380
just wanted it to end uh like if something bad similarly happens to pcp and like if one of us

945
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:05,180
decides to not associate with the pcp it's not i wouldn't blame me how about this name maybe the

946
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:12,140
cat's argument the cat's yeah let the cat speak um i just want to say uh look i'm aware if i was in

947
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:17,260
his position like there's a distinct possibility i would have broken long ago i just hope that people

948
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:23,260
who are you know who who value like i don't know not seeding intellectual ground just because

949
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:28,700
there's like a fuss that you might not agree with like i hope i would i just i just disagree generally

950
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:33,580
that this is like intellectual ground like he's not he's not changing his whole world he's just

951
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,820
like tired of the thing it's not about world it look they could do this about anything they could

952
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:42,220
take any meme any of us make ever and someone if they want to they could do a school shooting

953
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:46,380
and associate with that meme are you if you give ground on this you have to say that any meme can

954
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:52,700
be corrupted by one individual doing something extremely black and white about this of course it

955
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:58,060
can be corrupted i do not agree there's not a it's not a fucking light switch like you flick it and

956
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:03,180
then it's corrupted and if you say you are a school shooter it's not as drastic as that you're accepting

957
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:08,940
the principle that i don't i just don't i mean look yes it can happen but you shouldn't give it

958
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:15,660
it's wrong you don't you don't think that meaning can be changed by the addition of context i believe

959
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:21,900
very much in performative meanings no one has to say that subscribe to PewDiePie is like evil

960
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:27,020
or bad or associate with shit if you just don't associate okay but i think about it you you can

961
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,940
choose to believe whatever you want but that doesn't change the fact that lots of people out in the

962
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:36,380
real world now do associate that phrase with the new zealand shooter how do we square that with the

963
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:41,420
fact that those people have been fucking duped they've been okay because it doesn't matter it

964
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,740
doesn't matter if they've been duped the point is they they have the association is there now

965
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:50,700
it can't let's correct them one by one it can't be gotten rid of it's like i said earlier it's just

966
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:56,860
it's just naive i just want to quickly shift like the um we can use a similar um

967
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:02,860
hold on overwatch overwatch did like a ban on something on like the okay sign recently or

968
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,900
something like that because like one person complained about the okay sign and they just

969
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,220
someone flashed the okay sign during an interview yeah exactly and they censored it because this is

970
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:17,020
what i'm talking about yeah exactly like and i it was me it was me i was dog whistling i admitted

971
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:23,740
and like i think in that in that context that was dumb of them and i like sure and overall i do

972
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:28,700
agree with you nate but like with pewdiepie's case like i said i feel like it's a little different

973
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:34,220
and it's just like it's i mean are you aware that the christ church guy did the okay like obviously

974
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:39,580
he was doing it to play into the racist you know the newly formed like not actually the real meaning

975
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,660
of the thing or not the historical meaning of the way he did it when he was in like uh at court

976
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:48,140
or whatever when he was being tried or something right yeah so like i mean yes he's a hundred percent

977
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:52,540
i guess quote dog whistling but it's just i from what i heard he just did a lot of things to piss

978
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:57,980
off as many people as he could uh right yeah and he was a memer for yeah yeah absolutely i don't

979
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:03,900
agree with the whole okay sign being censored because people are taking over uh the meaning of

980
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:07,980
it despite it actually i just think it's the same logic i think those are like very similar

981
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,220
i mean it's the exact same thing it's someone taking something that's benign and trying to inject

982
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,820
poor beliefs yeah that's that's what's happening yeah but like i don't know like it's not like

983
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:23,020
pewdiepie saying like now it's bad it's just like i'm kind of over it now the difference in the

984
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:27,500
response he's agreeing it's been corrupted the difference between these two things is that like

985
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,540
with with the overwatch thing that was blizzard making a decision for someone else's actions

986
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:36,780
whereas with pewdiepie he's making a decision based on something revolving around his own brand

987
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:42,060
yeah so i can like i understand pewdiepie's position on a personal level even if i disagree

988
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:46,700
with it on a philosophical i mean that's and you know what i don't want to be overly critical

989
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:52,780
gib here you go well yeah i'm just the the the thing that's annoying me about like your argument

990
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:59,020
is that i like what do you suggest we do like i'm saying that that's the way it is and i don't like

991
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:05,900
it and you're saying the same thing but you're just i don't know like what like if i think it is

992
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:11,500
really stupid and naive to imagine that you can just tell each person individually by the way that

993
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:18,220
word doesn't actually mean that because language like in general is it shifts all the time words

994
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:22,300
start to mean different things and people don't like it people don't like that literally doesn't

995
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:27,740
necessarily mean literally anymore it just it can mean figuratively as well and that's just the way

996
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:34,060
language is like how how would you go about how would you go about changing something

997
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:38,140
that has been changed in a way that you don't like the thing is there's a lot of retroactive

998
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:43,340
continuity going on here like like i don't know people show like obama's made the okay symbol

999
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:48,700
has that word changed was he dog whistling all along do we need to give like time stamps to when

1000
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:54,380
words meant certain look i i know this is all muddy but like i mean here's my solution whenever

1001
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:58,700
you like you do an okay sign and someone says uh hey you know that's uh racist or something you

1002
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,580
say no it's not uh that's you know i'm not using it that way like i i'm aware that some people do it

1003
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:08,780
i don't think about that there i mean it's kind of like the same argument is like back in the day

1004
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:13,500
like using gay you know it's like gay doesn't mean gay it means stupid like it's it's just a different

1005
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,980
way of using the word and this is a different way of using the symbol and that's always gonna

1006
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:23,580
have pushback because you have people who look at everything uh with like a certain context and

1007
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:27,180
other people looking at it in a different way you know because like you have people who are taking

1008
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:32,780
like modern day sensibilities and projecting them on the entirety of human existence and you're

1009
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:36,220
obviously going to run into problems with that whereas you have other people who take a more

1010
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:40,060
nuanced approach and it's just the different ways people look at things i just think like

1011
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:47,660
if if something as big like the okay sign that is very ridiculous that is like you make a circle

1012
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:53,660
with your hand right that's that's what it is um that being turned into a no you make a w and a p

1013
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:59,020
for white power dog right of course like what i read like you're like the actual white pyro sign

1014
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:03,740
involves two hands rather than one yeah there's like a historical one that's like so you take

1015
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:09,580
both hands and you form them into a blod and it's you guys know how to do that i'm doing it right

1016
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:17,260
now i i do yeah uh it's all right go ahead get uh fucking lost my train of thought this is this

1017
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:22,300
always happens when i'm in the middle of a point brilliant blood comment ben way to go no it's

1018
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:27,340
everyone everyone's like it all right real funny though i apologize uh the okay symbol right the

1019
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:34,060
okay symbol it gets changed um changed as in like quote unquote changed like some people start using

1020
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:39,260
it as a meme how many people in the entire world is the majority thinking of this as a racist thing

1021
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:46,060
now it's really just like you give it a couple years until it is guaranteed yes everybody knows

1022
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:52,380
this thing to be to be like culturally insensitive or racially insensitive or something and then once

1023
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:58,700
it's like pretty clear then you don't use it just to out of respect because like if the if you've

1024
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:03,260
lose if you lose the battle and the word now means something else then what are you gonna do are you

1025
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:09,180
going to constantly fight the rest of your life over this one thing that you just nobody you're

1026
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,940
never going to convince everybody that it used to be something else and you're going to continue

1027
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:18,860
using it the old way because at some point it it's just changed it's like words change their

1028
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:22,620
meaning i mean i guess i don't think that we're there i guess i think that it's not you big yeah

1029
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:26,940
not not for the okay sign or it's changed that meaning and you can't just say well i'm just not

1030
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:31,180
gonna accept it or you're just gonna end up being wrong what are we actually we're actually talking

1031
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:36,940
about subscribe to PewDiePie which is obviously not inherently racist i mean if you think PewDiePie

1032
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:42,220
is a racist terrible person like okay well i don't think that what do you mean it's obviously not

1033
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:46,380
inherently racist it means whatever you think it means well okay we can say that for literally

1034
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:52,780
every word so let's not yes we yes we sure sugar can my my friend like and and we will it's it's just

1035
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:59,740
it's just like i'm coming at it from like a perspective of uh you know if i find out that

1036
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:06,140
something is racist then well i'm gonna stop doing it if it you know in the context in which

1037
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:11,340
that would be you know that would get me in trouble or is just be a stupid thing to do for no reason

1038
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:16,300
like i wouldn't go out of my way to say something that i don't think is racist but people have

1039
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:21,820
have decided is racist i i just would like well you know i can do without that word if every word

1040
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:26,700
in the english language was suddenly you couldn't say it then that that would be something different

1041
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:33,660
but like i i don't i don't inherently find losing ground as like like a terrible thing

1042
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:40,460
like i i understand like if the the subscribe to PewDiePie thing it's not that old so like

1043
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:46,700
i can see just still using it like innocently enough so i wouldn't demonize anyone for using it

1044
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:51,980
using it in the in the the more innocent like interpretation of it it's just like once you

1045
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:56,380
know once you are aware then there's a certain level of responsibility that comes with knowing

1046
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:01,020
when to say it i i sure didn't i wasn't saying subscribe to PewDiePie all the time but i sure

1047
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:05,420
would have thought twice about it you know after the whole well well here's the thing right like

1048
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:09,660
what you have you when you're in a transition period like that you know because like you're

1049
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:13,820
we're asking like when does the scale tip or when does the the switch flip and all that kind of

1050
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:19,180
shit and like it really just like for a while things just have dual meanings like right now

1051
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:24,220
like the okay sign means okay or white power depending upon your intent because like a joke

1052
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:29,020
got out of hand on 4chan and now it has two meanings and while i can understand on the one hand

1053
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:33,820
saying like well if something changes we have to respect that new meaning because things do change

1054
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:39,740
over time the way they change over time is doing what Nate's mad about and giving that ground uh

1055
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:43,580
yeah and look i know there's people who aren't clued into like it might i don't know your fucking

1056
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:47,900
grandma or whatever like she'll be like oh my god they're using this symbol and it means a horrible

1057
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:52,460
thing uh i didn't think it meant that but okay i guess it does oh better not do it like they're

1058
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:59,020
not clued into the whole fucking back and forth here i i get it but i don't know i when you when

1059
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:04,140
maybe i'm being conspiratorial but when look i'm not even saying i sense an agenda of like a force

1060
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:10,140
that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying that like we this guy for example said he was trying to

1061
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:15,260
make people you know more angry and divided and all that stuff and like and that's what's happening

1062
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:19,260
so why i mean we just feel like well look obviously this doesn't mean what do you think well the thing

1063
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:25,820
is with that is that um what he's trying to do is like the easiest thing in the world like it only

1064
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:31,420
takes well you know it takes like a sentence to ruin any friendship you have uh yeah i suppose so

1065
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,980
a friendship that can last for that can be built up over years like if you say the wrong thing then

1066
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:42,380
it's all over so like causing discord and and disruption and making people fight each other

1067
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:49,020
is like not not even slightly a challenge so it's not like he can it's not like him manipulating us

1068
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:55,580
is some feat that we you know i mean anything he said like like he used the he used the um you

1069
01:06:55,580 --> 01:07:00,860
know the marine copypasta right he said the whole like i'm a i'm a such a such a marine was so like

1070
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:06,220
that's tainted now too maybe not oh that is fucked up ben that is fucked up well here's the thing

1071
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:16,700
shut the fuck up and let me finish the point is that it has an association to that guy

1072
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:21,660
just like anything he did is now associated with that guy and there's just no helping it

1073
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:27,420
and like yeah he said the pewdiepie thing so of course that connection now exists and it was a hot

1074
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:32,860
topic at the time it was like a hot meme at the time so of course it's got you know it attracted

1075
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:38,540
a lot of attention along with the in association with the story and and that's just an unavoidable

1076
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:44,140
thing like hippo was saying it's the easiest thing in the world to connect two things like i'm not

1077
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:50,300
saying i would love if people could just disregard that guy or if he got no press whatsoever it would

1078
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:54,380
be even better it would be it would be nice um but the fact of the matter is information travels

1079
01:07:54,380 --> 01:08:02,780
really quickly and now people know those things and it's like you did he leave oh no we lost him

1080
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:09,900
nate nate what nate nate uh rage course oh he's back oh no he's back no he's back oh we had five

1081
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:15,580
glorious seconds of no nate what happened uh uh yeah sorry about that um i'm sorry i guess i just

1082
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:19,180
looked at you were saying this discussion's like fucking sick and all and like talking about politics

1083
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:24,220
that aren't actually politics being political uh that's great uh but but i want to talk about uh

1084
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:28,060
i played dark souls let's talk about trees in dark playing fucking dark souls i'm playing dark

1085
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:32,220
souls in bloodborne let's talk about that instead it sounds way more calm tell me about all the trees

1086
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:36,860
in in in dark souls the dark the trees in dark souls actually my sister was laughing at them

1087
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:40,700
yesterday because they use the uh the cross textures they just take a flat image and put it

1088
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,860
in like a cross shape to make it look like 3d oh yeah she thought that was funny uh because it's

1089
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:49,500
an old game and she's a child you guys understand the graphics used to suck i can't believe dark

1090
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,460
souls is an old game it feels like just yesterday i just i got the lord vessel and i killed i killed

1091
01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:00,700
two two of the boss of the big goss of the big souls so far uh nice i don't know dude i'm trying

1092
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:05,660
i've got 40 something hours in i still can't i can't get into dark souls it's just sick real on

1093
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:11,020
switch what secaro is not the new one on switch not yet i think secaro is not on the switch dark

1094
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:15,660
souls i'm playing dark souls on the switch i guess it's like not the remaster it's just the vanilla

1095
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,820
version at a higher frame rate yeah it's just the older isn't that isn't that just what the

1096
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,380
remaster is that it's just the remaster changes some visuals and stuff i guess and people are

1097
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:28,460
like bent about that like yeah the the visual the visual changes i've been watching the digital

1098
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,220
foundry visual yeah there's none of those in in the switch version because i guess i can't run them

1099
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:37,420
or something so it uses all the old i have a question to y'all have y'all played like this um

1100
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:44,380
old bioware game called jade empire i played some of it yeah oh did you like it it was pretty cool

1101
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:48,620
it was it was i liked it more than kotor because it actually had real-time combat i always thought

1102
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:51,900
it was dumb and kotor wearing like i pull out a lightsaber and i'm ready to fuck people up and

1103
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:58,940
then just freezes and i got to like do turn based stuff i was like oh yeah jade empire was like

1104
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:04,060
bioware's first like not their first original ip but like it was their first of that generation

1105
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:07,340
because i did star war stuff and then they finally made their own shit it was pretty cool and there

1106
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:11,100
was like kung fu and it was cool yeah it was basically my childhood and i loved the game so

1107
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,900
much i could never do the bad route i just felt so bad you had to be so mean that's that's that's

1108
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:20,460
bioware's shtick yeah but like i really liked how when you were evil like like the shadows would

1109
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:26,140
just sort of like start like slowly yeah yeah it was so cool not enough people played jade empire

1110
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:30,700
yeah it's weird like it's like it's the redheaded stepchild like people remember kotor people remember

1111
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:34,380
mass effect really fondly but jade empire was there and it was like the stepping stone between

1112
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:39,820
you should you should play it on iam games uh i should yeah i'll have to wait i'll have to get

1121
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:32,380
faith you'll find it i i've been dying to get back in the video games i'm notoriously well like

1122
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:37,100
have not played single player games let me let me tell you my sheet all you got to do is just

1123
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:42,220
injure your spine and then you just have no desire or drive to do real work because every moment of

1124
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:46,460
being awake is i've noticed you've been tweeting a lot about video games lately i've done nothing

1125
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:51,340
but play dark souls and bloodborne for the last two weeks and uh it's been and i can tell you're

1126
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:56,780
having a real shit time of it and you hate dark souls and i don't understand it makes me mad is

1127
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:01,900
so miserable it sends fortress is so hard guys well it is i can't what is what are all these

1128
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:06,540
fucking snake men doing here like uh why do you want to kill me so bad yeah like i wanted to give

1129
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,940
him a hug why they sell all these traps for me what the fuck yeah it's pretty it's pretty it's

1130
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:15,100
pretty not fun and i was i was really upset i'm beating it out of pure spite right now because

1131
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:19,500
every time i say like i'm treating like twitter right now is just like i'm live tweeting dark

1132
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,260
souls like you're just like i'm just playing it i got my phone in one hand those topical games of

1133
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:29,660
playing yeah yeah exactly um but the reason i'm playing it is because i want i want because

1134
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:33,660
everybody in this chat fucking loves dark souls and i'm like all right i gotta i gotta i gotta

1135
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:38,060
figure it out i gotta get to the the meat and never play dark souls everything about this new

1136
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:42,220
from soft game and i don't really understand what the deal is i mean it's it's just dark souls but

1137
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:46,620
again like there's literally no difference like i don't understand so live tweeted yeah so i'm playing

1138
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:52,780
playing fucking dark souls and i don't know i guess it's because like it started back in iam

1139
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:57,340
games because like did you was always talking about dark souls and i was like i don't really like it

1140
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:01,980
and then we got neo because he's like oh neo is like a dark souls s kind of game but by team ninja

1141
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:06,620
who made ninja guide in one of your favorite games so maybe you'll like that and i started not really

1142
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:11,500
liking it then i got into it and i played way too many hours it but like neo is way harder than

1143
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:16,060
dark souls and it's way harder than blood boron it like fucking beats the shit out of you so then

1144
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:19,580
i started playing blood boron again because i had that since i got my ps4 and just couldn't get

1145
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:23,820
into it but this time for some reason it clicked and like i played it just on stream randomly to

1146
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:28,380
kill time i think it was when digi wasn't there he was like away getting his house shit sorted out

1147
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:33,260
i needed something to play and then i packed up all my shit to move back to my parents place while

1148
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:37,900
i got my spine fucking surgery done and like the entire time i was like getting my shit packed up

1149
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:41,020
like man i just want to play blood boron right now it's kind of weird so i got into it and i

1150
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:45,260
bought the dlc and i fucking destroyed that game it was pretty fucking cool and i was like all right

1151
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:50,860
i've done it now i can play dark souls and get it and i played dark souls and i still don't get

1152
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:56,300
i mean dark souls and blood boron well actually demon souls and blood boron are the most like

1153
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:03,020
divergent in terms of the type of gameplay and yet also the same yeah and i'm having tons of

1154
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:07,500
arguments on twitter about it and i'm trying to be respectful and not mean because i don't i don't

1155
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,900
think dark souls is a bad game i just think dark souls does nothing in terms of like what i really

1156
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:16,460
like in games like it's pretty fucking cool and there's like some little interesting bits but

1157
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:20,780
like the core gameplay loop isn't enough to like keep me invested because like that was a thing like

1158
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:26,300
i got to father gas coin in blood boron and then that's when i ended the stream and i started to

1159
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,300
pack it up my shit up and i was like thinking the whole time like man i want to like take that hunter

1160
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,820
axe and kill more shit because it feels fucking great and that's why i went through and finished

1161
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:38,460
playing everything and that like fun of the core gameplay loop got me through all of the

1162
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:44,540
frustration of playing blood boron um dark souls is combat and just like core gameplay loop isn't

1163
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:49,180
as engaging for me personally uh because a lot of it's just like waiting because you have to

1164
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:52,380
like keep your shield up and like you know wait for openings and stuff where blood boron was way

1165
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:57,180
more aggressive based which i kind of enjoyed that was like the idea behind it there's nothing

1166
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:02,060
there's nothing but hatred driving me to beat this because i just because every time i say something

1167
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:06,620
uh i don't really know if i like uh this part of the game it's not really doing it for me like

1168
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:10,860
i'll just get a response it's get good so i want to get good i want to beat the game and then when

1169
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:14,860
i go on twitter and be like guess what i got good and it's still gay and i still don't like it sorry

1170
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:21,180
bro i hate get good so much it makes me sad i just went from playing securo jumping into playing

1171
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:26,860
dark souls on switch which by the way calls itself dark souls remaster so i assume that it is but i

1172
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:32,140
mean maybe there's more to the story securo calls itself dark souls remaster no dark souls the dark

1173
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:37,340
souls on the switch says dark souls remaster right on the thing which is brand it is dark souls

1174
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:41,420
remaster because they the changes of like uh being able to change your covenant from the

1175
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:46,380
bonfire and like a couple other mean little tweaks like that are there but the graphics engine because

1176
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:50,380
it was developed by it it was ported by a different company than the ones that did the ones for ps4

1177
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:56,780
and xbox they just took the base uh the base xbox 360 well shit that's probably the best version

1178
01:15:56,780 --> 01:16:02,780
then because the dark souls normal remaster looks like shit on on pc possibly i don't know i thought

1179
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:08,140
the flame still looks shitty on the bonfires this or whatever maybe uh but uh jumping from that from

1180
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:13,500
securo to that game was like stepping into you know you know when you're in dark souls and you go

1181
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:17,660
into the swamp and you start moving at like you know quarter speed or whatever yeah that's what

1182
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:22,860
going from securo to dark souls feels like all the time and it's it's you know it's more deliberate

1183
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:27,180
it's more you know whatever you gotta think about yourself as someone who plays devil may cry all

1184
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:31,820
the time like that's what playing any from game feels like and and like that's understandable

1185
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:38,620
going to dark souls one just like overemphasize that like even you know i'm like uh i think i mean

1186
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:45,100
playing dark souls now it's good i mean i i got like i respect it as like an art piece obviously

1187
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:49,580
and i'm a huge fan when i played it back in the day but having played dark souls two three blood

1188
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:55,980
born and securo now it's hard to go back and i feel like a lot of the joy of the game is actually

1189
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:01,340
about like the multiple playthroughs and the different play styles well that's why i got dark

1190
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:05,340
souls on switch because my idea was like everyone because i watched i watched all of hippo's dark

1191
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:09,100
demon blood videos before i bought anything uh because i wasn't sure if i was gonna get demon

1192
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:13,180
souls or not and based on your demon for any video i was like i don't think i'll probably be able to

1193
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:18,140
get into demon souls if it's even slower um so i kind of passed on that maybe i'll go back to it

1194
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:23,500
at some point demon souls i think is like the they they got it right the first time sort of game

1195
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:30,300
like it is slow but like it's so much about it is so good yeah it's great maybe maybe maybe i'll

1196
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:37,020
get to it maybe you should go go to the voicemail ralph pete green was a comic genius who spent years

1197
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:43,420
quote clowning around and spiraling to life's lowest depths then he conned rhymed and quote

1198
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:48,940
speechified his way to heights he hardly dared imagine using lessons from his unconventional

1199
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:54,700
grandmother on national tv with pete greens washington he'd end with a signature rhyme

1200
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:59,580
i'll tell it to the hot i'll tell it to the cold i'll tell it to the young i'll tell it to the old

1201
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:06,140
that had viewers asking who is this man laugh answers and introduces two characters destined

1202

to capture hearts that's it that's the description for laugh if you like ain't a damn thing funny

1209
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:51,180
everyone in this chat it just loves dark souls comes on it i've got come on the mind today you know

1210
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:57,580
i guess that's what you get when you bathe in seaman anyway guys it's me uh i'm here on the pcp

1211
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:01,340
i forget what i was oh dark souls i everyone likes that's all you were saying something though

1212
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:09,500
no no let let my cheek go okay oh i i uh and i tried to play on pc i thought i was uh i don't

1213
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,740
want to say boring uh i think it says this is the house but i just assumed that everyone was right

1214
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:17,260
that was a good game i just stopped playing it's like you know i'm sure they're right you know it's

1215
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:22,700
okay all right and then i stopped to save time but uh bloodborne has always seemed really appealing

1216
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:27,580
to me it's always seemed like a game that i would really enjoy but it's on a ps4 and like are you

1217
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:33,340
joking me like ha ha is what i say to someone saying the words playstation 4 to me like there's

1218
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:38,620
no way i would ever acquire one at all but like what i like played at digis house was so good and so

1219
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:43,340
fun i just craved and knew it but unfortunately i'm blocked by by the tools at my disposal and makes

1220
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:47,820
me upset every single day yeah hey you know bloodborne that's surprisingly good it's definitely

1221
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:53,500
the worst thing about all of it is that they're on lockdown consoles i really wish bloodborne and

1222
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,980
demon souls you could just play on pc well actually i was gonna mention one of the things

1223
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:04,540
i wanted to bring up was that playing dark souls actually kind of like sort of meta ruined some

1224
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:09,900
of my appreciation for bloodborne and the reason for that is that it it became very clear when

1225
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:15,580
playing dark souls how bloodborne came to be um because it was clearly like like sony rolled up

1226
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:20,940
to from software it's like hey that dark souls thing pretty big we had a thing with demon souls

1227
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:25,260
and we fucked it up sorry about that why don't you make us another exclusive kind of game like

1228
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:29,660
that but like you know gaming's like bigger and more mainstream now so maybe like uh make it

1229
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,980
more accessible for stupid people like maybe take out a lot of like the weight restrictions

1230
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:38,780
and uh and a lot of that should maybe make it simpler maybe pare down all of the rpg stuff

1231
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:42,940
make it so that our dumb console install base will be able to play it a bit more so we can sell

1232
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:46,700
a couple extra million copies thank you very much and that's definitely what happened with

1233
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:50,700
bloodborne i mean yeah and i'm a stupid person and i like sounds like they made a better game

1234
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:55,660
that i would like to enjoy yeah i think i think exactly i'm one of the dumb peasants that liked

1235
01:20:55,660 --> 01:21:01,980
the streamlined simplification i mean all right i i hate like the the the whole like get good

1236
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:08,380
atmosphere of the dark souls fanbase more than anyone um and yet i love those games and it's

1237
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:15,340
it's always annoyed me how like there's this elitism about you know all that stuff well i yeah

1238
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:21,420
it's it's just like all right i am a casual gamer i i don't play games a lot and when i do

1239
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:27,580
i want to win all the time and so for me dark souls is just sort of inherently interesting

1240
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:33,500
uh because i want to play it despite i get mad and throw the controller across the room

1241
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:39,580
maybe i'm just mentally strange that way i also really like the swamps i don't know why i like

1242
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:45,420
the swamps but i really like uh the the it's all that mud it's all that mud like this it's all

1243
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:52,300
that good gloopy bubbly mud it's it's the sort of like grossness and the depraved like sludge

1244
01:21:52,860 --> 01:22:00,300
and and and you know blood monsters and flies and you're making me hungry and it's like all all

1245
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,940
all coagulating at the bottom of the world and it's like yeah that's what i want to go into i want

1246
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:11,580
i want to trundle through that stuff and kill everything um speaking of hunger uh uh and

1247
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:17,500
swamps uh what do you call a white girl with a yeast infection michelle cracker with cheese gross

1248
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:29,740
got them oh no i was googling what do we do we do we want to do we want to do we want to duck

1249
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:33,420
back real quick to that shouting match we were having a minute ago and see if we can't just

1250
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,500
smooth that over the entire reason i brought up dark souls was to end that no but i know you're

1251
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,220
well i'm being transgressive by suggesting we dip back i feel like i feel like we got the end to

1252
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:46,860
the end of that conversation i don't think everyone dislike that but also i have a new thing to talk

1253
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:54,060
about um please god i i'm a web comic guy and i do web comics and my newest web comic is red

1254
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:59,740
man and the things he says in four panels over and over again i love the red man this is a slice

1255
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:05,820
of live comic yeah the slice of life he is he's just sort of he's such a simple wholesome you

1256
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:10,380
know blood beast was this was this intentional did you did you like sit down and make this

1257
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:15,260
like with a plan in mind or is just something that you did dry all right and decided to make a

1258
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:22,140
thing i had in the past i had in the past uh drawn a four panel or a three panel like garfield

1259
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:29,660
comic i took the garfield without garfield without john and um i had jim davis written there and i put

1260
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:37,020
blood man i put red man and gun girl uh and gun girl shot red man and that was funny um oh no she

1261
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:41,820
just sort of didn't like him and that was the whole comic he just said hello and i i just liked that

1262
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:48,940
as the the you know a tiny panel comic and i was thinking red man and gun girl are my two ocs in

1263
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:56,060
rowdy focus cop killers universe and i was thinking i could do like a garfield uh comic with them as

1264
01:23:56,060 --> 01:24:01,980
the characters and one day i was thinking hmm i should really get around to that garfield comic so

1265
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:08,860
i just drew some really crappy red man thing of him saying i just drew three three lines in a small

1266
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:16,940
document drew red man and then i put some text on it and uh it was it was just really funny and so i

1267
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:23,500
thought this reminds me of dinosaur comics i was gonna ask if you were influenced by dinosaur

1268
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,500
comics because it was like the format's like identical of like the art stays the same but

1269
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:33,020
you're changing the captions yeah it's it's the it's the coolest idea i've ever i've ever seen

1270
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:38,620
and you know that those dinosaurs are so funny we gotta we gotta get red man syndicated in the

1271
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:43,580
slime times munchie yeah the slime times needs to come back we gotta revive that just for him

1272
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:50,300
yeah the blood times it will be called was the perfect chroma keying green background done for

1273
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:56,460
pre-emptive uh uh memification purposes no that was just because green complements red as a color

1274
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:03,260
and if you'd pop out of the screen and also it was garish which is very rfck core that's true we

1275
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:09,820
should be our endless war should saturation all the way up yeah it's it's it was really funny the

1276
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:14,540
first few times i was like ha yeah i could do this i could do this as a little side comic and now

1277
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:18,940
whenever i have something that i would otherwise make a tweet out of i make red man say it and it's

1278
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:24,620
suddenly a million times better damn that's good way more yeah that's really that's really good

1279
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:30,860
got it you gotta figure out it's a good scheme you got going there yeah it means blown up immediately

1280
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:38,380
upon posting it everyone's just latched on to it like a baby to a tea yep exactly in the back of

1281
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:43,340
my mind i'm thinking hmm what if i make a million of these and then i publish a book and have them

1282
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:50,620
all in there and ruin everyone's goodwill yeah i'm imagining like a hardcover book that's like

1283
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:54,860
really big like one of those like novelty books you get if you're like a kid it's just like the

1284
01:25:54,860 --> 01:26:00,300
big book a fucking suckin dick and then uh it's you know a huge book that's like the entire like

1285
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:07,260
width of your tour so but it's just is all like a red bang comics for like hundreds yeah how funny

1286
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:12,060
would that be i i would buy that and put it on i would i would buy that absolutely you gotta have

1287
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:19,260
the format it's just one strip per page and then like huge white borders so the maximum thickness

1288
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:23,820
yeah i would sign each page individually yeah yeah oh do you gotta have a you know you gotta have

1289
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:30,140
like hussey style like uh author notes at the bottom of each page explaining each one they'd

1290
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:36,060
be unbelievably like like orders of magnitude longer than the comic themselves it's like no no

1291
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:40,220
it's like half the pay like like the top half of the page is the comic and a huge white border

1292
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:44,620
in the bottom half is just like a long like paragraph but all the art all the commentary has

1293
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:49,580
to be about the artwork even though it's the same artwork every time yeah it's like i was going for

1294
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:54,940
i was really trying to emphasize the motion of this of this one uh you know 10 out of 10 i want

1295
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:59,340
this to be real you have a long-term goal now i just really like the way he smiles at the end

1296
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:05,500
because yes and the fact that like it's binary brush and it's all very small so like that every

1297
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:10,380
pixel that sort of adds to his smile sort of like makes it hard to discern exactly what he's

1298
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:15,500
thinking so it's just it could you could interpret it it it's literally like the money by the

1299
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,940
content who knows what who knows what's behind that like that smirk can mean anything just

1300
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:23,580
depending on the panel before someone said it's it's fucking brilliant i did so now that you've

1301
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:30,700
become a mean a meme hippo do you want to continue to melt your viral viral worth for all it is worth

1302
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:35,660
do you do you plan to make more memes in the style just let it come naturally are you an

1303
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:41,820
artist about this or is gonna be your new career path your patreon one dollar pledge get new red

1304
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:48,140
band comic no i think this is gonna be like as long as i can think of something funny to put

1305
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:54,620
i will put something and then uh my i mean it takes like one second to make one of these uh wait

1306
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:57,740
really it looks really involved the end product

1307
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,180
don't don't don't don't stare this when you're when you're just that fucking good you know just

1308
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:09,500
makes the rest of us look like we're moving in slow motion i really like how people have taken to

1309
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:15,340
to making their own yeah that's the way to win would you say i think you should probably bring

1310
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:20,060
litigation against those people yeah you think i should destroy them yeah i think so welcome for

1311
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:26,860
all their work here's the scenario hippo uh blood man becomes real and start feasting upon blood

1312
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:33,900
do you disavow the red band comic what the he like a person becomes real as red man and is the same

1313
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:38,700
guy no no red no no listen you're making the technology that every child wants the technology

1314
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:43,020
to enter the side of the tv to jump right in like you're dived into a swimming pool you get into

1315
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:49,740
the cartoon world but what's this while exiting red man himself comes out and says his favorite

1316
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:56,220
catchphrase blood and continues to beat the blood of in a sense do you say no rayman that's a bad

1317
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:02,140
stop or do you say well you know that's just his prerogative and then keep and then crank it keep

1318
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:11,180
crank it out your red man comes i would probably um uh set him loose or against uh the uh the the

1319
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:16,140
farm animals instead of the people but then the farmers would be mad farm animal blood is that

1320
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:20,620
okay is he okay with animal blood i think he's pretty i think he's pretty happy with it like he

1321
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:24,540
gets a chicken and he's just so squeezes it until everything comes out and then just shows that

1322
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:31,980
in his mouth animals to red man let's be honest i like it i like it dude draw draw draw that now

1323
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:39,180
i'm slamming black blood the other day let me just tell you the bars tab grew sky dude red

1324
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:43,980
dude red man's gotta make a uh a beverage to compete with fuck energy he's gotta release

1325
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:49,660
blood energy he would never sell it that's the that's the problem he has like a whole thing

1326
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:54,540
like it's canned and bottled and it's got a custom label but it only for him it's not for sale

1327
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:59,180
anywhere it's like cunt corona selling his like kool-aid man but he shows up to the blood bank

1328
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:05,020
and bursts in the walls and takes all the blood he wants that blood man and he and he unlike most

1329
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:10,860
good dealers you know he definitely is partaking of his own stash so so red man played too much

1330
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:15,660
blood born got all those blood vials he's like i want to do this in real life he's blood drunk

01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:35,980
brush to involve anything social commentary there are not modern you know us politics yeah okay okay

1358
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:41,180
what would just would annoys me is when people especially in the comments but anywhere will just

1359
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:46,380
they'll use they'll call it like oh i hate all this talk of politics when like it's not even it's

1360
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:52,140
really just like an opinion i just want to i just want to move to voicemails that's all i want i do

1361
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:57,100
i mean i do too i do too i just all right people just just we'll just throw that word around like

1362
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:01,260
a general dirty word it doesn't mean it's been diluted it doesn't mean anything anymore i just

1363
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:06,540
sense that may spend me in exchange they they think the word politics mean i'm not going to

1364
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:12,380
apply the new concept we have to disavow i guess okay the final point we'll move on yeah i'm just

1365
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:17,180
saying that like i think that that particular discussion could have been decent but perhaps

1366
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:21,820
it went on too long we got too into it and expanded to too many categories and perhaps that was

1367
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:26,060
inevitable because i'm aware we're making a product here i don't want to make this unpleasant for

1368
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:30,940
people to listen to i want this to be a good thing but i mean there has to be some room for some

1369
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:35,740
amount of discussion of some of these things sometimes yes there is we were we were getting

1370
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:41,020
into like the fundamental nature of language though and you know you yeah once you're there you can't

1371
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:46,220
wrap that up on a podcast that's fair that's fair so sorry major didn't mean to yell at you that was

1372
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:51,660
a built up frustration about things so okay all right let's sorry i yelled you i was just doing

1373
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:57,020
a funny because mage yelling well i was not doing a funny i was doing an angry for sure well the

1374
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:01,340
well that's that's that much is clear i'm trying i'm trying to make a joke and be like oh you can't

1375
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:06,860
do it it's impossible funny is funny is just depends on what the individual believes it means

1376
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:13,980
why do we have to disavow they make jafar like a business like a fucking salary man he sounds like

1377
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:19,100
don't get me the lamp please i beg of you he sounds like a fucking faggo sounds like a twink

1378
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:24,300
please anything for a lamp and it's just it's just not right i just don't agree with it at all

1379
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:31,900
fetch me the lamp a ladder no it'll be your last sunrise he's saying that no but i mean he should

1380
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:37,500
it sounds like something he'd say that fits into my generic employee jafar jafar's awesome

1381
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:42,140
jafar's the coolest he's such a pussy now yeah he's oh he's great he's great but they ruin them

1382
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:46,620
they ruin a new one well i mean give him a chance maybe oh the new Aladdin wait what do you mean

1383
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:52,060
there's a there's a live action one with um will smith as the genie is now live action Aladdin

1384
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:58,300
oh god is that out it's coming out soon it's gonna be at soon hey is there a toy story for yep

1385
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:03,900
yep that's also coming soon i think okay it's coming soon okay all right great it stars a spoon i

1386
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:09,980
think yes that's right i've seen the spoon it is spoon getting into the fundamental nature of what

1387
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:16,140
is it to be alive what is it to be a toy what is it what is it to worship a capricious god

1388
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:21,900
up around whom you define your entire identity on their on their approval of your of your existence

1389
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:27,660
was was was woody just indoctrinating buzz into the into the andy cult the whole time yes

1390
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:33,260
should we really look so fondly upon all this pure projection of andy's homosexual urges uh

1391
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:39,980
but that being said uh let's check with our boy sex rex for our first voicemail yeah uh all right

1392
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:49,180
here we go commands hey guys it's me there's sex rex um i was uh listening to the pcp big

1393
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:57,740
mistake uh last episode while i was having sex and i just uh what's what's your guys favorite

1394
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:07,900
say oh god oh his favorite you know a sex rex uh male i think that his name is latin and rex

1395
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:12,860
means king so he's actually the sex king oh i thought it was like sex rex as in like sex rex

1396
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:19,820

1398
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:31,100
looking at old twitter things and uh i saw it wasn't that like wasn't that like well like when we

1399
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:35,820
were thinking of things to name the podcast or something i think it was i think this was gonna

1400
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:41,100
be the dino sluts podcast why didn't we call it the fucking dino sluts that would have been so

1401
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:45,580
much better once again there'd be a divided community the dinos versus the sluts you choose

1402
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:53,420
your side ladies and gentlemen we got a rebrand okay we got listen ever since we made that we're

1403
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:57,100
the reason people are dying shared our brand has been tainted and we've got to walk it back we've

1404
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:02,460
got to roll back the brand we've got to come back out as the dino sluts there's still time i think

1405
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:07,420
i know jessy'd be on board for sure i drew like a little i drew like a little icon it was like a

1406
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:11,820
like a banner that said dino sluts and it had like a t-rex roaring but it had like big tits

1407
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:17,820
can we get that in the show notes that's gotta be a bit all right fine i problem man i don't know

i feel like i can i can i can get the the tweet that i saw it from okay great all right put that

1409
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:29,260
in the show notes assuming whenever possible uh but okay let's move on uh that that was a good

1410
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:34,860
question that unearthed some deep lore uh like primordial lore of the pcp stuff that i'm not sure

1411
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:39,100
anyone anyone listening would ever have heard before yeah damn that's probably the juicy

1412
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:43,180
shit they want to hear but uh let's move on baseball that's that inside baseball i'm talking

1427
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:06,860
third time as he as he's sitting in that hot shower desperately slurping at his hot keto

1428
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:11,340
cocoa the one thing that sustains him through his pain uh but also would cause it that's the

1429
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:17,420
joke okay anyway uh fat cock 69 uh we've got a message from you let's hear it

1430
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:27,500
so my friend recommended me this podcast the pcp podcast yo listen into that shit this is

1431
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:32,460
pretty fucking entertaining bro yo this is a funny shit anyway thanks this is your podcast

1432
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:36,540
i was listening today the best guy i ever talking about and fucking that we're taunted bitch that

1433
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:40,300
was pretty interesting to me that was pretty entertaining anyway so i listened to that i

1434
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,260
was thinking about it i was thinking about the concept of having sex with we're taunted

1435
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:47,340
bitch so i was thinking about that concept and i was hearing that with the concept that you

1436
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:53,580
discussed the engagement concept to jim davis jim davis's idea of engagement and so i was thinking

1437
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:58,060
our city here i was listening to this podcast with my friend and i was like hypothetically

1438
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:04,700
hypothetically hypothetically would fucking we're taunted bitch be considered engagement you see

1439
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:09,820
let me explain this to you entertainment because you're having sex and sex is inherently entertaining

1440
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:14,300
it keeps you engaged also yeah it's engaging because it's sexy you're having sex you're going

1441
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:19,260
for that not but you see there's a lot of entertainment and it's on top of that because

1442
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:23,740
the bitch is retarded that's interesting that's an alternate experience that's interesting yeah

1443
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:28,620
that's real good and i'm retarded so i'd like to i want to experience the other side of that

1444
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:31,660
that's what i was thinking about anyway i appreciate you listening to my voicemail

1445
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,700
back off 69 thank you i love you guys so much

1446
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:43,420
okay so so i'm pretty sure so i'm pretty sure he answered his own question there yes

1447
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:48,220
having sex with the retarded bitch is enter gauging however i want to ask another question

1448
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:52,700
nate did michelle hear the podcast last week oh you know i don't think she got that far i don't

1449
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:58,300
okay i was gonna ask what did she think of that whole thing shit you know what i i told her that

1450
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,580
there'd be a great part that she should listen to but i don't think i'll have to remind her to do

1451
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:07,020
so okay i'll report back with results um i was here yeah okay well blasted on the car stereo on the

1452
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:14,780
way to the adventures good idea good idea make a twitch highlight okay next one we got uh hell no

1453
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:19,900
fresh uh calling it yeah let's see what this is about i just don't even want to what am i do

1454
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:23,900
that's not from hell no fresh are you retarded or or don't know how to cook of course you are

1455
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:29,340
listening to this podcast oh it's recipe we're gonna be making peanut butter ramen i know that

1456
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:33,020
sounds a little wacky but if you're ahead something like peanut chicken it's basically the same idea

1457
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:37,900
whatever fuck you dude flavor wise as far as packets of ramen go for this i'm gonna go ahead

1458
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:43,340
and recommend something like pork chicken chili oriental would probably work something like

1459
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:46,700
creamy chicken you probably got a little bit too much going on i'd be a little bit of dubious

1460
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:51,020
selection but that's shit you my man you're gonna want to get two or three green onions

1461
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:56,220
chop them up into little little little sections uh take the tentacle looking bits off the bottom

1462
01:41:56,220 --> 01:42:00,140
and fucking chuck them bitches into your yard next time your dad knows the grass you can sift

1463
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:03,740
through the clippings with your greasy little peasant food you might find some free green onions

1464
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:09,100
that's pretty dope take that shit on the stove throw your fucking noodles in there throw your

1465
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:15,180
fucking water in there empty the sauce packet in there put 75 percent of your green onions in there

1466
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:20,220
and then a dash of sesame oil and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes and once that shit gets going

1467
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:24,300
you want to take a scoop of your peanut butter and just toss that shit right in there it'll get

1468
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:28,940
on nice and emulsified it's fucking great you want to take the remaining 25 percent of your

1469
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:33,340
green onions and sprinkle those along some red pepper flakes on top of your sunny side up eggs

1470
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:38,300
that you've got going on medium heat cover that shit because you want to ensure that the yolk

1471
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:45,340
remains raw right so when you put the nice crispy eggs on top of your fucking soup you can bust the

1472
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:53,100
yolk into the broth and your dick would be crackling with sexual energy hey hey hell hell no fresh

1473
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:58,460
that's actually the the the sesame oil and stuff like that is sounds incredible it's actually a

1474
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:05,020
somewhat similar concoction to a thing that I make with ramen all the time it's ghetto carbonara

1475
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:11,420
carbonara is a spaghetti uh dish sort of thing with egg in it and I make ramen with that so I

1476
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:16,780
put uh I put I put also as well the chili flakes and like some a lot of like ground up red pepper

1477
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:21,180
and then I put on an egg on top of it and I make sure to keep the yolk bursting on that as well

1478
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:26,620
like a sunny side up yolk and I burst the egg into that shit and it's delicious if there's not that

1479
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:31,660
much water in the ramen so it just kind of like the egg just coats the ramen without like yeah

1480
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:35,980
the water sort of like you know alleviating that and it's just like carbonara it's just it's just

1481
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:41,340
eggy noodles and it's delicious doesn't make that hey by the way I want to make that today

1482
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:48,220
you know why am I the first because my kitchen works literally congratulations my kitchen was

1483
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:52,940
fixed and I got groceries and I'm finally gonna be able to do my fair day in the world and fucking

1484
01:43:52,940 --> 01:44:00,060
cook again for the first time in literally months I'm so excited that's wonderful I feel an urge

1485
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:05,580
to push back on mr hell no fresh because it seemed like the main component of his dish was like

1486
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:10,460
instant ramen is that really like I mean can't you do better than that if you're cooking well

1487
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:15,580
hold on shit out of instant ramen I mean it's not I mean it's not keto so it's obviously a zero out

1488
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:21,500
of ten sure you can do it well I don't understand I mean it's an agree it like any other does it

1489
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:27,180
taste the same as normal ramen no not really I mean though the the noodles in in instant ramen are

1490
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:32,860
fairly low quality compared to other stuff I mean can't you you don't have to have a good dish with

1491
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:35,820
like high quality ingredients that doesn't necessarily I'm just saying if you're making you

1492
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:40,860
I mean are they are they any worse are they any worse than like regular pasta that's great because

1493
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:45,660
it's easy to make and it's simple and it's you know you can make you can make it pretty reliably I

1494
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:50,300
would say almost anytime you want to make top ramen I mean it seems like you're not even I mean okay

1495
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:53,740
obviously there's other shit going on the peanut butter sesame alright it all sounds cool but I'm

1496
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:58,220
just saying like the fundamental here like that's I don't know it feels like a cheat it feels like

1497
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:03,180
it's not or it's not as good as it can be to make ramen noodles every single time you I'm with

1498
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:08,300
munchy I'm with munchy and the instant ramen noodles are an ingredient like any other I I suppose

1499
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:12,220
that's true and like you'll get it you'll get a different tasting dish if you use them as opposed

1500
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:18,940
to I don't know a linguine well yeah I mean isn't there any kind of like raw ramen noodles you can

1501
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:24,380
get like on its own and then like add you know spices and shit just of your own that gotta exist

1502
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:29,180
somehow right like not just are you talking about the packet you can't just not use the packet

1503
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:33,420
now well I'm saying like we're gonna get ramen noodles that aren't like the instant kind that are

1504
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:40,860
you know like better you gotta go to knee home you go to where they sell the pasta you just boil

1505
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:47,660
noodles in a you know they just come in packets similar what are ramen noodles I guess is the

1506
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:52,380
real question I'm asked well instant instant instant ramen goes through a strange process that I saw

1507
01:45:52,380 --> 01:46:00,700
on TV once that involves something and it may or may not be good for you good but normal normal

1508
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:07,340
ramen and pasta noodles that are not like instant and you have to like boil them for a number of

1509
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:13,420
minutes those are just normal I've seen videos explaining how to make like real ramen and the

1510
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:18,940
thing about it is that it is like a really complicated thing where you have to like steep

1511
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:24,860
multiple like you have to do like multiple steps of like steeping different like herbs and ingredients

1512
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:30,220
and like flakes of stuff and okay it's like it's like a it's like a pretty complicated process

1513
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:35,660
that's how a lot of Japanese stuff it's like the katana food you gotta fold that yeah the invention

1514
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:41,340
of making an instant ramen is like cutting out a million steps so yeah I guess there's no wonder

1515
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:46,220
it's popular I think you can at like an asian market or something I think you can just sort of buy

1516
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:51,980
like new like bundles of new of ramen noodle like you're not in like an instant pack but just sort

1517
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:57,500
of tied up in like a like rolled up in like a ball sort of huh yeah okay that's kind of what I'm

1518
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:01,740
talking about that'd be cool but maybe that's slightly more complex than I remember this recipe

1519
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:07,660
involved the flavor packet it might it did it did okay he gave a couple of choices okay well

1520
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:13,020
whatever fuck that he did say it was a ghetto dish so you know he did that's exactly kind of dish I

1521
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:18,220
want a millet taste good is involved but doesn't make you want to kill yourself after the price

1522
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:24,140
okay next voicemail let's do it it's uh Duke Nishimupil let's see what he's got for today

1542
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:45,820
and we're just we're getting more members we're slowly you know occurring more and more teens

01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:50,380
and we'll record our first episode soon muchy are you gonna go through some horrible like

1544
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:55,100
eviction when they hit 20 and they are no longer teens they have to be like memory wiped

1545
01:49:55,100 --> 01:50:00,780
like kids next door style to no longer be in the teen cp is this the inevitable fate of all members

1546
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:05,980
yeah munchie's already aged out he's 18 saying that i that i'm i'm well i'm well within the

1547
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:11,980
age bracket yeah he's 18 so you know he'll be 19 but then when it's 20 that's why i'd be worried

1548
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:17,580
i'd protect my neck and my back well you know it's like i'll just send off you know

1549
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:22,700
my second command will then become the new munchie and then yeah and just keep going okay fair

1550
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:28,780
fair enough fair enough there was there must always be a teen cp indeed there must always be

1551
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:33,180
a munchie i'm surprised munchie's still eligible because as we've all heard first hand munchie

1552
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:35,420
does not have a teen cp if you

1553
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:45,020
yeah yeah yeah tom i do remember when i showed you my penis

1554
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:47,020
guys what the fuck is going on

1555
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:54,700
all right moving on uh how many how many more do we got uh like six like six more

1556
01:50:55,420 --> 01:51:01,740
all right tom so choco taco you got one go toms or taco choco everybody i just wanted to correct

1557
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:07,660
something nate said last week yeah you actually still can download stuff from emu paradise it's

1558
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:12,780
just you have to download an extension called uh tamper monkey and run a script through it

1559
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:22,380
this is pretty easy to set up you can just google it it works fine i disavow any kind of

1560
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:28,700
illegal activity this man might be engaged in here uh i heard i heard that you just need a link

1561
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:33,260
that like the the emulators are still there you just need to find they don't have the direct

1562
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:36,860
links to them anymore so you need to find the direct links elsewhere like there's a subreddit

1563
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:41,740
or something like well you know the links to download emulators are legal emulators themselves

1564
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:46,460
are generally legal there's there's i'm i'm talking about the roms though i'm talking about the games

1565
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:52,140
yeah um but i haven't actually tried it so i don't know if i mean there's an even easier way than that

1566
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:57,900
friend all you have to do is buy the game purchase them on your nintendo switch yeah that's a stupid

1567
01:51:57,900 --> 01:52:04,700
idea it doesn't sound that something doesn't sit right about that to me on a moral grounds

1568
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:10,300
get in contact with your friend andy activision and he'll hook you up with any game andy activision

1569
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:15,260
did a hell of a job with securo so you know what i'm on i'm on his side right now uh but okay let's

1570
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:19,180
let's listen up to uh lost tape archive number three

1571
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:26,940
nate well it's by time i guess uh time to face the fire go i was blitzing through the cosmos

1572
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:36,060
the other day in search of the holy bludge i crashed into a remote aquatic planet called florida

1573
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:42,380
it extended its watery arms a wet tape in its clutches it whispered

1574
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:46,780
take me take it my darling take it for nate

1575
01:52:55,980 --> 01:53:05,180
i am a being of pure utilitarian bliss sounds like it i hail from the holy nation the nation of

1576
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:26,220
hydration drink your water drink your water i drink florida with a straw i now have the mass

1577
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:39,260
of ten moons

1578
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:50,140
i mean i think is the canon lower behind these like these are our private recordings

1579
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:56,060
that this man stumbles upon we're like 12 and i still don't know i mean there's a

1580
01:53:56,060 --> 01:54:01,980
there's lore being unearthed here uh maybe in like a past life or maybe like at my core being

1581
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:07,500
i'm like the reincarnation of a pure entity of pure utilitarianism and hydration who also wants

1582
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:22,940
cochi that sounds about right but uh you don't sound like you've been drinking your water i've

1583
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:27,020
i got well i got gatorade for my electrolytes with me right now which you mean in in that

recording in that recording it sounded like you needed a drink i need my water i need my water

1585
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:39,580

to quench your thirst next true it's true best to just avoid it to begin with agree are we talking

01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:52,940
about cutting down our carbs because believe me i would love

1588
01:54:53,980 --> 01:55:01,260

1594
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:37,900
and let's get into it right now go this is a public service announcement we'll

1595
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:45,660
let you know that you are all shit my voice modulator is bigger than your voice modulator

1596
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:54,780
you suck balls especially fat but bag it you can die go down to the hole of anises where you

1598
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:12,380
the biggest voice all right worst voice modulator that no like I like that because it's so over the

1599
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:17,580
top but I could understand everything I want that voice it's true I could let me tell it too yeah

1600
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:22,860
please email me you're probably just like six voice modulators on top of each other yeah maybe

1601
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:26,380
that's what it is maybe we should do a bonus episode where we're all using this

1602
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:33,660
speaking of bonus episodes possibly we recorded one recently oh there's there's a new one that

1603
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:38,620
should be out by the time you hear it I missed it because I had my fucking kidney stone I had no

1604
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:43,420
idea what was going on oh yeah well let's understand so if you hate then you'll love this episode

1605
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:50,300
yeah it was uh without spoiling too much we get to the core of our personality and understand

1606
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:54,140
things about ourselves that you know that there was there was some light spots the episode there

1607
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:59,740
were some dark spots the episode but you know mostly dark honestly mostly dark not gonna lie

1608
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:06,380
not gonna lie pretty dark uh okay moving on we've got a voicemail from uh voicemail housekeeping uh go

1609
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:10,700
what happens to the old voicemails did he just get deleted is there an internet archive does Nate

1610
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:16,220
download them all what happens also if I make a voicemail for a specific member of the podcast

1611
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:21,100
and they're not on when I record it if my voicemail just doomed to never be played you have to spam

1612
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:26,460
the folder that same voicemail over and over and over again or can Nate just download the voicemail

1613
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:32,300
and then play when it's actually relevant and when the member's on the podcast also why aren't the

1614
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:38,780
mp3s uploaded earlier doesn't think less time to just edit audio files and not edit audio and visuals

1615
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:43,660
why not it wouldn't really hurt the viewers okay that's it all right bunch of questions there

1616
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:49,100
so okay so they get deleted because they're on soundcloud we only got so much space uh this is

1617
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:54,620
just this is just a utility question I happen to get back to them on uh and like so I have

1618
01:57:54,620 --> 01:58:00,060
all the voicemails downloaded right now on my computer I have them maybe maybe we should make

1619
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:04,380
them available in the google drive we just we have the raw ones that have ever been been submitted or

1620
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:08,060
are the ones that have ever been played they've ever been played ever been played only and they're

1621
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:12,300
all they're in order too I think for the vast majority of them anyway so like maybe I can put

1622
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:16,940
them on on the drive but then that'll take up space on the drive and really take up that much space

1623
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:22,780
though you know they are really short let me see how much is a file not big it's not big I mean

1624
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:29,500
you could make like a video that houses all of them and unlist it so they they'd be around

1625
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:34,300
like if you made a super long video with all of the voicemails in them and just have it on the

1626
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:37,900
on the channel unlisted and then link people to it if they really want it you have to keep

1627
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:41,500
making more though right I mean yeah we have that's that's uh adding a lot of extra work well you

1628
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:47,580
know you could just do like one for 2018 one for 2019 make a disposable or a straight email account

1629
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:51,980
that says a separate google drive or something indeed well here's the I think I think they

1630
01:58:51,980 --> 01:58:55,900
could just go in their own file on the drive since they're small that's a reasonable idea

1631
01:58:55,900 --> 01:59:01,900
yeah I like that they will stuck up eventually though yeah but like I mean one pack of them

1632
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:07,980
is maybe one megabyte is like one megabyte for like all all 10 or 12 for a thing yeah so we got

1633
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:15,260
we got space and um uh to the other question the the last one about like uh what if I have a voicemail

1634
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:20,300
that's first specific person like why doesn't Nate just like hang on to it until I got fucking I don't

1635
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:25,020
make any extra money for doing this shit with the voicemails uh I'm sorry but if it's part of your

1636
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:33,180
admin fee my money did not go up when I started doing this extra work so explain to me again why I

1637
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:38,860
should continue to do this when I get nothing for it because you want to it well it is the admin fee

1638
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:43,660
but the admin fee did not rise when this extra responsibility it's the admin fee didn't I'm

1639
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:47,500
saying that it didn't I'm saying that it didn't go up and you didn't make any more money did the

1640
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:52,220
show notes get rolled into the editor fee I mean they like they just get given to the editors but

1641
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:57,580
there's a separate payment for uh doing the show notes that people get when they edit so I don't

1642
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:02,380
want to hear any of this fucking Nate needs to do more work shit I mean if you want me to propose

1643
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:06,300
me extra money and then I'll put more effort into it all right well then I guess the voicemails are

1644
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:11,820
dead and we all know who to blame it's been yeah I'll take it all right yeah just nail me to that

1645
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:18,140
cross Tom so to the practice for you less humble listeners out there submitting your voicemails

1646
02:00:18,140 --> 02:00:22,300
sorry but you just got to keep submitting shit uh you know if you got a if you want one you want

1647
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:25,740
people to hear honestly it's amazing that the voicemails are still working because we're not

1648
02:00:25,740 --> 02:00:29,740
paying anything for the voicemails we're only supposed to get like 20 a month on the free account

1649
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:34,220
and for some reason it just doesn't enforce yeah it just keeps working so I'm pretty thrilled about

1650
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:40,460
that hey okay anyway moving on from that so sorry guys but the burden's on you you gotta you gotta

1651
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:44,380
keep submitting shit and we do not what was the last thing about the mp3 is going up late was that

1652
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:48,700
the mp3 for the voicemails oh I think I think that was about I think he's talking about the mp3 of

1653
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:53,180
the podcast um if you're talking about like the itunes feed the reason it goes up hours later

1654
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:58,060
than the video is because when I make them go live at the at the same time that the episode goes up

1655
02:00:58,060 --> 02:01:03,260
but then google and like itunes they have to do like a check and it takes like a couple hours for

1656
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:09,740
it to get like approved yeah yeah I could do it earlier but if I do it earlier it risks it'll go

1657
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:15,980
up before the actual episode yeah I think I think maybe the last several episodes the uh the mp3

1658
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:19,980
link has not worked I don't know if that got fixed at any point but I think there were a bunch of

1659
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:26,060
episodes there yeah where the mp3 download link was not I usually check it but uh I mean if anybody

1660
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:29,740
has an issue with that for a while I was seeing comments being like the mp3 link doesn't work I

1661
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:33,020
know there were two episodes that had the same work because it wasn't changed and I did go back

1662
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:37,820
and fix that uh all right but people keep an eye out basically maybe it's maybe it's anytime there's

1663
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:41,660
a problem like there are tons of people who just bitch at me I'll be out on Twitter and I go and

1664
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:47,740
fix them so oh okay well great I don't get paid for that either Nate that's not true you literally

1665
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:53,820
do get paid for that that is your job that you get a fee for so no no I get I get paid to to upload

1666
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:57,020
the stuff to iTunes but I mean like when there's things in the description people come bitch at me

1667
02:01:57,020 --> 02:02:01,820
and I fix those as well I don't get paid oh well I mean yeah I mean you have no responsibility to

1668
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:06,620
do that yeah but I do it because I'm why do they bitch to you of all people uh because I've just

1669
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:12,140
become that guy I guess uh well okay I mean you don't have to it's it's fine I don't like it's the

1670
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:16,780
editor's responsibility to do that shit so who's the editor for the last like two months I mean

1671
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:21,340
well okay so it is your responsibility is the point but because you're the editor that I don't

1672
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:26,300
do well then it's not you okay whatever it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what I'm saying is I

1673
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:30,140
get no ground on this point I suffer just as much as you that's what I'm trying to say even

1674
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:34,460
it's not it's not true at all but I'm sticking to that's a hill I'm dying on for no reason

1675
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:39,340
other than I feel like it well good news uh we've got a mail from best baby ever

1676
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:45,260
and this is gonna be good I can already tell I can't wait here we go well this is the best baby

1677
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:50,700
area and I just wanted to say that food is too fucking hard to make I'm tired of I'm too weak

1678
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:56,300
for to follow instructions I want self cooking food I want to cook to be caught I want a baby

1679
02:02:56,300 --> 02:03:02,940
mode I want an easier than easy mode food should respect me as a consumer and give me an easier

1680
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:10,460
than easy mode I I can't follow a youtube recipe I just it's too fucking hard I can't I can't

1681
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:15,660
don't even find the the ingredients in the supermarket but I cannot do a shit I want

1682
02:03:15,660 --> 02:03:21,020
that a self cooking food I'm entitled to that if I pay for my ingredients I should have a good

1683
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:28,300
a good meal in my head I this is a straw man I just shot myself oh he shat himself he shat

1684
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:34,220
okay okay you know what I'm I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna say it guys based on popular

1685
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:39,100
opinion which is the only measure of truth yeah I definitely won the hello fresh debate

1686
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:44,700
you definitely did I don't everyone is everyone is on board with me I am the king I am the reigning

1687
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:49,500
champion because everyone who listens to our podcast is poor and can't afford a service yeah

1688
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:55,340
exactly everyone but no I think that our viewers are are intelligent capable human beings who are

1689
02:03:55,340 --> 02:04:00,140
more than able to fucking google a recipe and when we get a fucking flower at the supermarket

1690
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:03,660
except when they shoot down political discussion then they're fucking retarded that's right then

1691
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:09,820
they're fucking stupid okay as long as I always I found I found listening to that quite interesting

1692
02:04:09,820 --> 02:04:16,780
especially specifically with Nate saying that like yeah organizing ingredients and making a

1693
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:21,660
meal is like so much of an extra hassle that you can't deal with and you want to be a baby and

1694
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:28,460
you know spoon fan right no no no you were saying you were saying that words to that effect right

1695
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:33,900
you're saying that sort of like you're phrasing in a very critical way but I mean I'm just saying

1696
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:37,580
I'm just saying you don't want to have to think about it right you don't want to have to think

1697
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:44,220
about it yeah but then at the same time you are like a calorie counting gain guy that like does

1698
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:50,460
all of that other stuff that which pertains to food which is like why couldn't you also do that

1699
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:56,220
when buying ingredients well okay but I mean to me that sounds like like uh you know a person

1700
02:04:56,220 --> 02:05:02,860
you're carrying you know 10 stones like what's the big just carry 11 stones and I mean like okay I

1701
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:08,300
get it's not that much extra work but you don't want more stones to carry you want the least amount

1702
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:14,780
possible I mean I think it's just that you have like the capability to to like regiment yourself

1703
02:05:14,780 --> 02:05:20,140
in that way already it's like a skill you already have you just don't want to apply it to this other

1704
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:25,900
thing which is very very similar I I mean I guess so I've never been a cooking guy I mean let's be

1705
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:30,860
fair though if there was something that Nate could just like use to just automatically count his

1706
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:34,860
calories he would just do it like it wouldn't do it if he didn't have to that's true like there was

1707
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:39,020
like some service I could sign up to that like scan whatever food I ate and just added it I mean

1708
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:44,380
that'd be fantastic that'd be uh you know that'd be what I want just put an implant in your cheek

1709
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:47,980
that scans everything that goes in your mouth and automatically you fucking counts all the calories

1710
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:51,900
that'd be great that being said though you kind of want to you want to the point of some of the

1711
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:56,300
point of counting calories is to like like not choose the things that are bad because you know

1712
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:59,740
they're gonna be bad so it's a little bit of it'd be like by the time the food hits your lips it's

1713
02:05:59,740 --> 02:06:03,980
kind of too late sometimes but the thing about cooking for yourself is that it's modular in

1714
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:08,780
that you can you can tune it to be whatever you want it to be like I've been making I've been

1715
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:13,740
making a lot I've been using Arlo's crust recipe and I've been making a lot of keto pizzas lately

1716
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:17,820
and you know I know I know exactly what goes in them you have wait you have two

1717
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:23,500
I have no I want to get it on it sounds good oh it's it's great I made a I made like a pesto

1718
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:28,460
with like I made like a pesto pizza with tomatoes and onions a while ago I ate that and then the other

1719
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:33,980
day I made one with a salami onion mushroom and more sliced tomatoes with like a red sauce it was

1720
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:39,820
really good it's really delicious it's really great okay I and and and but the point is I know

1721
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:45,420
exactly what goes in them and I can make exactly how much I want and I can do if I want to not

1722
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:50,620
cook for a while I can just make a much bigger one and it's it's it's it's convenient I I find

1723
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:55,420
it more convenient like getting like that even even if Hello Fresh was like okay we'll deliver

1724
02:06:55,420 --> 02:07:00,700
three meals a day to you for like you know every day for like the rest of your life it's like yeah

1725
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:04,780
well you'd still have to cook each one of them individually you know and that and da da da da

1726
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:11,020
I got you the only thing is I've never operated that way in my in my life where like I've like

1727
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:15,340
even when I was at my best calorie counting and you know most regimented with my diet and all that

1728
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:20,780
stuff counting every single day and counting every calorie eight and stuff um like even then I would

1729
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:26,540
like I had like designated meals that were just designed to meet the macronutrient goals of the

1730
02:07:26,540 --> 02:07:32,140
day and and that was by far the most important thing I was never I never like I just don't think

1731
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:37,020
in a modular way when it comes to cooking I mean maybe I should that would be better but like I've

1732
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:42,700
always been like ingredient like calorie first and then everything else is far secondary and so I

1733
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:47,900
just like found you know recipes that allow me to you know mix those calories in a you know palatable

1734
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:51,740
way for the day or whatever so just different way of thinking yeah but you can't you can't do that

1735
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:55,740
with Hello Fresh though uh you get whatever they send you that's true that's true uh those those are

1736
02:07:56,460 --> 02:08:02,540
I I hate this topic more than life itself because I have such a non-point but I'm forced to play

1737
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:08,700
devil's advocate about it all the time I don't recommend Hello Fresh I think it could be good

1738
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:14,460
if you know if the things that we've talked about on the podcast seem like they're attractive to you

1739
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:19,020
I don't think that if like if someone came to me and said I want to learn how to cook I would not

1740
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:28,300
say get Hello Fresh I wouldn't say that I will say that the like I enjoyed Hello Fresh because

1741
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:34,540
with stuff like that when you have you wouldn't like Nate you've never like branched out or tried

1742
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:41,180
to have that creative spark and learn new recipes on your own the most appealing thing about Hello

1743
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:48,460
Fresh is that it forces you into these boxes that they have like meticulously made to be fast

1744
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:54,140
and easy and even though it's easy in the sense that it's not hard to do it will still help you

1745
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:58,300
branch out because they're varied meals and they have various different ways that you can prepare

1746
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:04,380
it with various different you know cuisines and and genres of food so the point of Hello Fresh in

1747
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:12,620
my eyes was to be a a bomb in a way a bomb that would go off in my fridge if I did not cook Hello

1748
02:09:12,620 --> 02:09:17,900
Fresh well then that was wasted money and I didn't want to waste money you know buying Hello Fresh and

1749
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:23,660
then just not even cooking it so it right the purpose of it was to force myself to do things

1750
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:30,140
that I would not normally do that that was the benefit for me that was probably the sole benefit

1751
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:35,180
and after I was like okay you know what I feel good that I've branched out I don't need to do

1752
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:41,180
this anymore because I just want to do these things because I've realized that they're not that hard

1753
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:46,780
to do and I can do them reliably on my own that's the point I that's the only thing I that's the

1754
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:51,500
only goodwill I have towards Hello Fresh is that it's easy and it forces you to do stuff that you

1755
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:55,980
would not you know would not normally do that's the convenience and that's the service that I want

1756
02:09:55,980 --> 02:10:01,980
I don't think that it's the best thing that you could do with your money it's not economical all

1757
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:06,700
right it's not the best you could do for the price I don't agree with this before not to rush

1758
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:10,860
I just want to say that I mean we're not that different Ben we're not that different I hate

1759
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:15,340
being on the other side of this argument I don't like yeah yeah yeah I agree I just wanted to say

1760
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:21,420
that I won and I beat you okay that's fine I have the mind I have the mind of a child is my point

1761
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:28,300
but let's let's move on to uh oh chilling chocolate chilling chocolate has a message for us uh let me
