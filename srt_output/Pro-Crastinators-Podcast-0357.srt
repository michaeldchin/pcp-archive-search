1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Damn, we should have talked about all that incredibly interesting stuff we just talked about. We should have talked about it on the episode.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
No, we should not have.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Aw, yeah, you're right. Now it gets to go on a bonus episode where people can pay money. Money!

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Don't talk to me about money.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're running out of money, Gibb.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's over.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, it's over. Time to call it quits.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Time to call it quits. We are floundering. What do you have to say about that?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I say, fuck the police. I'll flounder, even though I'm not allowed to.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
All right. Okay, good.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Welcome to the perk-er.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We've got to go all in on the perfect comic party. It's the only way.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The people don't want podcasts anymore.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They've grown beyond podcasts. I don't care about all that podcast stuff.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sad this month.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Go on.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sad and depressed, Sven.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Go on.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I've been feeling real bad.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, cool.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, it's so cool. You want to hear about it? You want me to talk about it at length?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's going to be great content.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I mean, I would love to hear about it if you'd like to discuss.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, all right. The annoying part is that it's a feeling that's hard to explain.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How long have you been feeling this way, Gim?

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Just this week?

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Last few weeks. I don't really know.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:18,000
First off, some basic notes. Lack of confidence that anything will work out with anything that I'm doing.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Increasing pressure to get some shit together so that the bad things will not happen even though I know they will.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And a horrific feeling of nobody understanding me and never being able to express how I feel ever.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's how I've been going.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You know, well, no, you know, I don't want to make it about me.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But okay, I mean, I understand all those.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Those all make sense.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I put something somewhere.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I put a little, yeah, I wrote it down.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, I was feeling sad about transience.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Transience?

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Transience, the things being brief or fleeting.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry. You were feeling sad about the concept of transience in general?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, yeah, I mean, everything's got to stop at some point.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah. You know, I mean, I agree with you and I do get sad about it sometimes.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's just funny to hear you express it so casually.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, yeah, I'm just sad about transience.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Just sad about transience.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, that's the word.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But I agree though, but sure, it is sad, yes.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, I mean, it's most of my frustration is that I don't know how to explain how I feel.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And every time I try to come up with a series of words or like a thing to say,

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
oh, so what's wrong?

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, well.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And then it's like white noise.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Like how do I express white noise in my head?

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Like words and language just don't cut it.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You have to feel it.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But it's also really stupid and pointless to talk like that in front of people with language

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
who can only understand words.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So I'm just sort of like, oh, it's just like that book.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I have no 1984 and I must 1985 or whatever.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, it's not like that book at all.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's why he wrote that book.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't feel like I'm cursed by a robot or whatever.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm cursed by the algorithm.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So I mean, okay, what's got you feeling this way?

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think it's just I don't feel like I'm capable of making it in a basic sense.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Like I can draw a little comic and it just takes a really long time.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And you're always going to compare yourself to other people and you should try not to.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's like just don't worry about it.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't worry about not being able to make a living.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Just try your best and keep going.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The best work comes when you're not stressing out.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm like, okay, so don't worry about anything.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
How do you do that?

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I mean, it's impossible.

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's just there's no escape and I don't think I'm cut out for life.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't know what I'm doing here.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's pretty heavy.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I understand.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, it is all encompassing.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I mean, I get you.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What are you going to do about it?

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, it's two things.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I want to kill myself too.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't do that and persist.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I like persisting.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm pretty good at that.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I've been practicing my whole life.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I mean, it's not like on the table or anything,

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
but it is one of those like...

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We're killing yourself?

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, good.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's good.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, it's not on the table.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't want to worry anyone, but it's just,

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't feel like I can make it.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't feel like I can do it.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No matter what it is.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's just sort of like, yeah.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Are you talking about career-wise, comics-wise?

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Comics-wise, career-wise.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't know, just life stuff.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like transitioning.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't know.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm getting choked up.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Getting all choked up about it.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh dear.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I shouldn't have brought it up, but...

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, that's not good content.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We're hemorrhaging viewers right now.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Crying live?

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They'll think I'm going for the pity vote.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
They'll think I'm crying for views.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Got to keep those tears locked away.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Ben's secretly...

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wait, no.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Actually, I know tears are good for views.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I got to make him cry more, but how?

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to steal Christmas.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm going to steal Christmas gift.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm going to come down from Mount Crumpet

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and steal all your buzz-wonglers.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Christmas.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Bah-hum-bog.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You know what?

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I've watched today.

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
My brother was here.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is why the PCP is late here,

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
because my brother was visiting,

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and I just want to hang out with him.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And we watched a movie

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
called The Christmas Game.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The Christmas Game?

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It was like a two-hour-long movie,

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and we realized that halfway through,

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
it was a two-hour-long epic fantasy folklore tale

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
of one of the Knights of the Round Table

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and King Arthur,

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and it's some sort of adaptation of a historical novel

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
by an anonymous writer.

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why would you watch The Christmas Game

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
when it's April?

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't know.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Henry put it on.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's so funny.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
When I googled The Christmas Game,

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the first thing I find is a board game.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Wait, it wasn't called The Christmas Game.

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It was called The Green Night, I think.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Wait, how did you call it?

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Wait, wait.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, I've heard of The Green Night.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why'd you call it The Christmas Game?

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Because in The Green Night,

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
there is a game called The Christmas Game.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's Christmas Day during the beginning,

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and this Green Night, this big,

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
made-of-wood sort of guy,

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
marches in to the throne room of King Arthur's court,

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and he says,

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
fight me, buddy.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is a Christmas game.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Choose one of your knights,

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and there's this clothes,

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
not Santa clothes,

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
in this little contract of this game.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We're like, fight me,

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
whatever damage you do to me.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The person, they have to try and nick me.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They have to try and cut me and hurt me.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And whatever damage you do,

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
six months from now,

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
or no, a year from now,

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
six nights to the north,

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will be waiting in a chapel,

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and you must come to receive the same mark again.

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And so this kid, like a...

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So why would you want to hurt him

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
if he says you'll be hurt as well?

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I know. It was so stupid,

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
because he's like this young boy,

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
he's always fucking,

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but he doesn't have any cool epic tales.

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He's in the brothel,

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and he doesn't have any stories to tell the court,

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
or King Arthur or King Arthur's like,

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
come on, boy, got any cool stories?

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And he's like, uh, no.

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
All I do is fuck.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And it's so like,

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I want to go on an epic quest, I guess.

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I guess that'll be good to do that.

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Um...

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then...

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And, uh...

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah, so he has an opportunity

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to go on an epic quest,

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
or to do something cool.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He says, I'll fight the Green Knight.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But he, like, idiot, like real stupid,

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
he chops the Knight's head off,

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
he beheads him, because the Green Knight

211
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
just kneels back down and says,

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
hey, why don't you chop off my head?

213
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He presents his neck.

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's a great idea.

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Didn't you listen to the thing you'll have to get

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
your head chopped off? Just nick his arm.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Just give him a little cut on the knee.

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Like, what are you doing? And he killed him.

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But he took his head up, and he's like,

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
haha, I'm the headless horseman now.

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And he laughed, and he ran away.

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And so, like, a year later,

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
that he just...

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He just like, oh,

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I guess I gotta go.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, I guess I gotta go, and then he goes.

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And he just has, like, little escapades,

228
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
little moments

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
in between, like, on his adventure.

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah.

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Thinking that, you know, he'll have courage

232
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
by the end, or he'll be a Knight

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
worthy of King Arthur.

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And he just sort of... Because I chopped

235
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the head off a guy who let me do it?

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, and, well, no,

237
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
now he has to go and get his head chopped off,

238
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and he knows that. And I'm like,

239
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
why did you chop his head off then?

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's the part I don't get. Why would you do this?

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The clause didn't say kill me.

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It says, like, nick me.

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Literally, that's what he says.

244
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah.

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Anyway, he goes there.

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And the film, it looks beautiful.

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Acting is all right.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But it's, like,

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
so overly slow.

250
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It does not need to be

251
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
two hours long, and we're getting bored.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Mm-hmm.

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's obviously very thematically rich,

254
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and all the characters and the things are, like,

255
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
there's lots to delve into,

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
but we were just not going to be bothered with that shit.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We skipped ahead.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I remember that movie came out,

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and for some reason, I thought it was, like, an MCU.

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I thought the Green Knight was, like,

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
a, you know...

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The Green Lantern?

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Some little-known Marvel hero.

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They're like, oh, they're making another...

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They've delved into the depths of...

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, they got Moon Knight, and who the fuck is that?

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, they got the Green Knight.

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay, sure. That's what I thought.

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But no, I guess it was, like, a real movie.

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, it's a real movie.

271
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Critics love it, apparently, but...

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Mm-hmm.

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I didn't have the patience.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It was just, like, every scene,

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
there would be scenes of him walking,

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and those scenes of walking would just go on

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
for, like, 20 seconds longer than they really needed to,

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and he goes on a lot of walking scenes,

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in between scenes where he's looking,

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and then sometimes he's looking,

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and then he's scared,

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and it's like, shut up!

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Shut up!

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Just get to the part where you go to the Green Knight

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and get your head chopped off.

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, he gets his axe.

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh, he gets his Green Axe

288
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
for landing the blow.

289
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll give you... Yeah, you land the blow,

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll give you the Green Axe, and it's a cool-looking axe.

291
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Like, it makes moss and grass

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
appear around it just very slowly.

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay.

294
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Like, he puts the axe away in a treasure chest

295
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
for later, because he doesn't want to use it.

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He doesn't care about it.

297
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And then when he goes to get his head chopped off,

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the axe has grown, like,

299
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
moss inside the wooden crate.

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's just...

301
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
There's moss everywhere.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But I don't think he even uses the fucking axe.

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's just sort of...

304
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He has it.

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
We did skip around, so maybe we did use it.

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I mean, it's pretty cool to have.

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Cool to have, even if you don't use it.

308
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I got a magic axe.

309
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah.

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
All right.

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He meets a fox, and the fox is like,

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
ah, hi, hi, my little fox.

313
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll teach you something about yourself.

314
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And he's like, fuck off.

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's what I would probably say.

317
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll teach you something about yourself.

318
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Ooh.

319
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You want to learn about friendship?

320
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Fuck off.

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Dog.

322
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah.

323
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So, this is not a review, because we did skip,

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
like, basically from the midway point

325
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
to the end.

326
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And then we saw the moment

327
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
where he puts the thing and he's like,

328
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
all right,

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
you can cut my head off now.

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Wait, I'm not ready.

331
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
When will you be ready?

332
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Give me a moment.

333
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Are you ready? Yeah.

334
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Why did he go?

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't know.

336
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Some sort of parable, probably.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Some sort of story.

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
To be a great man

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
is

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
to get your head chopped off

341
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
to get your head chopped off in this epic way.

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I mean,

343
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
yeah.

344
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's kind of ambiguous at the very end

345
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
whether or not it happens, because like,

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
he runs away, right?

347
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He runs away and he comes back home

348
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and it's supposedly like a happy moment.

349
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But then

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
things happen.

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
A king author dies, he becomes the king,

352
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
because he's related by like

353
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
sister or something.

354
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't know.

355
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Some sort of reason.

356
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And he becomes the king

357
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and then his kingdom crumbles

358
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
because of war and he's just kind of a shit king

359
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and he has a

360
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
bastard boy son

361
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and the son dies in war

362
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and it's like, oh, all this shit,

363
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
this bad stuff happens.

364
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You should have got your head chopped off,

365
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
then all that bad stuff wouldn't have happened.

366
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And that was a flash forward.

367
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Premonition did.

368
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And he was back there

369
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and he was like, oh, wait.

370
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I am ready.

371
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I won't run away

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
like a coward and live.

373
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I will instead die

374
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
from a green guy

375
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and the green guy says, well done son.

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Well done.

377
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Now off with your head

378
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and then credits.

379
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I see.

380
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And I'm like, I think it's supposed to be

381
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
ambiguous. He could say off with your head

382
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
as an off with you.

383
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Head of state.

384
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Maybe.

385
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But they don't

386
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
show any death after that.

387
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So I guess the idea is

388
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the moral of the story is

389
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
do things you

390
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
promise you're going to do, like

391
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
get your head chopped off.

392
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Even though it's scary.

393
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Your land will be cursed.

394
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Otherwise you'll be a shit king

395
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and nobody wants that.

396
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You'll have like a green aura around your kingdom.

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The lighting will be kind of green, meaning bad.

398
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Ooh, green is bad.

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah, green is bad.

400
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I learned that from The Matrix.

401
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I learned that from Slytherin.

402
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh yeah.

403
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Funny how green is bad, even though green is

404
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
gross and cows eat that

405
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and cows are nice.

406
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I made a tweet like that a long time ago.

407
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We should have known Rowling was bad

408
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
because she made the bad guys

409
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
green and the good guys red.

410
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And that's wrong.

411
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
She's twisted.

412
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
She's twisted in the mind.

413
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
She shoots the...

414
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
They shoot the...

415
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I got it messed up. People criticized me in the replies

416
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and I had to figure it out.

417
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I thought that it was...

418
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Expelliarmus was red

419
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and the killing curse, Avada Kedavra,

420
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
was green. I was kind of wrong.

421
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I was half wrong.

422
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Okay.

423
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes.

424
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It is red though.

425
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Okay.

426
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I think it depends on what you're looking at.

427
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
In the movie, maybe,

428
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
but in the book,

429
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I think it's usually not described

430
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
with any particular visual flair.

431
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There's like one part where

432
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
it says there's a red flash

433
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that Expelliarmus could...

434
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
One part or no, a scarlet flash.

435
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But what I was thinking of

436
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
was the stunning curse.

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, it's the other one.

438
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Stupendo?

439
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Stupify.

440
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Stupify shoots the red beam.

441
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Stupify versus...

442
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I think they remember that.

443
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The Ministry of Magic guys do that all the time

444
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
after a certain point.

445
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They just jump in and that's their taser.

446
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, that's their laser

447
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
that stops you but doesn't kill you.

448
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The bad guys use the laser that kills you

449
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and it's green.

450
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
In the games, Expelliarmus

451
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
has no

452
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
defined

453
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
visual

454
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
flair look.

455
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Sometimes it's like a parry button.

456
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Expelliarmus is like in the third game.

457
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's like a parry that you have to time.

458
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Snape uses it one time

459
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
in the book when it's described

460
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
as causing a scarlet flash.

461
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There is...

462
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh god, no, what was I going to say?

463
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh no, it's over.

464
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Harry Potter.

465
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Harry Potter.

466
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What a film.

467
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What a book.

468
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What a game.

469
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What a tale, yeah.

470
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So basically the Green Knight

471
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
is a long, long film that's okay.

472
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
RRR is very long.

473
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
RRR is three hours

474
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
but it's awesome.

475
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We also social in the sheep.

476
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
A couple of people

477
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
watched RRR after the last episode

478
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and from what I said, they saw it was good

479
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
so I thought I was pretty happy about that.

480
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We also saw

481
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Sean The Sheep, the movie.

482
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's an Aardman, right?

483
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah.

484
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah, I've not seen that one.

485
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's a very funny,

486
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
family-friendly...

487
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I mean, they're all family-friendly

488
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
but Sean The Sheep, the TV show, is like

489
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
for kids.

490
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's a little simple

491
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
but it's nice, it's fun.

492
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I was surprised.

493
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
My mom did not like

494
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
freaking, was it called

495
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
flushed away?

496
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
She thought it was a rat one?

497
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah, she thought it was like too gross.

498
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
There is poop.

499
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There's not even poop.

500
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There's toilets and there's slime,

501
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
like snails and stuff in the sewers.

502
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's probably as gross

503
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
as it gets, I think.

504
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I know and I just don't think it's that...

505
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's that gross.

506
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's actually as gross as the opening of Shrek.

507
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

509
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't know.

510
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I just didn't get that.

511
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But I thought flushed away

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
was really good.

513
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah, flushed away, I remember enjoying that.

514
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I haven't watched that in a long time.

515
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I think I watched it like two or three years ago.

516
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What was I going to say?

517
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You know Sean The Titular Sheep?

518
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, I mean

519
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
not really, but

520
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I guess

521
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I can assume some things about him.

522
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Well, what can you assume?

523
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know that he's a sheep.

524
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, okay.

525
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, have you seen the other Willis and Gromit movies?

526
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, well, several of them.

527
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Have you seen A Close Shave?

528
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's the one with the dog that's a robot

529
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and all the sheep and including Sean.

530
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The dog?

531
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Wait, I'm thinking of

532
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
the dog that's a robot.

533
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm thinking of the wrong trousers.

534
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The wrong trousers is the one where the trousers

535
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
are incorrect and there's a penguin

536
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and there's a penguin in a diamond

537
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
house and

538
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
that's the penguin one.

539
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The Close Shave is the one where

540
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Willis falls in love with

541
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
a lady at the wool, the knitting store.

542
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
She's got all this wool

543
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and

544
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
there's this dog

545
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
that

546
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
provides her with the wool but it's kind of

547
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
a really weird bully dog,

548
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
nasty dog, Gromit hates him

549
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and Gromit realizes that the dog's

550
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
evil but nobody believes him

551
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
because the lady believes

552
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
the dog and Willis believes the lady

553
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and so Gromit

554
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
is

555
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
something happens

556
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
but there's sheep, right?

557
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And it's actually the dog

558
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
is evil.

559
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Evil dog. He's a robot

560
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
scary dog, scary robot

561
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
dog made of robots.

562
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yes.

563
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's made of robots?

564
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I think the thing was

565
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
her dad was

566
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
an inventor and he

567
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
invented the dog to look after her

568
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
but it sort of goes too far

569
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I think.

570
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I thought I'd seen all the

571
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Wallace and Gromits but maybe I didn't see that one

572
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
because that doesn't sound familiar at all.

573
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That is probably

574
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
that is one of my favorites

575
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I would say

576
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I've seen the wrong trousers

577
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and I've seen the first one where they go to the moon.

578
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The grand day out.

579
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I thought I'd seen the third one too but

580
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
what you're describing

581
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I have no recollection of a

582
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
of a dog made of robots.

583
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I mean it's a reveal at the end

584
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
but like

585
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I guess this is what he looks like.

586
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let me

587
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This is where his skin has been torn off in the contraption

588
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and you can see his robotness

589
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I put a gif

590
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Wait a minute

591
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yes

592
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yes I have seen

593
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
this creature

594
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's nightmare fuel

595
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I was so small when I saw this one

596
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's the scariest movie I've ever seen

597
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I agree

598
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And Gromit there's

599
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
an amazing like night chase

600
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
on the motorway where

601
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Gromit tries to save the sheep

602
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
on a motorbike

603
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and Gromit tries to save all the sheep

604
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and then there's another thing where like

605
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Gromit gets a little

606
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh it's so fucking cool

607
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
He gets a little aeroplane

608
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
with a porridge gun on the front

609
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh the porridge gun

610
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah

611
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I do definitely remember that

612
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Well it's so Gromit

613
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
it's so fucking good

614
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
in any other franchise

615
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's better than the Avengers

616
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh yeah

617
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Iron Man couldn't do fucking shit about it

618
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
against Wallace

619
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
My dad

620
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
really liked

621
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
My dad really liked Wallace and Gromit

622
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and I

623
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
as a kid I accidentally recorded

624
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Pokemon over our copy

625
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
of the wrong trousers

626
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
My dad was really pissed at me

627
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Why do I have that same memory?

628
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Why do I have that exact memory

629
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
of the wrong trousers being taped over

630
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and so we couldn't watch the beginning of it

631
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I guess it's just one of those things

632
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Just one of those things

633
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Everyone has to deal with it

634
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Every father has to deal with their child

635
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
taping over their copy

636
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
of the wrong trousers

637
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Well that's it for this week

638
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
See you later

639
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What do I got in my notes

640
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
What do I got in my notes for the week

641
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh me and

642
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I bought some more government bonds

643
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I

644
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I indulged in fiscal responsibility

645
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and I purchased more eye bonds

646
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and me and

647
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Asterios

648
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
was like super stoked

649
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
to see me talking about eye bonds

650
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
on the Twitter timeline

651
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
He was like aww eye bonds

652
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
so much I called my mom about them

653
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's like cool man

654
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Gotta have a hobby huh

655
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Fiscal responsibility

656
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I prefer video games

657
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You know it's actually a pretty good hobby

658
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You know it's actually a pretty good hobby

659
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
because then you have money afterwards

660
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
after you get all done with it

661
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I know you said don't talk to me about money

662
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
but guess what idiot I'm gonna

663
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Did I think I've probably explained what eye bonds do before

664
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
but maybe

665
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
They you

666
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
you connect

667
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
a robot that deals

668
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
in currency to your eye

669
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and then you can see the money

670
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You can see the money

671
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I could see this computer

672
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I could sell that for $50

673
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
This bottle of water I could sell that for $0.50

674
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I could take it all

675
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I could zap it with my old VR gun

676
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
turn it into currency

677
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
An eye bond is a government bond

678
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
whose inflation

679
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
not inflation rate

680
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What's the thing for when you put

681
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
your money in something

682
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Interest rate is fixed to inflation

683
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So last year

684
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You know thanks to

685
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Biden, thanks to Brandon

686
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You know inflation was really high

687
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So the eye bond return rate

688
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
was an unbelievable 9%

689
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So

690
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
A 9% return on an investment

691
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
is like

692
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You never get that, that doesn't even happen

693
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But this was on a government bond

694
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
which is like one of the safest

695
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and most stable

696
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
investments that a person can make

697
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So it was like a no brainer

698
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So I dumped as much money as I could

699
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
into eye bonds

700
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And for six months I was getting that sweet sweet

701
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
9% return

702
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's you know and then

703
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
just the other day

704
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
at the end of April it was going to be

705
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
like a new period or whatever

706
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So at this point

707
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the interest rate is not 9% anymore

708
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Now it's like almost 7%

709
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Which is still pretty good

710
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's still pretty good

711
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So I dumped some more money in there

712
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
to get that 7%

713
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And then if it keeps going down

714
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I probably won't continue to do eye bonds

715
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But like for the time being

716
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm putting as much money into eye bonds as I can

717
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And just letting it

718
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
get as much interest as I can get out of it

719
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Cause it's just you know

720
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
9% Gib

721
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
9%

722
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's very good

723
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Considered from another perspective

724
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's not so much good

725
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's not so much like oh hell yeah

726
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm gaining 9%

727
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's like if I don't put money in there

728
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm losing 9%

729
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Because inflation is devastating 9%

730
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
of the money that I do have

731
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So you know

732
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Either way you gotta do it

733
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Conceived of the one way

734
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's like I got something

735
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Conceived of another way

736
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's like I protected

737
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
a portion of my assets

738
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
from an inevitable devastation

739
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So you know

740
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Tomato, tomato

741
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's not that I feel bad about you doing it

742
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's a feel I feel bad about me

743
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
not being good enough

744
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
to do

745
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
organizing

746
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Fiscal responsibility

747
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's never a bad time for fiscal responsibility Gib

748
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's never a bad time

749
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Never a bad time

750
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Just feel so pathetic

751
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Here's the thing

752
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Maybe I'm just a wacky weirdo

753
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
or something

754
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I have gotten to the point

755
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
where I find discovering

756
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
money loopholes like fun

757
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I like

758
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I don't know I find it like a gratifying thing

759
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
to like

760
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
look into and learn about

761
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Like I watch

762
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I watch the YouTuber called Patrick Boyle

763
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
who is like an accountant or something

764
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I watch Patrick Boyle

765
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and learn about like the latest crypto

766
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
scams or whatever

767
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and um

768
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You know I was watching one of his videos

769
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
recently

770
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and uh

771
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
it did occur to me

772
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It did occur to me

773
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
that like really from any

774
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
from any rational

775
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
um

776
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
person's point of view any rational like

777
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
financial investor

778
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
like all this stuff that I do oh and putting my money

779
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
in I-bonds uh churning my credit cards

780
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
uh you know

781
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
using cash back programs and stuff

782
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
all of that is like

783
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
at the end of the day it's very marginal

784
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
that's me like doing scraping

785
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
whatever strategies I can together

786
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
to mitigate the effects

787
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
of you know like the true

788
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
the true horror

789
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
the true devastation that I face

790
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
which is that I just don't have just like

791
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
a real job

792
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
like a regular

793
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
person just has a regular job and a salary

794
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and like

795
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
it's that's just like a million times more reasonable

796
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
than everything everything else

797
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
that I'm doing so everything else that I do

798
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
is just to try and mitigate the effects

799
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
of me not doing that

800
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
uh and I can pat myself

801
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
on the back for getting two percent cash back

802
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
or whatever all I want but um

803
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
you know

804
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
uh

805
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
yeah I mean

806
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
but like

807
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
it's it's good to do if you're in a

808
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
situation it is it's good it would be

809
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
it would be good to do it would be good to do no matter

810
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
what I mean if I if I was making

811
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
real money then

812
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
getting two percent cash back on all my spending

813
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
would be even better it would be an even

814
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
better thing to do

815
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
um so it's good

816
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
but yeah I was I was

817
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
listening to him it was listening to Patrick Boyle

818
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and he did a one about he was talking

819
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
about the video was about

820
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
investment strategies

821
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
like

822
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
academic people

823
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
that recommend versus what like popular

824
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
like authors and like

825
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
influencers recommend

826
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
and how they don't always recommend the same things

827
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and just yeah the emphasis

828
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
on the emphasis on like

829
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
planning for retirement and on like trying

830
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
to like hit a certain like savings

831
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
goal by a certain point in retirement

832
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
it's like wow

833
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I haven't planned for that at all

834
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm literally just

835
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
happy to I'm I'm I'm just

836
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
happy to have paid my

837
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
rent and not have less money

838
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
at the end of the year than I did

839
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
the year before that's success

840
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
to me and that's and

841
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
that's bad

842
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
that's not good

843
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
but

844
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
anything else just seems

845
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
so hard

846
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
like I would have to completely

847
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
upend my life

848
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
to do anything else

849
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
yeah

850
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
when I get old I'm just gonna hurl myself

851
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
off a cliff

852
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm gonna make sure I'm live streaming it

853
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
that's my life insurance you've never seen

854
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
content like this before

855
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
just want to bounce sound

856
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
oh no

857
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
you know what Gib

858
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'll tell you this if it makes you feel any

859
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
better I wouldn't watch it

860
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I wouldn't watch it I turn my eyes away

861
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and say no I can't look

862
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
okay

863
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
yeah I don't know like things like

864
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
owning property

865
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
having a pension in any

866
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
fashion oh god a pension

867
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
doing like

868
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
well being

869
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
any amount of success

870
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
having

871
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
money at all

872
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
just doesn't make any sense

873
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
doesn't even register as a thing

874
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
until I'm reminded about

875
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
how I'm not doing it I'm like oh yeah

876
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I understand

877
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I don't know I guess it has become

878
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
sort of a hobby for me

879
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
looking into how to

880
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
how to how to

881
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
what's the word

882
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
how to squeeze as much

883
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
value as I possibly can

884
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
out of what money I do have

885
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
um

886
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
actually a stereos

887
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
okay a long time ago

888
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
we had um

889
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
cheesy just made a funny comic

890
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm going to like it

891
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm gonna hit like on that tweet

892
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
um a stereos

893
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
recommended to me

894
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
he recommended to me a couple of like bank

895
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
things he recommended me a couple of counts

896
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
that I could keep my money in

897
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and that would earn like 4%

898
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
or like 4.25%

899
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and I was like blown away by that

900
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I was like how can it be

901
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
how can that be that high

902
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
because when we had um Minerva

903
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Minerva double cast remember

904
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
is that her name is that her real name

905
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
or does she have a different name now

906
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I remember double cast

907
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
we had double cast on because she I guess

908
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
is like a CPA or something and she was recommending

909
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I think I asked her

910
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
about like what I should invest in and she recommended

911
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
like a market linked

912
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
fuck

913
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
was it like a market linked mutual fund

914
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
or something like that

915
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
and um I never really looked into that

916
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
because I'm stupid

917
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
a stereos said he had a couple of like

918
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
banks that offer like

919
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
4% and like that's crazy

920
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
because my bank

921
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
of America savings account which I've kept

922
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
my money in for my entire life

923
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
offers like 0.01%

924
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
interest

925
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
so nothing

926
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
um if I'd been man if I'd been

927
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
earning 4% I would have

928
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
that would that would be significant

929
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
that's a considerable

930
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
amount of money that I have basically

931
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
thrown down the drain

932
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
by using

933
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
a bank of America savings account like a fucking moron

934
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
so

935
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
you know the way I see it

936
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
the way I see it right

937
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
it's like

938
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
you

939
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I can bemoan

940
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
that like oh I should have done that and then

941
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I would have more money now like yeah true

942
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
yeah true but it's more

943
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
productive and a little bit more

944
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
what's the word

945
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
encouraging to look at it like

946
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
you're in a boat

947
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and you're and the money

948
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
that you have

949
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
is the wait you're you're either

950
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
sinking or you're floating

951
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and so if you manage to like if you manage to patch

952
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
a hole you know if you're

953
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
sinking now that's bad but if you patch

954
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
a hole you shouldn't you shouldn't bemoan the water

955
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
that's that's come in already

956
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
you patch a hole and you stop the leak

957
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
or whatever it's like no no no don't

958
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
don't get upset about the water that leaked in already

959
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
just feel good that you patch the hole you're doing better

960
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
now you're on it you're on it you've improved

961
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
your trajectory

962
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
um that's what I like to do I feel

963
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
like oh I can get I can get two percent

964
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
cash back instead of one point five bam

965
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I've improved my trajectory because what that

966
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
means now is that I'll get

967
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
like that's like uh that's like an extra

968
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
hundred dollars that's like an extra hundred dollars

969
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'll get every year for the rest of my life

970
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
for doing nothing and then every time I find

971
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
a hack like that I feel like

972
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
that's an extra hundred dollars I'll get a year

973
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
every for the rest of my life well

974
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
that's a hundred dollars worth of work

975
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
that I don't have to worry about doing

976
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
ever again

977
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
uh that's why it's so gratifying

978
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
when I find a trick or a

979
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
cheat or something

980
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
uh yeah this is how

981
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
this is how it's

982
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I make it fun for me

983
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
cheating the system

984
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
imagine if I get a job

985
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
imagine if I get a job and then I'm gonna get a salary

986
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and I'm like oh to me they'll pay me like

987
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
twice a month I'm cheating this system so bad

988
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I hacked it guys wait until

989
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
the people online hear about this

990
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
this this this incredible

991
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
life hack that I found you mean that capital

992
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
owners will just will just pay

993
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
you they'll just compensate you for labor

994
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
holy shit

995
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
uh

996
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
yeah

997
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
yeah

998
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
um I think I've said this

999
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
before I think I should I think I should

1000
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
probably

1001
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I think I should probably look into

1002
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
some form of real job

1003
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
it may be maybe later this year

1004
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
after after I do the

1005
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
after after I do the the

1006
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
the slime and punishment kickstarter and maybe

1007
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
pump out one more lecture at that point I think

1008
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I might be like alright

1009
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
time to start throwing my resume around

1010
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and see if I can't find a

1011
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
a real job with benefits

1012
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and you know I can still do lectures

1013
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000

give me a job and they're like hmm

1040
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
but I see from your record that you haven't

1041
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
you haven't lived the life you haven't had

1042
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
enough cavities filled yet we're gonna have to drill

1043
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
it you have to be on the other side

1044
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
of the drill before we'll let you

1045
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
we'll let you be on our side

1046
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
so you know

1047
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
open wide bitch

1048
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000

1049
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
we're gonna root canalia

1050
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
how can you how can you how can you trust you

1051
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
to deliver a root canal

1052
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
if you can't if you

1053
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
can't take a root canal

1054
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I've just thought about what

1055
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
dentist school would be like there's probably like skulls

1056
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
all over the place and it's like alright

1057
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
now fuck with this skull

1058
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
alright now measure now measure the

1059
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the relative the width versus the height

1060
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
you know determine determine its ethnicity

1061
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
determine

1062
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
determine this skull's ethnicity and it's

1063
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
likely IQ

1064
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
uh go do I need to know that

1065
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
yeah uh for this school

1066
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
you do here at

1067
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
here at Hogwarts Dentistry

1068
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Hogwarts Dentistry

1069
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
they just go wibbly wibbly splat

1070
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
you've got no problems

1071
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
yes and then it's done

1072
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and then so in their spare time

1073
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
they just do phrenology they just

1074
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
they just compare

1075
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
various skulls

1076
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
stupid most of them probably were

1077
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000

1078
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
were you on Quailoos

1111
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
were you were you taken

1112
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
were you taken that that that Ivermectin

1113
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
were you taken Ivermectin when you

1114
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
heard it when you thought of Ilvermorny

1115
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I think we've I think we've cracked

1116
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
the case here oh it's in Massachusetts

1117
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
it's in Mount Greylock

1118
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
in Massachusetts is that a real mountain

1119
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
wait mount

1120
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
grey

1121
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
oh it is

1122
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
wait how far how far is it from where I live

1123
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
you're you're a confirmed muggle

1124
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
you can't see it you can't see the castle

1125
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
no that's not

1126
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
that's not true I just didn't get my I

1127
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
didn't get my letter by Thunderbird

1128
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
what's

1129
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
okay Mount

1130
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
why is it on Mount Greylock

1131
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
why that mountain

1132
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
sounds cool does sound cool

1133
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Mount Greylock

1134
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Castle Grayskull

1135
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
yes

1136
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
from from my house

1137
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
oh wow

1138
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
okay it's on like the far west

1139
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
edge of Massachusetts

1140
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
so it's a it's a it's about

1141
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
as far from me as anything in Massachusetts

1142
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
can be but it's only a 40

1143
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
oh no it's a 46 hour

1144
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
walk yeah Lamal

1145
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
it's a two it's a two-and-a-half hour drive

1146
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
it's not even bad

1147
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
it's not even bad

1148
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
America is so fucking big

1149
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
well now well now I know

1150
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
it's so crazy that

1151
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
you you have such a huge country

1152
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and so much of your

1153
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
infrastructure is road based when

1154
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
that's so inefficient for such

1155
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
large distances

1156
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I saw some

1157
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
gas this is because you just have

1158
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
so much gas but like Lamal

1159
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
this was this was a while ago I saw

1160
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
someone tweet about like

1161
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
it was like stop

1162
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
stop stop stop

1163
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
comparing the US is like rail

1164
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
infrastructure to like Europe's

1165
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and it was like

1166
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
placed

1167
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and it like placed the like the US

1168
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
against Europe and it basically the

1169
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
point of it was it visually suggested

1170
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
that like the US has more open

1171
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
space and therefore rail

1172
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
is more inefficient

1173
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and it's like literally the opposite

1174
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
is true literally the more open

1175
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
space there is the more necessary

1176
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
the more if the more energy

1177
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
like high-speed rail saves

1178
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
like that's the reason you build it is

1179
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
you traverse empty space efficiently

1180
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
you build you're what you're

1181
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
doing with a rail is you're building

1182
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
like the most frictionless possible

1183
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
road

1184
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
ever have and you don't even need to

1185
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
like worry about

1186
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
swerving into a tree

1187
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
yeah

1188
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
no guys obviously better

1189
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
no guys no guys it's it's much

1190
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
more efficient to have every

1191
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
in every individual like person or

1192
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
pair of two people or three people

1193
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
every every group of like one

1194
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
person or more has to have

1195
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
their own little vehicle that's powered

1196
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
itself and spend its own gas to

1197
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
individually traverse like 14 states

1198
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
yeah

1199
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
it just makes it just makes sense

1200
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
it's just more

1201
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
sensible

1202
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
road trips on in principle

1203
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
seem like a cool idea and they're

1204
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
often romanticized

1205
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
hmm

1206
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and I get it like if you just want to

1207
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
drive to a specific location or just

1208
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
like a camp

1209
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
on the side of the road that is

1210
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
you can't do with a train

1211
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
but like yeah I don't know

1212
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
maybe it should be just for road trips

1213
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
if you I mean if you want to like

1214
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
stop

1215
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
like oh I need to get somewhere I have

1216
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
to bring the car

1217
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
it's like oh it's a fucking million

1218
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
year drive

1219
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
if you want to like stop all over the

1220
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
place and see all kinds of things then

1221
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
yeah a train

1222
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
will not let you do that

1223
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
or not not as easily

1224
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
so yeah it's not it's not like I think

1225
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
it's not like I think cars are just bad

1226
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
but like yeah as

1227
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
like as an argument

1228
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
against trains like hey guys

1229
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
but there's so much more space is like the worst

1230
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
argument I've ever heard

1231
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
um it's literally the opposite

1232
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
of what you're of what you're trying

1233
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
to say

1234
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
um

1235
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
they build trains all over China

1236
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and instead

1237
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
they were gonna you know they were gonna they were gonna build trains

1238
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
across California but then Elon Musk said

1239
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
no no I'll build the hyperloop no no I'll build the hyperloop

1240
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I said okay

1241
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
yeah it's funny when I learned that

1242
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
is that the reason that hasn't

1243
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
been plans put in place

1244
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
is because Elon convinced the governmental

1245
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
body or something

1246
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
yeah like convinced enough people

1247
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
to not invest in the rail network

1248
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
because of what he was gonna do

1249
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
and then he didn't do anything he just sort of

1250
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
quietly abandoned the hyperloop

1251
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
he's not doing anything anymore

1252
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I mean it is he's not talking about it

1253
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I mean it exists but it's

1254
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
like stupid oh yeah

1255
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
the final well

1256
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
it was never said that that was the

1257
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
final project but that is

1258
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
the car tunnel that

1259
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
one car tunnel wasn't that supposed

1260
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
to be some different project

1261
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
like I'm gonna put a tunnel under the

1262
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
ground

1263
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and that was separate from

1264
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
the hyperloop which was going to be

1265
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
a specific motor transport

1266
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
that may or may not have been under the ground

1267
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I don't know

1268
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and he had so many terrible ideas

1269
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
he said 10

1270
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
11 years ago he said in 10 years he'd put a man

1271
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
on Mars

1272
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
and now he's

1273
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
explode in rockets

1274
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
now he's exploding rockets and he's charging

1275
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
$8 for

1276
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
he's pretending that celebrities paid $8

1277
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
for Twitter

1278
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
that is odd

1279
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I assume you've seen the drill stuff

1280
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
some of it yeah

1281
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
some of it yeah

1282
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I didn't realize I had been unfollowed

1283
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
from him somehow I guess

1284
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
something happened and I didn't notice

1285
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
because I was following him and I wasn't

1286
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
he specifically soft blocked

1287
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
you he didn't like you

1288
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
but I got back

1289
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm back and back

1290
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
better than ever yes good

1291
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
but yeah for a little while

1292
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
there

1293
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
he had a

1294
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
blue check mark applied to his account

1295
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
despite not paying for it

1296
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
by Twitter

1297
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
or maybe even by Elon specifically

1298
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
also Stephen King

1299
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and LeBron James

1300
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
and apparently there's a bunch of people with

1301
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
like more than a million Twitter followers

1302
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
people that had specifically said

1303
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
no I won't pay for the blue check mark

1304
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Jason Alexander

1305
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
uh yeah

1306
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I think Jacksepticeye

1307
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
in a weird

1308
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
stupid attempt I think

1309
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
to make it look like

1310
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
it's cool to have the check mark

1311
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
yes

1312
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
uh Lamana

1313
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
see guys it's not

1314
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
it's not just

1315
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
weird crypto perverts

1316
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
and Elon simps

1317
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and like mentally ill maga people

1318
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
it's not just them it's also

1319
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
people you like like LeBron James

1320
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
and Stephen King it's cool

1321
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I promise

1322
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
such a like a

1323
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
if that wasn't Elon I'm pretty sure I would have been

1324
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
an Elon idea like oh we've got to think of something

1325
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
to do how about this

1326
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
and then all the people that he didn't fire

1327
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
because there's you know

1328
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
they suck up to him I guess

1329
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
would be like oh yeah sure

1330
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
and it's like so short-sighted

1331
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
he's no

1332
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
like for such a future minded

1333
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
you know like

1334
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
really in the future like tech bro

1335
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
wizard

1336
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
he doesn't think very far ahead at

1337
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
all for anything like he doesn't think

1338
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
that oh as soon as these people realize

1339
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
that they're subscribed to twitter blue

1340
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
with the check mark even though they didn't want that

1341
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
they're going to say something about it

1342
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and then it's going to be revealed

1343
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
very very obviously

1344
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
that this is

1345
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
pathetic on twitter's part

1346
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I I mean

1347
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I read a think piece the other

1348
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
day

1349
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
actually it was like a long twitter thread

1350
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
but it was essentially a think piece

1351
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and it was about

1352
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and it was about how elons

1353
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
kind of like with the trains

1354
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
in California

1355
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
how like what the like

1356
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
the thesis of this piece

1357
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
what the pieces

1358
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
if you will was that like

1359
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Elon makes money

1360
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
by sabotaging

1361
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
public works

1362
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
and then like positioning himself

1363
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
to profit off of their destruction

1364
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and like that's

1365
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
what he did with you know

1366
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
by just by destroying

1367
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
plans for like high speed rail in California

1368
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
you know he increased

1369
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
you know the market value of like

1370
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
things like electric car stuff

1371
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and Tesla and all that

1372
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and I don't know I think

1373
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
this guy was kind of suggesting that maybe he's doing the same thing

1374
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
with twitter like

1375
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
by basically by destroying what was

1376
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
basically

1377
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
by deliberately destroying what was basically

1378
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
the public square

1379
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
of the internet he positions himself

1380
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
to potentially to potentially profit

1381
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
off it but I don't know about that because he literally

1382
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
owns it he literally owns it himself

1383
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and has personal stake in it so I don't know

1384
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
if you can really argue that he's going to profit off

1385
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
of buying it

1386
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
and then destroying it and then

1387
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
somehow I know I think he actually

1388
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
is just just fucking out I mean

1389
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm sure that was like

1390
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
part of the reason he made the joke in the first place

1391
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
is that

1392
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
that's how he operates he just thinks

1393
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
oh you know this car company

1394
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
this Tesla car company

1395
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
you know they're making electric cars

1396
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
what if I was the guy

1397
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
who was getting you know

1398
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I can have a piece of that

1399
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
and PayPal

1400
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
or whatever like he's always been

1401
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
the guy involved

1402
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
but not really

1403
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
important to a lot of these

1404
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
things that he's like

1405
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
rolled up in but Twitter was a little different

1406
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
because he got like

1407
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
he didn't want to buy it

1408
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
he got legally obligated to buy it

1409
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
for extremely large sum

1410
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
and you try as much as he could

1411
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
you couldn't get out of it

1412
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and that is the funniest

1413
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I have seen reports

1414
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
that there is um

1415
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I don't know I've seen

1416
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I keep hearing about all these like lawsuits

1417
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
that are potentially being incurred

1418
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
that Elon's Twitter is potentially incurring

1419
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and I just hope

1420
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
every time I see one I'm like I hope this is real

1421
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
hope this is really happening

1422
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I heard that like you know a bunch of like hate

1423
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
speech laws in Germany

1424
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
because you know Germany really doesn't like Nazi stuff

1425
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
so like the fact that

1426
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Elon's Twitter is like so permissive of Nazi stuff

1427
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
it's like pretty

1428
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
has incurred a bunch of like lawsuits from like the German

1429
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
government apparently

1430
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
um what was another one

1431
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I'm sure there's more than that

1432
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I don't remember

1433
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
um oh the

1434
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
thing with pretending celebrities

1435
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
bought the check mark is a thing called like false

1436
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
false endorsement

1437
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
or something like that

1438
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
so like that's potentially illegal

1439
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
which I hope he goes to jail

1440
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I don't know

1441
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
he won't go to jail

1442
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I mean as long as the threats there and there's like a credible

1443
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
like

1444
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
potential

1445
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that somebody could actually file

1446
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
for something because if there's a bunch of celebrities

1447
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
they probably have lawyers

1448
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
some of them will probably want to follow that up

1449
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
and there's a lot of

1450
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
like

1451
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
deceased celebrities who still have

1452
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Twitter accounts that have been given the check mark

1453
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
oh that's so cool

1454
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
like Chadwick Boseman

1455
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Norm MacDonald I saw a tweet

1456
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
posting them I'm like oh yeah

1457
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
yeah there are states

1458
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
so I'm not gonna be happy about that

1459
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
oh that's awesome

1460
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
that rules

1461
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I say estates but you know

1462
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
whoever is involved family

1463
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
anyone

1464
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
hang on I need fans at least

1465
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I need a sparkling water

1466
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I'd never needed a sparkling water more than I need one right

1467
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
okay I'm back

1468
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
so

1469
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
what else

1470
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
what else to have on my list

1471
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
oh yeah speaking of

1472
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
being deceased

1473
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I got

1474
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
really sick yesterday

1475
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
like all of a sudden

1476
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I was

1477
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
also I hope was there anymore

1478
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
not to change the subject if you wanted to say

1479
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
anymore about Elon

1480
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
nah I don't like him that's it I don't want to talk about that boy

1481
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
that little rascal

1482
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
that little baby that little diaper man

1483
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
yeah so I got super sick

1484
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
like Friday night

1485
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
and then I woke up in like the wee hours

1486
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
of Saturday

1487
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
like

1488
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
how detailed should I be

1489
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
well I don't know

1490
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I was I had a

1491
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I had vomiting and diarrhea

1492
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and I was shivering

1493
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and I was feverish

1494
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and I was alternatingly hot and cold

1495
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
and I it was like really hot in my room

1496
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I turned my heater up really hot because I was shivering

1497
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
but then I would get in my bed

1498
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
and I would cover myself in blankets then I was like

1499
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
like pouring sweat

1500
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
that sounds like food poisoning

1501
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
and or flu

1502
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
you think it might have been food poisoning

1503
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I think that can happen with food poisoning

1504
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
diarrhea involved

1505
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I thought it might have been that I ate something

1506
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
bad but like I didn't

1507
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I didn't

1508
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
well there was that one time

1509
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I was diet dumpster diving

1510
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
for scraps

1511
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I didn't eat anything that weird

1512
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
except I mean I was

1513
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I was making

1514
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I was doing licorice stuff

1515
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I was trying to create licorice

1516
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
but there's nothing that weird in that

1517
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
you made some fucked up licorice

1518
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I don't think I did there's nothing that weird in it

1519
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
it's just and I had done it before

1520
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
with all the same ingredients

1521
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
and I had been fine

1522
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
so I don't know why I would get

1523
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
food poisoning this time

1524
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I mean it's just it's corn syrup

1525
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
molasses

1526
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
starch

1527
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
flour

1528
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
there was a lot you know food coloring

1529
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I mean it could just be flu

1530
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
might have just been the flu

1531
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
it was um

1532
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I'm pretty much fine now

1533
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm like I'm still kind of like

1534
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
feeling like weirdly sweaty

1535
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
about it but other than that

1536
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I don't feel that feverish anymore

1537
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
it was just

1538
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
all Saturday all Saturday

1539
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I was just in bed

1540
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I just could not get up

1541
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
just don't get up

1542
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
just try to sleep

1543
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
it was exactly like when I had COVID

1544
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
only COVID lasted like three or four days

1545
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
and this was just like one day

1546
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
yeah so

1547
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I had wanted

1548
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
to get more Biscopades done

1549
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I thought I was going to do it on Saturday

1550
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Saturday was like okay I'm behind

1551
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I'm going to do it

1552
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
and then I got sick and I wasted my whole day

1553
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
and I couldn't do a damn thing

1554
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I did get some more done

1555
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I got a couple more pages done

1556
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I'm on page 13 now

1557
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I wouldn't count being sick as wasted day

1558
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
you had to recover somehow

1559
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
well it's wasted in that I didn't

1560
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
get to use it for what I wanted to

1561
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
sure

1562
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
but I did get some pages done

1563
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I was going into Saturday

1564
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Friday night I was like

1565
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
tomorrow

1566
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm going to spend the whole day

1567
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm going to get at least three more done

1568
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
but I did

1569
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
do more this week

1570
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
so I don't feel too bad

1571
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I'm nearing

1572
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
a point of being

1573
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
like okay that's the chapter

1574
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
done I don't know exactly when I'm going to

1575
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I don't know exactly what

1576
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I don't know exactly what moment

1577
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm going to end the chapter

1578
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
on some like minor

1579
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
cliffhanger probably

1580
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
but anyway being sick was

1581
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
bad felt very bad

1582
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
didn't like it

1583
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I'm trying to think

1584
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
if there's anything

1585
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
there's nothing that weird

1586
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
in the licorice

1587
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I mean probably wouldn't

1588
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
be a licorice if it's like

1589
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
if you have all the ingredients and none of them

1590
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
will rancid or anything

1591
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
it's just fine

1592
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
it's all the same stuff

1593
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
it's all the same stuff that I do

1594
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
that I make candy out of

1595
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
any other time

1596
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
you probably just got like a COVID mini

1597
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
maybe I mean I

1598
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I ate a very over right

1599
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
banana

1600
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
but it wasn't like rotten or moldy

1601
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
it was just like brown and mushy

1602
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I put it in a pudding

1603
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I doubt a banana would have that

1604
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
food poisoning is like raw meat

1605
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
usually isn't it

1606
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
meat that's not cooked well enough

1607
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
chicken often

1608
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I come sort of

1609
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I cook all my meat

1610
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I swear I cook all my meat

1611
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I do I mean I eat

1612
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I mean I put bacon in my lentils

1613
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
but I cook it in the rice cooker

1614
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and I think that's fine

1615
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I don't see as long as it looks cooked afterwards

1616
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I don't see why that would be weird

1617
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
googling cooking bacon in rice cooker

1618
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I mean it's kind of boiling

1619
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
bacon isn't it rather than

1620
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
basically basically yeah

1621
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
so like boiled ham like you can do that

1622
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
okay odd but like

1623
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
no no no I'm seeing recipes

1624
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm seeing recipes

1625
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
on google that are like

1626
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
yeah make stuff with bacon

1627
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
in rice cooker

1628
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
so

1629
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I should try that honestly I haven't tried that yet

1630
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
it's it's

1631
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
we got a little rice cooker

1632
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
do you use it

1633
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
for rice yeah

1634
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
you know I haven't actually used mine for rice

1635
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
so just lentils and

1636
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
okay yeah pretty much all I use it for

1637
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
is lentils

1638
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
because like a protein

1639
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I mean what I like to do is

1640
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I'm sure it would

1641
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
you know what's really good

1642
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
rice

1643
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
spam and sesame oil

1644
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
that's a that's and salt

1645
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
that's a winning combination

1646
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
half spam

1647
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
do you have sesame oil

1648
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
love sesame oil

1649
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I had a friend

1650
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
in California

1651
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I had a friend in California who had a

1652
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
girlfriend

1653
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
a Korean girlfriend who would make

1654
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
she would make basically like sashimi

1655
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
but it would be like rice

1656
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
and instead of like fish or whatever

1657
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
it would be a rice ball

1658
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
on top of a slice of spam

1659
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
cooked in sesame oil

1660
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
and they were so good

1661
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
yeah

1662
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
that makes me want to make that

1663
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I don't even have rice

1664
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
but I could get some

1665
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
yeah I just

1666
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
try to keep my protein up

1667
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
so I try to

1668
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
other than my candy stuff

1669
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
now I try not to eat anything

1670
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
that doesn't have protein in it

1671
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
now I'm nervous

1672
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
now I'm nervous that something I ate

1673
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
made me sick and it's going to make me sick again

1674
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I mean other than like the ingredients

1675
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
being

1676
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
contaminated is the kitchen clean

1677
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
yeah

1678
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
the kitchen is cleanish

1679
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
and I mean I haven't

1680
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
maybe a rat pooped in it

1681
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
my mom told me that when she was young

1682
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
she got food poisoning

1683
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
from like rat poop or something

1684
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
cause like there were rats living in her kitchen as well

1685
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
and she got food poisoning due to them

1686
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
maybe I got rat poop

1687
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
but I haven't seen a rat

1688
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
have not seen a rat in several weeks

1689
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
there's a cat living here in the house now

1690
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
and I think it's scared the rats away

1691
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and somebody found like a rat nest

1692
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
somewhere and got rid of it

1693
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
so like the rat problem

1694
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
while it would be overly optimistic to say that it's over

1695
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
it's decreased

1696
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
so you know I'd be

1697
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
surprised

1698
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I'd be surprised if it were rat related

1699
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
but I guess

1700
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
you can't you can't

1701
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
you can never be sure

1702
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
what a life

1703
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
what a life

1704
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
hey you know what I did

1705
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I did the anime

1706
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
do you want to see

1707
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
do you want to see

1708
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I realized that I forgot a few

1709
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
they're like

1710
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
OVA's there was one about like a cellist

1711
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
in the woods

1712
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and he has like a hallucination

1713
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
slash little stories

1714
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
with animals

1715
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
and he's like the most best cellist

1716
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
ever

1717
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
and I liked that but I forgot to put it on the list

1718
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
and I don't really think of it as like a show

1719
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
cause it was like

1720
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
no it was a film

1721
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I wouldn't have put it on the list

1722
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I wouldn't have put it on the list anyway

1723
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
but then there was like

1724
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Treasure Island

1725
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
an adaptation of Treasure Island

1726
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
the Russian one

1727
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
no it was the Japanese

1728
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
sorry to interrupt but have you seen

1729
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Takashima

1730
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
have you seen the Russian Treasure Island

1731
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I have not

1732
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Takashima's Treasure Island

1733
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
yeah in 1978

1734
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
it's got

1735
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I remember really liking it

1736
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I mean it's Treasure Island so I know the story

1737
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
but like

1738
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
really cool animation

1739
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
what's the Russian one

1740
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
wait no it's not Russian

1741
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
ah fuck

1742
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
maybe if I just look for weird treasure island

1743
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
fucked up Treasure Island

1744
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
yeah there's one

1745
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
where the animation is just

1746
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
so bizarre

1747
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
oh no

1748
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
oh it's called Treasure Planet

1749
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
from 1982

1750
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
obviously different from the Disney one I guess

1751
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
yes

1752
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
but it's funny that

1753
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
there was another adaptation of Treasure Island

1754
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
called Treasure Planet

1755
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
much earlier

1756
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I'll just show you some screenshots

1757
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Treasure Planet

1758
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
1982

1759
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
there's like a

1760
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Sakuga in this show the Treasure Island

1761
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
in 1978

1762
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I just want to find a good gift

1763
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
it's got the little leopard

1764
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
leopard cub

1765
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
here we go

1766
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
here we go

1767
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
anyway that would be high up on the list

1768
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
oh look at that

1769
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
wait what's this

1770
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
oh this is Treasure Island

1771
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
this is pretty cute

1772
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
wait

1773
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
he's not

1774
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
hang on I'll just post the link

1775
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
it's so much better in motion

1776
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
yeah I thought it was a wheelchair

1777
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
yeah this is a real movie I've watched this movie

1778
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
if you remember

1779
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
what was that fucking show

1780
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
that I did

1781
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
if you remember

1782
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
The Fleet Pit

1783
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
if you remember Live at the Fleet Pit

1784
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I reviewed this movie on that

1785
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
and it's kind of

1786
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
you know it all

1787
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
it all looks like this

1788
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
yeah is the jerky

1789
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
motion of the arms

1790
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
but like the face

1791
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
is like a single image that they're obviously

1792
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
just shifting around

1793
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
there's

1794
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
moving around

1795
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
making me feel like South Park almost

1796
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
there's lots of gifts

1797
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and I don't know

1798
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I could post more

1799
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
but you get the idea

1800
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
but anyway

1801
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
do you want to look at my list here

1802
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
yes

1803
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
my challenge list

1804
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I actually have

1805
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
watched a lot of anime

1806
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I kind of forgot

1807
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I've seen more than

1808
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
60 of them

1809
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I was on my

1810
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
stream

1811
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
and I had to ask stream people

1812
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
to remind me about

1813
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
anime that aired around

1814
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
a certain time

1815
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
of my life

1816
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
and people just threw out lots of suggestions

1817
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
and most of them I was like no never heard of it

1818
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
no never heard of it

1819
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and they'd be like oh yeah that one

1820
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
like oh yeah Cromartie High

1821
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
oh yeah Big O

1822
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
oh yeah Steel Angel Karumi

1823
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Paranoia Agents

1824
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Lupin

1825
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
yeah oh my god

1826
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
wow there's so many

1827
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
yeah

1828
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
kind of too many

1829
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
to like go over

1830
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I felt bad for

1831
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
everything that had to go up

1832
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
against Fuli Kuli like early on

1833
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
like Barakaman

1834
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and Garzi's Wing

1835
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji

1836
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
all get knocked out really early

1837
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
even though those are all really good

1838
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
just because it's Fuli Kuli

1839
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Fuli Kuli did end up winning

1840
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
unsurprisingly

1841
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
but in the second to last round

1842
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I did have Fuli Kuli vs Gurren Lagann

1843
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
oh my god Madoka Magica

1844
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I did watch that

1845
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I forgot that one

1846
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Golden Boy vs Madoka Magica

1847
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
was really hard too

1848
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I kind of hated

1849
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
knocking Golden Boy off

1850
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I think I tried to watch the first episode

1851
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
was that the space one

1852
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
it's the space one that's like 500 episodes long

1853
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I've watched half of it

1854
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
a lot of the one

1855
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
that was on this list I've only seen a little bit of

1856
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
most of them I've seen at least

1857
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
most of them I've watched all of

1858
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
a lot of them I've just watched

1859
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
like a decent amount of

1860
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
like Jojo Part 3

1861
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I've seen most of it I haven't seen all of it

1862
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
but I counted it

1863
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
a couple of them

1864
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I'd only seen a little bit of

1865
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
like Steel Angel Karumi

1866
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I think I watched like 2 episodes

1867
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I don't remember what it's about at all

1868
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I've watched this list really fast

1869
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
did I put Death Note on mine?

1870
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I think I did

1871
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I don't remember

1872
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
there were

1873
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
what the hell is those who hunt elves?

1874
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
those who hunt elves

1875
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I don't know it's like some stupid

1876
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
like fantasy

1877
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
show about a group

1878
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
it's like a weird etchy

1879
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
like fantasy

1880
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
comedy about some

1881
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
you know

1882
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
it's like a fantasy world where

1883
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
they

1884
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
they have to

1885
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
they don't hunt the elves

1886
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I think what they do

1887
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
is they have to find out who is an elf

1888
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and who is not an elf

1889
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
and it's straight up just like

1890
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
to see if you're an elf they have to like look at their tits

1891
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
or something

1892
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
it's about like stripping people

1893
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
and like looking at them naked to see if they're elves

1894
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
because elves have like a magic tattoo

1895
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
or some shit like that

1896
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
intriguing

1897
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
yeah

1898
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
yeah that one didn't

1899
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I don't think that one made it very far

1900
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
no it was immediately

1901
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
defeated by kill a kill

1902
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
oh another one sided

1903
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
match up there

1904
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
um

1905
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
let's see let me look for some other

1906
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Azumanga Dio

1907
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
no I don't think I've seen enough of that to count it

1908
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I like Azumanga Dio

1909
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I haven't really seen Nietzsche Joe

1910
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
or that's like that in Azumanga Dio

1911
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
are like kind of similar

1912
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
people tell me Nietzsche Joe you should watch

1913
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and I'm like I've seen

1914
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
when it was coming out

1915
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
or around like earlier

1916
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I'm like oh I've seen gifts of that

1917
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I've seen when she suplexes a goat

1918
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
or something

1919
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I've seen like funny like

1920
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
oh it's like a little cute girl

1921
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
but she is like animated

1922
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and over the top fashion

1923
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
to deliver some sort of

1924
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
punch

1925
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
or something and I'm like yeah I get it

1926
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I don't need to watch that I get it

1927
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
that's the joke

1928
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
it sure is

1929
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
people always say oh it's so fucking wacky

1930
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
and I'm like well is it fun

1931
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
is it nice is it cute is it wholesome

1932
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
is it anything other than wacky

1933
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
and they never say anything

1934
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
because I don't remember just to tell them

1935
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
oh dear

1936
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
that's not good

1937
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I'm sure it's fine

1938
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
probably might be a pretty hot take

1939
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
here but I had

1940
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I have

1941
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Excel Saga Beats Lucky Star

1942
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
in my first

1943
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
in my first

1944
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I liked Lucky Star but

1945
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I don't know what Excel Saga will say

1946
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I liked Lucky Star fine

1947
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Excel Saga is like a

1948
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
it's like a parody anime

1949
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
about like

1950
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I don't know

1951
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
it's

1952
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
God how do I even

1953
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
it's a comedy about

1954
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
these girls

1955
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
who join an evil organization

1956
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
bent on world domination

1957
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and basically every episode is like

1958
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
their stupid boss

1959
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
sends them on some mission to like

1960
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
here's how we're gonna

1961
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
it's like pinky in the brain like how are we gonna take over the world

1962
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
this time pinky

1963
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
and every episode is like they try to take over

1964
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
the world in a way that

1965
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
parodies like some very specific like anime genre

1966
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
like they try to take over the world

1967
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
by going to the beach

1968
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and being the hottest girls on the beach

1969
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
or they try to take over the world by

1970
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
having a

1971
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
there's a post apocalypse desert

1972
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
where you have to ride motorcycles around

1973
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and do a fist of the north star

1974
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
type stuff etc etc

1975
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
and it's just

1976
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
fucking funny and wacky and you know what

1977
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
it left a bigger impression on me than

1978
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
lucky started so it

1979
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
wins

1980
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
chris chan famously was a big

1981
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
excel saga fan

1982
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
which gave a lot of points obviously

1983
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
i notice you have

1984
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
jojo part three but no other parts

1985
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
i have only i have not seen any other parts

1986
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
is jojo jojo seems to be one of those

1987
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
anime where like different seasons of

1988
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
the show are considered different things

1989
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
yeah

1990
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
so like you can say oh i love jojo

1991
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
part two but if you just

1992
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
say i love jojo's bizarre adventure

1993
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
people will always ask

1994
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
a follow up questions like well which part

1995
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
yeah i mean

1996
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
as opposed to like any other show where it's like

1997
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
a long running show that has

1998
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
like arcs wait actually

1999
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
now i might be confused

2000
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
i might not even be talking about three

2001
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
i'm talking about the one that has

2002
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
um josuke and

2003
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
shining diamonds that might

2004
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
be four actually i might be i might be on

2005
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
on weed

2006
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
but yeah

2007
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
i know i've heard of like what happens

2008
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
in the early jojo parts and it doesn't even

2009
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
sound like remotely similar

2010
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
to what happens in the later ones

2011
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
so you know

2012
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
whatever

2013
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000

watched a couple episodes of on chibi backers

2165
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000

01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000

2169
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
yeah

2170
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
damn it

2171
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
ah

2172
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
fuck no

2173
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
instead of steel angel karumi

2174
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
um

2175
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
the only one that i realize i didn't

2176
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
put on the list here was medica magica

2177
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and i don't have a lot of like

2178
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
i don't have a lot of like oh

2179
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
what you thought this was better than

2180
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
that moment like i don't have that

2181
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
yeah i guess if you don't know most of these

2182
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
um i was bummed that

2183
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
that tatami galaxy got knocked out

2184
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
like immediately

2185
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
and i felt a little weird

2186
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
like having soul eater beat it

2187
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
you ever seen soul eater

2188
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
i watched

2189
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
no no we for chibi backers we watched three episodes

2190
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
i like so i think

2191
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
i like soul eater a lot

2192
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
uh i thought it was really good

2193
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
i thought the ending

2194
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
was really the ending is really shit

2195
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
it has a really shitty ending

2196
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
it they kind of do the thing how in like

2197
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
in the original full metal alchemist anime

2198
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
they just completely change the

2199
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
ending to something else because like the

2200
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
manga was still going they do that with soul eater

2201
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
but instead of being cool like in out

2202
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
full metal alchemist it's it sucks

2203
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
um yeah i've heard

2204
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
lots of things about soul eater's

2205
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
endings yeah it's just dumb

2206
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
um but it's a good show

2207
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
but i like tatami galaxy a lot too

2208
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
and i would usually give the edge to a

2209
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
show that's shorter like tatami galaxy is

2210
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
like a short ova which basically

2211
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
makes it automatically better in most cases

2212
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
but i don't know um

2213
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
what i remember most about tatami galaxy

2214
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
is just like its art style

2215
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
and like the the plot

2216
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
itself i like remember

2217
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
it but i don't remember it that

2218
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
well i just i have a lot more

2219
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
like oh yeah remember

2220
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
what when that happened oh yeah remember

2221
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
that character from soul eater

so i had to give it to soul eater

2223
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000

2225
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000

2229
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
by the way i don't know if i mentioned

2230
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
uh the last time i had

2231
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000

2232
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
i hadn't finished utana

2233
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
now i have oh

2234
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
how was that revolutionary

2235
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
revolutionary girl utana is

2236
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
um

2237
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
something that immediately needs

2238
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
a big long analysis video

2239
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
afterwards because i don't get it

2240
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
you don't you're not you're so

2241
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
fucking thick with

2242
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
uh insinuation themes

2243
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
but like insinuation

2244
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
and metaphor rather than

2245
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
over like direct dialogue

2246
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
um so

2247
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
insinuation of

2248
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
sex

2249
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
uh yes i mean there's literal sex

2250
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
that are there's lots of

2251
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
it's it's not um

2252
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
yeah i can't really speak

2253
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
on the themes even though

2254
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
i watched some good videos

2255
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
even trixie's old video was good

2256
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
on utana

2257
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
on utana there was a comment

2258
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
under it it was like oh i always thought it was

2259
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
like a woman's perspective of utana

2260
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
and haha turns out i was right lol

2261
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
pretty funny pretty

2262
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
drool yeah um but then

2263
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
there was another one another two or three

2264
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
that i watched i was like okay

2265
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
i think i get it but i couldn't

2266
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
recount it i couldn't like tell you

2267
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
what utana is about all i know is

2268
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
uh i loved it

2269
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
it was great it's very tragic

2270
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and very soulful

2271
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
and um

2272
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
but like uplifting near the end like

2273
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
it's sort of like a it's a cliff

2274
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
hanger like not a cliffhanger but sort of

2275
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
like a you don't really see

2276
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
what happens at the very end but like

2277
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
if you follow the themes and what

2278
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
you know the show is

2279
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
telling you oh like how

2280
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
like how in the green night you don't actually see

2281
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
him cut his head off

2282
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
yes

2283
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
like if you if you take what

2284
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
the show is telling you

2285
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
non-directly you can figure out

2286
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
basically what is what's happened and you're

2287
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
like okay the movie

2288
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
um

2289
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
is apparently like a clusterfuck

2290
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
of weird shit

2291
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
takes place in a parallel version

2292
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
of the the show rather than

2293
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
simple

2294
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
like movie that is a retelling of the

2295
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
show with a bit more animation

2296
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
uh so i i haven't watched

2297
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
that yet but i want to

2298
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
um and yeah i like utanela

2299
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
it's

2300
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
very fucking sick

2301
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
i'm

2302
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
i'm eating i'm trying a new

2303
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
recipe instead of

2304
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
a gummy i'm trying to make like a chew

2305
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
like a starburst sort of chew

2306
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and i'm trying to make

2307
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
a version of it that does not like

2308
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
melt you know it doesn't like

2309
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
deform just from holding it

2310
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and

2311
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
um

2312
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
i think it needs it needs something

2313
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
it's it's kind of like

2314
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
it's kind of like a tootsie roll

2315
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
but you can't just like pack tootsie rolls into

2316
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
into a bag they're all like melt together

2317
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
they'll stick together they might need to

2318
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
be like coated in something

2319
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
mirror oil talcum powder

2320
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
talcum powder

2321
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
maybe just like a corn starch

2322
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
maybe just a simple a simple corn

2323
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
starch powder

2324
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
yeah powdery something or other

2325
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
might do it

2326
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
maybe maybe just like

2327
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
a little bit of gelatin just a small

2328
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
amount of gelatin just to kind of make

2329
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
it hold its shape

2330
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
that might be that might be like a

2331
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
gelatin shellac

2332
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
well i told you

2333
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
that um shellac is the

2334
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
thing that they put in starburst right

2335
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
and oh no you didn't

2336
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
yeah um i found this

2337
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
out i was looking at starburst ingredients

2338
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and one of the ingredients is

2339
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
well it's called quote unquote

2340
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
confectioners glaze

2341
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and what confectioners glaze is

2342
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
is shellac it's

2343
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
the stuff that they that they that you coat

2344
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
wood with which if you didn't know

2345
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
is an excretion of a certain

2346
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
insect the lack bug

2347
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
excretes this goo that you

2348
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
coat wood with and

2349
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
that they that they put in starburst

2350
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
but they don't call it that

2351
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
because it sounds gross in food

2352
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
in food they call it confectioners

2353
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
glaze but it's the same bug

2354
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
goo

2355
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
well we've been eating bugs this whole time

2356
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
yeah

2357
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
and you know what

2358
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
i'll do it again

2359
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
i'm okay with it

2360
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
i like starburst are we thinking of the same

2361
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
thing starburst

2362
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000

01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
starburst the tiny little

2365
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
cuboids with

2366
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
wrapping paper around each one

2367
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
cuboids

2368
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000

uh yeah

2372
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
i mean in the uk there's different flavors

2373
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000

2374
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000

uh i don't know

2383
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
i mean i know that strawberries are like the most

2384
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
the default

2385
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
starburst

2386
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
are you sure the okay okay

2387
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000

01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
other flavor

2389
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000

2390
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
tropical skittles or berry

2391
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000

pear i mean that sounds

2399
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000

i mean yeah that sounds great just

2401
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000

yellow pink orange red

2405
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000

this is this is this is starburst and everything

2407
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
else is a

2408
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
i mean i would say that's

2409
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
like yeah more common

2410
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
i guess

2411
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
i would always leave the lemon ones i think

2412
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
i didn't like lemon the lemon it was the orange

2413
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
i didn't like

2414
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
strawberry is my favorite

2415
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
i like the ice yeah but then i also really

2416
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
like the apple ones i think lemon is the least

2417
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
good but they're all good i don't like

2418
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
leave any of them hang on

2419
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
um

2420
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
um

2421
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
oh my god

2422
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
uk u k starburst

2423
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
a comparison

2424
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
i'm just yeah i think i think

2425
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
the main ones were like strawberry and blackberry

2426
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
were the like the two flavors

2427
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
and then orange

2428
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
and lemon

2429
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
so i guess it was just cherry that was the

2430
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
strawberry and blackberry

2431
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
so i guess it was just cherry that was different

2432
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
instead of cherry i had

2433
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
wait a minute

2434
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
so british they okay they have an orange

2435
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
a cherry lemon lime

2436
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
combo and what's the what's the purple

2437
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
and grape

2438
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
blackberry or grape some i think

2439
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
is blackberry

2440
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
blackcurrant yeah

2441
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
blackcurrant okay i'm glad it's not

2442
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
grape because grape sucks grape is like the

2443
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
worst flavor of anything

2444
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
yeah um i love blackcurrant

2445
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
blackcurrant is my like

2446
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
i always think of blackcurrant is like the staple

2447
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
the staple like

2448
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
confectionary flavor is blackcurrant

2449
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
wait wait wait okay so your red

2450
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
is your red is cherry

2451
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
no no your red is strawberry

2452
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
our red is cherry and our pink is

2453
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
strawberry so that's so that's wacky

2454
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
wow i didn't know this

2455
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
damn i want to try these i want to try these

2456
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
blackcurrant starbursts

2457
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
sounds oh yeah sounds pretty good

2458
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
actually yeah i think the apple ones

2459
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
i was thinking of were like the sour

2460
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
chew-its chew-its

2461
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
yeah chew-its you know

2462
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
chew-its no

2463
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
is it like chicklets they're

2464
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
they're very similar they're like cuboids

2465
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
with individual wrapping just a different

2466
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
brand and

2467
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
they had a sour

2468
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
what what's wrong with cuboids they're not

2469
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
cubes i mean they're not rectangles i guess

2470
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
they're tech i guess you're technically right they

2471
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
are cuboids

2472
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
they are i would call them squares

2473
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
i'm just gonna say i would call them squares

2474
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
nah all right cuboids

2475
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
is funny all right um

2476
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
chew-its had like

2477
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
a dinosaur mascot

2478
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
and it would be like ah i'm

2479
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
a dinosaur and i love chew-its

2480
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
so much oh wow he really would eat them

2481
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
there's another there's another thing

2482
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
called now and later's

2483
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
which are very similar to a starburst but

2484
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
they're really hard

2485
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
they're really hard and you pretty much have to

2486
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
suck on them for a while until they become soft

2487
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
enough that you can chew on them

2488
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
where is the

2489
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000

okay let's give it a watch

2532
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
i like the ChewIt

2533
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
oh, it is

2534
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
its the song we were thinking of

2535
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
in the episode

2536
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
he likes to share it

2537
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:06,480
and

2538
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,480
I

2539
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:17,280
Thought that song was about Chewitt's and then I heard it in the Madagascar movie and I was like what why they put the Chewitt's

2540
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:20,280
Why they put the Chewitt's song in Madagascar?

2541
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:25,900
That's that's advertising this this Chewy this Chewy substance that I've made I

2542
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,140
Think it's pretty good. I think it's maybe a little too much cornstarch

2543
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:32,140
The

2544
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:36,500
Consist the chewiness the consistency is about right but it's a little bit like it's firm

2545
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:41,660
But like it like if you hold it it's sort of like deforms and starts to kind of like droop and I would rather

2546
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:45,620
I'm thinking maybe yeah, maybe just a tiny bit of gelatin

2547
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:53,700
Or sh or maybe maybe you can buy shellac in flakes. You have to buy it in flakes. Maybe wax. Maybe carnauba wax

2548
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:58,180
Flavors good though

2549
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:02,820
The first one I made had too much acid. It was too sour

2550
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:08,500
Too sour and not sweet enough too starchy

2551
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:14,260
So in this time I replaced half the starch that I added I press half of it with with a confectioner sugar

2552
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:20,260
Which um I had forgotten about confectioner sugar. It turns out

2553
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:27,500
It turns out that yeah when you just add sugar to a solution sometimes it becomes gritty and crystalline

2554
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:33,500
Great way to not have that happen. It's just use confectioner sugar because it's finely ground and it's and it's powdery

2555
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:36,100
They've solved this problem for me and I had forgotten

2556
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:40,380
I'm a genius

2557
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:43,300
Okay

2558
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,300
Candy, what was the other one fruit teller?

2559
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:52,660
Fruit teller was like fruit the non super sweet, but still quite tasty fruit flavored

2560
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,420
cuboid snack

2561
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:58,020
Hugh Brits and your in your cuboid snacks

2562
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:03,420
We love cuboids over here. I have never seen a fruitella

2563
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,940
We have fruitopia

2564
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:13,580
We got fruitella. We got nutella. Now these ones. What else have we got? Now these ones have you a green apple

2565
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:15,980

2568
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:22,180
Looks pretty good

2569
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:29,060
Yeah, oh and then the the box has it has fruit, but the fruits are all square or cube

2570
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:34,380
Yeah, like the products just the product so the product no

2571
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:41,380
No, they only becomes a cube if you combine two of them together and squish them you take them out of packaging

2572
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:48,540
You push them together. They molecularly bond to become one cube of the product. Oh, these are these are gelatin free

2573
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:52,220
Wait, these are gelatin free wait, so what's in them?

2574
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,940
Fruit no

2575
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:03,220
No, they're veggie. They're vegetarian, which means they don't contain gelatin wait, okay. I have to know

Traitor

2582

Well that other one said it was gelatin free. I mean maybe there's different

2583
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:31,900

01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:41,220
Glisser all

2587
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:48,420
Okay, all right, how to make fruitella at home Wow, I I think I have mentioned this

2588
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:55,460
I have looked up um how to I have looked up recipes for licorice at to make it yourself and all the recipes that I find

2589
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:58,480
involve like milk and eggs and

2590
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:01,180
it's like so

2591
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:07,440
Fucking stupid like that's obviously not what you're buying. Yeah, they all involve like like like condensed milk and

2592
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,180
fucking eggs and shit

2593
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:12,300
Like fresh eggs

2594
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,340
It's like give me a break

2595
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:20,460
Is that for like the bonding agent or something? Yeah, it's just stick it together

2596
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:25,980
Yeah, probably it's probably like I mean, I'm sure it tastes fine

2597
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:32,980
But it's not that's a cake. They're making there's them. That's a that's a dang cake

2598
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:36,180
I mean the end result looks pretty good

2599
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:42,340
You know you try you it gets this this paste this sticky like paste and you cut it into you know

2600
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:46,180
Cuboids or whatever and I'm sure it's fine

2601
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:54,180
But it's not you know, I want something that keeps on the shelf for ever and that you know make it with eggs

2602
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:56,180
It's not gonna do that

2603
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,020
Now hang on

2604
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:02,660
Fuck

2605
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,220
Shit, I was gonna look I was gonna look something else up, but I forgot

2606
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:10,340
Oh well, oh

2607
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:11,740
well

2608
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:14,100
Yeah eggs eggs, I guess are just like

2609
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,020
something that

2610
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,580
Eggs, I guess are like there's something they're a good

2611
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:21,580
They're a bonding agent that anyone would have in their kitchen

2612
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:27,820
Like if you're just for a home cook or just a hobbyist or just someone who's like bored and wants to do make something in their kitchen

2613
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:32,460
Like yeah, a recipe that involves eggs is like yeah, sure just go go nuts use eggs

2614
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:35,020
Just like just like financial

2615
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,660
Advice it's exactly like financial advice

2616
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:42,020
Because you know I was watching that video by Patrick Boyle and he said

2617
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:48,900
that like a lot of the like popular financial advice that like authors recommend is

2618
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:51,100
stuff that

2619
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:53,100
is kind of just wrong

2620
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:57,780
But a lot of it is wrong in a way that is designed to like

2621
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:03,540
Sort of account for the fact that like humans are stupid and

2622
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:10,020
Don't behave correctly and what I mean by that is like example a lot of popular

2623
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:15,980
Financial advice tells you to pay down your smallest debts first

2624
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,460
Like if you have debts

2625
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:22,220
Find the one that you have that's the smallest and pay that one down first

2626
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,620
Whereas like

2627
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:26,300
The right thing to do

2628
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:30,220
By any metric is to pay down the one that has the highest interest rate

2629
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:34,780
But I guess a lot of authors will tell you pay down the smallest one first because it's like

2630
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:40,540
Psychologically if you successfully knock one off the list it like feels better

2631
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,980
Right and so it's like

2632
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:47,180
Kind of not

2633
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:51,500
Right, but maybe it might get people to behave in a way that gives

2634
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:54,540
It might you know might get them to stick with it better

2635
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:57,180
Uh or something

2636
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:59,180
even though it's not

2637
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:01,740
Mathematically optimal

2638
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,980
Um

2639
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,380
Good thing I always do the mathematically optimal thing

2640
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:15,100
I don't have to worry. I don't have to worry about that. Yeah, so true. It is so true. It is so true though

2641
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,820
um

2642
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:20,940
Let me look at my let me look at my notes. Let me look at my stupid notes

2643
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:23,660
I played a video game

2644
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:25,180
This week

2645
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:26,940
Oh, yeah, yeah

2646
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:28,940
Did I mention that I found?

2647
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:31,340
phantom's revenge on some other website?

2648
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:34,380
You did. Yeah

2649
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:37,900
I mean, let me let me let me see if I could find it

2650
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,460
Wait, no, I don't know if you did

2651
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:42,060
You probably

2652
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:46,540
I vaguely remember this but I think it might oh I might be confusing it for something else

2653
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:49,420
But I don't know what else so maybe I did hear it. Wait a minute

2654
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:58,620
Okay, no, no, I was I was thinking of I was thinking of the pump run away from snakes was found on other websites because it didn't have

2655
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,100
It didn't have a link. It didn't have a

2656
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:05,260
My name or charlie's name in the game itself

2657
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:12,140
So there's no way to get like recognition for that. Oh really? Damn. Yeah, let's see. So for for for

2658
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:15,260
uh, the the

2659
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,900
Pumpkin alley it starts with our names

2660
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:20,780
And there's names like in the credits

2661
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:26,220
So even if it ends up on other sites and I think it has the little demo we made fridge

2662
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:32,620
Uh, we've still got credit. There's links within the game itself two things that we've done

2663
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:38,540
Yeah, phantom's revenge is like that. It says it's by ben saint and like there's links to like read the comic and stuff in it

2664
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,540
So I'm not I'm not worried about

2665
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:46,540
Yeah, it getting stolen or misattributed or whatever. Yeah, it's here on on soft tonic

2666
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:50,140
On soft tonic.com. There is a web page

2667
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:53,180
And yeah, they have their own write-up

2668
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:57,900
Of the game. It's not they didn't just copy paste my write-up. They wrote

2669
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,700
They wrote their own. She's kind of

2670
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:03,820
Interesting here. I guess I'll just post the link. Why not?

2671
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:05,820
um

2672
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:10,380
Apparently 68 people have downloaded it from this website, which is interesting

2673
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:15,420
Uh free download. I mean, it's free anyway. So yeah, yeah, it's free

2674
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:18,140
On itch as well

2675
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:19,500
uh

2676
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,700
Okay

2677
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:27,980
They are from indie for game developer ben saint. So they do credit you. Yeah. Yeah, they say developer ben saint over on the right side

2678
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:32,220
You know, I mean whatever like I'm not not upset about it

2679
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:37,340
With its content and the variety of activities for you to do phantom's revenge is a

2680
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:42,300
Thoroughly enjoyable experience true for indie gaming fans. So true

2681
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:46,620
Ooh, it is somewhat comparable to mother of many or limbo

2682
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:54,220
Yeah, oh the colorful or more graphic aesthetic to it. I okay. I read this write-up and I went first of all limbo sucks

2683
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:57,980
second of all, uh, I was curious about mother of many

2684
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:02,140
So I went and I go and I and I downloaded mother of many and I played it

2685
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:04,380
and

2686
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:06,220
it was

2687
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,580
interesting

2688
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:11,180
But it was not what I wanted it to be. I was kind of disappointed in it

2689
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:18,380
Yeah, I played mother of many and from the screenshot that they showed on this website

2690
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:22,220
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here. Here is here was the screenshot

2691
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:29,820
And I thought from this that you would be playing as like that it would be like a side scrolling

2692
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:35,980
Action adventure or beat them up where maybe you would like control like a squad of mice

2693
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:40,380
And you're like their mother or something and you're like commanding them to like fight for you

2694
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:47,500
Uh, that's this was wrong. This was not the kind of game. It was at all. It was actually a 3d

2695
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:50,860
um, I don't even know like a horde

2696
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:54,380
Based like first person

2697
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,500
shooter

2698
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,500
Basically you play mother of many

2699
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:02,860
And you start the game and when you get to the actual game part of it

2700
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:07,180
you're in an arena and zombies just zombie mice just start like

2701
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:13,260
encroaching into the arena from the sides and you have your little scythe that shoots beams

2702
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:15,900
and you have to

2703
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,060
You know, you just have to fight back the hordes

2704
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:23,180
And you know, they come like faster and faster and more and more and bigger and stronger of them

2705
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:28,460
And you know, you get experience points from the ones you kill and as you get as you level up

2706
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:31,500
you get to choose this sort of like a roguelike element to it where like

2707
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:37,340
You know, you're choosing which upgrades to get and that that changes your play style a little bit

2708
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:42,700
And basically the the goal is just like, you know survive 15 minutes of

2709
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,500
fighting this horde off and it's fine

2710
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,060
The gameplay is a little shallow

2711
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:49,500
Uh

2712
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,500
Aesthetically, I guess it looked pretty good

2713
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:54,220
It has like an it's you know, the like eastern european

2714
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,100
depression simulator

2715
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:01,420
They look cool in this screenshot. There's only there's only one actual mouse

2716
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:05,580
There's only one actual mouse in the game and it's uh, this one

2717
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:08,540
Yeah, it's frankly. There's not enough mice

2718
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,660
But she's the mother of many, right? No

2719
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:16,460
She is not the mother of many. She is your sister

2720
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:19,820
And sister of one

2721
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:25,260
I'm not I'm not clear on if the mother of many is like your mom

2722
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:28,220
Or like the goddess of the woods

2723
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:31,180
I think it's both

2724
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:34,300
Anyway, the point is you're bringing your sister out to this like

2725
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:37,020
secret place in the woods to

2726
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:42,460
To kill her and sacrifice her so that her blood will nourish the land and like your crops will grow

2727
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:49,980
And uh, and when you try and cut and cut her, uh, she gets possessed by the mother of many and like summons all these demons

2728
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,460
You got to fight the demons

2729
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:55,580
And it's good

2730
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:01,100
Yeah, I'm I'm I'm just noticing on your thing. There's like

2731
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,980
Translated versions at the bottom

2732
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:05,100
What?

2733
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:05,980
Like

2734
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:09,820
Yeah, it says program available in other language. I think they just translate the page

2735
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:12,860
Not the game itself

2736
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:18,140
I'm curious if you can tell like if it's been downloaded from another country. Wait a minute

2737
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:24,940
Like on your soft tonic page like at the bottom it's like oh phantom's revenge Korean Italian

2738
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:31,900
It's it says in in the details list that it's like oh, yeah on the Spanish page. It says that the game is in English

2739
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:38,140
So I'm it would be so fucked up if like they had actually like gone into the code and translated the

2740
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:44,380
The game into no no, I wouldn't expect that would be amazing sort of like I'm I'm interested because it doesn't say

2741
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:47,900
On those different pages the number of downloads

2742
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:54,460
But does that mean that if somebody from from korea did download it it would say one

2743
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:57,420
I

2744
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,420
think it's probably

2745
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:01,180
quite likely

2746
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:01,980
that

2747
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:04,540
Nobody has downloaded this game from the

2748
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,100
Italian

2749
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:09,820
A web web version of the web page

2750
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:13,180
I would be funny though. It'd be so funny

2751
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:16,220
Yeah, because because this

2752
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:18,380
hypothetically is like

2753
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:24,540
Exposing you to so many different markets. Yes that you would never have I'm I'm I'm truly am mr. Worldwide

2754
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:27,100
Hey

2755
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,340
Oh, there's a polish page

Ah, no downloads

Ah, no downloads

2759
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,340
It's just so funny seeing like

2760
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:50,220
In in the midst of uh different language texts the things that are state english are like my little pony tonic the headshot

2761
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:52,380
Strong youtuber

2762
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:57,260
Yeah, what is this? This is great. It's the japanese page

2763
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:02,540
Uh

2764
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:04,860
Katana's wayende pony

2765
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,580
What and it's never

2766
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:16,140
Oh in in mezlim door drink there in katana's wayende pony meet an attitude

2767
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:18,140
Ha ha ha

2768
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:25,660
Pony with an attitude a katana wielding pony with an attitude. I'm pretty sure is this exactly what the english version says

2769
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:28,060
Oh, yeah

2770
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:31,740
Like what is the a vietnamese?

2771
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:36,460
Sure. Why not a pony a pony slasher with a story

2772
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,660
Well, I didn't know vietnamese

2773
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:41,580
looked like that

2774
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:46,860
It's like mostly arabic characters not arabic. Um, I'm thinking of arabic numbers. Um

2775
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:53,340
Like what are these characters called? They're not the they're not like diacritics

2776
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:57,100
You're talking about the ones with the weird like symbols above the letters

2777
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:00,460
No, is there a way to to like

2778
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:03,740
Categorize like types of

2779
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:05,420
text

2780
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:11,020
What like in in asian languages they have like symbols like this but a lot of

2781
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:14,220
European languages share letters like abc

2782
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:16,780
Uh

2783
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:19,980
Vietnamese apparently has like stuff that looks more western

2784
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:23,740
Uh

2785
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:31,180
I mean i'm looking at what I think is the vietnamese page and it looks like all the letters are yeah

2786
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:39,580
Basically, you know arabic not arabic. Um, yeah, yeah, I thought that's what i'm thinking. What's the word for that describing that?

2787
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:46,220
Did they did did vietnam just like not have their own like written

2788
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:49,260
language until they

2789
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:53,740
Or maybe they didn't have like an alphabetical language. Maybe they only had like a pictographic language

2790
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:56,860
I don't know. I don't know

2791
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:59,260
Yeah, weird weird that they have

2792
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:02,780
This this is their written

2793
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:07,100
System what's up with that

2794
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:10,540
What's up with that

2795
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:15,580
What's up with that? I mean, I don't know that it's vietnamese. It just has the thing vi

2796
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:19,260
Next to it. I mean, it says what else could that be? It's yeah

2797
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:24,060
What else what else could could it possibly be? I can't think of anything

2798
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:30,220
Okay, french colonial rule of vietnam led to the official adoption of the vietnamese alphabet

2799
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,660
Which is based on latin latin script. That's what i was thinking of there we go

2800
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:38,940
Interesting so french are the reason for that

2801
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:43,260
Now we know they strike again

2802
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:51,100
Um, I have let me see have I gotten through my entire list yet?

2803
01:49:56,940 --> 01:50:00,140
Mmm illness mother of many anime bracket bonds

2804
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:05,580
Website down the last thing I want to say this week is that my my website is down

2805
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:08,220
Did you hear about this by any chance?

2806
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:12,300
Uh, yeah, yeah, uh jesse dmca

2807
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:20,140
dmca reported uh saint comics dot com for hosting the plebe and the weave

2808
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,940
Uh, uh blu-ray vials

2809
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,220
Lemau

2810
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:32,860
Yeah, yeah, I just I just I just have to say I just have to say how funny I think it is

2811
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:35,740
that rather than

2812
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:37,260
rather than

2813
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,260
make the blu-rays

2814
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:40,780
or

2815
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:48,380
Let me give him money to let me sell them. He has elected instead to pay a lawyer to uh

2816
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:53,900
He's paid paid money to bury them pay money to to prevent them from seeing the light of day

2817
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:56,540
Uh

2818
01:50:56,540 --> 01:51:01,980
I know I did you are you aware that I offered him a cut that I said just let me let me give you a cut of sales

2819
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:04,140
And and let me keep selling and he said no

2820
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:06,860
Uh

2821
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:11,660
I wasn't aware of that exchange. I guess it was in dm. So it was it was in dms

2822
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:16,140
It was in dms that would have been like a maybe a month ago or maybe two something like that

2823
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:22,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean well, uh, so

2824
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,940
Yeah, he hired a guy

2825
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:30,860
He hired a guy who does dmca takedowns for 50 bucks a pop

2826
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:36,780
I I looked into the uh, I got I got a letter and I looked into who sent it and it was this this one guy

2827
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:39,660
And I looked at his website and I was like, hmm interesting

2828
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:42,540
uh, so

2829
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:44,700
the website my website's down

2830
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,500
I just need a new host which is

2831
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:50,780
Actually the way the way it worked out

2832
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:52,300
is is like

2833
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:58,220
It's kind of good that something happened to make me switch hosts because my old hosting was on like

2834
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:01,260
I had I had picked a really bad plan

2835
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:06,540
The plan I had picked was like month to month and I was paying like $14 a month to host my site

2836
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:11,740
Uh, you know, I switched hosts. That's that is quite a lot. It was quite a lot. It was I

2837
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:16,540
It was not a good I I screwed I screwed up

2838
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:22,380
So I have picked the new plan that I've got I've locked in a rate. It's gonna be like

2839
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:29,580
It's gonna be like $3.99 a month for a while and then it'll go up to like $8.99

2840
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:33,260
In like a year or two

2841
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:34,460
so

2842
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:39,260
That's fine. The website's down for the moment. It'll be back up in I don't know a week or two

2843
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:42,380
Probably not even that long

2844
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:43,980
so whatever

2845
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:47,980
No, no biggie. No problem. And you know, I gotta say

2846
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,780
I did

2847
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:55,420
I never really intended to leave the plebeian the weeb stuff up on my store page forever

2848
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,300
You know, it's not like

2849
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:02,140
You know, it's not really germane to the content of my personal website

2850
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:04,860
Yeah

2851
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:08,220
So so what I mean, you did also say that nobody was buying it anymore

2852
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:11,020
Oh, yeah, I mean

2853
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:15,260
A couple people bought them like the last minute when I said I was almost out

2854
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:20,620
Uh, so my my you know, I had I had a couple copies left. I said guys I'm almost out

2855
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:24,460
You know a handful more people bought them and now I'm out and so it's all good

2856
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,940
the

2857
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:28,300
the

2858
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:29,820
you know

2859
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:31,820
but you know

2860
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,820
I just

2861
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:35,580
After after that

2862
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:37,180
When I said, okay, they're free now

2863
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:43,660
If they're free to download now, it's it's so it was no longer about the money. It was no longer about selling them or making money

2864
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:47,820
Uh, uh, and it's I don't know. Don't you think it's weird?

2865
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:53,100
Don't you think it's weird and wacky that like the dmca takedown didn't come until like

2866
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:57,100
After I'd already said I'm not selling them anymore. They're free now

2867
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:04,380
Don't you think that's weird and wild and wacky and wonderful? I don't know. I mean

2868
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:09,100
Is it is it not

2869
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:10,380
could you

2870
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:14,860
I'm trying to think if there's like a reason a dmca has to be against something digital

2871
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:17,980
Because you're hosting a digital file as opposed to

2872
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:21,900
Having a store where you can buy something and maybe that's different

2873
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:24,460
uh

2874
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:26,460
What do you mean?

2875
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:31,020
Uh, well, I don't know like like a dmca against your site

2876
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:37,100
Would not prevent you from having physical stock that you could mail to people who dm you on anywhere

2877
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:39,260
No, but a file hosting

2878
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:42,300
You can you can you can block that from existing

2879
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:48,220
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I mean maybe there's a difference in in something like that. I mean

2880
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:52,140
You know, I don't know all I'm saying is um

2881
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:58,380
I guess I I just I just really feel

2882
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:01,900
That jesse's whole attitude about this thing

2883
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:08,140
is completely irrational and and very stupid and and wrong-headed and like

2884
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,860
He seems to have felt from the very beginning

2885
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:12,780
that I am

2886
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,620
stealing from him

2887
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:16,620
and and uh

2888
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:18,700
victimizing him

2889
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:19,820
and

2890
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:23,260
I don't know. I just I just think that if you take a step back and look at it

2891
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:28,460
Like the the fact that this is happening now after this stuff was already free

2892
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:32,140
I'm just I'm not even selling them anymore. I'm just offering it for free

2893
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:36,060
I literally just did I did his job for him and I made the blu rays and I

2894
01:55:36,380 --> 01:55:40,460
Completed that work for him and I said anyone can have them and it's free now. Don't worry about it

2895
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:44,700
And then he gets lawyers involved and then he sends his dmc a takedown takes my website down

2896
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:47,740
it just I don't know it just really kind of uh

2897
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:50,300
just really kind of uh

2898
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:51,980
Highlights that like

2899
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:54,460
There really was no need for any of this

2900
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:59,820
You really could have just been normal about it and not been a little a little little baby bitch about it

2901
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:02,300
and just and just not uh fucking

2902
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:08,860
Just don't be such a spaz. I don't know. He's been a real spaz about it the whole time. That's that's my opinion

2903
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:10,460
um

2904
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,460
and uh, you know

2905
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,460
Sorry

2906
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:15,660
Uh

2907
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:20,700
Just there's no point. There's no there's no actual harm being done and I don't really think there ever has been

2908
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:25,820
Uh, and that's my line and uh, we'll never uh, I will never recant it

2909
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:29,420
That's what I have felt all along and I continue to feel that way

2910
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:36,140
Uh, but oh well, you know, I guess none of that matters in the face of 50 dollars

2911
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:40,620
Given to a guy to send a letter to uh to a web host

2912
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,500
I don't know what else to say about it

2913
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:50,780
I don't like it

2914
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:52,460
um

2915
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:54,700
Anyway, that's anyway, that's why my website's down

2916
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:59,820
I I know I know, you know, I know my site is like a huge a hugely popular

2917
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:02,700
buzzing hive of activity

2918
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:06,940
I know it's a thousand people a day are like are checking it to read

2919
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:12,540
Beescapades to get caught up on Beescapades so that when the next chapter drops and the perfect comic party

2920
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:18,140
They'll be caught up. I don't know what's going on and a thousand people a day are like, where's where's the website?

2921
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,940
I can't read Beescapades. I can't read. I can't

2922
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:25,740
Read slime and punishment to understand the context behind phantom's revenge

2923
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:30,860
And I just want you to know that I'm I'm with you and I'm working on it

2924
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:37,020
And um, the problems will all be solved soon. We will put all this silliness behind us

2925
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:44,300
Okay, that's all I have to say okay, okay

2926
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:49,660
Sorry, I was just looking at my currently operational website and I was just

2927
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:53,420
No, don't look at that

2928
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:57,820
I was looking at my links that I have to from my Clarissa to buy the Clarissa book

2929
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:00,460
I'm like, I can't wait can't wait to add a new link

2930
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:09,900
Well, I guess it'll be the same link, but I guess it'll send the link to like the the page of Clarissa volumes rather than the single one

2931
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:16,780
I think um, I think it'll be like, ah, what if you want to buy one of one of the series?

2932
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:19,580
I think give and take dot site

2933
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:22,300
represents a um

2934
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:25,580
I think I think it's uh

2935
01:58:25,660 --> 01:58:27,660
I think it's violating my copyright

2936
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:31,580
I think I think it represents a uh, a uh

2937
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:37,340
You know a a functional market replacement for st comics.com. I think it's uh,

2938
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:41,420
Yeah, pretty much. It's not it's not transformative enough

2939
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:47,340
So I'm what do you mean? I'm gonna have where it's been saying I'm gonna have point point to Ben saying I'm gonna have to take it down

2940
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:49,340
I'm sorry. It's over

2941
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:53,180
Well, it's it's well, they're both because because you know when people see

2942
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:56,540
St comics is down they say well now

2943
01:58:57,100 --> 01:59:00,860
What now I gotta go I guess I have to I guess I have to go read

2944
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:05,900
Yeah, I guess I have to go read closer gun smoke instead and then their lust is is slaked and then they

2945
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:08,220
They'll never read

2946
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:12,380
Vapors chapter three. I'm gonna I'm gonna release a new comic called the voopers

2947
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:15,180

2953
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:35,180
Fine if you must

2954
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:38,220
Oh, so papers is well now. Okay losers. They're so

2955
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:42,060
Confident and they don't have any social problems at all. That's

2956
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:45,900
That's awesome. That's that sounds so cool

2957
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:54,140
The voopers I'm gonna ah and then they say I'm gonna go boop. You want to go boop? Yeah

2958
01:59:55,820 --> 01:59:57,820
They're best friends. Well

2959
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:00,220
Now they're better friends

2960
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:02,700
Well, shit

2961
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:04,700
Yeah, you can do that if you want

2962
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:06,940
Unless I beat you to it

2963
02:00:07,340 --> 02:00:11,180
And then my second comic will be called the loser and they never win a fight

2964
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:15,100
Hey, so in the green night

2965
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:18,220
Is um, is this is this the game?

2966
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:24,540
Uh, yeah, basically. No, no the christmas game is about getting you

2967
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:26,620
getting

2968
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:28,620
I you punch me. I punch you

2969
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:32,460
It's a weird game. I don't why I don't know why it's called the christmas game

2970
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:35,020
So the so the christmas game

2971
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:37,340
The green night says chop my body

2972
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:41,820
And then a year from now next night and he says you have to try and nick me

2973
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:45,500
Is it like is it like sounds like he's gonna be dodging around is it like saint nick?

2974
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:53,500
Like saint nick nick me. Hmm. And then next is it is the idea that then next christmas. I'll come and nick you

2975
02:00:55,100 --> 02:01:00,620
Is it like trick or treat like yeah, you you you trick me by slicing my wood off

2976
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:07,580
And then tomorrow. I mean next year. I'll come and treat you to a gouging wound in your body

2977
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:11,740
Uh, yeah, something like that interesting

2978
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:14,220
fascinating

2979
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:23,100
Concerning looking into it. It's a I think it's the they just call it the christmas game probably just because the original story has it during christ's mass

2980
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:28,700
Uh, and it's not to do with like tradition like not traditional but like um more modern

2981
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:33,820
Understandings of holiday season stuff. It could just be like a pagan thing

2982
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:39,260
Well, no, it wouldn't be a pagan thing because it's christmas. They call it the christmas game

2983
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:44,380
Maybe it was a pagan thing. They changed it in the film to be the christmas game because people know what that is

2984
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:51,740
Who cares?

2985
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:53,740
No, it would have been

2986
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:56,380
Because isn't gaue and like one of the knights of the round

2987
02:01:57,660 --> 02:01:59,660
So they so they would have been christian

2988
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:07,340
Right, okay. Yeah, I don't know the history. It probably it probably has some pagan origin though

2989
02:02:08,380 --> 02:02:10,380
No, I mean

2990
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,460
I mean a lot of christian stuff does

2991
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:18,220
It does I don't know when christmas got taken over or the pagan holiday

2992
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:21,820
Of like the wincest sources got taken over by christians

2993
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:24,380
um

2994
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:26,940
Because when christians came and wokeified it

2995
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:30,060
They they they they christified it

2996
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:33,180
um, they christified

2997
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:35,980
um

2998
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:37,580
like

2999
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:40,380
Because jesus wasn't born on december

3000
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:45,660
But like when was that like changed? Um

3001
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:50,620
Oh gee, I just don't know my history golly golly g

3002
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:52,620
Oh

3003
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:58,940
Gee whiz, I guess we'll just never know. I guess only the lord may know such secrets

3004
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:02,220
Gee whiz we jizz

3005
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:06,700
That's true. That's what they said. That's really true

3006
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:11,900
Lamal, um

3007
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:15,660
Oh god, I didn't read the new one piece yet

3008
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:18,220

3010
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:29,820
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

3011
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:33,740
I heard it's good

3012
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:41,820
Did we talk about garp in the last one when he does the big punch on the galaxy first? Yeah. Yeah

3013
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:44,780
Yeah, I think we did talk about that. All right

3014
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:48,460
Well, I guess we're doing one piece now. I guess we're doing one piece now

3015
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:52,300
Should I just read it real quick?

3016
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:56,220
Yeah, read it real quick. Um, but I want to immediately draw your attention

3017
02:03:57,420 --> 02:03:58,860
to

3018
02:03:58,860 --> 02:04:00,060
the

3019
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:04,620
Image at the front of the chapter where sanji is reading a book about caulking. Oh, yeah

3020
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:11,260
Ah, he just didn't uh, I just didn't complete the uh, I just didn't complete the uh the oh

3021
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:12,380
No

3022
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:14,860
But then it would be cooking without the sea

3023
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:17,340
What?

3024
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:19,660
Oh, wait, no cooking doesn't have a sea

3025
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:23,340
I thought he missed out an oh whoops

3026
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:27,820
It is cocking. It is looks like i'm the one who doesn't know english

3027
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:32,060
All right, all right, i'm reading i'm reading

3028
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:37,500
Man

3029
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:39,500
I like scuffed piece

3030
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:48,380
I was i'm going back uh doing I think I I don't I don't remember if I mentioned the one piece book club reading volumes

3031
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:50,780
from

3032
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:51,900
previous

3033
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:55,980
Reading all the volumes from the beginning with a new group people. Yes, I heard about that

3034
02:04:57,180 --> 02:04:59,180
and um

3035
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:01,580
scuffed piece kind of was all always there

3036
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:04,380
It's just that there's

3037
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:07,420
Because like I look at the drawings and I'm like, oh, you know what?

3038
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:14,540
You can really tell that this was hand drawn with a like it wasn't I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but like that's just manga

3039
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:19,820
Most manga is pretty scuffed if you stop and you like look at every individual panel

3040
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:23,180
Uh, yes

3041
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:25,980
except for like except for like death note

3042
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:29,180
Or or like berserk, right?

3043
02:05:30,220 --> 02:05:32,220
Like some of them aren't but

3044
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:34,620
Most manga

3045
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:36,060
you

3046
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:40,300
It's drawn with the idea that you look at any given panel for like a quarter of a second

3047
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:43,900
It literally like doesn't need to look good

3048
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:50,300
And yet it's so good and yet it's so good and yet it's so good

3049
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:55,660
Okay, i'm reading a few moments later. All right. I'm done

3050
02:05:57,820 --> 02:05:59,100
so

3051
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:03,260
All right, looks like blackbeard did not get the ope ope fruit

3052
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:09,180
But just like I thought yeah, he he wants he wants its power for eternal life

3053
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:16,220
Uh, but he would not he would not be able to do that if he stole the power for himself

3054
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:19,580
I guess he would he would have to give it to one of his subordinates

3055
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:22,380
Which I think he could do

3056
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:26,060
I think what he could do is like have like

3057
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:34,540
Like a slave do it like you capture someone forces them to have the fruit and then tells them to use it on him like that

3058
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:36,700
Yeah, yeah

3059
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:42,540
Uh, so if he could capture law he might be able to I don't think he'd be able to do that because law would die

3060
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:48,700
But what does he mean about he says the hundred hearts of people that law stole

3061
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:56,060
Yeah, I I think this has been explained like mentioned a long time ago law

3062
02:06:56,940 --> 02:07:01,820
Does that thing where he uses his power to take someone's heart away? He had Caesar's heart for a long time

3063
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:04,220
That was a bargaining chip. Mm-hmm

3064
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:05,500
um

3065
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:07,500
and I think he did that to

3066
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:15,740
Like yeah, a hundred people a rocky part, but I forget where rocky part is or when that happened. Yeah, I don't uh

3067
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:18,380
I don't even remember that at all

3068
02:07:19,740 --> 02:07:25,180
Maybe it's maybe it's a new thing. Maybe it's not an old thing that's being referenced, but I think it is an old thing

3069
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:28,300
uh, I mean, but the point is uh

3070
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:33,580
All those people are pirate island, which is blackbeard's island

3071
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:38,300
So I guess law made a lot of enemies and blackbeard made friends with those enemies

3072
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:41,100
If I bring your something

3073
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:45,420
We're all living in fear on pirate. Yeah, I guess so

3074
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:48,300
uh

3075
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:50,220
this

3076
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:52,220
This chapter makes blackbeard seem kind of cool

3077
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:57,980
Oh, yeah, it's it's the funny thing with blackbeard. He's not like a dumb

3078
02:07:58,860 --> 02:08:02,220
I'm evil and I want to destroy sort of villain. He's

3079
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:04,460
been

3080
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:06,460
sort of set up as like

3081
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:15,420
A an inversion not an inversion of luffy, but like a different interpretation of the freedom of piracy. Yeah, he's all about freedom

3082
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:17,260
and

3083
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:18,380
but he's

3084
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:19,580
you know

3085
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:23,660
Freedom freedom freedom for himself freedom at the cost of others

3086
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:27,020
At the cost of others luffy's is all about freedom

3087
02:08:27,980 --> 02:08:29,980
Uh for himself. Yeah

3088
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:32,300
But also for everyone

3089
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:35,020
For everyone. Yeah

3090
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:41,020
Like he likes sharing freedoms. Yeah blackbeard is like cynical. He doesn't believe luffy sees someone being oppressed

3091
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:47,020
He'll he'll do something to stop it, but blackbeard will be like how can I turn this to my advantage?

3092
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:50,220
Yes, yeah

3093
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:54,460
Uh, so in a way he's a good he's a good um

3094
02:08:55,740 --> 02:08:57,740
Smart and thematically

3095
02:08:58,540 --> 02:09:03,580
Uh relevant antagonist. Yeah, it's the main villain kind of kind of the main villain

3096
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:07,020
I mean, yeah, see see in them all just like hang out in the bar with kuzan

3097
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:11,740
They're all just like, uh, you know, they're all just vibing. They're all just uh, just bantering

3098
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:16,860
Yeah, they're like, oh, you hate the marines too at that ike acai, you know that piece of shit

3099
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:22,300
Yeah, it's like maybe if if you weren't enemies with these guys, they might be kind of cool to just hang out with

3100
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:23,820
I don't know

3101
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:27,020
I mean when blackbeard when they when you meet blackbeard at

3102
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:30,140
Chaya, he's just sitting there cherry pie

3103
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:33,260
Yeah, yeah

3104
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:35,420
And I I always liked

3105
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:38,220
That luffy hates cherry pie

3106
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:42,780
And blackbeard loves it and that's what they fight over rather than anything else. Yeah

3107
02:09:43,580 --> 02:09:44,700
They're like

3108
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:46,940
Yeah, they're they're they're kind of similar

3109
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:50,300
Uh, but

3110
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:51,660
they just

3111
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:54,460
Fundamental disagreement fundamental disagreement on the method. Yeah

3112
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:58,380
Why would luffy hate cherry pie?

3113
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:04,940
Yeah, I know it's such an odd little thing. I also don't he loves I also don't really care for cherry pie

3114
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:07,740
low tier pie

3115
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:09,580
Uh

3116
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:11,820
Yeah, he just he rather yeah, this is

3117
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:16,460
Oh, so okay, so kuzan's missing a leg now from the battle with uh

3118
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:21,020
Okay, you know this is interesting doesn't doesn't affect him at all

3119
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:25,180
Doesn't even bother him, but uh, he just makes a I mean

3120
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:29,180
Prospero also had that like he lost an arm

3121
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:35,740
From pedro and then he turned his arm into a candy arm. Who's who still has an arm. Who's prospero?

3122
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:38,940
the big uh, the number one

3123
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:43,020
Son the first son of big mom the big tongue guy

3124
02:10:44,620 --> 02:10:46,620
Oh

3125
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:49,820
Oh the candy man. He literally makes candy

3126
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:55,740
Yeah, this is devil fruit. Um, I'm having trouble picturing him. Let me just google him real fast

3127
02:10:57,020 --> 02:11:00,460
Oh pero sparrow pero sparrow. Oh, yeah

3128
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:05,740
Yeah, this wow this guy left like no impression on me whatsoever

3129
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:10,140
Okay, he yeah big tongue sure

3130
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:13,420
Sure, whatever

3131
02:11:14,220 --> 02:11:17,180
Yeah, but that's not even his real tongue. That's probably a candy tongue

3132
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:21,660
No, of course, this is real time. He's been he loves licking

3133
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:24,940
Candy well

3134
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:27,020
pooms among us

3135
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:28,380
um

3136
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:31,740
All right, so yeah, there's a few things starting off. Yes

3137
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:34,700
um garb lands with the ship

3138
02:11:35,580 --> 02:11:39,820
And he's like, uh, fuck. I'm old and you know, wow

3139
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:42,300
He's so strong

3140
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:47,900
He's so strong and yet he's not as strong as he was. I like that trope. I enjoy that one

3141
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:54,620
Um, and then the the cute girl with the gun gets turned to ice

3142
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:57,740
by by alki g

3143
02:11:58,620 --> 02:12:01,260
Yes, unfortunate. This is very unfortunate

3144
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:08,220
And alki g is one of the black bed pirates who is here rather than at uh, we presume egghead

3145
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:11,100
on the ship

3146
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:14,380
Uh, yeah, he says teaches away

3147
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:18,540
So so maybe teach it so maybe so maybe that means teaches at egghead

3148
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:26,060
Yeah, so yeah, that's what I'm thinking. So the teach blackbeard and some other people who haven't we haven't seen

3149
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:28,220
are

3150
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:30,220
on the ship and alki g is not

3151
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:32,700
he's here

3152
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:34,140
and

3153
02:12:34,140 --> 02:12:37,340
The whole thing with him joining the blackbeard parts. We were wondering about this

3154
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:41,580
I've been wondering about this for a long time like why would you do that?

3155
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:46,460
Obviously the fight with the the alki g and leaving the marines

3156
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:51,020
Seemed they say it's like over the fleet admiral position

3157
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:53,900
I guess that's been said before

3158
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:58,780
But I feel like it was probably more than just that like I want the promotion

3159
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:04,060
No, I want it and then they fight like that that seems a bit insane. I it seemed like

3160
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:13,340
Uh, I mean it seems like just the the the hierarchy was just kind of in chaos at the time and so

3161
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:16,300
like one of them will probably get it

3162
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:18,700
And

3163
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:22,460
I'm sure it wasn't like an official like whoever wins the fight gets it. It's more just like

3164
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:25,260
All right, we but we don't like each other

3165
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:29,100
We don't want the other guy to become the new fleet admiral

3166
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:33,500
There's nothing to do but just fight about it and like fuck the guy who loses

3167
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:38,860
Uh, uh, yeah, I don't I don't know what to think of alki g because like

3168
02:13:39,820 --> 02:13:41,820
Like I said last time

3169
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:44,940
I don't think he's dumb. He doesn't seem like a

3170
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:48,860
Like a hard on his sleeve kind of person. No

3171
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:52,700
That thinks uh after he does stuff

3172
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:56,140
No, but the way he's characterized here is that

3173
02:13:56,940 --> 02:14:01,180
You know, he got into a a fight with the other admiral over

3174
02:14:02,140 --> 02:14:04,140
Like a position in the military

3175
02:14:04,940 --> 02:14:06,940
and then he joins blackbeard's crew

3176
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:09,260
on the

3177
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:10,300
you know

3178
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:11,900
for for like

3179
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:15,100
presumably the protection and the freedom that piracy

3180
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:17,100
allows

3181
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:20,460
Yeah, I don't and I'm like that that that makes sense enough, but then

3182
02:14:21,980 --> 02:14:26,380
Well, I guess it just I guess it just does make sense. It just sort of is sad to see him

3183
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:32,940
Do things well that it seems to make to make him look like a villain like turning somebody to ice instantly

3184
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:37,980
Okay, I know he's trying to protect. I mean turn it's turning people to ice like he can turn him back. It's fine

3185
02:14:38,860 --> 02:14:40,860
I know for reasons I

3186
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:46,140
Blackbeard says like, uh, you know, we all we all we all profit because uh

3187
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:49,980
Yeah, we all okay the the the

3188
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:54,460
The the you know pirates all wrong. We ain't just a merry band of chums bumming around

3189
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:57,820
We all profit from having our own agendas. That's what makes us pirates

3190
02:14:57,900 --> 02:15:01,420
Yes, and the the the vis translation that I just read is different

3191
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:06,300
It says have you got the wrong idea about pirates? Nobody said we're all best friends here

3192
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:09,580
The only thing pirates need is an alignment of interests

3193
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:12,060
Which is you know, it's similar

3194
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:16,700
So, you know, I love this face by the way. There's something so satisfying about this face

3195
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:24,380
Oh, yeah, I posted teach teach his good face good. He's he's a he's a great design. I love his nose and his

3196
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:28,460
face so like he's so his giant face is like so threatening

3197
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:32,380
He's right up in there

3198
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:34,380
So

3199
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:37,820
I mean you're a free man do what you want. So I mean Cousin is

3200
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:42,700
I guess he must see aligning himself with these guys

3201
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:45,500
as useful

3202
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:46,780
to some

3203
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:48,060
end

3204
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:52,140
Yeah, I don't I don't exactly know what his end his goal is right now

3205
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:57,420
But I think well, I'm pretty sure that whatever his goal was

3206
02:15:58,300 --> 02:15:59,260
um

3207
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:06,060
Or continues to be is very much involved with the reason that he got into such a catastrophic fight with alkiji

3208
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:08,700
back. I knew I mean

3209
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:10,220
over

3210
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:15,420
Fleet admiral position because like he doesn't seem like he would give a shit about something about being fleet admiral

3211
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:21,900
Yeah, I think either because he believes that um akainu would be a terrible problem

3212
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:29,260
Or I think he that's probably yeah, I think he probably yeah, if my read on him is correct. I think he just wouldn't want

3213
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:31,420
Akainu

3214
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:37,020
To do it. He just wouldn't want him in charge. I don't think I don't think Cousin is the kind of guy who's like

3215
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:39,100
I've got to be freaking king or whatever

3216
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:42,060
Yeah

3217
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:48,300
So I so I think it's like biting his time. I could see how joining the blackbeard pirates might help him in the goal of

3218
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:51,580
Yeah, eventually taking down akainu. That makes sense

3219
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:58,060
Yes, but and then there's the bit where garp he's fighting with garp

3220
02:16:58,940 --> 02:17:04,140
And he says your number one protege versus your new favorite. So new favorite meaning kobi

3221
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:06,460
and uh

3222
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:11,020
That implies that uh cousin was the old favorite of garp

3223
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:17,900
Meaning that garp probably also saw goodness in kuzan. Yeah

3224
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:22,220
And I wonder if kuzan is throwing this fight deliberately

3225
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:28,540
Because obviously he has to look like he's defending stuff

3226
02:17:29,420 --> 02:17:31,420
Yes, I see because he

3227
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:34,380
garp says he's hesitating or wavering

3228
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:37,740
And yeah

3229
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:44,220
Yeah, and he's sort of letting himself lose to garp and it's not it's not a bad story like garp is such a legend

3230
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:46,300
Yeah, it would happen. Yeah

3231
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:53,820
That's that's true, but I wonder if I wonder if kuzan could have beaten him or at least really tried harder than this

3232
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:57,900
I

3233
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:03,980
Well, he he freezes uh, he freezes him right he freezes garp, but it just like doesn't work

3234
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:11,980
Did I yeah, he just he just breaks out of it or something. Yeah, super hacky super malio

3235
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:16,300
Wavering is a sign of weakness wait

3236
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:23,020
Yeah, okay, I says don't be would you kill your senior apprentice's favorite protege?

3237
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:27,980
Don't be tight and then garp says don't be tied down by this nonsense. I taught you to live in the moment

3238
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:32,060
It's not working on him. Listen up kuzan wavering is a sign

3239
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:34,300
All right, he breaks out of the ice then he

3240
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:36,620
Kicks his kicks his little ass

3241
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:39,100
Throws him into the blue throws him into the blue hole

3242
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:42,860
It's like a black hole, but it's blue because he's a

3243
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:44,780
cop

3244
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:47,180
Yeah, this is a thin the thin blue hole

3245
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:52,860
Um

3246
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:58,380
I think yeah, I think you might be right that he might have uh, he might just kind of be putting on appearances for this fight

3247
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:01,820
It's so funny how black beard

3248
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:05,100
You know, I've been playing uh

3249
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:07,340
Battle network mega man

3250
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:09,420
And it's funny every now and then

3251
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:11,740
Your rival shows up

3252
02:19:12,140 --> 02:19:15,900
And your your rival chowd has proto man is his navi

3253
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:19,500
And he's all and occasionally he'll say something like this. He'll be like

3254
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:21,580
Proto man will be like

3255
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:25,580
Me and chowd aren't friends like we're just we're we're just i'm just his now

3256
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:27,820
I dutifully serve him as his program

3257
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:35,180
Uh, and mega man will be like but me and lan we're best friends and and brothers and and our d we share our dna

3258
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:37,420
And we love each other in a platonic way

3259
02:19:39,340 --> 02:19:44,620
And proto man will be like, hmm, that's gay bro and chowd will be like, yeah, it's totally gay

3260
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:48,460
I don't think proto man's hot at all and proto be like, yeah, I don't think chowd's hot either

3261
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:52,540
Also, he's like 11 years old. So it's weird to even talk like that. Okay. Bye

3262
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:55,260
Um

3263
02:19:57,020 --> 02:19:59,020
Insisting like yeah, we're

3264
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:00,060
Yeah

3265
02:20:00,060 --> 02:20:05,740
Me and my co-workers. Yeah, we're not friends. We're just here to get our shit done and make a ton of money

3266
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:09,340
It's like I get it. I get it

3267
02:20:10,380 --> 02:20:12,380
I get it

3268
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:14,140
Is a little sad

3269
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:18,220
Is a little sad to be like, yeah, I pretty much hang out with these guys 24 7

3270
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:21,660
We hang out on a on a on a on a ship together

3271
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:25,500
Maybe that's true. Maybe that's not true. Maybe maybe they're not always on a ship together

3272
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:30,380
I guess they have a whole island now. They probably don't even have to hang out together unless they really want to

3273
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:36,780
Well, I I mean the blackbird pirates seem like chummy. I don't think they seem like cold

3274
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:44,060
They can have a beer and they can have a laugh. Yeah, and they can enjoy a victory together, but like ultimately

3275
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:49,740
They're in it. Yeah, not for friendship. They're in it for power. Yeah

3276
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:55,260
Yeah, but they can get power by being together. So it's just it's a kind of

3277
02:20:56,060 --> 02:21:00,540
You know, it's not unemotional. Oh, that's what the pcp was supposed to be

3278
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:07,260
Yeah, we were we were supposed to kill the government and and uh

3279
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:12,620
And yet it's still there the government and he's not moved hasn't moved an inch

3280
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:18,940
And now they've elected the real life version of acai new joe biden and there's nothing we can do about it

3281
02:21:19,660 --> 02:21:21,900
We were supposed we were supposed to stop this

3282
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:25,660
He's got his magma powers

3283
02:21:25,820 --> 02:21:27,420
Yeah

3284
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:28,940
Uh joe

3285
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:30,220
Ah joe

3286
02:21:30,220 --> 02:21:32,140
It's joe over. It is joe over

3287
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:34,940
Uh, um

3288
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:37,500
Let's see. Okay. What else to

3289
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:44,860
Well, the next thing in the chapter is that we see that I predicted and it's pretty obvious, but I predicted law

3290
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:50,860
Oh, yeah defeated. Yes defeated. Just like kid. Yeah, just like kid

3291
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:53,580
Damn black beard is defeated law

3292
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:59,740
On winner island, I don't know if that was the name of the island they were at before

3293
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:03,660
I guess it must have been because if it was the it was if it was like

3294
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:06,220
the one depicted before

3295
02:22:06,780 --> 02:22:08,780
Where like law was

3296
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:11,100
Briefly turned into a woman for that one panel

3297
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:15,260
Good times. Do you remember that? I vaguely remember that. Yeah

3298
02:22:15,980 --> 02:22:21,260
Yeah, it's a little little like haha. We're fighting and this is the result. Was he turned into a woman by

3299
02:22:22,860 --> 02:22:25,740
Docky cue with his oh trans disease

3300
02:22:27,100 --> 02:22:31,740
I was thinking it was who's the is it Ivanovic is the one that can turn you into a woman

3301
02:22:33,260 --> 02:22:35,740
Ivankov Ivankov Ivankov, right

3302
02:22:36,220 --> 02:22:38,380
Yeah, Ivankov. Yeah

3303
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:43,580
Fucking doc cue doc cue has freaky hormone fruit. Is that really what it is?

3304
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:48,620
Yeah, the hormone hilarious doc doc cue has like

3305
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:51,900
weaponized like estrogen bullets

3306
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:58,220
Amazing. Yeah, and they say oh, it's only temporary. It's just a freak. I'm out a little just to make a little

3307
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:01,100
Just to make of all weird and shit

3308
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:04,140
So that we can gain me up a hand it was like

3309
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:10,140
It worked shut up. You just wanted to draw a law as a girl. Wait. Yeah, wait a minute. Wait a minute

3310
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:12,140
well

3311
02:23:12,140 --> 02:23:14,380
Would that have happened like a long time ago?

3312
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:18,300
Because I mean doc wait

3313
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:21,500
If doc cue shot law

3314
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:26,460
Then I mean was was is that the same encounter that led to his

3315
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:29,100
submarine being destroyed

3316
02:23:29,740 --> 02:23:35,660
I mean, I'm assuming that I can't remember. I don't think there's enough landmarks in these panels to determine

3317
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:38,140
Whether it's the same island

3318
02:23:38,220 --> 02:23:42,140
Um, all I know is they were fighting. We didn't see the resolution of that fight

3319
02:23:42,220 --> 02:23:47,180
And here is a resolution of a fight between black bear and law. I think it makes sense that it's the same thing

3320
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:53,820
Yeah, yeah, meaning this would have happened a little while ago, but not that long ago. I mean if if he was already

3321
02:23:54,780 --> 02:23:57,980
getting shot by doc cue I have to imagine that that

3322
02:23:59,260 --> 02:24:00,860
was

3323
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:03,340
I don't remember if it was a bullet. It may have been like a gas or something

3324
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:08,300
Okay, but they were because he was fighting a bunch of the crew was like but doc doc cue was there and they were having a battle

3325
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:10,460
So, I mean, yeah, yeah

3326
02:24:11,020 --> 02:24:13,660
Blackbeard must have showed up later

3327
02:24:14,860 --> 02:24:16,860
No, blackbeard was there during oh, okay, so

3328
02:24:17,740 --> 02:24:22,300
So this is so this is they were they were in the throes of a of a fight. It was just we didn't see what happened

3329
02:24:22,300 --> 02:24:24,300
Okay, so this is what happened

3330
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:26,780
Okay, so the law got beat

3331
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:33,020
And uh, we we saw earlier that blackbeard knows of the road poneglas

3332
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:38,380
And big mom kaito have won each law has those ones

3333
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:41,660
so now blackbeard and shanks both have

3334
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:45,340
kaitos and big moms a road poneglas

3335
02:24:46,860 --> 02:24:48,860
um, but then

3336
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:54,620
There's two more they don't know about one of them. We do know about it's the one inside zoe the giant

3337
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:56,620
Yes, uh, the giant

3338
02:24:57,500 --> 02:25:00,780
What is it? It's a it's a elephant tree in the shape of a whale

3339
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:08,540
What on top of it? Yeah, that's the location. There's like the the mink tribe settlement. There's a big tree that looks like a whale

3340
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:12,300
Uh, did I hallucinate that?

3341
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:15,260
Are you know what a tree?

3342
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:19,100
Okay, a tree that looks like a whale. I can't zow is not the elephant

3343
02:25:19,660 --> 02:25:25,580
The elephant is could is kashina kashina is the elephant and it has a tree in the shape of a whale on it

3344
02:25:25,580 --> 02:25:28,940
And that's zow and that's where the the poneglyph is no zoe

3345
02:25:29,660 --> 02:25:34,860
Zoe is wait zoe is the the island on the top of the elephant called kashina. Okay

3346
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:40,540
And then on in so on zoe there is a tree shape like a whale

3347
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:46,300
And in that tree there is a poneglyph

3348
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:50,860
Is it kashina? I'm typing kashina and it's sanguina and I'm like no

3349
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:57,260
There's a glyph in the tree and a tree in the shape of a whale and a whale on the zoe and zoe on an elephant

3350
02:25:58,140 --> 02:26:01,660
It's it's zunesh. Okay. Not kushina. Okay. Sure. Whatever

3351
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:04,620
Zunesh, uh, da da da da

3352
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:07,340
One da da da zoe on its back zoe is the island

3353
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:09,420
and

3354
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:11,420
Uh, da da da da da

3355
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:13,580
Where is the thing?

3356
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:16,780
Layout and locations whale forest. That's what it was called

3357
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:20,140
Um

3358
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:21,740
No images

3359
02:26:21,740 --> 02:26:26,780
You're fucking me. You're killing me over here. I just want to show ben the whale. Please

3360
02:26:27,740 --> 02:26:29,740
I want to see the whale tree

3361
02:26:31,340 --> 02:26:33,340
Whale tree

3362
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:38,780
Okay, here is an image of I think I guess it's not a tree. No, it is a tree

3363
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:41,660
It's got it's got leaves coming out of it. Huh

3364
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:44,220
Well

3365
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:49,260
Okay, so that's inside that is a secret compartment where rhizo was hiding

3366
02:26:49,980 --> 02:26:51,980
And where the road ponyglyph is

3367
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:56,060
Okay, and so and we don't know where the fourth one is right?

3368
02:26:57,180 --> 02:27:00,540
No, the fourth one is hypothesized by the blackbird pirates

3369
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:04,780
It heard rumors that the man marked by flames has it

3370
02:27:05,420 --> 02:27:09,020
Who is a mystery man? I can't think of who it could be

3371
02:27:09,260 --> 02:27:13,260
Man marked by flames means burnt. I guess I mean

3372
02:27:13,980 --> 02:27:15,980
Man marked by flames

3373
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:19,100
It's I mean the only one I can think of

3374
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:25,740
Is luffy because he's got the scar from his on his chest from the from the magma punch

3375
02:27:27,740 --> 02:27:29,740
Uh

3376
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:34,140
I guess you could you could say that but I mean he doesn't yeah, yeah

3377
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:38,940
Obviously not who they're talking about they're talking about a mystery man that travels in a black ship

3378
02:27:39,740 --> 02:27:41,980
Yeah, um that creates whirlpools around it

3379
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:45,980
Um the man marked by this is the first time we're hearing about that, right?

3380
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:49,020
I think so. Okay. Um

3381
02:27:49,180 --> 02:27:50,300
The man might play flames

3382
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:57,020
I had at first thought was like fisher tiger because marked by flames as in like branded with a branding iron

3383
02:27:57,260 --> 02:28:01,820
Like the slaves will do so it could be a fish man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

3384
02:28:03,180 --> 02:28:05,820
But I think all the permanent fishermen have been like

3385
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:11,980
Introduced and are either fisher tiger or someone else and I don't think it's any of the other people

3386
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:17,980
Um other than that it could be someone wounded by someone who had a flaming devil fruit

3387
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:21,580
Yeah, I can't think of anyone that would be

3388
02:28:22,620 --> 02:28:28,540
But I have heard just by people leave in comments that what if the whirlpool?

3389
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:31,100
um

3390
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:33,500
You do you remember the very beginning of one piece? No

3391
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:35,500
Oh

3392
02:28:35,740 --> 02:28:38,540
Uh, well, yeah, no, I remember the yeah, what would you say in?

3393
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:44,060
Luffy leaves on his journey after waiting 10 years after shanks left

3394
02:28:44,460 --> 02:28:52,060
He punches that fish that but shanks arm. You know the classic. Oh the um, I'm the the the the sea king

3395
02:28:53,340 --> 02:28:56,460
Sea king. Yeah, the the local village sea king tiny little guy

3396
02:28:56,860 --> 02:29:02,780
Bit shanks arm off. Luffy punches it and then immediately he's uh in a whirlpool and he'll die

3397
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:04,300
right

3398
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:07,660
He'll in a bit. He's in a big whirlpool and he's like, oh, I'm gonna drown

3399
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:12,220
I guess I hide in this barrel and then that barrel gets found

3400
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:18,700
By alvita's pirates and he meets kobe and all that stuff happens. Um, but the whirlpool

3401
02:29:19,980 --> 02:29:23,500
What if the whirlpool was because of the whirlpool guy was there?

3402
02:29:23,980 --> 02:29:30,940
What if the whirlpool was because the guy who makes whirlpools behind him with a potential devil fruit the guy man marked by flames

3403
02:29:30,940 --> 02:29:35,100
What if that guy was there? I can't think of any other reason why there would have been a whirlpool

3404
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:41,100
It couldn't have been like a sea thing. It couldn't have just been a sea anomaly when you say that

3405
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:48,300
Yeah, I mean, what yeah, what are the uh, oh, so you're saying that like the whirlpool they just happen like the sea just does things

3406
02:29:49,020 --> 02:29:52,940
Okay, uh, when you say that it makes me think of dragon

3407
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:56,060
And the the lightning that struck at

3408
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:58,940
rogueport

3409
02:29:58,940 --> 02:30:05,980
Remember he kind of like controlled the weather and like uh, yeah lightning struck what when elufi was going to get executed or something

3410
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:10,300
Yeah, I don't know if it's clear what dragon's

3411
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:15,980
Fruit has dragon seems to have some kind of weather control powers and he's got that scar on his face

3412
02:30:16,060 --> 02:30:19,660
I don't know. Maybe it's dragon. Maybe dragon is the man marked by flames

3413
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:23,500
Monkey

3414
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:25,980
A D dragon

3415
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:32,620
He does have a big fucking scar although it looks more like a tattoo than a flame

3416
02:30:32,780 --> 02:30:36,940
Did I did I show did I show you that image of um, how it kind of looks like

3417
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:39,500
The bottom of the of a shoe

3418
02:30:39,740 --> 02:30:44,060
As though garp had just like stomped stomped on his face with like a rubber sneakers

3419
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:48,620
Okay

3420
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:50,860
Abilities and powers

3421
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:53,740
He's the supreme commander of the revolutionary army

3422
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:56,940
um

3423
02:30:59,420 --> 02:31:01,420
I love one piece

3424
02:31:01,820 --> 02:31:06,940
I do I love scuffed piece. Uh, I love uh, the the retcons

3425
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:11,500
I love when the rubber fruit becomes a magic cloud man fruit. Duh

3426
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:15,740
I eat my slop. I do I unironically do

3427
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:24,220
Okay, it remains unconfirmed if dragon was directly responsible for the wind blast or if he has a power enabling to create them

3428
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:28,540
So we don't actually know if he has a fruit. We don't know anything about his powers

3429
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:31,980
Uh, yeah, if he does have a weather control power

3430
02:31:33,180 --> 02:31:40,220
Then his ability to make weather things happen such as a lot of wind lightning potentially whirlpools

3431
02:31:40,940 --> 02:31:42,220
uh

3432
02:31:42,220 --> 02:31:45,180
I the reason I don't think is dragon is just because

3433
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:50,940
The rumor of the guy traveling around in a black ship. They would just like the black pearl

3434
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:56,860
From the fucking pirate to the cow. Do you think that it's just like a totally new guy?

3435
02:31:57,820 --> 02:31:59,820
That we haven't seen before I think

3436
02:32:00,940 --> 02:32:03,500
I think it's it's gotten a real

3437
02:32:04,380 --> 02:32:06,620
reason to be a guy we know. Yeah

3438
02:32:07,900 --> 02:32:09,580
um

3439
02:32:09,580 --> 02:32:11,580
It probably has

3440
02:32:12,220 --> 02:32:18,940
Like it could be like an old ally of like a famous pirate or a friend of someone who we do know already

3441
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:23,020
Like oh, maybe Ray Lee knows them or I don't know

3442
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:25,900
um, I think the the the

3443
02:32:26,300 --> 02:32:32,940
Clue would be the fact that at the bottom of the ocean near fishman island where it used to be

3444
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:34,620
this

3445
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:36,620
red poneglyph used to be there

3446
02:32:37,180 --> 02:32:38,300
um

3447
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:43,980
And there's in its place a poneglyph that is an apology letter saying sorry. I had to move this

3448
02:32:46,460 --> 02:32:48,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Say that again

3449
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:51,340
There's an apology poneglyph

3450
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:55,660
It's just written as like sorry. I just I gotta take I think that's what it was. Wait, wait

3451
02:32:56,700 --> 02:33:02,780
Where huh? I'm sorry at the bottom at fishman island. There's an apology. They go from from who?

3452
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:05,980
Oh, we don't know

3453
02:33:05,980 --> 02:33:11,580
Do we know what it's I'm sorry. Can you explain this to me like I am stupid? Yeah, I don't understand. I don't remember what you're talking about

3454
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:16,860
I I looked at it a few weeks ago and I need to relook at it just to remember

3455
02:33:18,140 --> 02:33:19,660
um

3456
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:21,660
So the poneglyphs we know about

3457
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:23,980
Sea forest yugu kingdom fishman island

3458
02:33:24,460 --> 02:33:29,660
All right, nicka robin initially believed this poneglyph held vital information to understanding the void sentry

3459
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:32,780
However, upon finding it she noted that it was different from the other poneglyphs

3460
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:38,940
She had found reading more like an apology letter than a historical text the message was written by a man from the surface known as joyboy

3461
02:33:38,940 --> 02:33:41,180
Okay, so joyboy wrote this poneglyph

3462
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:45,420
In the message, he apologized to the people of fishman island for breaking part of his promise

3463
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:51,340
Which involves returning to fishman island to carry out noah's purpose. Okay, so that's not what I was returning to fishman island

3464
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:56,380
To carry out noah's purpose. So he apologized for not doing that or he said he would do that

3465
02:33:57,100 --> 02:33:58,540
uh

3466
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:00,540
Yeah, something about noah

3467
02:34:00,540 --> 02:34:04,300
Uh, the gigantic no is yeah, I was gonna say okay. No is the giant ship, right?

3468
02:34:05,100 --> 02:34:07,100
Okay. No. Yes. Here here it is

3469
02:34:07,180 --> 02:34:09,180
At least 25 years ago

3470
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:11,020
This is the fourth

3471
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:11,980
red

3472
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:13,340
Road poneglyph

3473
02:34:13,340 --> 02:34:18,860
At least 25 years ago. This poneglyph was located at the sea forest next to joyboy's apology message

3474
02:34:19,980 --> 02:34:25,420
At a certain point later that the road poneglyph wereabouts became unknown and it is currently considered lust

3475
02:34:26,940 --> 02:34:30,380
And then there's a speculation however, it's speculated to be in the position of

3476
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:32,060
Hino

3477
02:34:32,060 --> 02:34:34,780
Kizu who's the head Hino Hino Kizu is the

3478
02:34:36,380 --> 02:34:39,740
Oh, Hino Kizu is the name given to a mysterious man possessing a burn sky

3479
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:41,900
It's just the the man the man marked by flames

3480
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:44,780
Hino Iso

3481
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:47,100
Hino Hino Kizu

3482
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:55,420
So yeah, it used to be right next to joyboy's apology message next to fishman island at some point

3483
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:57,980
25 years ago

3484
02:34:57,980 --> 02:35:00,940
Yeah, I mean someone like fisher tiger kind of makes sense

3485
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:04,620
I don't know if fisher tiger is even alive, but um

3486
02:35:06,620 --> 02:35:08,620
Yeah, it's a mysterious man

3487
02:35:09,260 --> 02:35:11,260
And that's all we know

3488
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:14,620
But we know it used to be under fishman island

3489
02:35:14,620 --> 02:35:20,060
So if there's any clues it would be some relation to fishman island man marked by flames

3490
02:35:20,460 --> 02:35:26,940
I immediately think of the sun pirates, you know the burns the the branding iron turned into a pirate emblem. Yeah

3491
02:35:28,140 --> 02:35:31,900
But I I don't know. I don't know how you could make that work

3492
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:34,300
with fisher tiger

3493
02:35:34,300 --> 02:35:38,060
Or it could be just some other pirate crew member from that crew, but like

3494
02:35:39,260 --> 02:35:45,580
I don't know. Why would he do that? I guess a fishman might have the ability to do fishman karate and make whirlpools

3495
02:35:46,460 --> 02:35:49,100
Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, probably the blackbeard pirates were like

3496
02:35:49,740 --> 02:35:54,940
Hypothesizing that it was a devil fruit power and it might not be it might be a fishman karate technique

3497
02:35:55,900 --> 02:35:57,900
Something that jim pay could learn

3498
02:35:57,900 --> 02:36:01,260
Oh, fine. Oh our helmsman. We can level up our helmsman

3499
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:04,460
You can get a power. Yes, okay

3500
02:36:05,580 --> 02:36:07,580
all right, so

3501
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:11,180
Probably probably not gonna probably not gonna crack this mystery

3502
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:13,660
No, yeah

3503
02:36:13,660 --> 02:36:17,500
Um, oh man, I'm gonna say it's a fishman. That's my vague guess

3504
02:36:18,380 --> 02:36:20,380
That it's at least a fishman

3505
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:23,740
Because how could he put a fucking move it from under the ocean?

3506
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:27,340
How they gonna move it?

3507
02:36:27,660 --> 02:36:33,900
Well, okay, we don't I mean we don't know that the guy who's got it now is the same guy who took it

3508
02:36:34,460 --> 02:36:37,980
In the first place so like a fish even if a fishman took it

3509
02:36:37,980 --> 02:36:43,100
He might have given it to some other guy this guy marked by flames or maybe that guy stole it from the other guy

3510
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:47,180
Yeah, it could be a fishman. I don't know seems like it really could be anything

3511
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:55,820
I mean a fish a tiger fish a tiger died from blood loss after being ambushed and shot by a squad of marines. Oh, no, he died. Oh

3512
02:36:56,460 --> 02:36:58,460
Yeah fringe

3513
02:36:58,940 --> 02:37:00,940
Cringe

3514
02:37:01,900 --> 02:37:05,420
Uh, why what a cool white all the good ones die

3515
02:37:06,220 --> 02:37:10,860
What a cool guy, you know, he was like, yeah, I'm racist, but

3516
02:37:11,980 --> 02:37:14,700
I get that I shouldn't be so I'm not gonna let it

3517
02:37:15,740 --> 02:37:18,460
Not was he racist? I thought he was definitely hated humans

3518
02:37:18,460 --> 02:37:21,660
He was he there's definitely a part where he's like, I hate humans

3519
02:37:21,820 --> 02:37:24,620
I'll never be able to stop hating humans because of what they did to me

3520
02:37:24,940 --> 02:37:30,620
But I understand that like a future where humans and fishman can like cooperate

3521
02:37:30,940 --> 02:37:32,540
Is like preferable

3522
02:37:32,540 --> 02:37:36,220
So I'm I'm not gonna like outlaw them or anything. He there was something like that

3523
02:37:36,460 --> 02:37:40,140
But yeah, he himself was like, yes, I cannot get over my hatred of humans

3524
02:37:41,580 --> 02:37:45,420
He's I'm reading and it says even though he hated humans according to Hancock

3525
02:37:45,740 --> 02:37:51,420
He did not discriminate against them when it came to slavery and liberated every one of them during his raid of marishwa

3526
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:57,900
That's pretty cool. He hates hates humans, but he hates the institution of slavery even more. It was pretty reasonable

3527
02:37:57,900 --> 02:38:06,380
Yes, he did not believe in revenge on humans for the discrimination. He just don't like him. Just just is racist against sure

3528
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:09,100
And I mean who's among us

3529
02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:15,900
His compassion to humans was further demonstrated when he vowed to take a child who was a former slave back to her hometown

3530
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:21,020
Going as far as to mark her with his own jolly roger to lift the burden of slavery off her back

3531
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:25,100
Yes, I remember that koala was the name of the girl, right

3532
02:38:25,980 --> 02:38:27,980
Right

3533
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:32,380
And koala is in the revolutionary army, right? She's like, um, was friends with sabo

3534
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:35,660
Yeah, that's the girl

3535
02:38:36,220 --> 02:38:38,460
I remember now sounds right. Yeah

3536
02:38:40,140 --> 02:38:42,140
Hey, yeah

3537
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:44,380
Hey, yeah koala

3538
02:38:44,460 --> 02:38:46,460
One piece. Let me let me

3539
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:52,940
Oh steam punk. Yeah, that was the girl that fisher tiger

3540
02:38:53,020 --> 02:38:55,020
Did something with

3541
02:38:56,620 --> 02:38:58,620
He brought her back to her hometown

3542
02:38:59,420 --> 02:39:03,580
Despite being a lowly little human the pee human give her watch

3543
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:05,980
Give her watch the english dub

3544
02:39:06,220 --> 02:39:07,980
Like the four kids dub

3545
02:39:07,980 --> 02:39:14,140
You know that in the four I know in the four kids in the four kids dub arlong calls humans pee humans

3546
02:39:15,740 --> 02:39:17,740
Because they stink get it

3547
02:39:18,700 --> 02:39:20,860
Uh, he would do that. He would and he did

3548
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:25,820
Oh, you can play as koala in one piece super grand battle x

3549
02:39:27,580 --> 02:39:29,580
I gotta buy holy shit

3550
02:39:30,220 --> 02:39:32,060
Bro

3551
02:39:32,060 --> 02:39:34,380
Check this out. You're not gonna believe this

3552
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:41,500
Si

3553
02:39:42,940 --> 02:39:47,340
Oh, she's got chopper aside. Her head is way too big. What's simsie saying?

3554
02:39:50,860 --> 02:39:52,860
I

3555
02:39:56,780 --> 02:39:58,780
Don't don't understand

3556
02:39:59,740 --> 02:40:01,740
What is this

3557
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:06,780
I don't know

3558
02:40:09,020 --> 02:40:11,020
Oh, that crawfish is gonna be delicious though

3559
02:40:12,060 --> 02:40:13,900
Why did he jump in there?

3560
02:40:13,900 --> 02:40:18,860
He didn't know what he didn't know what else to do. Oh poor little that uh, that's actually really upsetting

3561
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:22,140
Just seeing him like I'm just gonna go over

3562
02:40:24,140 --> 02:40:26,140
Instant death

3563
02:40:26,220 --> 02:40:28,220
Probably not that instant not instant enough

3564
02:40:29,260 --> 02:40:31,020
Not instant enough

3565
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:33,500
Unclear if uh mollusks feel pain

3566
02:40:34,060 --> 02:40:36,620
Or no, I guess they're not mollusks because they're crustaceans

3567
02:40:37,660 --> 02:40:42,540
I think I think crustaceans might not feel pain, you know, it makes me feel pain. That's bad enough

3568
02:40:43,340 --> 02:40:46,300
I I see what you I see what you mean

3569
02:40:47,260 --> 02:40:49,260
Um

3570
02:40:49,820 --> 02:40:56,300
Uh, okay. I mean pretty good one piece this week. Yes. I I guess it was pretty good

3571
02:40:57,180 --> 02:40:59,180
Yeah, it was shut up

3572
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:05,900
I guess it was with your your you gotta have blind loyalty. Okay. We have blind loyalty on this show pretty pretty decent

3573
02:41:06,220 --> 02:41:13,180
Um, you know, sure it was sure it was scuffed and owed as a hack, but I mean, you know what I I've just I've just grown

3574
02:41:13,580 --> 02:41:21,260
Uh, I've just grown weary enough that I'll just accept whatever slop I'm giving. Oh, uh, uh, Cousin join the blackbeard pirate

3575
02:41:22,140 --> 02:41:24,140
Okay

3576
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:26,540
Sure thing oda

3577
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:30,540
Whatever you say, you know, he just you know, he just thinks I'm uh, he thinks I'm an idiot

3578
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:33,660
He's gonna disrespect me like this, but you know what? I like it now

3579
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:40,060
Um, oh one more thing one more. Yeah, I don't either one more thing. Um

3580
02:41:40,060 --> 02:41:41,260
Um

3581
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:46,460
Briefly to mention is Beppo Beppo saved law. Thanks to chopper chopper giving him

3582
02:41:47,260 --> 02:41:49,260
Oh

3583
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:54,620
That uh, okay, okay, okay before un

3584
02:41:55,420 --> 02:42:00,220
Uh documented creation of a Soulong ball or maybe it's just a rumble ball

3585
02:42:00,780 --> 02:42:04,380
Um that allows Beppo to go Soulong without the moon

3586
02:42:05,020 --> 02:42:09,340
Okay, Soulong is when a um, oh fuck. What are those people called?

3587
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:13,500
Is when a mink when it's the full moon and the mink goes like hyper mode, right?

3588
02:42:14,380 --> 02:42:16,060
Okay, so

3589
02:42:16,060 --> 02:42:18,220
Did did chopper make a Soulong ball for?

3590
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:22,060
Like carrot or someone did he make one of these before? No, no

3591
02:42:22,140 --> 02:42:27,980
This is the first time we have seen the idea of chopper using technology to do to put Soulong

3592
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:31,260
I guess this was developed after wano

3593
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:33,900
Before the three crews

3594
02:42:34,300 --> 02:42:38,060
Set their you know sites for different islands and left chopper was like

3595
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:43,820
I wonder if Soulong could be like used more than just the full moon. I guess and then he made that little thing

3596
02:42:44,700 --> 02:42:48,460
Wow, there's a little panel where Beppo is eating something and he's remembering chopper

3597
02:42:49,580 --> 02:42:54,860
Oh, he's he's eating. Okay. I saw the little uh, oh, yeah, he chomps it. He chomps it. Yeah

3598
02:42:55,420 --> 02:42:59,020
Cute little chomp. Oh, he's so cute. He is

3599
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:01,340
Beppo

3600
02:43:01,340 --> 02:43:03,340
And they turned into this giant

3601
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:04,780
Flaming

3602
02:43:04,780 --> 02:43:10,060
Bear beast. Yeah, it's really cool. Actually. Yeah. Okay. I wasn't sure what was going on with the little chopper bubble

3603
02:43:10,940 --> 02:43:14,460
I see. Yes. He made a he made a Soulong ball, of course

3604
02:43:15,500 --> 02:43:16,940
Makes sense

3605
02:43:16,940 --> 02:43:18,940
So Beppo saves the captain

3606
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:22,460
Yeah, uh, finally Beppo has done something

3607
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:27,020
Every instance we've seen Beppo. He's been like he's just standing there

3608
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:30,540
He's just been a cute funny bear who's always scared and and law

3609
02:43:31,180 --> 02:43:33,180
Presumably likes him because he's cute

3610
02:43:33,980 --> 02:43:35,500
Yeah, understandable

3611
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:41,260
I just remembered because he mentions like the freezing ports of the north blue because he's from north blue

3612
02:43:41,820 --> 02:43:43,820
Uh, it's probably just because

3613
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:46,620
Law was in the cold area and he met a bear

3614
02:43:47,500 --> 02:43:53,020
And a bear who was like, oh, I'm oh, I'm a little bear and law was like, ah, join my crew

3615
02:43:56,700 --> 02:43:58,700
And so they've been buddies forever

3616
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:01,580
So this is this heartwarming

3617
02:44:02,620 --> 02:44:07,340
But uh, also the his entire crew is destroyed and his ship is destroyed and law is fucked

3618
02:44:07,580 --> 02:44:13,340
But he's not dead. He's not he's not fucked. He's got Beppo. He's got as long as he's got as long as he's got Beppo

3619
02:44:13,420 --> 02:44:15,420
there's hope

3620
02:44:16,220 --> 02:44:19,260
Yeah, so the new heart pirates are gonna be Beppo and law

3621
02:44:20,620 --> 02:44:21,980
um

3622
02:44:21,980 --> 02:44:23,660
There is that one guy

3623
02:44:23,660 --> 02:44:29,660
You can see it when the submarine is being destroyed the one guy on the left with the with the with the hair with the hair

3624
02:44:29,820 --> 02:44:31,820
he's the fishman from

3625
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:34,380
a shabaldi

3626
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:39,500
I remember him joining the the the the the heart pirates crew

3627
02:44:40,140 --> 02:44:43,260
After being saved by law during all that hubbub

3628
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:44,860
Man

3629
02:44:44,860 --> 02:44:46,860
A submarine is awesome

3630
02:44:46,860 --> 02:44:50,060
It is it's awesome to have a submarine as your pirate ship

3631
02:44:50,700 --> 02:44:55,660
It's so cool pretty cowardly though. You can't show off your your big flag if you're underwater

3632
02:44:56,300 --> 02:45:01,980
Um, fuck off. Uh, he's got it painted on his side. It's fine. It's cool. You know what? He's

3633
02:45:02,780 --> 02:45:08,220
He's not he's not bound by tradition. He's think he's thinking outside the box and I appreciate it. Uh,

3634
02:45:08,540 --> 02:45:10,540
Yeah, damn now it's wrecked

3635
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:15,900
It is pretty I guess that like there's not more submarine type things. I wonder who built that

3636
02:45:17,020 --> 02:45:18,300
Yeah

3637
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:20,300
It does it makes you wonder why

3638
02:45:20,780 --> 02:45:25,020
Why does he have a submarine? Why is he the only one with a submarine?

3639
02:45:25,900 --> 02:45:26,940
What's going on?

3640
02:45:26,940 --> 02:45:34,140
He doesn't need to like coat his ship with like bubble goo to go to fishman island. He could just drive the ship there

3641
02:45:34,460 --> 02:45:41,980
It's see it seems like uh the ship can surface like it's upside down in this panel, but it seems like

3642
02:45:42,700 --> 02:45:44,700
There's like decks that you could stand on

3643
02:45:44,940 --> 02:45:50,540
Yeah, stuff like if it were if it were on so like yeah, it can come up and hang out on the surface if it wants to

3644
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:53,420
I don't remember seeing it before. I'm sure we've seen it before. I just

3645
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:55,900
Oh, no, we've seen it loads of times. Yeah

3646
02:45:56,540 --> 02:46:01,900
Yeah, I just I mean that was the ship that was the ship that saved luffy during the war at marenford

3647
02:46:02,620 --> 02:46:04,620
Right

3648
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:07,340
You know I just

3649
02:46:07,900 --> 02:46:09,900
So hard to keep

3650
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:11,980
Everything sorted in my mind

3651
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:15,100
Uh, I just I see this and I'm like, yeah, okay

3652
02:46:15,740 --> 02:46:20,860
I I don't remember, but I'm sure that that's what it looked like. Uh, it's it's cool

3653
02:46:21,420 --> 02:46:25,980
I mean, I don't think we've seen it in a while. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just I'm you know

3654
02:46:25,980 --> 02:46:29,660
I look at this and it's it's as though it were new to me and I nod and I go, huh cool ship

3655
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:33,260
Yeah, cool ship too bad. It's dead too bad. Oh, well

3656
02:46:34,140 --> 02:46:36,140
Um, so yeah, that was a good chapter

3657
02:46:36,780 --> 02:46:38,780
I await more

3658
02:46:39,980 --> 02:46:41,980
What's what's uh

3659
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:46,140
What's what's gonna happen? I mean, well, okay, we've seen laws fate

3660
02:46:46,860 --> 02:46:48,860
Law is yeah blackbird has

3661
02:46:49,900 --> 02:46:51,500
two

3662
02:46:51,500 --> 02:46:57,580
Do you think we still don't know if law like luffy shared the one from inside the uh

3663
02:46:58,300 --> 02:47:02,380
The thing I guess I guess to keep the stakes high. Maybe it was all three

3664
02:47:02,940 --> 02:47:08,140
And so they shared all three so now shanks blackbeard and luffy have three of the four

3665
02:47:08,700 --> 02:47:10,860
And they're all looking for the mysterious man

3666
02:47:11,740 --> 02:47:15,580
Yeah, and whoever finds him first that would make sense would be able to get it I guess

3667
02:47:17,020 --> 02:47:19,020
That would that would make sense

3668
02:47:20,220 --> 02:47:21,340
um

3669
02:47:21,340 --> 02:47:22,940
Do you think

3670
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:26,700
I mean kuzan is seems to have been beaten or is

3671
02:47:27,580 --> 02:47:31,660
I think the fight fight might go on but I don't think kuzan

3672
02:47:33,340 --> 02:47:36,700
That there's there's two ways it could go one is kuzan could

3673
02:47:37,420 --> 02:47:44,140
Ultimately decimate everyone and then kill kobe and that's bad because kobe needs to escape

3674
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:47,100
I think garp might sacrifice himself to save kobe

3675
02:47:47,660 --> 02:47:50,460
But I also don't know if kuzan would want to go far enough

3676
02:47:51,100 --> 02:47:55,260
To actually kill garp. I don't think so. I really don't think so

3677
02:47:55,820 --> 02:47:59,580
Uh, but I think maybe to keep up appearances. He would do it

3678
02:48:00,300 --> 02:48:03,820
If it if his if his goal matters that much that he needs to stay

3679
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:11,500
Like undercover that hard, but like I don't know. Well, maybe that would be a real that'd be a real heel turn

3680
02:48:11,980 --> 02:48:15,580
Moment for him. That would be really crossing a line. Yeah

3681
02:48:16,780 --> 02:48:23,260
Uh, I think I think it seems like he's done and it seems like his powers don't work on garp and like

3682
02:48:23,900 --> 02:48:28,620
He hesitated and it doesn't seem like he's he's fighting at full strength. I think

3683
02:48:29,900 --> 02:48:35,500
I don't know. Do you think garp is is garp just gonna run wild and just like beat beat the freaking uh

3684
02:48:36,380 --> 02:48:37,340
crew

3685
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:41,260
I don't think he he can't beat the entirety of the blackbeard crew other than like

3686
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:45,980
He can't beat like four blackbeard guys. No, I don't think so

3687
02:48:46,700 --> 02:48:49,820
Yeah, especially since one of them is the island they're standing on

3688
02:48:50,540 --> 02:48:54,060
They're I think they're probably gonna be I think probably because kuzan

3689
02:48:54,860 --> 02:48:56,460
Is sort of throwing

3690
02:48:56,460 --> 02:48:58,620
I think he's probably just they're gonna get away with kobe

3691
02:49:00,220 --> 02:49:02,220
Yeah, I think kobe's gonna survive

3692
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:05,500
I don't know if garp is but I think kobe is gonna survive

3693
02:49:06,300 --> 02:49:09,900
Yeah, I could I could see garp dying but not from kuzan

3694
02:49:10,700 --> 02:49:12,700
One of the other one of the other guys might

3695
02:49:13,100 --> 02:49:18,380
Might get him. Yeah, and kuzan wouldn't be able to help garp without ruining everything for himself

3696
02:49:18,380 --> 02:49:20,380
Possibly

3697
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:25,420
Well, cuz um cuz cuz garp couldn't save

3698
02:49:26,940 --> 02:49:28,940
Uh ace

3699
02:49:29,180 --> 02:49:35,260
Because he had to stand by be like, uh, I couldn't uh couldn't do anything. They were executing ace. I just couldn't do anything

3700
02:49:35,500 --> 02:49:40,940
I'm a marine. That's my job. I just had to just had to stand there and watch and kuzan would be like, uh, well

3701
02:49:40,940 --> 02:49:44,780
I'm a blackbeard. You know, I just just had to stand there and watch while they killed my old uh

3702
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:48,380
My old master. Well, that was the brakes, I guess

3703
02:49:49,580 --> 02:49:51,580
Would kind would kind of be uh

3704
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:55,020
Sort of fitting and for garp in a way, I guess

3705
02:49:57,020 --> 02:49:58,620
I mean garp's old

3706
02:49:58,620 --> 02:50:00,620
You know what he deserves to die

3707
02:50:01,100 --> 02:50:03,100
For being for being old

3708
02:50:04,060 --> 02:50:06,060
Um

3709
02:50:06,700 --> 02:50:08,060
Hmm

3710
02:50:08,060 --> 02:50:09,740
Yeah, so

3711
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:17,100
There's gonna be obviously egghead is probably what's happening. We're gonna focus on again after this

3712
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:21,740
Cuz blackbeard is um his way on his ship

3713
02:50:23,100 --> 02:50:29,020
With probably every blackbeard pirate that is not featured in this little garp mission

3714
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:35,420
And they're going to a

3715
02:50:35,420 --> 02:50:38,620
They're going they probably have putting in the brig

3716
02:50:39,740 --> 02:50:43,900
And they haven't seen egghead in a while. It's been like three weeks. Oh, yeah

3717
02:50:45,180 --> 02:50:47,180
Le Mans

3718
02:50:48,620 --> 02:50:52,220
Ah, there's so much and then there's the big buster call. There's the

3719
02:50:53,020 --> 02:50:55,740

3720
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:58,300

3721
02:50:58,300 --> 02:51:03,660
J garcia sadden j garcia sadden. Are they are they buster calling egghead? Is that what they're doing?

3722
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:06,540
There's something calling. I don't think it's literally a buster call

3723
02:51:06,540 --> 02:51:09,020
But it's just like a fuck ton of battleships are coming

3724
02:51:09,980 --> 02:51:14,060
Yeah, uh to destroy this island because of information

3725

impulsive arrow

3735
02:51:39,900 --> 02:51:41,900

3736
02:51:43,260 --> 02:51:45,260
Okay, never mind. I'm googling it

All right, good chapter very exciting. Shall we go into voicemails?

3740
02:52:01,020 --> 02:52:03,020
Um, yeah

3741
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:05,100
Yeah

3742
02:52:05,260 --> 02:52:07,260
Yelp

3743
02:52:08,060 --> 02:52:10,060
speakbip.com slash pzp voicemails

3744
02:52:12,460 --> 02:52:14,460
If you want to die

3745
02:52:16,620 --> 02:52:22,460
Okay, the first one. Oh the first one is called beast capades late suggestion

3746

Are you ready? Mm-hmm. Okay, three two one go

3747
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:31,900
This will be outdated already, but uh

3748
02:52:32,620 --> 02:52:33,820
Uh

3749
02:52:33,820 --> 02:52:35,820
Regarding the beast capades

3750
02:52:37,580 --> 02:52:39,580
Uh gift versus

3751
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:42,300
Png release format

3752
02:52:43,340 --> 02:52:52,860
I give you wrong ban you right? You should just focus on one type of release. Thanks. Don't divide your small audience even further

3753
02:52:54,460 --> 02:52:55,500
Um

3754
02:52:55,500 --> 02:52:58,060
Don't rely on multiple people

3755
02:52:58,700 --> 02:53:01,900
You're like, oh, I want to I want to be I want to see that again

3756
02:53:02,540 --> 02:53:04,940
and just put a lot of effort into something that's

3757
02:53:05,980 --> 02:53:07,980
Gonna satisfy two people

3758
02:53:09,420 --> 02:53:11,660
Uh, sorry if this is too authoritative

3759
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:21,740
That's fine. You can do that. I don't remember what was the other point. Uh, goodbye. Yeah, um

3760
02:53:22,300 --> 02:53:24,300
Um

3761
02:53:24,620 --> 02:53:29,660
I was um, I think probably making it as gifts is just like

3762
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:35,580
It's probably better just to not do it because it's like it's like a lot more work

3763
02:53:36,540 --> 02:53:37,500
and like

3764
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,500
Does it does it increase?

3765
02:53:39,500 --> 02:53:40,620
enjoyment

3766
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:42,380
For the reader like a ton

3767
02:53:42,380 --> 02:53:43,980
maybe sometimes

3768
02:53:43,980 --> 02:53:45,980
But like I can just make the panels look good

3769
02:53:46,860 --> 02:53:49,340
In a static format too. Yeah, and that's fine

3770
02:53:49,980 --> 02:53:51,980
My my my thing is still like

3771
02:53:53,260 --> 02:53:55,260
You may be making two people

3772
02:53:55,820 --> 02:54:01,740
More happy, but if one of those people is me the author then I would do it because fuck it

3773
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:04,620
Yeah, I mean, yeah

3774
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:09,340
I'm I'm not I'm not smart

3775
02:54:09,500 --> 02:54:14,540
I understand that in in in like a in like a efficiency way, but that's why I draw

3776
02:54:15,420 --> 02:54:16,860
I

3777
02:54:16,860 --> 02:54:18,060
me

3778
02:54:18,060 --> 02:54:19,740
As the author

3779
02:54:19,740 --> 02:54:24,780
Yeah, I guess like having it be exactly the way I wanted it to be would make me

3780
02:54:25,820 --> 02:54:28,300
Would make me happy, but on the one hand

3781
02:54:29,260 --> 02:54:33,580
There's always going to be compromise in anything you do. Nothing will ever be perfect

3782
02:54:34,460 --> 02:54:35,740
and

3783
02:54:35,740 --> 02:54:37,740
Yeah, having making it one way

3784
02:54:39,100 --> 02:54:44,300
If I if I make it one way in static images and then I go back and I make it again in gift form

3785
02:54:45,100 --> 02:54:46,060
That

3786
02:54:46,060 --> 02:54:49,260
Even though I might like the result that process is going to make me miserable

3787
02:54:49,740 --> 02:54:55,260
Sure, because I'm just be like I've already done it. So I think my my happiness would be decreased

3788
02:54:56,300 --> 02:54:58,300
So, yeah, I think uh

3789
02:54:59,180 --> 02:55:02,860
Perfect comic party static images is what I'm going to do for the time being

3790
02:55:03,660 --> 02:55:07,900
Um next one is called slime and punishment book three two one go

3791
02:55:08,860 --> 02:55:10,860
Ah, yes, Ben, please

3792
02:55:11,660 --> 02:55:13,500

3793
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:14,860
release

3794
02:55:14,860 --> 02:55:16,860
Slime and punishment as a god damn

3795
02:55:18,060 --> 02:55:20,060
A comic already

3796
02:55:20,620 --> 02:55:23,340
I've been waiting for a year. I've been sorry

3797
02:55:24,140 --> 02:55:27,660
Some people to read it as I borrowed it to them

3798
02:55:28,300 --> 02:55:30,860
For a year and they are still waiting

3799
02:55:32,140 --> 02:55:33,580
Besides that

3800
02:55:33,580 --> 02:55:38,300
I really would like them to experience the game because I love the game

3801
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:42,060
It's the main thing that makes me want to buy this expensive. That's the thing

3802
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:45,260
It's gonna be that expensive

3803
02:55:45,980 --> 02:55:47,980
Unless you're foreign

3804
02:55:47,980 --> 02:55:53,100
I want to know is the comic doesn't comic make it obvious when

3805
02:55:54,300 --> 02:55:58,860
You could just play the game instead of reading the comic version

3806
02:55:59,820 --> 02:56:03,100
Uh, please and thank you. I mean

3807
02:56:03,820 --> 02:56:08,380
I mean, there's a section of the comic where the panels are

3808
02:56:09,660 --> 02:56:16,700
Like game in-game shots. So like yeah, it's really it's really clear what part is the game and what part is not

3809
02:56:17,580 --> 02:56:21,180
Uh, it's like I think it's like 30 pages or something. It's like 35 pages

3810
02:56:21,900 --> 02:56:26,300
Uh, you know, I just got I just this week. It was late

3811
02:56:26,380 --> 02:56:31,980
I ordered from etsy a piece of fluorescent pink fabric to be my green my black light green screen

3812
02:56:32,380 --> 02:56:34,860
for that shot I wanted to do for the um

3813

02:56:48,940 --> 02:56:50,940

Nice and yeah, I have I should have everything I need for it now

3819
02:56:59,420 --> 02:57:01,420
Uh pretty cool

3820

Uh, you know progress continues even though

3821
02:57:05,580 --> 02:57:07,580
Never as fast as I would like

3822
02:57:07,580 --> 02:57:11,660

02:58:40,140 --> 02:58:42,140
What's that mr. Match

3844
02:58:42,540 --> 02:58:45,580
One more program to upload to my toaster

3845
02:58:46,780 --> 02:58:50,540
Well, I suppose I could I suppose I can do that

3846
02:58:50,620 --> 02:58:55,580
I could suppose I can upload one more little little little thing or whatnot in my toaster

3847
02:58:56,780 --> 02:58:58,780
Okay, here goes or whatnot

3848
02:59:03,100 --> 02:59:07,420
What mr. Match my house is on fire

3849
02:59:09,820 --> 02:59:14,140
I think it was a coffee maker. I think it was a coffee maker that

3850
02:59:14,700 --> 02:59:16,700
Lipped her house on fire

3851
02:59:17,660 --> 02:59:19,660
That's um mr

3852
02:59:20,380 --> 02:59:22,380
Mr. Match is a guy from

3853
02:59:22,700 --> 02:59:28,860
Uh mega man battle network. He tells you that he's good. He's a bad guy, but then he tells you he's good now

3854
02:59:29,100 --> 02:59:31,900
Hey, I'm good now. Hey now that I'm good. Would you go around and

3855
02:59:32,460 --> 02:59:34,860
Put all these programs into all these important machines

3856
02:59:35,420 --> 02:59:40,060
And then you do it and then there's like, ah, it was bad. Ah, the place is on fire. Ah, everything's on fire

3857
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:42,460
Ah, your dad's in the hospital the mal

3858
02:59:43,100 --> 02:59:44,220
Gotcha

3859
02:59:44,220 --> 02:59:45,980
Gotcha

3860
02:59:46,060 --> 02:59:49,660
All right, next one is called sick new t-shirts 3 2 1 go

3861
02:59:50,460 --> 02:59:55,500
Um, you should make a t-shirt with the new pcp like icon like the skull icon

3862
02:59:56,300 --> 03:00:01,580
On it because that's true that is hell and uh, it it belongs on a shirt. I think it would work really well

3863
03:00:02,140 --> 03:00:05,340
Um, I've noticed that the old tpc logo

3864
03:00:05,980 --> 03:00:11,180
Shirt has it as like just a really big image on the shirt, which I think maybe would work better for the skull

3865
03:00:11,180 --> 03:00:14,300
I don't think it worked well for that one. I think it would have been better as like a breast

3866
03:00:14,860 --> 03:00:19,260
Like the small image on the breast area, you know what I'm talking about

3867
03:00:19,660 --> 03:00:23,900
I know exactly what you're talking about, but for the skull, maybe that one would work with both of those formats

3868
03:00:23,980 --> 03:00:26,700
I don't know. I don't know. I'm just I'm just telling you what I want to see

3869
03:00:26,700 --> 03:00:28,700
I'm just telling you what I want to see so I can give you money

3870
03:00:29,180 --> 03:00:34,300
You know what? I think he's right. No reason not to make a shirt with the new branding. Yeah

3871
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:39,100
Okay, can I get a bigger cut because I made the logo

3872
03:00:39,100 --> 03:00:41,100
Oh

3873
03:01:01,500 --> 03:01:03,020
Next one is called

3874
03:01:03,020 --> 03:01:05,020
WTF 321 go

3875
03:01:05,660 --> 03:01:07,660
What the fuck been saint?

3876
03:01:07,660 --> 03:01:14,620
How the hell did you look at $2,000 for americans and think that's way too much

3877
03:01:15,180 --> 03:01:18,540
And chopped it up the stock market some bullshit deficits

3878
03:01:18,780 --> 03:01:24,700
He really said fuck your rent and the fact that you're essential in some ways you're worse than

3879
03:01:24,940 --> 03:01:26,940
Reagan and Thatcher

3880
03:01:26,940 --> 03:01:30,380
Was it we still are two are already dead

3881
03:01:30,940 --> 03:01:37,500
2023 only just started and you're already making it worse

3882
03:01:50,940 --> 03:01:52,940
I don't know what I did. I don't know

3883
03:01:53,820 --> 03:01:57,500
You're seeing a song and I could not for the life of me figure out what song

3884
03:01:57,980 --> 03:02:05,180
Was he talking about the covid relief $2,000 for americans when when I say that wasn't that was too much

3885
03:02:06,460 --> 03:02:08,460
That's silly. That's silly

3886
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:11,180
Um, thanks for the voice

3887
03:02:14,220 --> 03:02:23,420
I don't even know why why would you say these things? Um, okay, uh, next one is called. Oh, it's an image. Okay. Let's take a look

3888
03:02:24,060 --> 03:02:26,060
It's an image

3889
03:02:27,740 --> 03:02:29,740
Okay

3890
03:02:31,980 --> 03:02:38,460
It's jesse serving me a dmca. I'm sure to win because my flange is superior

3891
03:02:40,940 --> 03:02:42,860
Well, I mean

3892
03:02:42,860 --> 03:02:44,860
It's just true. It's just true

3893
03:02:45,580 --> 03:02:49,020
It's exactly how it it it would go and how it did go

3894
03:02:50,700 --> 03:02:51,980
Thank you

3895
03:02:51,980 --> 03:02:53,980
voice mailman

3896
03:02:53,980 --> 03:02:56,060
Uh, let's uh, let's look at the next one

3897
03:02:58,220 --> 03:02:59,500
Oh, it's a

3898
03:02:59,500 --> 03:03:01,500
anime girl

3899
03:03:01,580 --> 03:03:03,100
Of some kind

3900
03:03:03,100 --> 03:03:07,980
It sure is sure is it sure is

3901
03:03:08,380 --> 03:03:10,380
I don't uh, I don't get it

3902
03:03:10,540 --> 03:03:12,540
Next one is called my darkest fantasy

3903
03:03:13,260 --> 03:03:15,820
fugitive ben saint 3 2 1 go

3904
03:03:19,580 --> 03:03:22,540
So, um, if you killed someone and

3905
03:03:22,780 --> 03:03:27,500
There was a dead body sitting in the middle of your room right now

3906
03:03:28,700 --> 03:03:32,780
Uh, what would you do with the body and then after that will be your next move?

3907
03:03:33,580 --> 03:03:36,940
And everyone knows everyone knows that that person was at your house

3908
03:03:41,260 --> 03:03:44,860
Hmm. Oh, did you kill them? That's the important part

3909
03:03:46,060 --> 03:03:49,900
If he doesn't say you killed them, so I'm thinking no you didn't

3910
03:03:49,900 --> 03:03:55,660
Well, if I didn't then I would call the police and say there's a corpse in my house and I don't know what happened

3911
03:03:56,700 --> 03:04:01,740
Because then I'm like, oh, I reported the body. I didn't do it because I didn't yeah

3912
03:04:03,020 --> 03:04:07,100
Yeah, if you just if I try to hide it then you could get caught and then

3913
03:04:08,140 --> 03:04:11,020
You're obviously implicated as the culprit

3914
03:04:12,540 --> 03:04:14,540
Let me let me listen again

3915
03:04:15,100 --> 03:04:19,900
No, no, he does it if you killed someone. Okay, so if I killed him

3916
03:04:21,500 --> 03:04:24,060
Um or her don't exclude

3917
03:04:24,700 --> 03:04:26,700
um

3918
03:04:27,500 --> 03:04:29,500
I mean, I guess I would

3919
03:04:30,140 --> 03:04:31,980
I think

3920
03:04:31,980 --> 03:04:33,660
ooh

3921
03:04:33,660 --> 03:04:35,660
Okay

3922
03:04:36,300 --> 03:04:38,300
I think

3923
03:04:39,020 --> 03:04:42,860
That I'm not smart enough to like get away with it

3924
03:04:43,820 --> 03:04:46,620
So so I think the move is

3925
03:04:48,860 --> 03:04:50,860
Okay, the move is probably

3926
03:04:53,660 --> 03:04:59,020
Hide the body as quickly as I can maybe you know, maybe bury it maybe maybe

3927
03:04:59,980 --> 03:05:04,620
Bury it like that night like dig a hole and bury it in the backyard. No, maybe that's even like two

3928
03:05:06,380 --> 03:05:11,900
That's a lot of work moving enough dirt to put a human being underground. I genuinely think

3929
03:05:13,420 --> 03:05:17,820
Actually that I might just put the body in my closet or something

3930
03:05:18,540 --> 03:05:22,300
Like put the like because like people might see me digging people might see me digging

3931
03:05:23,420 --> 03:05:28,860
Whereas like if it's just in my room like nobody's gonna come into my room until like a police investigation starts

3932
03:05:29,180 --> 03:05:31,740
so I think I might just hide the body in my closet

3933
03:05:33,020 --> 03:05:34,460
and then

3934
03:05:34,460 --> 03:05:36,060
just like

3935
03:05:36,060 --> 03:05:37,900
Get all my money

3936
03:05:37,900 --> 03:05:43,500
Get all the money that I have like like withdraw it from all my accounts that I have access to and just like

3937
03:05:44,060 --> 03:05:45,660
I put it to bitcoin

3938
03:05:45,660 --> 03:05:51,180
I put it to bitcoin. No and just and just flee somewhere and just like flee to I don't know canada or something

3939
03:05:51,980 --> 03:05:53,980
You get caught in canada

3940
03:05:54,460 --> 03:05:57,900
You got to go like to a small island in the pacific

3941
03:05:59,820 --> 03:06:01,980
Yeah, maybe maybe the philippines or something

3942
03:06:03,420 --> 03:06:06,540
They they don't have america laws

3943
03:06:07,900 --> 03:06:14,060
I don't know how laws work. I don't I wonder if my oh, I might need to renew my passport. I'm not sure if my passport's still valid

3944
03:06:15,100 --> 03:06:17,100
Yeah, I think

3945
03:06:17,340 --> 03:06:20,060
The the move is hide quick quickly hide the body

3946
03:06:21,340 --> 03:06:23,340
Get as get as much of my money as I can

3947
03:06:24,220 --> 03:06:25,420
and just

3948
03:06:25,420 --> 03:06:27,500
Try and escape

3949
03:06:27,500 --> 03:06:30,220
to somewhere and and go off the grid

3950
03:06:32,300 --> 03:06:37,020
Because uh, I don't think there's any I don't think there's any like getting away with it

3951
03:06:38,860 --> 03:06:44,300
So you're you're resigning yourself to the fact that people will eventually find it and know that you were a murderer

3952
03:06:44,700 --> 03:06:46,700
So you can never come back

3953
03:06:47,900 --> 03:06:49,900
Yeah, probably yeah

3954
03:06:50,940 --> 03:06:52,940
I mean, um

3955
03:06:53,260 --> 03:06:58,060
Maybe I could um, I mean, maybe I could try to make it look like an accident it would depend how I killed them

3956
03:07:00,780 --> 03:07:02,780
Yeah, I don't know I don't think about this

3957
03:07:03,340 --> 03:07:05,340
So I don't know what I would do

3958
03:07:05,500 --> 03:07:08,700
If I killed someone I probably I think I think I think about it all the time

3959
03:07:09,580 --> 03:07:11,580
I'm always thinking about this

3960
03:07:12,220 --> 03:07:14,620
Uh, like if it was premeditated

3961
03:07:15,740 --> 03:07:20,460
Yeah, I probably would have already had a plan but I just like yeah, he didn't say he didn't say it was premeditated

3962
03:07:20,460 --> 03:07:22,780
He he might have just done it in the heat of the moment

3963
03:07:24,140 --> 03:07:26,140
And if that's the case

3964
03:07:27,980 --> 03:07:29,980
Like depending on if I already

3965
03:07:31,260 --> 03:07:32,780
I don't know

3966
03:07:32,780 --> 03:07:35,900
Like right now answering this question. I don't know if there's like

3967
03:07:36,700 --> 03:07:37,820
some

3968
03:07:37,820 --> 03:07:40,300
lesser sentence I could get for like oh, it was

3969
03:07:41,020 --> 03:07:45,820
Just because I was really mad because they beat me in fortnight or whatever or whatever it was

3970
03:07:46,620 --> 03:07:49,980
I think they said I was ugly and I killed them

3971
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:55,660
I think you would be I would still get murder charge. It wouldn't be a different type of thing

3972
03:07:56,460 --> 03:08:00,700
Unless I plead insanity, but then I'd have to prove that and I can't do that. It's hard

3973
03:08:03,020 --> 03:08:08,220
Depending on how you did it. You might be able to get the charges reduced to like manslaughter. Maybe

3974
03:08:09,260 --> 03:08:10,540
Like maybe

3975
03:08:10,540 --> 03:08:15,820
Yeah, you didn't intend to kill them. I don't think I would be emotionally or

3976
03:08:17,100 --> 03:08:21,100
Yeah, I wouldn't be emotionally prepared to think about running away forever

3977
03:08:23,180 --> 03:08:26,700
I would yeah, I would probably end up serving some jail time

3978
03:08:27,900 --> 03:08:30,060
Hopefully not the maximum amount

3979
03:08:30,700 --> 03:08:33,180
You would probably go to jail for years

3980
03:08:34,940 --> 03:08:36,940
Hey, at least I don't go to play rent

3981
03:08:38,460 --> 03:08:39,740
Yeah

3982
03:08:39,740 --> 03:08:40,620
Yeah

3983
03:08:40,620 --> 03:08:46,460
Hell yeah, I mean true. I mean true. They don't have estrogen in jail though. That's the part

3984
03:08:48,220 --> 03:08:50,220
That's probably true

3985
03:08:50,780 --> 03:08:52,140
Oh

3986
03:08:52,140 --> 03:08:54,140
Prisons are woke now

3987
03:08:56,540 --> 03:08:59,100
Yeah, I think my move is I think my move is probably flee

3988
03:09:00,140 --> 03:09:04,300
Honestly, it's a better move than I'm just trying to think how I would react

3989
03:09:04,380 --> 03:09:07,580
I feel like I wouldn't be able to handle it. I would have a fucking breakdown

3990
03:09:08,140 --> 03:09:14,540
I I get it. I get it. I understand the fleeing hiding them and then fleeing is like

3991
03:09:16,060 --> 03:09:17,100
Well

3992
03:09:17,100 --> 03:09:23,820
That I mean that probably makes it that makes my eventual sentence worse if I ever get caught which I probably will

3993
03:09:24,220 --> 03:09:27,260
Let's be real. I'm gonna get caught. They're gonna come for me

3994
03:09:28,220 --> 03:09:30,220
May as well

3995
03:09:31,100 --> 03:09:37,260
Have some maybe the move is maybe the move is just just give up turn myself in immediately

3996
03:09:38,380 --> 03:09:40,380
I don't know. I don't know. Is that the move?

3997
03:09:41,500 --> 03:09:43,500
Does that reduce the eventual consequences

3998
03:09:43,900 --> 03:09:50,780
What if the person what if the person you killed was like everyone hated them and you get a real real small sentence

3999
03:09:51,420 --> 03:09:55,340
If honestly if I think if I think if everyone hated them

4000
03:09:55,900 --> 03:09:59,820
Like nobody like this person at all. Yeah, I think I mean, I would probably still get

4001
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:02,300
sentenced to something

4002
03:10:02,300 --> 03:10:03,260
but

4003
03:10:03,260 --> 03:10:04,460
sentenced to

4004
03:10:04,460 --> 03:10:06,460
A party

4005
03:10:06,620 --> 03:10:12,540
If but if no if nobody is like if nobody is like pursuing this case like know what there's no one who's like

4006
03:10:13,100 --> 03:10:19,420
Really dedicated to making this conviction happen. I feel like yeah, it's probably I'm probably gonna get a pretty light sentence

4007
03:10:20,460 --> 03:10:22,460
If I have a zealous advocate

4008
03:10:23,340 --> 03:10:25,340
Yeah

4009
03:10:25,900 --> 03:10:27,900
So that would change things a little bit

4010
03:10:28,300 --> 03:10:30,300
I'd be like, yeah, I killed this guy

4011
03:10:30,700 --> 03:10:34,220
Yeah, but you know, I said the moral victory though because he was a jerk and nobody liked him

4012
03:10:34,460 --> 03:10:35,420
Yeah, he was illegal

4013
03:10:35,420 --> 03:10:39,580
But you know, everyone kind of wanted to do it and everyone would be like, yeah, I thought about it all the time

4014
03:10:40,060 --> 03:10:42,060
Ben was the only one brave enough

4015
03:10:42,060 --> 03:10:44,060
to actually do it

4016
03:10:44,220 --> 03:10:45,420
Yeah

4017
03:10:45,420 --> 03:10:47,420
All right. All right

4018
03:10:47,660 --> 03:10:49,420
Next one is

4019
03:10:49,420 --> 03:10:51,420
Okay, well the next one is a

4020
03:10:51,900 --> 03:10:55,420
Link and I gather it seems like it's a link to

4021
03:10:58,460 --> 03:11:00,460
Okay, it's the Mon Ben guys channel

4022
03:11:02,940 --> 03:11:04,940
But what do I care about this guy's youtube channel

4023
03:11:07,260 --> 03:11:09,260
This orisawa

4024
03:11:09,500 --> 03:11:12,620
Yeah, I don't care I don't care this guy's got a youtube channel

4025
03:11:15,100 --> 03:11:17,100
I've never read any of this guy's stuff

4026
03:11:18,060 --> 03:11:19,260
Have you?

4027
03:11:19,260 --> 03:11:27,340
Uh, no, in fact, I haven't even really watched Mon Ben yet. I keep thinking I should I will I will but I don't

4028
03:11:27,820 --> 03:11:31,500
This is the guy he did a 20th century boys and monster

4029
03:11:32,140 --> 03:11:36,700
Oh, I fucking have read 20th century boys and I've watched some of monster

4030
03:11:37,900 --> 03:11:39,900
I like his stuff

4031
03:11:40,620 --> 03:11:45,180
20th century boys is really good. You did did you not know that that's the guy that hosts Mon Ben?

4032
03:11:45,580 --> 03:11:50,780
No, I think I I think you must have you've explained it before and I guess I forgot

4033
03:11:51,420 --> 03:11:53,020
No

4034
03:11:53,020 --> 03:11:55,980
Well, I'm not I'm not super familiar with his work outside of that

4035
03:11:57,100 --> 03:12:00,220
Oh, and then this is someone on my stream was telling me to watch

4036
03:12:00,700 --> 03:12:04,780
I guess the new oris or a orisawa is the thing called Pluto

4037
03:12:05,820 --> 03:12:07,820
And someone was telling me I should watch Pluto

4038
03:12:08,380 --> 03:12:10,380
so I don't know

4039
03:12:10,380 --> 03:12:13,100
Maybe I will oh, it's on netflix. Oh, I can't watch it then

4040
03:12:14,060 --> 03:12:16,700
I don't have netflix. I don't have anything. I'm off the grid

4041
03:12:17,420 --> 03:12:20,780
I'm off the grid in case I ever kill someone and they need to escape really fast

4042
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:23,020
So it won't be that much of a culture shock

4043
03:12:23,660 --> 03:12:28,220
If you kill someone and you have a netflix account, it's all over. Yeah, that's how they'll get you

4044
03:12:28,700 --> 03:12:32,140
Like oh, but I really want to watch but I really want to watch Pluto though. I'll see where I

4045
03:12:33,260 --> 03:12:35,500
He's signing in from canada. Go go go get him

4046
03:12:36,380 --> 03:12:40,540
Uh, all right. Next one is called is this the end three two one go

4047
03:12:43,500 --> 03:12:45,020
I

4048
03:12:45,020 --> 03:12:47,980
Did present time ha ha ha ha

4049
03:12:50,620 --> 03:12:55,760
Then Saint is planning on abandoning communism and doing profit from other's comics

4050
03:12:56,780 --> 03:13:01,580
GINE take his planning on helping them come on to the closet and become a woman

4051
03:13:01,580 --> 03:13:03,580
Ben was always destined to be

4052
03:13:04,240 --> 03:13:09,740
Red condo. Gin finally came out killing most of the pcp watcher base

4053
03:13:09,740 --> 03:13:14,740
Half of them died from heart failure, and another have died from nosebleed.

4054
03:13:14,740 --> 03:13:17,740
And this just finally got paid.

4055
03:13:17,740 --> 03:13:18,740
Good for him.

4056
03:13:18,740 --> 03:13:19,740
False.

4057
03:13:19,740 --> 03:13:22,740
Cheesy despite the edgy tweets.

4058
03:13:22,740 --> 03:13:24,740
Has grown soft and vulnerable.

4059
03:13:24,740 --> 03:13:29,740
The oblivion fall was sucked into the giant mommy milkers.

4060
03:13:29,740 --> 03:13:33,740
And the good voicemails were no more.

4061
03:13:33,740 --> 03:13:38,740
And Cybershell, the last YouTuber, was nowhere to be found.

4062
03:13:39,740 --> 03:13:40,740
This is it.

4063
03:13:40,740 --> 03:13:42,740
This is the end.

4064
03:13:42,740 --> 03:13:44,740
The Batman is dead.

4065
03:13:44,740 --> 03:13:46,740
The podcast is dead.

4066
03:13:46,740 --> 03:13:51,740
And I am the last one standing here laughing like a lunatic.

4067
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:56,740
Give me a headache.

4068
03:13:56,740 --> 03:13:59,740
Is that the Joker, baby?

4069
03:13:59,740 --> 03:14:01,740
I don't know.

4070
03:14:01,740 --> 03:14:04,740
I think it's the Joker from something.

4071
03:14:04,740 --> 03:14:08,740
I think he meant Jesse got paid from the Radcon funds, which is technically true.

4072
03:14:08,740 --> 03:14:09,740
Yes, technically true.

4073
03:14:09,740 --> 03:14:10,740
Yes, we all got paid.

4074
03:14:10,740 --> 03:14:13,740
Even the people I don't like got paid from the Radcon funds.

4075
03:14:13,740 --> 03:14:15,740
I couldn't do anything about it.

4076
03:14:21,740 --> 03:14:23,740
It's the end of an arc.

4077
03:14:23,740 --> 03:14:24,740
The end of an era.

4078
03:14:24,740 --> 03:14:27,740
Perfect comic party is the new arc.

4079
03:14:27,740 --> 03:14:29,740
It's getting an ultra slow start.

4080
03:14:29,740 --> 03:14:31,740
Sorry, I didn't get it done this week.

4081
03:14:31,740 --> 03:14:32,740
That's okay.

4082
03:14:32,740 --> 03:14:35,740
I'm also being very sluggish with everything.

4083
03:14:35,740 --> 03:14:42,740
But I'm late now because the Clarissa that was supposed to be in the first one

4084
03:14:42,740 --> 03:14:44,740
is the one that you've already finished, right?

4085
03:14:44,740 --> 03:14:46,740
Like you're already done with the chapter.

4086
03:14:46,740 --> 03:14:47,740
So I'm late.

4087
03:14:47,740 --> 03:14:48,740
I've been late for...

4088
03:14:48,740 --> 03:14:53,740
Hey, how long ago did we come up with the idea for the perfect comic party?

4089
03:14:53,740 --> 03:14:56,740
I want to make myself feel bad for a minute.

4090
03:14:56,740 --> 03:15:01,740
Well, I didn't really start hankering down.

4091
03:15:02,740 --> 03:15:06,740
On the Clarissa until March?

4092
03:15:06,740 --> 03:15:07,740
Oh, really?

4093
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:09,740
I think February...

4094
03:15:09,740 --> 03:15:11,740
No, it was February.

4095
03:15:11,740 --> 03:15:19,740
I was drawing Clarissa and doing Febubri during February.

4096
03:15:19,740 --> 03:15:20,740
Oh.

4097
03:15:20,740 --> 03:15:23,740
And I sort of stopped Febubri and I was continuing to draw Clarissa.

4098
03:15:23,740 --> 03:15:28,740
So it must have been February or January, the end of January where we had the idea.

4099
03:15:28,740 --> 03:15:30,740
I had the idea, I don't know.

4100
03:15:30,740 --> 03:15:32,740
I think I mentioned it.

4101
03:15:32,740 --> 03:15:34,740
That's not as bad as I thought.

4102
03:15:34,740 --> 03:15:36,740
No, it was not last year.

4103
03:15:36,740 --> 03:15:40,740
This is like a new year and oh, everything sucks.

4104
03:15:40,740 --> 03:15:42,740
What are we going to do?

4105
03:15:42,740 --> 03:15:43,740
What are we going to do?

4106
03:15:43,740 --> 03:15:45,740
And it was just like born from that.

4107
03:15:45,740 --> 03:15:47,740
Right, right.

4108
03:15:47,740 --> 03:15:51,740
Yeah, I was...

4109
03:15:51,740 --> 03:15:58,740
Okay, well, you know, the goal of the perfect comic party is to be monthly.

4110
03:15:58,740 --> 03:16:05,740
This month, you know, now it's been like almost three months since we started to have the idea.

4111
03:16:08,740 --> 03:16:10,740
I'm going to be done soon.

4112
03:16:10,740 --> 03:16:15,740
Once the content for the first one is done, we'll get everything sorted out.

4113
03:16:15,740 --> 03:16:18,740
We'll sort out the format, we'll figure out.

4114
03:16:18,740 --> 03:16:22,740
And then the next one will just be content.

4115
03:16:22,740 --> 03:16:26,740
Maybe the second one won't come out in one month, but it'll be like...

4116
03:16:27,740 --> 03:16:29,740
Well, we'll shoot for a month.

4117
03:16:29,740 --> 03:16:32,740
We'll shoot for a month and we'll end among the stars.

4118
03:16:32,740 --> 03:16:34,740
That's right, that's right.

4119
03:16:36,740 --> 03:16:41,740
A couple more Biscuits pages to go and then I'll be done with this chapter.

4120
03:16:43,740 --> 03:16:45,740
Next one.

4121
03:16:45,740 --> 03:16:47,740
Oh, a hopeful.

4122
03:16:47,740 --> 03:16:49,740
Next one is called This is Not the End.

4123
03:16:49,740 --> 03:16:51,740
We have hope yet.

4124
03:16:51,740 --> 03:16:53,740
Three, two, one, go.

4125
03:16:57,740 --> 03:16:59,740
Metta-Man, wake up.

4126
03:16:59,740 --> 03:17:01,740
We are in big trouble.

4127
03:17:01,740 --> 03:17:04,740
Dr. Wahwee has spread robo-

4128
03:17:04,740 --> 03:17:06,740
Wahwee.

4129
03:17:06,740 --> 03:17:12,740
It has a ready-to-form, the famous Megumin YouTuber.

4130
03:17:12,740 --> 03:17:17,740
Into a zoombie with purple skin and green teeth.

4131
03:17:17,740 --> 03:17:19,740
What the actual fuck?

4132
03:17:19,740 --> 03:17:22,740
Get away from me, you crazy bum.

4133
03:17:22,740 --> 03:17:24,740
You smell of beer and pee.

4134
03:17:24,740 --> 03:17:25,740
Gross.

4135
03:17:25,740 --> 03:17:26,740
Go.

4136
03:17:26,740 --> 03:17:27,740
Get a shower.

4137
03:17:27,740 --> 03:17:28,740
Or something.

4138
03:17:28,740 --> 03:17:31,740
Also acid green tea, thorough hip, new thing.

4139
03:17:31,740 --> 03:17:33,740
And I tweet light-farkle.

4140
03:17:33,740 --> 03:17:39,740
A legally distinct individual from recently deceased twilight sparkle.

4141
03:17:39,740 --> 03:17:42,740
And always on top of hip new things.

4142
03:17:42,740 --> 03:17:45,740
Oh no, so you are already in pain.

4143
03:17:45,740 --> 03:17:48,740
In all, in fear, infected.

4144
03:17:48,740 --> 03:17:52,740
Yes, I am indeed already a rowdy cock cucker.

4145
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:56,740
And I do not help with PCP obsession with comics.

4146
03:17:56,740 --> 03:18:00,740
In fact, I will do the exact opposite.

4147
03:18:00,740 --> 03:18:04,740
I will send my own comic to PC.

4148
03:18:04,740 --> 03:18:07,740
In the very next voicemail.

4149
03:18:12,740 --> 03:18:14,740
Oh no, God.

4150
03:18:14,740 --> 03:18:17,740
No, this is so tragic and terrible.

4151
03:18:17,740 --> 03:18:22,740
I think the next voicemail is an image from Drinking Moth.

4152
03:18:24,740 --> 03:18:26,740
So I think this might be...

4153
03:18:26,740 --> 03:18:28,740
These might all be from Drinking Moth.

4154
03:18:28,740 --> 03:18:29,740
Wow.

4155
03:18:29,740 --> 03:18:33,740
There's a five seconds of this audio.

4156
03:18:33,740 --> 03:18:35,740
Five seconds?

4157
03:18:35,740 --> 03:18:36,740
You say?

4158
03:18:36,740 --> 03:18:37,740
Oh, right.

4159
03:18:37,740 --> 03:18:38,740
Is it really?

4160
03:18:38,740 --> 03:18:40,740
Three, two, one, go.

4161
03:18:43,740 --> 03:18:44,740
Okay.

4162
03:18:44,740 --> 03:18:46,740
Oh, it's a whole comic.

4163
03:18:46,740 --> 03:18:48,740
This is a real comic.

4164
03:18:51,740 --> 03:18:53,740
Oh, okay.

4165
03:18:53,740 --> 03:18:57,740
Static dome, prophet spires in the city heart.

4166
03:18:59,740 --> 03:19:01,740
Should we read this right now?

4167
03:19:01,740 --> 03:19:03,740
I don't know if it's...

4168
03:19:03,740 --> 03:19:05,740
It's kind of long.

4169
03:19:05,740 --> 03:19:07,740
Yeah, this is very substantial.

4170
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:10,740
I want to read it later, I guess.

4171
03:19:10,740 --> 03:19:13,740
Because we'd just be silent for a while.

4172
03:19:14,740 --> 03:19:15,740
Although...

4173
03:19:15,740 --> 03:19:19,740
That's how we do the one piece.

4174
03:19:19,740 --> 03:19:20,740
So I'm not...

4175
03:19:20,740 --> 03:19:22,740
How far down does it go?

4176
03:19:22,740 --> 03:19:23,740
I think...

4177
03:19:23,740 --> 03:19:25,740
Load 10 more images.

4178
03:19:25,740 --> 03:19:26,740
I think that maybe...

4179
03:19:26,740 --> 03:19:27,740
Okay.

4180
03:19:27,740 --> 03:19:28,740
Holy shit.

4181
03:19:28,740 --> 03:19:30,740
Yeah, it's quite long.

4182
03:19:30,740 --> 03:19:32,740
Okay, we can't read it right now.

4183
03:19:32,740 --> 03:19:34,740
Wait, how many pages does it have a page count?

4184
03:19:34,740 --> 03:19:35,740
Oh, it just keeps going.

4185
03:19:35,740 --> 03:19:37,740
Oh, God, there's 10 more...

4186
03:19:37,740 --> 03:19:39,740
What is this, like 30 pages?

4187
03:19:39,740 --> 03:19:41,740
It's a whole comic.

4188
03:19:41,740 --> 03:19:42,740
Hang on.

4189
03:19:42,740 --> 03:19:52,740
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

4190
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:55,740
Am I crazy or are these pages really long?

4191
03:19:55,740 --> 03:19:57,740
Eight, nine, ten...

4192
03:19:57,740 --> 03:20:00,740
They are a little taller than A4.

4193
03:20:00,740 --> 03:20:15,740
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24...

4194
03:20:15,740 --> 03:20:18,740
Okay, I think it's 24 pages.

4195
03:20:18,740 --> 03:20:19,740
Here's what I think.

4196
03:20:19,740 --> 03:20:22,740
Here's what I think.

4197
03:20:22,740 --> 03:20:24,740
I do want to read this.

4198
03:20:24,740 --> 03:20:29,740
I think we should invite Drinking Moth to submit this

4199
03:20:29,740 --> 03:20:32,740
to submission for the perfect comic party.

4200
03:20:32,740 --> 03:20:34,740
And maybe we can put it...

4201
03:20:34,740 --> 03:20:35,740
Wait, is that punk?

4202
03:20:35,740 --> 03:20:36,740
No.

4203
03:20:36,740 --> 03:20:37,740
No, it's not punk.

4204
03:20:37,740 --> 03:20:38,740
There's punk?

4205
03:20:38,740 --> 03:20:39,740
No, she's just orange.

4206
03:20:39,740 --> 03:20:41,740
No, she's just orange.

4207
03:20:41,740 --> 03:20:42,740
Oh.

4208
03:20:42,740 --> 03:20:48,740
I think we should invite Drinking Moth to submit this to the perfect comic party.

4209
03:20:48,740 --> 03:20:50,740
And then when we do...

4210
03:20:50,740 --> 03:20:51,740
We can do an episode...

4211
03:20:51,740 --> 03:20:52,740
This was my plan before.

4212
03:20:52,740 --> 03:20:56,740
We could do an episode where we discuss the content of the perfect comic party.

4213
03:20:56,740 --> 03:21:00,740
And then we can go over this and other...

4214
03:21:00,740 --> 03:21:02,740
Whatever else is in there.

4215
03:21:02,740 --> 03:21:04,740
What do you think about that?

4216
03:21:04,740 --> 03:21:06,740
I think that is pretty good.

4217
03:21:06,740 --> 03:21:07,740
Okay.

4218
03:21:07,740 --> 03:21:08,740
And I agree.

4219
03:21:08,740 --> 03:21:11,740
Drinking Moth on the show would be nice.

4220
03:21:11,740 --> 03:21:12,740
Yeah.

4221
03:21:12,740 --> 03:21:17,740
I think I've said it before, but I was very impressed with Drinking Moth.

4222
03:21:17,740 --> 03:21:18,740
Drinking Moth ended up...

4223
03:21:18,740 --> 03:21:23,740
I think she ended up doing the most pages of the eventual Rad Condition.

4224
03:21:23,740 --> 03:21:26,740
And she did them really fast.

4225
03:21:26,740 --> 03:21:27,740
Like remarkably fast.

4226
03:21:27,740 --> 03:21:30,740
She would have like the page done like the next day.

4227
03:21:30,740 --> 03:21:31,740
It was crazy.

4228
03:21:31,740 --> 03:21:36,740
So I really appreciated that and I thought her work was really good.

4229
03:21:36,740 --> 03:21:42,740
And a reminder, read the dojo and it's on the PCP website and the stuff you can download

4230
03:21:42,740 --> 03:21:46,740
it and read it for free to see more of her work and others as well.

4231
03:21:46,740 --> 03:21:47,740
Okay.

4232
03:21:47,740 --> 03:21:49,740
Is the PCP website up?

4233
03:21:49,740 --> 03:21:50,740
Yeah.

4234
03:21:50,740 --> 03:21:51,740
Yeah.

4235
03:21:51,740 --> 03:21:52,740
Okay.

4236
03:21:52,740 --> 03:21:54,740
It is up.

4237
03:21:54,740 --> 03:21:55,740
It is currently...

4238
03:21:55,740 --> 03:21:58,740
What's the deal?

4239
03:21:58,740 --> 03:21:59,740
The...

4240
03:21:59,740 --> 03:22:00,740
Yeah.

4241
03:22:00,740 --> 03:22:01,740
Okay.

4242
03:22:01,740 --> 03:22:04,460
The DMCA thing.

4243
03:22:04,460 --> 03:22:09,940
My domains, St. Comics are on my host and those have been hit with the DMCA.

4244
03:22:09,940 --> 03:22:13,060
The PCP domain is not on that host.

4245
03:22:13,060 --> 03:22:14,220
It's a different host.

4246
03:22:14,220 --> 03:22:21,940
The files are hosted with that host, but the domain is with a different company and it

4247
03:22:21,940 --> 03:22:23,620
just points to those files.

4248
03:22:23,620 --> 03:22:25,980
So I just need to...

4249
03:22:25,980 --> 03:22:27,540
The DMCA will...

4250
03:22:27,540 --> 03:22:30,700
I just need to put the files on the new host.

4251
03:22:30,700 --> 03:22:35,100
So I don't need to transfer domains for the PCP website.

4252
03:22:35,100 --> 03:22:39,940
So the reason why the St. Comics is down is because the domain needs to transfer.

4253
03:22:39,940 --> 03:22:41,220
PCP doesn't need to do that.

4254
03:22:41,220 --> 03:22:47,860
I just need to click around a little bit and just tell it, yeah, point to a different file

4255
03:22:47,860 --> 03:22:50,460
location.

4256
03:22:50,460 --> 03:22:52,580
So the PCP website is up for the moment.

4257
03:22:52,580 --> 03:22:53,620
It will be down...

4258
03:22:53,620 --> 03:22:56,460
It might be down for a day or two soon.

4259
03:22:56,460 --> 03:22:58,460
Oh, okay.

4260
03:22:58,460 --> 03:22:59,460
Scream.

4261
03:22:59,460 --> 03:23:00,460
Okay.

4262
03:23:00,460 --> 03:23:13,220
Anyway, do not read Drinking Moth's comic.

4263
03:23:13,220 --> 03:23:16,780
Do not read it until it is in the perfect comic party.

4264
03:23:16,780 --> 03:23:20,540
Do not do it.

4265
03:23:20,540 --> 03:23:21,540
Here we go.

4266
03:23:21,540 --> 03:23:26,980
Next one is called B&G Appreciation Hour from Prince Isolation.

4267
03:23:26,980 --> 03:23:28,740
Oh, there is a voicemail attached.

4268
03:23:28,740 --> 03:23:30,540
So let's listen to that 3, 2, 1, go.

4269
03:23:30,540 --> 03:23:34,140
Hi, we're back with the Ben and Gibb Appreciation Hour.

4270
03:23:34,140 --> 03:23:40,980
Today, I want to show appreciation for the beautiful artistic dynamic between the characters

4271
03:23:40,980 --> 03:23:42,980
of Ben St. and Gibb and Tay.

4272
03:23:42,980 --> 03:23:43,980
Wrong.

4273
03:23:44,180 --> 03:23:50,980
One facet of their fascinating friendship and character relationship.

4274
03:23:50,980 --> 03:23:59,980
So enjoy this little fan art piece I've made of a very important, classic type of interaction

4275
03:23:59,980 --> 03:24:02,780
between the two, you know?

4276
03:24:02,780 --> 03:24:04,980
Are you seeing this?

4277
03:24:04,980 --> 03:24:06,660
Yeah, I'm looking at it.

4278
03:24:06,660 --> 03:24:11,780
People I hate, ironic bigotry, semi-ironic nihilism, something absolutely insane.

4279
03:24:11,780 --> 03:24:12,780
Okay.

4280
03:24:13,780 --> 03:24:14,780
Okay.

4281
03:24:18,780 --> 03:24:20,780
Perfect dynamic.

4282
03:24:20,780 --> 03:24:22,780
The perfect dynamic party.

4283
03:24:25,780 --> 03:24:27,780
The branding is just so strong.

4284
03:24:27,780 --> 03:24:31,780
You can't help but say something like that with that acronym.

4285
03:24:32,780 --> 03:24:34,780
There's an alternate version.

4286
03:24:36,780 --> 03:24:37,780
I like the alternate version.

4287
03:24:37,780 --> 03:24:38,780
Oh, with boobs.

4288
03:24:38,780 --> 03:24:39,780
I see, I see.

4289
03:24:39,780 --> 03:24:40,780
Boobs added.

4290
03:24:42,780 --> 03:24:46,780
Next one is Cheesy Audio Appreciation Hour.

4291
03:24:47,780 --> 03:24:51,780
Okay, from Prince Isolation, 3, 2, 1, go.

4292
03:24:51,780 --> 03:24:57,780
Yeah, so I think that maybe I had it right with the way I've published things all along, really.

4293
03:24:57,780 --> 03:25:04,780
Maybe I should just keep publishing digitally and doing pre-order things.

4294
03:25:04,780 --> 03:25:08,780
Maybe that just works way better.

4295
03:25:08,780 --> 03:25:12,780
And I think that maybe I had it right all along.

4296
03:25:12,780 --> 03:25:15,780
I should just continue to do it the way I'm doing it.

4297
03:25:15,780 --> 03:25:21,780
I mean, I'm seeing that people that are not like me or that are doing it more like old-style,

4298
03:25:21,780 --> 03:25:28,780
they're just like kind of making less money and they're just like, you know, they really...

4299
03:25:28,780 --> 03:25:30,780
I'm just wondering, hold on, hold on.

4300
03:25:31,780 --> 03:25:36,780
Yeah, and I think that maybe I should just...

4301
03:25:46,780 --> 03:25:48,780
Does Cheesy make loud noises that much?

4302
03:25:48,780 --> 03:25:50,780
I don't know.

4303
03:25:52,780 --> 03:25:55,780
I do think Cheesy's mic quality is not great.

4304
03:25:55,780 --> 03:25:57,780
He needs a better mic.

4305
03:25:57,780 --> 03:26:03,780
But in terms of like moving around and banging stuff, I don't know if he does it that much.

4306
03:26:03,780 --> 03:26:06,780
But yeah, I don't know.

4307
03:26:06,780 --> 03:26:09,780
But it's okay, because it said no hate, just love.

4308
03:26:09,780 --> 03:26:10,780
So it's fine.

4309
03:26:10,780 --> 03:26:11,780
Yeah.

4310
03:26:11,780 --> 03:26:12,780
So it's fine.

4311
03:26:12,780 --> 03:26:13,780
It's good.

4312
03:26:13,780 --> 03:26:14,780
It's fine.

4313
03:26:14,780 --> 03:26:15,780
It's good.

4314
03:26:15,780 --> 03:26:17,780
Next one is...

4315
03:26:17,780 --> 03:26:19,780
Oh, I didn't download that one.

4316
03:26:19,780 --> 03:26:23,780
Next one is Ben Appreciation Minute, 3, 2, 1, go.

4317
03:26:23,780 --> 03:26:27,780
So in preparation for the eventual coming out of the perfect comic party,

4318
03:26:27,780 --> 03:26:35,780
I finally decided to cave and sub to the prestigious Procrastinators podcast, patreon.patreon.com.

4319
03:26:35,780 --> 03:26:36,780
Finally!

4320
03:26:36,780 --> 03:26:38,780
Procrastinators, by the way.

4321
03:26:38,780 --> 03:26:42,780
And in the meanwhile, I've had the chance to listen to some of the bonus content featured there.

4322
03:26:42,780 --> 03:26:48,780
And specifically, I was listening to the commentary track for the Radcon 2 documentary.

4323
03:26:48,780 --> 03:26:54,780
And I just really quickly wanted to highlight a funny little thing that Ben did that's very indicative of his online persona,

4324
03:26:54,780 --> 03:26:57,780
his character, as you might say.

4325
03:26:57,780 --> 03:27:00,780
So Gibbon is saying about DeVoo.

4326
03:27:00,780 --> 03:27:05,780
She's saying like, you know, DeVoo, DeVoo, she's a little awkward and stuff.

4327
03:27:05,780 --> 03:27:06,780
But you know, she's interesting.

4328
03:27:06,780 --> 03:27:07,780
I like her.

4329
03:27:07,780 --> 03:27:08,780
She's interesting.

4330
03:27:08,780 --> 03:27:11,780
And then there's a silence.

4331
03:27:11,780 --> 03:27:14,780
And then Ben just says, well...

4332
03:27:14,780 --> 03:27:16,780
And I appreciated that.

4333
03:27:16,780 --> 03:27:20,780
Very tough to your hater behavior on your report, Ben.

4334
03:27:20,780 --> 03:27:21,780
Okay.

4335
03:27:21,780 --> 03:27:22,780
Bye-bye.

4336
03:27:22,780 --> 03:27:23,780
Thanks.

4337
03:27:23,780 --> 03:27:25,780
Yeah, I'm a hater.

4338
03:27:25,780 --> 03:27:27,780
Yeah, whatever.

4339
03:27:27,780 --> 03:27:32,780
Okay, next one is an image.

4340
03:27:32,780 --> 03:27:34,780
Want to draw today?

4341
03:27:34,780 --> 03:27:35,780
Not really.

4342
03:27:35,780 --> 03:27:37,780
Implacent Western artist.

4343
03:27:37,780 --> 03:27:38,780
Third worlders.

4344
03:27:38,780 --> 03:27:43,780
Ears are in $5 per hour.

4345
03:27:44,780 --> 03:27:46,780
It's so true.

4346
03:27:46,780 --> 03:27:47,780
It is so true.

4347
03:27:47,780 --> 03:27:49,780
I feel so sea.

4348
03:27:49,780 --> 03:27:50,780
Want to draw today?

4349
03:27:50,780 --> 03:27:51,780
Not really.

4350
03:27:51,780 --> 03:27:54,780
When would I ever want to draw?

4351
03:27:54,780 --> 03:28:01,780
I started drawing earlier and I couldn't do it because I was sick.

4352
03:28:01,780 --> 03:28:09,780
I woke up thinking that I was over my illness and I sat down at my computer and I was like

4353
03:28:09,780 --> 03:28:14,780
sitting there just like freezing and sweating and like aching.

4354
03:28:14,780 --> 03:28:17,780
And I'm just like...

4355
03:28:17,780 --> 03:28:23,780
I must have sat there for a couple of hours until I just gave up and went back to sleep.

4356
03:28:23,780 --> 03:28:24,780
And you know what?

4357
03:28:24,780 --> 03:28:28,780
Strikingly not that different from a usual day.

4358
03:28:28,780 --> 03:28:32,780
A non-sick day in my life.

4359
03:28:32,780 --> 03:28:38,780
The results were largely the same.

4360
03:28:39,780 --> 03:28:44,780
To be a third worlder eager to earn $5 per hour.

4361
03:28:44,780 --> 03:28:47,780
Yeah, we should go live in a third world.

4362
03:28:47,780 --> 03:28:49,780
That's the play.

4363
03:28:49,780 --> 03:28:53,780
Ask not for lighter burdens but broader shoulders.

4364
03:28:53,780 --> 03:28:57,780
The third worlder eager to earn $5 per hour has the broader shoulders of all.

4365
03:28:57,780 --> 03:28:59,780
It's the dream.

4366
03:28:59,780 --> 03:29:05,780
Okay, next one is a VVV comic from Vinny.

4367
03:29:05,780 --> 03:29:10,780
Got to organize time better to get these out sooner at LoveU.com.

4368
03:29:10,780 --> 03:29:13,780
Well, let's take a look.

4369
03:29:13,780 --> 03:29:14,780
So long.

4370
03:29:14,780 --> 03:29:15,780
Been safe.

4371
03:29:15,780 --> 03:29:18,780
Your treachery shall be avenged here by my Kawasaki blade.

4372
03:29:18,780 --> 03:29:19,780
I remember that.

4373
03:29:19,780 --> 03:29:21,780
Shwing.

4374
03:29:21,780 --> 03:29:25,780
Previously on Vinny's Comic, you've made a grave mistake to choose this fight.

4375
03:29:25,780 --> 03:29:27,780
I will not die here.

4376
03:29:27,780 --> 03:29:28,780
Ooh.

4377
03:29:28,780 --> 03:29:32,780
The sword like trails the scene.

4378
03:29:33,780 --> 03:29:34,780
Haha.

4379
03:29:34,780 --> 03:29:37,780
Nice slash, but that was made.

4380
03:29:37,780 --> 03:29:39,780
Wait, but that won't make the cut.

4381
03:29:39,780 --> 03:29:40,780
Haha.

4382
03:29:40,780 --> 03:29:41,780
Yes.

4383
03:29:41,780 --> 03:29:42,780
True.

4384
03:29:42,780 --> 03:29:43,780
Huh?

4385
03:29:43,780 --> 03:29:45,780
What is this?

4386
03:29:45,780 --> 03:29:47,780
Gurgle, gurgle.

4387
03:29:47,780 --> 03:29:49,780
This is eating through the floor.

4388
03:29:49,780 --> 03:29:50,780
Whoa.

4389
03:29:50,780 --> 03:29:52,780
Whoa.

4390
03:29:52,780 --> 03:29:54,780
Creek schlump.

4391
03:29:54,780 --> 03:29:58,780
Fuck you, Ben Sainto.

4392
03:29:58,780 --> 03:29:59,780
Ben, is he?

4393
03:29:59,780 --> 03:30:01,780
Brace yourselves.

4394
03:30:01,780 --> 03:30:02,780
Oh, my God.

4395
03:30:02,780 --> 03:30:03,780
I'm bracing.

4396
03:30:03,780 --> 03:30:04,780
Is that tiny?

4397
03:30:04,780 --> 03:30:05,780
Ben did something to the air.

4398
03:30:05,780 --> 03:30:06,780
I can't breathe.

4399
03:30:06,780 --> 03:30:08,780
I have to make this last move quick.

4400
03:30:08,780 --> 03:30:09,780
Shadow art.

4401
03:30:09,780 --> 03:30:11,780
Da kusuro.

4402
03:30:13,780 --> 03:30:14,780
Wait, what?

4403
03:30:14,780 --> 03:30:15,780
Oh.

4404
03:30:15,780 --> 03:30:16,780
I was in the kitchen.

4405
03:30:16,780 --> 03:30:17,780
I'm eating my ramen still.

4406
03:30:17,780 --> 03:30:18,780
Slurp.

4407
03:30:18,780 --> 03:30:21,780
Oh, the knives are coming out.

4408
03:30:21,780 --> 03:30:22,780
Oh.

4409
03:30:22,780 --> 03:30:23,780
Oh.

4410
03:30:23,780 --> 03:30:24,780
Haha.

4411
03:30:24,780 --> 03:30:28,780
Simsie grabs them.

4412
03:30:28,780 --> 03:30:30,780
He's so strong.

4413
03:30:30,780 --> 03:30:33,780
He's so strong and powerful.

4414
03:30:33,780 --> 03:30:36,780
Poof, poof, poof.

4415
03:30:36,780 --> 03:30:37,780
Slurp.

4416
03:30:37,780 --> 03:30:40,780
Wait, is this one flying towards me?

4417
03:30:40,780 --> 03:30:42,780
Munch, munch.

4418
03:30:42,780 --> 03:30:43,780
What's happening?

4419
03:30:43,780 --> 03:30:44,780
This is real good.

4420
03:30:44,780 --> 03:30:45,780
I wasn't paying attention.

4421
03:30:45,780 --> 03:30:46,780
What happened to the knife?

4422
03:30:46,780 --> 03:30:48,780
It looks like a pink hand.

4423
03:30:48,780 --> 03:30:49,780
Oh.

4424
03:30:49,780 --> 03:30:53,780
Yeah, something caught it.

4425
03:30:53,780 --> 03:30:56,780
Did you conjure an ethereal pink ghost hand?

4426
03:30:56,780 --> 03:31:00,780
Oh, it's the Rayman.

4427
03:31:00,780 --> 03:31:03,780
My stand is Rayman because it's a platformer.

4428
03:31:03,780 --> 03:31:05,780
I forgot the name.

4429
03:31:05,780 --> 03:31:07,780
He jumped over the counter and what then?

4430
03:31:07,780 --> 03:31:09,780
I melted the floor and he fell.

4431
03:31:09,780 --> 03:31:12,780
I used my stand to remove the oxygen molecules from the air.

4432
03:31:12,780 --> 03:31:16,780
I made sure he'd end up unconscious one way or another.

4433
03:31:16,780 --> 03:31:18,780
Oh, wait, that's your line.

4434
03:31:18,780 --> 03:31:19,780
Okay.

4435
03:31:19,780 --> 03:31:20,780
Okay.

4436
03:31:20,780 --> 03:31:21,780
Okay.

4437
03:31:21,780 --> 03:31:22,780
Okay.

4438
03:31:22,780 --> 03:31:28,780
I have my little green goo friend here.

4439
03:31:28,780 --> 03:31:29,780
He's looking.

4440
03:31:29,780 --> 03:31:31,780
Look, he's looking.

4441
03:31:31,780 --> 03:31:33,780
We're getting freaking burgers.

4442
03:31:33,780 --> 03:31:35,780
I can't trust Japanese food places.

4443
03:31:35,780 --> 03:31:37,780
Yeah, that's probably a safe bet.

4444
03:31:37,780 --> 03:31:39,780
Bloody hell, Ben.

4445
03:31:39,780 --> 03:31:41,780
Oh, good grief.

4446
03:31:41,780 --> 03:31:43,780
Fuck you, Ben.

4447
03:31:43,780 --> 03:31:45,780
That's insane.

4448
03:31:45,780 --> 03:31:48,780
I messed with the layers at the top and had to redo a lot,

4449
03:31:48,780 --> 03:31:50,780
but I got it out on time for the next ever hope.

4450
03:31:50,780 --> 03:31:53,780
Ben isn't too sick to read his lines.

4451
03:31:53,780 --> 03:31:54,780
Not anymore.

4452
03:31:54,780 --> 03:31:56,780
I'm mostly fine.

4453
03:31:56,780 --> 03:31:58,780
Hey, that was cool.

4454
03:31:58,780 --> 03:31:59,780
Yeah.

4455
03:31:59,780 --> 03:32:03,780
I like when I have powers.

4456
03:32:03,780 --> 03:32:06,780
Some of my little green.

4457
03:32:06,780 --> 03:32:09,780
I just like the little squat and you're just explaining.

4458
03:32:09,780 --> 03:32:11,780
I melted the floor and you fell.

4459
03:32:11,780 --> 03:32:15,780
I used my stand to remove the oxygen molecules from the air down there.

4460
03:32:15,780 --> 03:32:17,780
What is my little green guy?

4461
03:32:17,780 --> 03:32:20,780
Why does he have like four horns?

4462
03:32:20,780 --> 03:32:21,780
I don't know.

4463
03:32:21,780 --> 03:32:23,780
When was he first depicted?

4464
03:32:23,780 --> 03:32:26,780
I don't remember him looking.

4465
03:32:26,780 --> 03:32:29,780
I don't remember one that looked quite like this.

4466
03:32:29,780 --> 03:32:31,780
Just melts through the floor.

4467
03:32:31,780 --> 03:32:34,780
There's no oxygen.

4468
03:32:34,780 --> 03:32:37,780
It looks like it looks like he's in this one.

4469
03:32:37,780 --> 03:32:46,780
When I said brace yourselves, it looks like he is like extracting air

4470
03:32:46,780 --> 03:32:51,780
from through the floor like he's or something.

4471
03:32:51,780 --> 03:32:54,780
And that's what he's doing.

4472
03:32:54,780 --> 03:32:55,780
Oh, yeah.

4473
03:32:55,780 --> 03:33:01,780
I guess that the vapors is getting the vapors out of the underneath.

4474
03:33:01,780 --> 03:33:08,780
He's getting vaporized.

4475
03:33:08,780 --> 03:33:11,780
I'm just looking over again.

4476
03:33:11,780 --> 03:33:14,780
La Mal.

4477
03:33:14,780 --> 03:33:19,780
That was a quick read because there wasn't much dialogue.

4478
03:33:19,780 --> 03:33:24,780
But you know, action packed.

4479
03:33:24,780 --> 03:33:26,780
What was the Rayman thing?

4480
03:33:26,780 --> 03:33:30,780
Is it just hands?

4481
03:33:30,780 --> 03:33:35,780
My stand is a Rayman, but it's a Raywoman.

4482
03:33:35,780 --> 03:33:37,780
I vaguely remember.

4483
03:33:37,780 --> 03:33:39,780
Thanks, Vinny.

4484
03:33:39,780 --> 03:33:41,780
I love you.

4485
03:33:41,780 --> 03:33:42,780
OK.

4486
03:33:42,780 --> 03:33:43,780
Good.

4487
03:33:43,780 --> 03:33:50,780
Next one is a quick question from Prince Isolation 321 Go.

4488
03:33:50,780 --> 03:33:51,780
Hi.

4489
03:33:51,780 --> 03:33:55,780
So I was listening to the solo Ben cast commentary track, by the way,

4490
03:33:55,780 --> 03:33:56,780
please make another one.

4491
03:33:56,780 --> 03:34:01,780
There's a squeak wall right there whenever you get around to it.

4492
03:34:01,780 --> 03:34:05,780
I was listening to the commentary on the solo Ben cast and Ben said

4493
03:34:05,780 --> 03:34:10,780
there that y'all were thinking about maybe at some point doing a behind

4494
03:34:10,780 --> 03:34:17,780
the scenes on the OVA filming and or Radcon 4 and maybe subsequently

4495
03:34:17,780 --> 03:34:19,780
a commentary track on that.

4496
03:34:19,780 --> 03:34:24,780
And you know, I am just at this point a total slut for PCP content to listen

4497
03:34:24,780 --> 03:34:26,780
to at any point during work or whatever.

4498
03:34:26,780 --> 03:34:29,780
So, you know, is that still happening?

4499
03:34:29,780 --> 03:34:31,780
Should I look forward to that?

4500
03:34:31,780 --> 03:34:32,780
Is that shelved?

4501
03:34:32,780 --> 03:34:37,780
I asked Nate about it and apparently there really isn't much like behind

4502
03:34:37,780 --> 03:34:39,780
the scenes footage.

4503
03:34:41,780 --> 03:34:42,780
Right?

4504
03:34:43,780 --> 03:34:46,780
Well, I guess not.

4505
03:34:46,780 --> 03:34:48,780
We didn't film us coming up with anything.

4506
03:34:48,780 --> 03:34:54,780
It's just sort of like outtakes and seconds before we said action.

4507
03:34:54,780 --> 03:34:57,780
That's all that would be filmed during that time.

4508
03:34:57,780 --> 03:34:58,780
Yeah.

4509
03:34:58,780 --> 03:35:04,780
The OVA, I mean, I guess I could go through all of the footage and see,

4510
03:35:04,780 --> 03:35:08,780
but pretty much all the footage from the OVA is like, yeah,

4511
03:35:08,780 --> 03:35:14,780
it's just the shots that we used in that Nate used in the final thing.

4512
03:35:14,780 --> 03:35:19,780
I think the in terms of commentary, we already did a commentary on the OVA,

4513
03:35:19,780 --> 03:35:23,780
which includes as much behind the scenes stuff as we remember.

4514
03:35:23,780 --> 03:35:24,780
I think.

4515
03:35:24,780 --> 03:35:25,780
Yeah.

4516
03:35:25,780 --> 03:35:28,780
That's why I'm thinking behind the scenes would just be extra footage.

4517
03:35:28,780 --> 03:35:30,780
I just don't know if there really is any.

4518
03:35:30,780 --> 03:35:31,780
I mean, I have all the footage.

4519
03:35:31,780 --> 03:35:34,780
I saved it on a second hard drive.

4520
03:35:34,780 --> 03:35:36,780
I could go through it, but it's funny.

4521
03:35:37,780 --> 03:35:40,780
It's all in like one minute long cuts.

4522
03:35:40,780 --> 03:35:43,780
There's not like none of it is like long.

4523
03:35:45,780 --> 03:35:48,780
Honestly, maybe we should have just filmed it all in one long thing and then chopped it up.

4524
03:35:48,780 --> 03:35:53,780
Maybe it would have been nice to get a bunch of like behind the scenes footage of us just fucking around.

4525
03:35:53,780 --> 03:35:58,780
Yeah, I think we were just very, we were very like hectic on that day.

4526
03:35:58,780 --> 03:36:02,780
Like we got a, we got a, you know, next scene, next scene.

4527
03:36:02,780 --> 03:36:08,780
I think when some people were filming, the rest of us were just lounging around for like,

4528
03:36:08,780 --> 03:36:12,780
we weren't in the shot, but we weren't filming that, I guess,

4529
03:36:12,780 --> 03:36:17,780
because we didn't have our cameras with us because it gets sandy if we had to put them down.

4530
03:36:18,780 --> 03:36:19,780
And we weren't wearing clothings.

4531
03:36:19,780 --> 03:36:22,780
We couldn't put them in in like pockets.

4532
03:36:22,780 --> 03:36:24,780
We were wearing bikinis.

4533
03:36:24,780 --> 03:36:25,780
Right.

4534
03:36:26,780 --> 03:36:35,780
We, I suppose I could take all that footage and put all the original footage in a timeline and see like how long is it.

4535
03:36:35,780 --> 03:36:37,780
And maybe there is extra stuff in there.

4536
03:36:37,780 --> 03:36:42,780
I would, I would have to, I would have to go through it and see.

4537
03:36:43,780 --> 03:36:45,780
Maybe, I don't know.

4538
03:36:46,780 --> 03:36:54,780
If I, if I found any interesting bits of like, oh, this is, this is us just like fooling around that wasn't in the OVA.

4539
03:36:54,780 --> 03:37:00,780
I mean, yeah, if there was a significant amount of that, yeah, I would be fine with publishing it,

4540
03:37:00,780 --> 03:37:03,780
maybe as a bonus content of some kind.

4541
03:37:03,780 --> 03:37:05,780
I just, I just have to see.

4542
03:37:05,780 --> 03:37:06,780
That's all.

4543
03:37:06,780 --> 03:37:07,780
Okay.

4544
03:37:07,780 --> 03:37:08,780
Next one.

4545
03:37:08,780 --> 03:37:11,780
I think, you know, I might, I might take a look at some point.

4546
03:37:11,780 --> 03:37:12,780
Good, good question.

4547
03:37:12,780 --> 03:37:14,780
Next one is called Ben Speaks.

4548
03:37:14,780 --> 03:37:17,780
Oh, and it is just a image.

4549
03:37:17,780 --> 03:37:19,780
It's an image of chat GBT.

4550
03:37:19,780 --> 03:37:20,780
Uh-oh.

4551
03:37:21,780 --> 03:37:22,780
Not another one.

4552
03:37:24,780 --> 03:37:25,780
Not again.

4553
03:37:26,780 --> 03:37:28,780
I am Ben Saint.

4554
03:37:28,780 --> 03:37:33,780
I'm visible on your timeline, but if I can help it, I am invisible to you until it's too late.

4555
03:37:33,780 --> 03:37:34,780
I know where you live.

4556
03:37:34,780 --> 03:37:35,780
And guess what?

4557
03:37:35,780 --> 03:37:36,780
I live there too.

4558
03:37:36,780 --> 03:37:37,780
I hover around all of you.

4559
03:37:37,780 --> 03:37:41,780
I know no color barrier, no religion, no morality, no currency.

4560
03:37:41,780 --> 03:37:43,780
I speak your language fluently.

4561
03:37:43,780 --> 03:37:46,780
And with every voice I take away, I acquire yet another language.

4562
03:37:46,780 --> 03:37:48,780
I work very quickly.

4563
03:37:48,780 --> 03:37:53,780
I work faster than pediatric aids, cancer and diabetes combined.

4564
03:37:53,780 --> 03:37:56,780
If you have any patrons, I make sure that your Patreon fails.

4565
03:37:56,780 --> 03:38:00,780
Your money will fall into my hands and I will bankrupt you for my own self-gain.

4566
03:38:00,780 --> 03:38:03,780
I don't sleep, so I make sure you don't either.

4567
03:38:03,780 --> 03:38:09,780
I will make it virtually impossible for your followers to engage, to converse or support you without a struggle, without embarrassment, without pain.

4568
03:38:09,780 --> 03:38:10,780
You have no care for me.

4569
03:38:10,780 --> 03:38:13,780
Your scientists don't have the resources and I relish their desperation.

4570
03:38:13,780 --> 03:38:18,780
Your oomphies are happy to pretend that I don't exist, of course, until it's their turn.

4571
03:38:18,780 --> 03:38:19,780
I am Ben Saint.

4572
03:38:19,780 --> 03:38:21,780
I have no interest in right or wrong.

4573
03:38:21,780 --> 03:38:24,780
I derive great pleasure out of your loneliness.

4574
03:38:24,780 --> 03:38:26,780
I will fight to take away your hope.

4575
03:38:26,780 --> 03:38:29,780
I will plot to rob you of your clout and your dreams.

4576
03:38:29,780 --> 03:38:35,780
I will make sure that every day you wake until you cry, wondering who will take care of my content after I die.

4577
03:38:35,780 --> 03:38:39,780
The truth is, I am still winning and you are scared and you should be.

4578
03:38:39,780 --> 03:38:40,780
I am Ben Saint.

4579
03:38:40,780 --> 03:38:41,780
You ignored me.

4580
03:38:41,780 --> 03:38:43,780
That was a mistake.

4581
03:38:43,780 --> 03:38:45,780
True.

4582
03:38:45,780 --> 03:38:52,780
I like that you ignored me at the end like somebody who's just successfully getting you and this is your response.

4583
03:38:52,780 --> 03:38:58,780
This is my unhinged like Twitter reply that's already, I've already been blocked.

4584
03:39:04,780 --> 03:39:06,780
I wonder, I wonder how they got it to.

4585
03:39:07,780 --> 03:39:11,780
I wonder if they told ChatGPT, hey ChatGPT, imagine a character.

4586
03:39:11,780 --> 03:39:13,780
His name is Ben Saint.

4587
03:39:13,780 --> 03:39:15,780
He is a content creator.

4588
03:39:16,780 --> 03:39:24,780
He is an unknown content creator who is spiteful and who wants to destroy other people's success online.

4589
03:39:24,780 --> 03:39:28,780
Write me a poem in, write me a non rhyming poem.

4590
03:39:28,780 --> 03:39:33,780
Write me a manifesto in the character of Ben Saint explaining what he will do to you.

4591
03:39:34,780 --> 03:39:35,780
Yeah.

4592
03:39:35,780 --> 03:39:42,780
I can imagine a lot of this is very specific and you're not that prominent of a person that ChatGPT would just know these things.

4593
03:39:43,780 --> 03:39:44,780
No, they would have to.

4594
03:39:44,780 --> 03:39:48,780
I mean, ChatGPT thinks that I'm the creator of the Munchie Minute.

4595
03:39:54,780 --> 03:39:57,780
Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading that.

4596
03:39:58,780 --> 03:40:00,780
Let's see if we got any last minute voicemails.

4597
03:40:00,780 --> 03:40:01,780
Oh my God.

4598
03:40:01,780 --> 03:40:06,780
Yeah, there's three more in the last five minutes.

4599
03:40:07,780 --> 03:40:09,780
How to pronounce Ben Saint.

4600
03:40:09,780 --> 03:40:11,780
Okay, it's a Vokeroo link.

4601
03:40:13,780 --> 03:40:15,780
You ready?

4602
03:40:17,780 --> 03:40:18,780
How to pronounce Ben Saint.

4603
03:40:18,780 --> 03:40:20,780
That's another one.

4604
03:40:20,780 --> 03:40:21,780
How to pronounce Gibb.

4605
03:40:24,780 --> 03:40:25,780
Okay.

4606
03:40:25,780 --> 03:40:28,780
Okay, how to pronounce Ben Saint.

4607
03:40:28,780 --> 03:40:29,780
Three, two, one go.

4608
03:40:43,780 --> 03:41:01,660
Yeah.

4609
03:41:01,660 --> 03:41:03,140
Yeah, yeah.

4610
03:41:03,140 --> 03:41:06,680
So say no, no, no, no, no, no.

4611
03:41:06,680 --> 03:41:09,880
Bint, bent, bent, bent.

4612
03:41:09,880 --> 03:41:10,880
Your name is Bint.

4613
03:41:10,880 --> 03:41:12,040
You are bent now.

4614
03:41:12,040 --> 03:41:14,040
Bint, bent, bent, bent, bent.

4615
03:41:14,040 --> 03:41:17,780
It can't say Bint that many times.

4616
03:41:17,780 --> 03:41:20,080
He can't, he can't get away with it.

4617
03:41:20,080 --> 03:41:23,360
Bint is like a slang for like prostitute.

4618
03:41:23,360 --> 03:41:24,360
Is it?

4619
03:41:24,360 --> 03:41:25,360
Yeah.

4620
03:41:25,360 --> 03:41:26,360
Oh my god.

4621
03:41:26,360 --> 03:41:28,460
How could he say that?

4622
03:41:28,460 --> 03:41:29,960
How could he say Bint?

4623
03:41:29,960 --> 03:41:30,960
Oh, I said it.

4624
03:41:31,660 --> 03:41:33,660
Are you ready for how to pronounce Gib?

4625
03:41:35,460 --> 03:41:36,460
I guess so.

4626
03:41:37,460 --> 03:41:38,460
You better be.

4627
03:41:38,560 --> 03:41:39,960
That's only one second long.

4628
03:41:40,760 --> 03:41:43,060
Okay, three, two, one, go.

4629
03:41:46,460 --> 03:41:47,960
That is how you do it.

4630
03:41:49,560 --> 03:41:50,560
Very good.

4631
03:41:50,560 --> 03:41:52,060
And one last one.

4632
03:41:52,060 --> 03:41:55,060
Next, voicemail victims from Prince Isolation.

4633
03:41:55,060 --> 03:41:56,560
Okay, three, two, one, go.

4634
03:41:57,160 --> 03:41:58,360
Well, hello, guys.

4635
03:41:58,360 --> 03:42:03,160
Welcome back to my journey through the PCP Patreon backlog.

4636
03:42:03,160 --> 03:42:09,360
I'm just here to say, coming right at you from the voicemail roundup episode.

4637
03:42:09,760 --> 03:42:13,560
Fuck, why were all these things cut?

4638
03:42:13,760 --> 03:42:17,460
You know, why were all these little gems, these little diamonds in the rough,

4639
03:42:17,460 --> 03:42:22,760
cut from the fucking beautiful podium that they rightfully deserve?

4640
03:42:22,860 --> 03:42:27,560
You know, for all of his centrism, for all of his enlightened fence writing,

4641
03:42:27,560 --> 03:42:30,360
Nate sure was a fucking fascist.

4642
03:42:32,660 --> 03:42:33,660
Okay.

4643
03:42:35,660 --> 03:42:36,660
Is that all right?

4644
03:42:36,960 --> 03:42:38,160
Is he cut himself off?

4645
03:42:38,660 --> 03:42:40,860
I, I guess.

4646
03:42:42,560 --> 03:42:45,660
Well, I don't know what he's, I don't know exactly what he's referring to.

4647
03:42:46,460 --> 03:42:51,460
Uh, to the voicemail episode, the bonus one, where we went through as many bo-

4648
03:42:52,460 --> 03:42:56,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, why he didn't hear it when he cut all the voicemails.

4649
03:42:56,860 --> 03:42:57,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4650
03:42:57,760 --> 03:42:59,060
He didn't play them on the show.

4651
03:42:59,160 --> 03:43:00,260
I see, I see.

4652
03:43:00,360 --> 03:43:03,260
Yeah, yeah, he hates the freedom, he hates freedom of speech.

4653
03:43:03,260 --> 03:43:04,260
He hates freedom of speech.

4654
03:43:04,560 --> 03:43:05,360
Yeah, that's true.

4655
03:43:05,860 --> 03:43:06,360
That's true.

4656
03:43:06,360 --> 03:43:07,160
That's why he didn't play them.

4657
03:43:11,460 --> 03:43:17,060
We've cut them for you, dear viewer, to pay money to have us listen to them

4658
03:43:17,060 --> 03:43:18,660
for your entertainment.

4659
03:43:22,460 --> 03:43:26,460
Right?

4660
03:43:27,260 --> 03:43:29,460
Uh, incorrect.

4661
03:43:29,560 --> 03:43:30,160
Okay.

4662
03:43:30,860 --> 03:43:35,560
Uh, I actually have, uh, I think I actually have like two bonus episodes

4663
03:43:35,560 --> 03:43:38,660
that Ellie is our edited and gave me and that I just haven't uploaded yet.

4664
03:43:39,160 --> 03:43:40,260
Uh, so I should do that.

4665
03:43:40,660 --> 03:43:41,060
Yeah.

4666
03:43:41,060 --> 03:43:41,460
Oops.

4667
03:43:41,860 --> 03:43:44,660
Uh, I think I have, I think there's two.

4668
03:43:44,660 --> 03:43:47,560
There was like one from last month and he just gave me one like this past week.

4669
03:43:48,460 --> 03:43:49,760
Uh, I'll get those up soon.

4670
03:43:50,060 --> 03:43:53,060
Patreon.com, slash the procrastinators for that.

4671
03:43:54,060 --> 03:44:00,360
And, uh, the commentary, the, the, the, the rad con OVA commentary is pretty good.

4672
03:44:01,260 --> 03:44:02,560
I think people will like that.

4673
03:44:03,560 --> 03:44:04,860
Um, okay.

4674
03:44:05,260 --> 03:44:06,860
Well, that's about it.

4675
03:44:06,960 --> 03:44:07,660
Let's cut it.

4676
03:44:07,760 --> 03:44:11,460
I'm going to go, I'm going to try and use the rest of my day to, uh, get that

4677
03:44:11,460 --> 03:44:17,260
Biscopades done and, uh, you know, move on, take steps towards actually getting

4678
03:44:17,260 --> 03:44:19,360
that, that, that perfect comic party out here.

4679
03:44:19,360 --> 03:44:20,160
It's coming soon.

4680
03:44:20,160 --> 03:44:22,560
It's going to be, it's going to be ready before we even know it.

4681
03:44:23,260 --> 03:44:23,860
Yeah.

4682
03:44:24,560 --> 03:44:25,960
I'm going to go to bed.

4683
03:44:26,960 --> 03:44:27,860
I guess it's late for you.

4684
03:44:28,560 --> 03:44:29,760
It's 12 58.

4685
03:44:30,160 --> 03:44:31,060
That's okay.

4686
03:44:31,160 --> 03:44:32,060
Not so bad.

4687
03:44:33,360 --> 03:44:33,760
All right.

4688
03:44:33,760 --> 03:44:38,560
Well, um, um, the, the, bye.

4689
03:44:38,860 --> 03:44:39,560
Bye.

4690
03:44:39,560 --> 03:44:40,360
End of the episode.

4691
03:44:40,360 --> 03:44:41,060
See you next week.

4692
03:44:41,060 --> 03:44:41,760
Okay.

4693
03:44:42,260 --> 03:44:42,660
Thanks.

4694
03:44:43,260 --> 03:44:43,560
Bye.

4695
03:44:45,360 --> 03:44:45,660
Okay.

4696
03:44:45,660 --> 03:44:46,560
Let's, uh, let's sing.

4697
03:44:49,360 --> 03:44:49,860
Yeah.
