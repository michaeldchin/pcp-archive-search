00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Thank you for

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,680
cheering for me because I am the best guy ever and I deserve your applause and love. Joining

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,840
us today, we have The Davoo. Mmm, these cookies! I gotta get the recipe from Liz. We have Tom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:36,280
Oliver. I'm hungry for a good episode. Damn. Meet up y'all. You're starving, you're starving

5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,120
friend. I've been waiting since, I've been waiting a hundred and nine episodes and we

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,720
still haven't gotten one yet. But I believe, but I believe we can deliver. Hippocrit is

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:57,000
here. That's what sounds like when I'm hooking up some stuff. Ben Saint is here. Oh no, my blood

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,720
sugar. Get it, get it out. Get it out of me. Get the sugar out of my blood. No blood sugar

9
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,360
please. And we've got Munchy. Yo, I just cooked some eggs right before this podcast and I've

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,160
got one singular yolk here. All pristine and shit. I'm about to shove it into my fat,

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:21,960
gapy mouth. Let's go. I have one too. I'm gonna eat it. Oh, that's good. I just cooked up a monster

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:32,040
absolutely zero energy in a chemical bath. I'm currently drinking a coffee. It tastes like a

13
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,480
fresh diaper. I've got a juice monster energy drink. Pipeline punch right now. I'm gonna fucking

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:44,520
drown this and hopefully my tongue seared off and I can't speak anymore. Let's all hope that

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:53,800
happens. While we introduce our final special guest, longtime LGBTQ ally of the PCP, his name,

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:03,720
Icon Clasm, aka Double Shot. Icon Colts. I remember because I did fan art and never

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:12,520
showed anyone. Oh, wow. Not even Victor. That's the man. And that's the man, Victor. Victor Collins.

18
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,840
Here he is, everybody. Oh man. I just ate a big hot dog from 7-Eleven and washed it down with

19
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,280
Mountain Dew and now I feel like I'm gonna vomit. You're in the 7-Eleven food. You unerotically

20
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,200
eat 7-Eleven food. That's a thing in your life. Yeah, I mean, that's true. Victor. Almost every

21
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,600
day. And it's horrible. Your last name was Collins? I thought your last name was Brough.

22
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,640
Oh, because of... You gotta go to 7-Eleven and you gotta get a fucking buffalo chicken log.

23
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,360
Oh, those are good. I like those. Oh, no. Buffalo chicken roller log, dude.

24
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,640
Yeah, I like those. It's a very fun name. I do those for a little while and then...

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,080
I mean, yeah, they all make me sick. Topic, ladies and gentlemen, get the fuck out of my

26
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,840
kitchen. You're undercooking the chicken. It's cooking. You're just like your father.

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,680
We're talking about cooking, talking about po-boy and rich boy eats alike. They all have a place

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,680
in our lexicon of food. And speaking of lexicons that has nothing to do with what I'm saying,

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,680
also let's look at Urban Dictionary and see what the fuck is going on with cooking. Here we go.

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,400
Hang on. Silly me. I searched cocking by mistake, which is texting while urinating.

31
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,360
Okay, cooking. Here we go.

32
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,000
Cooking is a dance trend invented by Lil B in that it's only waste up designed to be

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,120
done in front of a webcam. Wait, incorrect, incorrect. I don't know anything about this

34
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,120
topic. I'm out. Cooking. Okay, cooking. This is a good one.

35
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,520
Cooking, what you better be doing right now, woman.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,240
Damn. Oh, that one was funny. Okay, cooking. In reference to wannabe comedian, Dane Cook. No, okay.

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,440
It's when you put the food in the pan and it sizzles. That's what cooking is, when you eat food.

38
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,800
You know, what if you're not using a pan, though? I mean, that's true.

39
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,320
Then that's cold. It's not real cooking, obviously.

40
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,520
I suspect we are going to spend easily 45 minutes talking about what is or is not

41
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,120
nobody's cooking. Let's not. It's making a sandwich cooking, please.

42
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,360
No, cooking literally is the act of heating something like raw ingredients to make it meal.

43
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,160
But so temperature being involved. But here's a question, and I said this to Vic beforehand.

44
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,920
If I make ice cream, if I make ice cream, when I'm using temperature to create it in the negative,

45
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,320
the opposite direction is that cooking? No. Why? A cooker is a heating implement.

46
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,280
No, no, no, no. It's possible that for one podcast, we can like not open it with like

47
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,360
an excessive. No, no, actually, let's open the scanner worms. No, no, no. Here's why it opened.

48
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,560
Famously, I am responsible in Ben's legendary sandwich debates. I am legendary quoted as saying

49
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,400
that the American flag is a sandwich, which I stand by. Why? Because like the lines?

50
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,240
Okay, no, no, because there are layers on the American flag, which are the 13 stripes.

51
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,880
By that definition. Okay, on the bottom there's a red strip, on the top of the red strip, and

52
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,720
the middle there are white stripes. Here's Munchy. Munchy. Munchy, famously,

53
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,920
onions are known to have layers. Does that make an onion a sandwich as well?

54
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,080
No, no, because there's not, okay, there's not similar layers on the top or the bottom.

55
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,520
Look, look, look. My final word on the sandwich debate is that artist intent, artist intent

56
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,880
matters when it comes to a sandwich debate. I am definitely an author. I'm definitely an author.

57
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,760
No! A sandwich has to be deliberately assembled for the purpose of being eaten. That is why

58
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:59,000
the American flag certainly was. If the author died, you'd go hungry. Betsy Ross, Betsy Ross,

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,520
just put those stripes on there. Famous sandwich, it could tear. Yeah, yeah, yeah, James Ross was

60
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,280
like, hey hey, babe, can you give me a beer. I want to watch the game, and she came back

61
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,040
here with the American flag, and she's like, wow this is really good. You need to watch the game

62
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,280
before games were even invented. Okay, so one American revolution. Let's not have, let's not

63
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,480
have Nate make us a one-hour debate about the definition of food. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

64
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,600
I almost said that. Okay, here's here's what I think, I think that cooking, okay, I think that

65
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:33,080
making ice cream is cooking. I think that cooking is cooking is the act of, of creating food.

66
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,240
But there has to be like chemical chemical processes need to be involved like what if I make what about what about like making

67
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,560
Sushi, you know. Yeah sushi like sushi is pretty interrelated pretty elaborate. I like not anyone

68
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,320
I've got a button here. I think it might just be a British thing English thing

69
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,200
But like ovens like the other word for an oven is a cooker that which is where the word cooking

70
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,440
From the right that's not where the word comes from I would argue

71
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,200
Fucking comes from no, no, I'll kill everyone

72
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,040
Well, this is not important. She has rice and the rice has to be yeah, the rice

73
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,840
I have the best definition of cooking cooking is

74
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,760
Preparing food to an extent that if you don't like it, you'll procrastinate on it or try to get someone else to do it

75
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,760
That's not bad. Like so sushi inquires requires cooked rice

76
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,120
What about a salad making like a complicated salad with lots of stuff, okay?

77
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,760
No, no, no funny joke to like pretend that we're doing it again and be like

78
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,440
I'm interested in this the sandwich debate is

79
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:48,280
Go on like a salad becomes cooking if you are like like if you cook grilled chicken and put that in the salad

80
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Well, of course, of course, then it's cooking

81
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,000
But otherwise it's not cooking

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,920
I feel like I could look I could work really long and hard on a complicated decadent salad

83
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,200
But that doesn't involve any heat being used. I feel like heat is the main

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,760
Because if you say if you say like oh, I'm gonna go cook

85
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,440
You know, I'm gonna go cook like this chicken or whatever

86
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,760
But you say I'm going to go make a salad because a salad does not

87
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,840
That's generally true. Hey, I see give a poster the definition of cook

88
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,280
I assume it's from like the actual dictionary.com the actual dictionary.com

89
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,240
The definition is just a prepare by mixing combining and heating the ingredients

90
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,960
But you can heat negatively by making

91
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Utilitarianism

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,160
Totally count is a negative number a number

93
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I haven't say

94
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,000
Probably about 300 episodes will probably be able to become like our own like court system because we'll have like legal

95
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,680
Fucking everything by the way, I have Nate's other thing. He's gonna say I'll just like undercut him here

96
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,400
Hey guys wouldn't be much better in Star Trek where you just push a button and food gets made for you

97
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Didn't we have to spend any time cooking

98
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,840
And food is full there's literally no fuel to talk about this because just food is fuel and just get like energy bars

99
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,320
Yeah, exactly. I mean well sort of just get so I'll be the soy boy. You want to see in the world. That's my motto

100
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,800
But anyway, all right, I think we're past all that bullshit. Finally, we're never gonna be pasta

101
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah speaking of dead fish I think if if you say cook in a context and it sounds retarded then that's not cooking like you don't say

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm gonna go cook a salad or I'm gonna go cook ice

103
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Victor the voice of reason

104
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,520
We can't define it, but we know what when we see it

105
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,120
Everything I prefer I prefer to turn my strow in the kitchen

106
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
I like refer to it

107
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,760
Let's bust open this legendary debate that was I was first introduced to in a full episode of full metal alchemist when Winery and that stupid

108
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,680
Book girl were arguing is cooking a science or an art. It is an art. It's an art. It's a fucking art

109
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,800
Dude, what do you wait? It's a cold calculated meticulous sociopathic

110
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,120
When you're ripping up shit that no one thought of

111
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,040
Fucking literally painting is also a science. You know how to mix the code. I mean, that's true

112
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,240
I know I remember extra credits their old episodes

113
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,280
They would say that video gaming is a game design is an alchemy because it's a mixture between science and art

114
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
So you know

115
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,880
What the fuck is they just made that shit up

116
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
I just want to get

117
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:01,320
You know, you know like Leonardo da Vinci known alchemist because they did both science and art Wow

118
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,280
Yeah, all right. All right, you know, I always I hate this argument because you can kind of apply it to anything

119
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,240
That's true. If you decide to proceed. It's really like it's kind of like artistic intent, right?

120
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:17,240
Mm-hmm. It's like are you intending to make a dish that is new and is your art and you're assembling it and it's beautiful

121
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,240
Do you work at yeah, Arby's and you're just assembling a sandwich? Yeah, someone that it's not

122
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,960
And science is more of a mindset in its creation rather than the end result, but you can usually yeah

123
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,760
Yeah, so for example, if it's like, hmm, what do I like on my spaghetti the most and so like today

124
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
I try you know tomato sauce next day

125
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
I try Alfredo next day I try putting hamburger in next day

126
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,580
I try putting chicken in and I take notes about exactly how much I liked each thing and then I collect the data and make my best

127
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,120
Decisions from there that science. Well, that's I mean, all right

128
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I want to severely destroy this

129
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,360
Result is if the if the only data you know acting is how much do I like it like that's not science

130
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,720
This episode being a real name guys, what is your favorite food that you can cook?

131
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,400
Sausage and eggs bird's nest which is an a which is a bread that you pull the center out of and you cook an egg

132
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,700
Inside the bread and then you eat it that way cheese. You scrambled eggs

133
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,720
Make would be like a big old slab of chicken with like on a bagel with like cheese wait wait something like that with

134
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,200
Maybe an egg or something

135
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
That's good. I also want to change my answer though

136
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,400
ice cream

137
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,000
You make ice cream hot damn. I have I have

138
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,640
This is not the food podcast, this is the cooking podcast so all the question left it and cooking good

139
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:05,080
My I like making omelettes. I make a mean omelette. I enjoy yeah the alchemy of of combining ingredients with the egg to make

140
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
The omelette alchemist

141
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,200
Anything is a sandwich because it's sandwiched when you eat it between the top and the bottom halves of your mouth

142
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
No, no

143
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,280
Okay, I want to know here. Okay. Here's my question

144
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,960
I want to go around and I want to hear from everybody because again, this is not the food podcast food doesn't matter

145
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,680
It's the cooking PCP. I want to hear about everyone's day-to-day

146
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,520
Relationship with cooking. How much do you do? How much do you fear it and are you good at it?

147
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,480
Like what do you eat? I want to I want to know I want to know everybody's thing

148
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,120
I don't like cooking just because I'm not good at it and I'm not interested and I

149
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Preferably I would like to ascend to a higher plane where food no longer matters to me and it is just fuel

150
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,800
So I'm constantly moving toward a state where you're all fucking

151
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,040
No, no, there's I enjoy I enjoy the results of good cooking, but I am not good

152
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,160
Enough in the skill to cultivate it in myself

153
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,280
I like when other people cook delectable meals for me that I can enjoy

154
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,600
Yeah, but I do not want to invest my time into doing it myself because there are other things

155
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,160
I would prefer doing with that time. I don't even appreciate

156
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,840
I mean, it's not okay. Okay, if someone makes a great dish like I'll appreciate that it's good and I'll enjoy it for what it is

157
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
But I'll beat the shit out of them

158
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:51,680
But the sad fact like the sad fact that I have come to realize is that I'd be almost as happy just eating like a boiled egg

159
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,000
Like I would be almost as happy

160
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,640
Those traits that I dream about and like romanticize about every single day of my fucking life

161
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,920
They're not a day that goes by when I don't think about the timeline where I literally am Gordon Ramsey

162
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,920
The warped and twisted streets of bombed out France living pay to check paycheck fucking every bitch

163
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,160
I can and I even care about the eggs. I'm slamming together

164
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,760
Learning from the best and getting the shit beat out of me and the fucking twisted streets

165
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,080
I will say if you had like if you were all about food like there was no fucking like anime or cartoons or home sec within you

166
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,680
I was all food and you became the fuck the like the protege for Ramsey

167
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,240
You probably would be qualified for him to pass the torch to would be just like the next Jojo where there's like slightly different attributes

168
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,840
But it's ultimately the same screamy shouty man and a man Homestuck has ruined your dreams. I know right saying

169
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Yeah, it's sapped away. I I

170
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,880
If left to my own devices, I will like I will make bagels

171
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,200
I will make not make but like I will eat bagels to eat ramen toast

172
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,080
I occasionally I will like do a fry up of bacon and eggs and stuff

173
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
But I will really go to the lengths that you know

174
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,000
My dad would go to have like a Sunday roast or anything mostly because I'm never never cooking for more than one person

175
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:25,560
Right, it's just me and just me I can get I can get by with like I can just buy a loaf of bread and eat that you know

176
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,840
But I what I do love because like cooking itself is like you know, I only cook when I'm hungry and by that point

177
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,840
I'm too. Oh, I'm too agitated

178
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,800
Yeah, dude, but what I love doing instead of cooking is baking. I love baking desserts cakes

179
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:51,320
I hate baking. I love it so much. It's something I would do even if I didn't want to eat it afterwards. I love waking and bacon

180
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
I

181
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,680
Don't know what you mean, but I don't want you to explain baking is too complicated and there is too much science in it

182
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,040
No, but like it's like it's like how much fucking egg

183
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Science and art

184
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,840
Here's the thing with baking in with cooking usually it's like heating stuff up

185
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,680
And you have to time things to be cooked at the right time

186
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,320
Yeah, and then put them all on the plate and make sure you eat it before it gets cold

187
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,880
And you can't let things get cold because then they're gross with baking time is basically completely gone

188
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,480
It just you can do it at any time you can cook it and then you can bake it and you can prepare it

189
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,320
maybe bake it and then

190
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,600
You can just leave it in the fridge and it's just like as you know, a chocolate brownie

191
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,160
Or a thing basically and it's like there's no time investment at all. There's no time pressure

192
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,680
It's just like really relaxing like even baking a loaf of bread

193
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,320
That's true. I guess that's true. I don't know

194
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,400
But I don't really have much to say on the subject of specifically baking

195
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,480
But what I did want to say was just I don't cook a lot

196
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,960
I cook rarely which is bad because I should

197
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,840
Cook more to get the more specific nutrient requirements

198
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,320
I need instead. I'll you know kind of slap it together from stuff that's around so I want to improve that but I do

199
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,120
Generally love the feeling of once I have committed and I've cooked something great

200
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,840
And I have shared it with people and I see them and excuse me enjoying it and appreciating it that in that

201
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,400
That's kind of what I wanted to say. That's the communal aspect of cooking is the real shit. It's oh

202
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,200
Hey, it is on this podcast

203
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,400
I'm fine. I'm finally an episode right with Nate the rare Munchie Nate alliance in a PCP episode

204
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,920
It's been forged today so rare, but so powerful

205
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,960
A certain type of cooking cooking for other people is one of the most enjoyable things in this life in this life

206
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,840
I've I've met some chefs actually

207
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,640
Yeah, where it seems like people who become chefs are becoming chefs because they enjoy cooking for other people

208
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,120
It's usually like they had a grandma that taught them how to cook and that the grandma would cook for the whole family

209
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,320
And then they got inspired by that and they want to cook because they want to give other people food and not

210
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
Which is pretty interesting, you know, that that's what would drive someone to want to do that

211
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,600
That's kind of the way I feel about baking like I would I would bake a bunch of brownies and I would like

212
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,800
Like really enjoy giving it to the rest of the family

213
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,480
What do you think about these these chocolate things you like

214
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm listening hippo. Don't worry. I'm listening. I'm sorry. Yes, that is great. I'm too high

215
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
Was there a joke I'm sorry I didn't I food episode

216
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,480
I hope like my favorite way to bond with friends or just like go out and experience the world is through restaurants

217
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,920
My favorite thing to do is just to get together by offline friends and go to restaurant and just eat together

218
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,920
something about like like the feeling of like eating like with you know, you're your relatives or people you're

219
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,920
It's just really it's better than talking alone. It just feels super like base and like and like

220
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,920
Primitive and it feels like you're a real that's true

221
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,840
I was gonna say I like I share Tom's like rage at the fact that I'm trapped in this weak fleshy

222
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:19,160
Prison of a body and that I have to like, you know, eat regularly to fuel it and stuff like oh, it's so annoying

223
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,400
But considering that that's the reality that I'm in like just using food as a tool to like make people like you

224
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I mean, it doesn't have to be like, you know

225
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,800
maniacal or anything but just like like like

226
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,200
Eating a meal is like when everybody has to be together. Like you can't escape it. So it's a great time to like

227
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,560
Talk to people and like get to know people better and and bond just over sharing the meal with other people

228
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,880
I should have realized that me you're coming out of these different angles

229
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:56,040
I want I want to cook and like be around people just as a nice thing and it's like how can I like force people to be around me?

230
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,080
I'm just thinking I'm just more woke munch. I'm just more woke. I thought black pills

231
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,200
I put a few more black pills in my muffins if you know what I'm saying

232
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,040
So there's something so like a luring about the about like the chef lifestyle where whenever I watch like a high-level

233
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,840
Chef it's like they're a cowboy. It's like they're a cowboy in the old rest and they don't give a shit about anything

234
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,080
Yeah, put some salt in there just like slamming around

235
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,680
You know like like like when you when you're cooking like steak or something just picking up with your bare fucking hands

236
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,040
I don't even care. Here's anything in my hands. Just slam it on the table. I don't give a shit

237
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,600
I'm self-determined and cooking does not faze me where I don't even like food. I hate eating Gordon Ramsay doesn't eat

238
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:47,080
He literally just like tastes up of what he's eating. He's not having meals. That's the thing about him. That is true

239
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,500
Really? Yeah, here's here's a here's an unpopular opinion. Here's a okay. Okay. I think that food

240
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,760
I'll hit you for it. So food is food is sort of art in the in the way that porn is sort of art

241
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,800
I think food is basically all and I think that it's

242
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,800
Hear me out here me out because I kind of I kind of know where you're going with this

243
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,080
Yeah, okay food like sex is just a thing. It's just a you know

244
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,600
It's like a primal instinct. It's like a primal instinct that we're all forced that we're all forced to enjoy

245
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,120
Like like we can't help that about ourselves that we like food and you just like porn, you know

246
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,160
There's there's there's there's some pretty simple formulas

247
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,200
I mean you could get artistic with it if you wanted

248
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,500
But it's also easy to make some very satisfying and delicious food

249
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,480
Slash porn with like some easy to find ingredients. Let me just throw a shit ton of butter in there and you know

250
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Whatever

251
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,160
From the perspective of a literal record

252
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,600
Though like because like butter isn't something that just naturally happens like butter is science

253
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,360
Ben I have a similar attitude towards it as you but I come to it from a very different angle

254
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,720
I see it as

255
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,800
You go back to if you just think of humans as just as an entity under themselves forget the actual

256
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,000
Context or culture there in they could be born today or 10,000 years ago, right?

257
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,480
You know food eating having sex having a shelter. It's all equally important

258
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,480
You know, maybe you'll have entertainment if you need it. So the thing is because eating and

259
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Eating is a higher priority, right?

260
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:29,720
Humans have spent a lot longer amount of time put way more man hours into perfecting the craft of food

261
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:38,240
To the point that by the 20th century pretty much everyone who's you know, at least decently privileged has access to basically most food

262
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,560
Right and we've basically got it down

263
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,960
I think that over the course of thousands of years

264
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,920
There was a lot of experimentation a lot of studying a lot of stuff that feels like real art and discovery

265
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,760
but we sort of like figured it out and

266
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,080
Similarly with porn it's had a lot less time to advance but because people care about porn so hard

267
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,240
It like figured out its formula and it what it needs to be a lot quicker

268
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,560
Well, meanwhile, so we mean we figured out food because we don't know shit about nutrition people

269
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,320
Nutrition is an all-new front, but when it comes to okay, okay food that tastes good and feels satisfying sure

270
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,680
It's like hitting it's like hitting a fucking equilibrium goddamn

271
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,640
Singularity with like every single month KFC and Taco Bell is inventing a new thing

272
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
That's like basically another delicious

273
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,000
Look at the KFC double down and not call it aren't okay

274
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,240
I think the double down is like that's it's a meme. I really hate because all it is it's just chicken where the bread would

275
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,400
I think I think the KFC famous bowl is pretty much the pinnacle of yeah

276
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,720
Yeah, I think the whole double down me is like fucking retarded because all it is is just you're just swapping out bread with chicken

277
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,080
It's such a simple but powerful change look

278
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:56,360
Minimalist double down right there before us the whole time we simply need to open our eyes and realize people describing the double down is disgusting

279
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,240
I think those people are all fucking retarded, but there are other things

280
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,160
I don't see what's so bad about it's me. There's definitely fried chicken. Yeah, there's definitely

281
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:12,200
There's technically less carbohydrates if you get yeah double down. Yeah, well, it's a breading. Yeah, well, it's not fucking

282
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,480
It's breaded chicken, but but anyway, so meanwhile stuff like comics or fucking

283
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,480
Literature right there's like

284
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,560
They would just reach over like in the Garden of Eden Adam would reach over to the bush and pluck

285
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,600
Think about how much we figured out food like we basically know what most people like there's a restaurant for almost every sensible taste that in the book

286
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,720
Meanwhile tastes in movies or comics or books is

287
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,960
Even though we've made so much progress

288
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,240
There's still much more

289
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:04,400
Formulation for them to make and at this point we're probably heading towards some sort of perfection there within a hundred years or so with algorithms like

290
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,440
Data-collecting every opinion possible. I don't know. Maybe maybe maybe maybe it's possible

291
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Maybe it's possible

292
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,320
I don't think that was enough that with enough like if we live in a post-singularity society

293
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,640
And we have like every fucking like everyone's making art there might be like a home stuck for every single opinion

294
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
You could have coming out every couple of months

295
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,560
Because the principle of diminishing returns even if a perfect story were crafted that everyone

296
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,880
Eventually become boring and we would need something else because

297
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:43,280
My this was I picked my words carefully a home stuck for every type of opinion coming out every two months

298
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,960
Okay, okay. What was what was Vic saying now? I want to hear I want to hear Vic twine

299
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,640
I'm gonna say I don't agree with the idea that cooking has become like this singular

300
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,840
No, it's not like actually perfect. Yeah, it's so much closer. It's so much like further up on that hill that it feels

301
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,400
I mean it might just be because like satisfying the taste buds a much simpler thing than satisfying ones like

302
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,640
We've spent media like 10,000 years

303
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Advancing agriculture

304
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:17,720
Agree with that, but I mean is it is it crazy to think that like it is true satisfying the palette is just an objectively less

305
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Someone I consider myself someone with a very unrefined palette, so maybe I don't have

306
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
to like comment on

307
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Maybe someone with a very developed

308
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,400
For example, like oh, I don't need much at all. Oh, hey, I'll put some salt on it

309
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Salt was an incredibly difficult thing to get throughout most of history

310
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,600
It's not like mentally strenuous from the from the perspective of a cook but from the broader cultural from the broader like all of society working together

311
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Like the fact that you have a spice rack dude spices used to control like the commerce of the entire fucking planet, right?

312
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:05,560
But now it's just casual, so like they were the bitcoins of that kind of what I was getting at in the fact that there's

313
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,760
Like I still think that is going to continue to evolve because there's still resources that are more scarce

314
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,440
And like there are food trends that come out where it's like now

315
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,400
There's a million pomegranate drinks because now pomegranate is easier to farm right we're making GMO fruits that can actually fucking

316
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Reproduce

317
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,760
Preservation techniques that will allow the pawpaw fruit to come back into wide circulation

318
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,400
Exactly, right exactly. I need I need pawpaw flavored

319
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,560
Fruit native to America we need it's a symbol of America

320
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,040
We have to make America great again with the pawpaw

321
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,640
Are you not referring to the pawpaw fruit from one piece that Bartholomew kuma canonically ate? No

322
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:58,040
It's from the pawpaw fruit. It's like they still grow in Virginia and West Virginia. It's like a it's like a virginia native

323
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,640
Because that it's not people say it's really good. It's super overpowered in one piece. It's really strong in one piece

324
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,720
GMO discussion in this episode because I feel like that might be important to cook in yeah, we could we could go off on some fucking

325
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,080
I could fucking when you like that match you can't stop

326
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:28,560
Do with cooking it's really more about agriculture, but I'm happy to talk about GMO to death goddamn it your pro GMO to death, huh?

327
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,040
Yeah, there's a good documentary on Hulu that you could watch that'll make it fucking red pilled for GMO's

328
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:39,160
Okay, basically, it's all bullshit like GMOs are fine. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it

329
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,360
It's just fucking you're you're just splicing DNA and that's completely bad

330
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,560
Like people people chemicals or pesticides. I don't know much about it, but like all it is like you just change in their genes

331
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,880
That doesn't make them like radioactive. Yeah poisonous or anything

332
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Yeah, people act like it's fucking poison faster. We've been doing literally all of our species existence

333
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:08,840
Did you guys know the carrots used to be purple? No, no, did you guys know? Okay? Okay, you know dogs used to be wolves

334
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,040
We have dogs that can literally sneeze their own eyeballs

335
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,440
Here's something that legitimately blew my mind. Okay, like spinach broccoli

336
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:28,320
Broccoli cabbage Brussels sprouts called they're all the same plant. They all are they all are descendants of wild mustard

337
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,600
They were like they're the same plant that we're just selectively bred for different trades

338
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,440
Also like Brussels sprouts like a tiny tiny tiny little cabbage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know I found that out and I was like holy shit

339
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,560
That's adorable. Yeah, it is still don't like to eat like a like with bananas like they they they basically

340
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,080
It's still selective breeding is just forced into the DNA where they're just taking traits from other plants and putting them in so that

341
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
They won't die from like mass viruses

342
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,920
Yeah, and like without that then the economies of the places that are fucking growing the bananas would tank because all the bananas would die

343
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,800
And then we wouldn't have bananas. Yeah, yeah without GMOs. So it's like it's praise GMOs

344
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,360
And the the people that spread the fear of it like this this is a good documentary

345
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,920
Yeah, the the funding for those fucking documentaries are all coming from places like Whole Foods and shit

346
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:26,480
Yeah, because it's their agenda to sell all this non-GMO stuff because it's a trendy now to be fair is

347
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,080
Not positive some of the fear that like in the future

348
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,120
There will be consequences as opposed to right now of using GMOs. Is that

349
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
I don't

350
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,360
Would be that the the only consequence would be that like the viruses would change to

351
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,440
Sorry to interrupt. Yeah, how do I say my mic still working? You said fine. Yep

352
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:05,840
Like yeah, well, you know, this is all very interesting at all, but there's I think the audience really there's just one thing that came for

353
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,160
Victor I want to know about the philosophy of the po-boy eats. I just want to know everything

354
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
That goes on in that world

355
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:25,400
Tell me about it. I mean this is that the series was inspired by the fact that I cook these super simple dishes for me and hope every day

356
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,320
Almost it not every day at all, but but basically enough, but it's all I fucking know how to do

357
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:38,000
But like I know other fucking broke-ass dudes who are like like I have a friend who

358
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,560
Gets on me all the time for like the way I eat and stuff and he literally just eats peanut butter and granola sandwiches

359
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,640
So that he can save his money so that one day he could fucking buy a boat

360
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,520
And I'm like you are you are killing yourself. I can't eat just a peanut butter and granola sandwich

361
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:59,920
My dad will eat rice mixed with corn and pea. Yeah, and that that's a satisfying dinner to him

362
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Like I can't do that right

363
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,800
Like you can you could be kind of broke and also make yourself food that

364
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,120
Makes you not want to kill yourself, you know, well, so everybody knows I mean in case you missed it

365
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,240
We have to link this in the show notes or wherever about the red the rad con three po-boy eat

366
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
That was an absolute fucking

367
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,320
Art piece that was that was definitely alchemy going on in that video for sure, right?

368
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,120
That was I got to say I tried noodles on bread

369
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,680
Like just the other day because I just thought I was cooking noodles. I was like, you know

370
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,920
I don't remember the the the you know the Victor burger being that bad. I

371
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Want to try it again. I want to try noodles on bread and it was probably is quite good. Yeah

372
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:50,320
I'm glad that was on it. Well, the Japanese do that. They'll have like the fucking the noodles on like the hot dog buns and stuff

373
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,800
Right. Yeah, that's true though. There's like a bunch of other shit

374
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,920
Soba hot dog bun shit, right? That's right. There's people experimenting far beyond what I've been doing

375
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,560
I mean, it's just not in America. We're just we're we're

376
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,560
Yeah, hey while we're on the subject of while we're on the subject of simplistic food

377
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,840
Like I didn't end up talking about like my lifestyle with cooking. So here's the thing with me in cooking

378
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,280
The the tensions I have with it are like weird. So I love cooking. I find it therapeutic

379
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,280
I find doing the dishes to be therapeutic

380
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,160
The problem is I just never take the time to like do it because I want to like work on videos more

381
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,640
So I have the same problem as hippo where by the time I finally set about to cook

382
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,120
I'm too fucking hungry and so then it's just almond butter sandwich

383
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,640
So what I need to do what I do when I really like kind of have my shit together

384
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,760
It's just make a whole bunch of food put it in the fridge right now

385
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,440
Wait, was that it was that an almond butter sandwich or is that a was that a all the butter no almond butter sandwich?

386
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
Like one stick of butter

387
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,160
Okay, we're like even cashew butter sandwich, which is even better. That's good. Yeah. So like here's right now

388
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,240
I don't have a microwave though. So I can't I've just been eating like cold leftovers that I make but here's the other thing

389
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,160
It's about simplistic food, right? I only got one recently like as I was getting older as I was like, you know becoming 15 16 17

390
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,000
Some of my friends were like, oh wow you cook food. That's like so helpful, right? I'm like, oh, I'm a helpful person who cooks

391
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,260
I don't know and so then leading up to moving in to the bro house with digi and Victor and

392
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,640
Tom been and whatnot. I'm like, okay, so I guess I cook maybe I'll be useful for cooking

393
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:30,440
But then when it turns out is oh the reason why people don't cook is that they want to have like actual food and not just like

394
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,440
Something that you make with like three ingredients, which is what I always eat like I'm just like, okay

395
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,080
What the ingredients do I have? Oh boy? I have some chicken. Oh, I have a spinach. Oh, I have a

396
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,480
Mushrooms or I have some onions of carrots. All right. I'll saute this and I'm like that's for me is like as good of a meal as I can have

397
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,160
Like I'm not quite as crazy about like weirdly simplistic meals. Okay with that. That sounds pretty good to me. I mean, I don't know

398
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,000
I don't know like that like

399
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Because like I'll eat like rice broccoli and a chicken breast. Yeah, that's like decade because did you was saying like yeah?

400
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,360
You know, I just don't like cooking. I can't I can't I don't know how to cook

401
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,360
I'm like, oh, well, dude, if you want to know how to cook all you gotta do is just make spaghetti, right?

402
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,920
Then the next day or whenever you feel like making spaghetti again make it with like hamburger meat or chicken meat, right?

403
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Then next time put in some like mushrooms and green peppers in there, right?

404
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,800
So just keep making spaghetti and amp up the fucking ingredients one at a time, right?

405
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,240
Yeah, but then like digi then like a month later in another episode of digi, bro

406
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,080
He's like, huh divus telling me how to make spaghetti. I know how to make spaghetti

407
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,520
Like he basically what he was saying is the reason why he doesn't want to cook does see though

408
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,920
The reason why he can't cook by his own definition is that he wants cooked food to be like more complex

409
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,920
And not like the way that his dad would eat food

410
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,360
So what I found out is that even though I like making food

411
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,480
I don't like making food for other people because people don't ever want to eat what I'm gonna make for the most part

412
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,000
The food that I've seen you cook is pretty weird

413
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,760
It's pretty well, you'll have like it's just like I don't rice

414
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,000
You'll have like brown rice like a piece of chicken and then like a pile of like

415
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,520
steamed shredded carrot or something

416
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,520
Ever care about like the I don't maybe I just hate carrots

417
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:21,800
I mostly don't care about like the the precise execution like the difference between like exactly how long you might want to

418
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:28,680
Royal something or like breading something correctly or like having the like ratio of ingredients be correct

419
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,520
I became cognizant of this when like when did you was saying like oh?

420
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,680
You know the reason you go to Kevin's doghouse is because it's got the perfect ratio of bun to wiener to chili and I'm like

421
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,520
Oh, yeah ratios. I kind of don't care. I just sort of think what are some ingredients?

422
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:49,380
I like do those ingredients go well together put them together like it's just very caveman like for me and that

423
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:55,780
That's why it's so fucking cowboy like these it's because you don't have to give a shit to cook

424
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,260
You do not have to care and that's what makes cook so cool

425
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:06,100
Is that they're just constantly like cynical and pessimistic and they have no passion or life left on your body?

426
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,460
My approach to cooking

427
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,940
Fucking bowls together and outcomes when when I pause pause pause. What was Gibbs say?

428
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,820
Well, I was gonna say my dad. Yeah, he's like been cooking his whole life

429
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,660
And he's like the cook of the family and he's like really really good in it

430
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,140
I love any cooks, but when I was trying to learn from him like I was like, okay

431
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,580
I got a I got a I got a step up to the plate. I got to try and cook things and

432
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:36,820
He doesn't have like he doesn't know timings for anything

433
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,020
He just like over the course of being a cook for so long. Yeah, he just

434
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,540
Instinctively knows how long you're supposed to cook a piece of thing and at what temperature

435
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,100
I have to keep asking him what temperature do I reheat this thing at what about this?

436
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,420
How long do I go and just go just go until it's brown and then put the thing and yeah

437
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,980
I'm like that like I know like in my heart of heart when the chicken is probably done

438
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,460
Yeah, but you know, it's like jazz man. Yeah

439
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,340
Yeah, when I when I cook I will like I'll start cooking with a thing in mind

440
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,780
I won't check to see if we have the ingredients

441
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,740
I will just kind of start going and then I'll just I'll just make whatever

442
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,900
Substitutions, I feel like right you want to talk to it. I do a cowboy. So hi

443
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Yeah, yeah

444
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,300
Oh, yeah

445
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,180
So like the the reason why I wanted Ben to be on this episode is that me and Ben?

446
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,780
Well, I played witness to Ben trying to make his infamous like rhubarb pie shit

447
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:42,300
Back it was it was the it was the devoo bar pie. It was a strawberry rhubarb pie with blueberries

448
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,980
That's good, but the thing is I'm gonna make this rhubarb pie, right?

449
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,060
And you're like, okay

450
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,900
Well, let me look at the ingredients and one by one by one by one by one

451
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,380
You had like maybe two out of the ten ingredients and just

452
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:04,060
Substituted and substituted over and over and over again. Whoa. Some of the substitutions were legit. Yeah

453
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,820
And it was just the most Ben experience I've ever had

454
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,940
Turned out like what were you left with okay? It turned out okay?

455
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,260
It would have been a fine pie

456
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,900
The only thing was that there was not enough filling so the filling kind of baked down into just kind of like a film

457
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:29,820
So it kind of just became like really thin bars of like pie crust with kind of a thin gooey like layer of

458
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,380
You know of devoo bar

459
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,500
Okay, the top of it. It was right. I mean it wasn't gross or anything, but it was not a pie

460
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,460
Yeah, we were looking for rhubarb and like we literally went like all around Virginia fucking beach even to like the Asian food

461
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,420
Sort to find rhubarb. There was just no fucking rhubarb anywhere. We grow that shit in our fucking garden up. Yeah

462
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,060
Yeah, I think it's I think it's more of a northern thing. Yeah, I guess so

463
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,700
Bites into that and he thinks you know, I could have eaten the hard-boiled egg. That's the problem Ben

464
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,580
It's not the food. It's that you're making a weird filmy disgusting like fish tank food

465
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,540
by

466
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,180
um

467
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:15,140
You guys remember who was who was there for it when I made the um the the Swedish fish flavored fried Oreos

468
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
that no

469
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,260
During a round like I was there at Radcon

470
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:29,340
You and me made Dorito a breaded fried chicken. I remember I remember. Yeah, they didn't really really taste like Doritos

471
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:34,580
They needed to be dusted with Dorito dust after frying like right not before

472
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,940
Remember the fucking crock pot

473
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:44,220
Chernobyl crock pot the crock pot. Okay. Do you remember? Okay. Do you remember the final days of the crock pot?

474
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,100
Well, I remember the time when it well when there was that one crock pot that dragged out for a couple of days

475
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, like we had like chicken and vegetables in the crock pot

476
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,700
This was like this was right before we retired it for good. Yeah

477
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:03,180
So there were chicken and vegetables in there and it had been cooking for it had been in there hot for like two days

478
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,220
It was very dried out. It was not well

479
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,100
So what I did was we went we went to the supermarket and I picked up some cans of soup

480
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,700
I got like cheese and beer flavored soup

481
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,900
And I just

482
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,940
Cheese and beer flavored soup

483
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,060
And mix them with

484
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,420
To moisten it up so I could eat it again

485
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,460
Right, right

486
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,500
Ben like set a crock pot and like the mid-afternoon

487
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:35,300
And I thought it was Digi's crock pot for some reason and like I had heard that the crock pot was done

488
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,820
It was supposed to be done at 10 p.m. 10 p.m

489
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:45,020
10 p.m. Comes and I'm the only one still awake and I thought well, it's Digi's crock pot Digi's relatively responsible

490
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:50,420
He'll remember but it was actually Ben's crock pot. I assume he was asleep. So the next morning comes up

491
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,220
I wake up and I'm like, I'm hearing a sizzling. What's the sizzling?

492
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:59,580
And I look and I see the crock pot has been on full blast all fucking night. It's all dried up and

493
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,820
Like and Digi comes down. I was like, oh shit Ben's gonna have to throw this away

494
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,200
Then Ben wakes up and he's like hmm. I don't think I had to throw this away

495
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,220
So like you just like neither of us like take a single stab at it

496
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,420
We don't even want to like be in the same zip code, but you're like nibble nibble

497
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,900
I mean, I mean, you know nibble nibble and yeah

498
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,780
You eventually get like fucking like cheese and beer soup like so like basically just make it worse

499
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,780
Just to make it fucking worse. That's and to me. There's a certain logic

500
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,140
That's the perfect summary of the experience of living in that house at that time

501
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,140
It was that there was always some sort of disturbing black mess crock pot

502
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,980
That crock pot on he left the crock pot on on warm right he didn't even like put it in the fridge

503
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,740
He just left it on warm for like a couple more fucking days

504
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,420
Continuing to nibble at it before he finally gave up and it was like all crusted and dried at the bottom

505
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,620
The whole kitchen smelled like ass it was just like

506
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,060
The beer and cheese soup gave it a very strange smell

507
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,540
Two separate soups a beer soup and a cheese

508
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,980
One can soup it was okay and cheese flavor soup. Yeah, okay

509
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,260
It was a real thing more than anyone in this group needs to have his needs to star in a sitcom

510
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,780
Just this man who's just everything about life and existence for him as a total failure

511
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,820
But he's so complacent with it and so chill about it that it seems like he's doing it on purpose

512
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,820
And it's actually really cool

513
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,780
I resent that a lot. I'll fucking end you good tonight

514
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,980
That's the creamer of real life in some ways

515
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:50,060
Here's the rub. Yeah, is don't be don't be like this. Don't do this. Why not it's good. It worked out

516
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,220
I got I got no down to that crock

517
00:44:53,580 --> 00:45:00,020
Don't give a shit Donald's don't go to der Wiener schnitzel. Don't go to fucking Burger King

518
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,340
Don't just learn just learn the real shit. That's fucking easy

519
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:11,980
Put some butter in a pan get the pan hot and put it in the egg you will be satisfied by just

520
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,740
So this is this is my secret to being a cooking boy and

521
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:27,980
And keeping it going and cooking every day and do it and cooking real meals that aren't just bullshit and it's having a

522
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,780
Girlfriend who is way more responsible than I am

523
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:38,060
It's a good it's an ultimate secret my uh, yeah, that's a pretty good she goes and makes lists of shit and

524
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,740
Gets ingredients and goes and bides them and then all I have to do is assemble them and cook them

525
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,220
And it's easy because it's all planned for me. Yeah, and I don't have to do shit

526
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:53,660
That is the best way to keep cooking in your life. It's it's so difficult and because I live with my parents still

527
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,780
Yeah, and like my dad is is the cook boy. He cooks

528
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,980
Like he has meals planned like way ahead of time like I'm gonna cook a fucking a curry today

529
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,080
And then we're gonna have a lot of roast lamb

530
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,620
You know whatever and he's like he has all these ingredients in the fridge

531
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:14,820
And I don't know what I can use and what I can so I did I never get the chance to use

532
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,900
Let to learn cooking myself. I really should like

533
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:25,900
Like I feel like I would be able to keep track of it if I had with the fridge to of my own

534
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,740
But it's kind of how I felt that's a fridge with a yeah with my

535
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:35,940
With my family like my mom was the one who does the cooking primarily, but like she wouldn't do it all the time

536
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,340
It would be like hmm point it'd be like

537
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,460
two out of every third day, right and

538
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,740
The thing is is that most of the time we would just make meals for ourselves

539
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:50,380
I think my dad was like the only one who would like he would basically just rely upon them food that my mom made

540
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,580
He did as leftovers or he'd get work all the time

541
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,380
So he would have lunches out

542
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,940
But everyone else in the family just basically makes their own shit like I make my own shit

543
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:05,740
And I think my younger brother and sister took after me as a result because even though we generally like almost all the food that our mom makes

544
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,900
We just want to eat when we want to fucking eat, right like yeah me and my brother both like

545
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,300
When we like hit puberty we both became like massive needs we'd be up at totally random times

546
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,820
So it's like I want to have fresh food and I want it to be exactly the amount of fucking proteins

547
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:26,520
I need right now. So that's how I got into the habit of just like cooking some stupid thing for myself

548
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:35,020
The result of this is that the dishes in our kitchen were completely out of control 24-7 and they remain so to this day

549
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,060
I'm glad I moved out. I probably we should probably do a whole isolated episode about dish washing

550
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,260
I can definitely get an episode worth of that

551
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:49,660
Damn, I think dish washing is just part of cooking. You should consider that part of cooking fucking wash your shit immediately

552
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:56,460
Afterwards, I mean, I will never be a problem. Okay. I'm gonna spoil the upcoming the eventual dish washing episodes

553
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,020
Just right now, right? Here's the thing about that

554
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,860
It depends on your cooking habits

555
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:07,060
My mom would have a number of times where she would kind of snap and be like, okay from now on

556
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:12,940
You're always washing the dishes right after we're done cooking, right and inevitably invariably

557
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,940
Every time she has that snap in like the like early afternoon come late evening

558
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,580
She'll have a moment where she cooked something and she's fucking tired

559
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,580
Like there was one time where she was really adamant about it

560
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:30,780
She was really adamant about it and then that night she makes fucking muffins

561
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:36,420
And then there's just five fucking crusty muffin tins on the countertop, but I'm like hey mom

562
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:41,940
What's up with that whole cleaning thing, right? She's like I know I know because here's the thing about it

563
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,940
Is that by the time you're done cooking?

564
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,820
You're a completely different fucking person like

565
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,060
Fucking hungry now you eat the food by the time you're done eating the food

566
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,260
You've like the time of your life that you spent dirtying those dishes

567
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,980
That's like a long past memory you're you've moved on you need to move on with your life

568
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,860
The only way to do it is just have dedicated time where it's like there's a pile of dishes

569
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,860
I'm gonna fucking shred

570
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:18,020
The way to do it the way to do it is not to do it right after you've finished eating is to wait like a couple hours

571
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,180
Or at least before you go to bed

572
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:28,860
What me and Hope will do is that we will have washed most of the dishes by the time we're even finished cooking like as soon as

573
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,060
You can do that I think that's ideal

574
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:40,340
The problem is it depends on what you're cooking because it's like for example

575
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:46,980
Oh, you know what actually kills it for me almost everything I cook is fucking fried or like sauteed right you can't cook a hot-ass thing

576
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:51,780
Right after it's done you you have to let it cool a bit and some of that shit's gonna congeal

577
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:56,260
You can't just touch it right now. So like you have no choice but to put it off for a while

578
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,460
You know okay, okay?

579
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:04,060
Sometimes sometimes you get a dish that is like really crusty and sticky and then you know you soak it and you let it sit for a while

580
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,460
Personally, I think it probably is the most efficient to clean immediately

581
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,540
I kind of like to do like a big like to clean a load of dishes at once

582
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,780
I know it means passionately dishes are in the sink and it's and it's lame

583
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,900
But I like to just do it all I mean I end up doing that Ben

584
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:27,460
But the thing is I end up getting to a place of great anger at the world at those dishes that are piled up

585
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,140
And it makes my life worse like I've never do it because I'm like yay time to wash the dishes

586
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,060
It's always fuck. I cannot put this off any longer

587
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:41,140
Now I have to fucking wait into this hellscape and do the dishes for me what made my what makes me but my whole by the way

588
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,520
Once I'm actually doing the dishes. It's not so bad. It's it's the preparation to be like fine

589
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,620
I love washing dishes because I think it's really satisfying and therapeutic

590
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:55,120
It's just I I want to get back to work and that's the problem with me and my whole family is that we're always my whole family are like

591
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:00,960
What am I doing next type of people right like my dad's someone who it's like if he has 15 minutes to wait to go to work

592
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,080
He's gonna like come up with something to do that'll make him just like 15 seconds late, right?

593
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,040
So we're all like that so none of us want you to continue

594
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,200
Harboring over the fucking like food that we just made and continue to like keep cleaning dishes, right?

595
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,840
We wanted like move on to the next thing because now we have all this new renewed after meal energy

596
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,440
So like the the thing with that is

597
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,360
Fuck I don't know where I was going with that. So yeah

598
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,960
I

599
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,880
Want to just gotta do it man. Just gotta do it. Yeah, but

600
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,240
There's other stuff I gotta do because like when you have a well one of the problem

601
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:44,440
When you have a stay-at-home job, then you have a choice, but to like yeah when you got a stay-at-home job

602
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,480
It's really challenging and it really means that you know

603
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,440
You got a budget your time because you don't have the kind of free time with someone who works 9 to 5 in an office or anything

604
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,440
I know you're being sarcastic then but it's like

605
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:05,480
It's fucking when you have a 9 to 5 there's these clear borders of when you are or are not working, right?

606
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,280
But when there's always a video project left to be made just in the other room

607
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,840
It's always nagging at me. So what I want to do is I want to have no I know what you mean

608
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:18,480
I do I want to have a dedicated time each day where I'm cooking and cleaning at the same time

609
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,720
Simultaneously and then everything is clean and then like all the leftovers I'll need for tomorrow or in the fridge

610
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,640
That's what I need to do

611
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,280
I just need to manage that as a giant chunk and just wipe it all out in one go. I

612
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
Structure to that point. I

613
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,120
Have a certain level of fear that when I go full-time doing YouTube stuff that my my lack of an

614
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,520
inherently rigid rigid cold schedule

615
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,840
It's the toughest thing. It'll be an issue. Like they say when you become your own boss, you have to hate yourself like a boss.

616
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,800
You just be able to make your own schedule. You're just gonna be able to like like

617
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,840
Regally like like make his own hours

618
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,600
Well, you know that that's the thing that to do like that is the way to go and like to try to stick to that

619
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:04,600
But like if my my personal like internet creation career thing has kind of been an exercise in

620
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:12,640
Finding ways to not have to rely on my own willpower and instead putting on it like like by making like we Agua like I have to get

621
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,320
One done every week. There's no choice like you can't procrastinate or I mean I am right now

622
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,080
But you know what I've been doing for the last several months

623
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,960
I've been experimenting with this over the last year

624
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,840
But I've been doing it hardcore for the last couple months is don't don't schedule myself

625
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,720
But just keep track of what I'm doing which is interesting cuz CGP Grey just like did a Q&A where he mentions that that's what he does

626
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:37,820
too so like I just track how many how how many minutes in the day I spent working and then doing chores and then

627
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,600
Fapping and then doing nothing and then like watching stuff, right and then sleeping

628
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,640
So then I just look at the numbers and the numbers that just sort of constantly reminding me

629
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,480
It's like a pat on the fucking shoulder like bro. Hey, hey, wake up

630
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,920
You know, it always makes me think about it like okay, and that keeps me awake

631
00:53:53,920 --> 00:54:00,960
I'm now. Maybe I don't know shit about shit, but I feel the need to ask has that actually work because I

632
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,960
Mean like to my view it seems kind of like you've fallen completely off the map

633
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,840
Well, yes, there have been other things that have made me like not well as I've been

634
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:18,680
Checking the numbers. Yes, there've been like huge stretches of time where I'm barely like putting in like even part time hours, right?

635
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:24,740
And I'm trying my best and I'm trying to crawl out of it. I think I am I've been saying that a bunch of times though

636
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,640
You know, it's fucking you know in a relationship having basically doubled my family amount

637
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,000
You know what I mean? So like just all sorts of stuff flies in

638
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,680
Well, he doesn't need to defend himself

639
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,600
Although I probably fall off the map because I'm trying to be less of an internet personality

640
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,760
But I guess I'm on podcasts more now. So I guess I'm failing at that. Yeah

641
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
Getting back to cooking. I

642
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:57,200
Remembered something that is like the perfect like the most fun cooking that I actually do love a lot

643
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,200
And I hope a lot of you agree

644
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,700
Being a barbecue chieftain

645
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:06,620
What is it with sitting sitting at the barbecue by the way, it's like universal

646
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,900
I the idea is that moms are the cookers, right?

647
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:14,540
But barbecuing on the on the thing outside is always a hundred percent dad. I

648
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:21,700
Well, here's the thing with that my dad has sort of like relegated that to me and I have like leapt it up like that

649
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,100
That's my favorite thing to do. I am yeah

650
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,540
I'm now the dad when it comes to barbecuing and it's like that Tim and Eric skit when when Eric is like

651
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,220
Children, I'm just gonna be one of you now

652
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:38,580
That's our new dad. I'm just one of the kids now. That's what your dad's done to you. You've been promoted. He's demoted because like

653
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:45,860
It's it's I took a great side when I moved out of the house and moved in to my own place when we we bought a grill

654
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:51,580
And I was like, all right, I am the new grill master. Yeah, I'm my dad did this and I'm gonna do this now

655
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,160
And this is my thing and it's it's fun

656
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,600
With grilling and cooking anything you are not beheld into any when you restaurant or to any cook

657
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,280
Yeah, your mom or to your dad you were making your own shit. Yeah for your own path

658
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,360
I just do literally so great

659
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,720
And you can just do whatever the fuck you want these fucking munchies

660
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,800
Let's give go. He was he was coming. Yeah. Yeah. What's so good reason? It's so it's so good is because

661
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,320
Um

662
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:27,880
When you are like the main guy doing the cooking everybody comes to you as like the leader of what's happening currently

663
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:34,280
And so like you put the meat on and then somebody else. So can I get you anything kind of do you need like a

664
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,720
Shall I bring the the next set of like kebabs or whatever bring you the next version for you to impregnate?

665
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:45,280
Yeah, and then people are like willing to that because standing in front of a barbecue on a hot day

666
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,680
It's like a big whoosh of hot air and it's like ow. It hurts. It hurts my eyes, but I love being there

667
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:56,960
It's like being a blacksmith. It's but it's like it's like sweating and like and like smoke all over my face

668
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,160
And I'm like I'm smashing these sausages onto the grill and I'm looking at them crisp up

669
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:07,080
And and I got my apron and my tools and I'm like, I'm the coolest guy and the best thing about it

670
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,640
It's during a party this happened once

671
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,840
It may happen again where there was a barbecues a summer like last year

672
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:20,480
I was barbecuing and there's a bunch of people around and they are like people my parents know and I don't really know them

673
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,760
They're all drinking and talking and having a good time

674
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:28,360
And I'm the barbecue boy which means that nobody has to come and talk to me about anything because the barbecues tucked away

675
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,880
And I'm just providing food

676
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,480
I'm just saying I'm like my brother would come here talk to me because he doesn't like talking to anyone either

677
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,560
And he would be the one bringing the fruit from me to the kitchen

678
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,280
So like I got to not I get to not participate in the party, but still be

679
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,160
Like a non-anti-social person and cartoons don't work out hippo

680
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,040
You could do the job of being the like four armed

681
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,760
Heat guy from spirit of the way who like gets the fire going for the boilers and shit

682
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,280
That's he basically looks like he already like when you have that like half mustache beard thing going on, right?

683
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,480
Yeah, it's true

684
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,640
Coming off of what hippo said I think one of the reasons that like

685
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,680
Barbecuing appeals to dads and it's kind of like that male thing my wife

686
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:16,080
That I think it's like it's something you like you want to be outside doing something a little bit

687
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,240
Barbecuing is something to do and then it's also a great excuse to have a bunch of beers

688
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,040
Yeah, like sit there and grill like my dad always did it when he always be drinking beers

689
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,800
And then when I barbecued I like basically got drunk while as barbecuing and had a blast right because you're outside

690
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,440
Yeah, and I'm outside alone

691
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,320
So I'm like I the only way to pass the time is really to like fucking drink a bunch of beers

692
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,120
Well, you're sitting there barbecuing. Yeah, and you're having a blast

693
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,240
And you can't you can't like get roped into any stupid conversation because you're like, oh, sorry

694
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,680
I gotta I gotta pay attention to this, you know the stuff

695
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,480
This is important, you know late in my career as a son

696
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:57,360
When I when I live with my parents still the thing is grilling became sort of a vital component of like everyday meals

697
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:03,980
So like we we would grill out on like the deck where the where the thing was like all the time and the problem is I don't share

698
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:10,720
Exactly the same, you know manly trope of how great barbecuing is because it became just like a family cooking thing

699
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,440
They're like I would do a lot. I'm you know bend it sometimes

700
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,920
I remember having to do it a lot and it was just like a thing that I was expected to do and it was like it was like

701
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:24,280
My dad was the real boss. I was just the fire monkey who had to go out and you know prepare

702
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:28,220
Yeah, you know and it was it hurt my feelings. I didn't get to be a big boy

703
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,120
They sucked all the fun. I like it was it was fine. It was fine. It was just a chore though

704
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,740
Yeah, yeah, I was not master of my domain, which I think was the difference here

705
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,880
My dad would only ever barbecue like once a year. Yeah, it was always a big deal

706
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,080
Like it was this rare phenomenon that we were grilling and it's like oh man

707
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,120
This is the coolest thing basically instead of being a cook. I was just a cook

708
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,320
About like that that being on a hot day and having that hot grill blow smoke into your face

709
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,360
There's something so satisfying about like being in pain, you know

710
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,640
About doing something hard that like physically harm you not like emotionally like work really like like hurts you and burns like like

711
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:17,080
Like I'm sure like you know mining at night getting your hands all chapped and like

712
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,840
I do not like that before in my life. So thank you. Yeah, that's what I'm I

713
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,640
Defaulted that cuz I'm a fucking idiot

714
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,960
hard labor hard labor feels great just to do like gardening gardening digging up weeds destroying like like

715
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,440
Stumps, it's great

716
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,840
Labor to like accomplish something that you know is good and that you want to do and it's just like of your own accord

717
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:45,360
You're like, you know, I'm gonna be a fucking man. I'm gonna get down in the dirt. I'm gonna grovel. I'm gonna flop around like a fucking pig

718
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,320
I'm the poor mud over my fucking spread-ass eagle

719
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,560
Shit, I'm gonna fucking be a man

720
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,720
Or even just like going on like a long hike through like the woods like that's like physical and it's like

721
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:04,840
Ah, I've accomplished this, you know. Yeah, I don't mean I don't do I don't do physical labor or physical exercise

722
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:12,320
Oh, the only muscle that I ever work out is my brain is your brain. Yeah, there we go. Also my my my my ethics

723
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,280
I mean, yeah, the three form a whole eternity

724
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,680
He said like in one episode

725
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,680
Maybe conscience would be a better word, I think your brain is a huge fucking muscle, bro

726
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,240
That's why I like yeah one time Rush Limbaugh was like people always say rush. Why don't you ever work out?

727
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,640
Why don't I ever see you like even like lift anything or like do anything physical?

728
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:45,140
It's because you all don't see the cylinders firing at full strength in my

729
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,000
You said Rush Limbaugh, yeah, yeah, okay, okay. Well, what a fucking idiot

730
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,000
If I if I did any physical activity, it would take okay

731
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,960
It would divert power away from my brain cylinders

732
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:14,600
But Rush Limbaugh is a big fatty and L is canonically like a tennis warrior gladiator champion. So yeah, I'm just saying

733
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,160
There's something so sad

734
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:21,640
It's fine not being able to like give another human and like like a share in the thing

735
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,560
You're giving another human of like giving them like the primal desire of eating food

736
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,840
But not having to be like a weird like like societal commitment like sexes

737
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:37,640
And a friendly ordeal where you just share and being a human and bleeding and weeping together

738
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,480
And you have your bread or your cheese and you can talk and you can catch up

739
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:49,920
It's just a warm homely ever that doesn't have any societal pressures on it. It's this like a cursed forced

740
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,520
heterosexual

741
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,000
Relationships I'm forced to engage in you know

742
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,040
Just just the the the feeling of joy

743
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,840
Yeah, through a chaotic, you know, just just

744
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:08,040
Just happen to happen J. Oh crystal charging sesh with the boys. No, that's that's pure

745
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,440
That's what life is really about. Hey, are we gonna start a PCD club?

746
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:18,520
What's the D for Pete the D club? You don't know about the D club. Oh the D club, of course, of course, I mean yes

747
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,880
Radcon D

748
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,520
The fourth one will be next so D would work. Yeah, damn. That's a good idea

749
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:39,200
I've got like one last story about like primal cooking. Yeah, cuz I've been camping a couple times

750
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:46,200
No, it's like we get like a log fire going and you know the the obvious like marshmallows is like nobody fucking does that

751
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,240
What we used to do was we got like um

752
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:54,040
We got like a potato and we wrapped it in tinfoil and we just threw it in the fire

753
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,320
And and and sweet corn as well

754
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:03,720
Mm-hmm. I remember making egg bread out in the woods and I don't know how we did that eggie that was strange

755
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:10,840
Oh, yeah, eggie bread is like when you when you get an egg and you whisk it up and then you dip the bread in the egg

756
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,640
Because they're mortal enemies

757
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,260
No, nothing

758
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:29,600
You call them french fries chips they come chips. Oh, right. Well, no, I know that we have

759
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:36,560
We have for it. We have fries, which are like this thin like McDonald's things. Yeah, but then chips are like chunkier

760
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,880
So chips are the good fries

761
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,960
So you go so when you go to McDonald's when you go to McDonald's you order fries not chips

762
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:52,320
Yeah, well, they they ask that that's they've always been like an Americanized restaurant chain. They don't change

763
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:01,600
With cheese winners the metric system that's what fucking pulp fiction talked about so I think well

764
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:06,960
That's just the name but but I mean this I mean in Japan. They have whole different sandwiches and shit at McDonald's

765
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:15,200
Yeah, fucking bizarre we got spaghetti. Are we done are we done talking about cooking now should we

766
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,480
Away like nothing

767
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:26,480
Yeah, I mean not I don't know anything I was gonna ask if like okay

768
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:33,640
If each of you guys had to recommend to our fair audience something for them to cook. Oh, what would you recommend? Oh, right?

769
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,380
I recommend. Oh, is that hard to make though, Ben? How do you make that?

770
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:44,980
You just fucking get some you know, I mean you coated in some egg and some flour and so whatever the hard you could coat it in

771
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:48,580
Like anything you want you just cut anything you got a fire

772
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:52,740
You just fucking deep you get a deep fryer. Can't you just make it in a pan?

773
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:57,620
I'd like 20 bucks. You can put oil in a saucepan and deep fryer thing. Yeah

774
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:06,020
Here's my recommendation if the way that I described the way I cook and the things I eat sounded interesting to you dear viewer

775
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,540
Like what I like to call it is the water saute

776
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:15,980
Which is like to do the kind of meals I mentioned with the chicken and the you know the carrot and the mushroom and the spinach and just

777
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:20,940
Instead of using oil just use like water and just like keep that's steaming

778
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:28,500
I know I know it's steaming but instead of like having a thing like where like you know

779
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:33,940
There's water beneath it and you know the steam comes up like you're cooking chicken like you put the chicken in there when this chicken is like

780
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,760
50% cooked that's when you can add the carrots when everything is like 98% done

781
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,400
That's when you could put on the the spinach because that's just shrivels up really quickly

782
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,480
But yeah, like it is basically a saute in my opinion because it's all like in a thing

783
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,440
It's not it's not just steam you're using water

784
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:54,920
Just keep adding water and then you can just like basically eat stuff that I think tastes pretty good with basically like no

785
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:01,240
Like you know shitty things for you, you know, there's not even any butter or oil, right? It's just like the fat of the chicken

786
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,360
So that's my recommendation

787
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,640
My recommendation would be just think of something you've always wanted to know how to cook

788
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,720
Google it get the ingredients and just cook it with your phone

789
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,440
Where you can keep track of every single thing you have in your fridge and it'll like algorithmically like pick out like recipes

790
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,440
Oh, no fuck that true

791
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,600
I hate regimenting things like that

792
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,040
I'd rather just like be like on a whim like I want to learn how to cook a Spanish omelette

793
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:39,360
I Google Spanish omelette recipe and then I just make it and I just look at my phone. It's great

794
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,480
You got a guy have that adversity like oh, you gotta look in your fridge and be like, oh, what's here?

795
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,440
It's not a whole lot here. I guess I guess there's no but like it's I can do make this

796
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:53,200
I mean, it's it's intimidating the idea that you're supposed to just become like a person who

797
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,400
Inherently knows what you need to put into a thing

798
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,960
I think if you want to get into cooking start by learning recipes and eventually you'll figure out that you yeah

799
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,560
Like what you can you know, how do you know what you can change about a risk?

800
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,760
Yeah, sure watch chopped all the time

801
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:15,440
How do you like how do you learn how to play guitar like if you want to be like an excellent like jazz guitarist?

802
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,640
Like the first thing you do is you like learn to play like a song and then you like look up

803
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,960
Exactly what to do and then as you go. Yeah, just kind of learn like okay

804
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:31,240
So I've learned I've learned you see repeating patterns of how songs are and cooking is similar to that in the sense of the the way

805
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:36,320
You can like you know extrapolate and apply things in different ways and all that kind of stuff. So yeah

806
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:40,640
Let me say you could you could go and learn how to like make a sauce, you know

807
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:47,240
And like go to the roots of like don't just buy prego try to make sauce and then you'll see like how things go together

808
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,720
You know and how things are actually made in

809
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:55,760
In the cooking world indeed Tom, can you speak for like three minutes straight so you earn your $30?

810
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,520
Is gay

811
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,720
I've had nothing to contribute to this topic at all

812
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,400
Well fair enough

813
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,760
Okay

814
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,240
Just make a fucking steak. Here's what you do. Here's what you do

815
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:20,400
You just put on a fucking steak and you move it with your hand you move it with your hand

816
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:25,800
Oh, no, no, you scrape a steak and you just fucking pick it up

817
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,680
Wait, wait, you don't even you don't even like pick it up like like from the top

818
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:34,080
You scoop it up with the burning oil in the pan and you slather it all over your fucking face

819
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,160
I'm

820
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,560
Literal cooking tip when you put when you're cooking a steak and you put it down in the pan

821
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:47,360
Never move it well not never but like don't move it around to cook it because you need to let the the skin like

822
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:51,400
Crisp up and harden and when it slides around on its own then you can flip it

823
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,160
Oh, if you move it around it likes it'll like break apart and it'll be gross

824
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:01,760
Moisture in there. I always want to move my food around when I'm watching it cook. It's a bad. It's not stakes

825
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:07,760
It's a bad idea. Okay. You're supposed to like you're supposed to like make steaks in the pan and the frying pan

826
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,760
And then I put it in the oven, right?

827
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,640
Real estate

828
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:19,080
Has everyone laid out their food recommendation? Well, no, we're in the middle of it got to I know I know like once this is done

829
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,080
That's basically it. I

830
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,760
Don't know maybe it anyway

831
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,200
All right, just just checking

832
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,960
Why were you talking about wait?

833
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:45,880
Here's here's my cooking recommendation don't do it. Here's this is this is what I'm saying

834
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:56,320
Money and you won't have to do it anymore. I mean that's just get better at your job and make more money

835
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,680
I mean, that's a good recommendation too, but here's what I'm actually saying. Here's my real recommendation

836
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:06,600
I cooking is nice and I like the communal aspects and all that stuff, but better than that is

837
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:13,480
Like saving any time that currently is used cooking so my recommendation is to those

838
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:21,040
asshole soy boys out in you know fucking the West Coast that makes soil and whatnot make a real version

839
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,040
that's not some gay soy shit and

840
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,780
So that I can be a man and made a pure animal product puree

841
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Invent a new thing that

842
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,680
Wait, I'm shattering the fucking paradigm right now

843
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,940
Break out of the box. There's a soil and competitor called a hue fuel with an H and it has

844
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,360
No, so you say thank God

845
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:52,280
I mean, I don't I don't the soy is not actually a problem, but like I don't know what like the new I have not looked at

846
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:57,720
Like the nutritional facts here. Here's what I want. It's not the size of the problem. It's the boys the boys in that soil

847
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,720
That's a problem. Listen. It's the

848
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:05,960
I want a slurry. I can just chug at any moment of the day and I just want to be able to

849
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:12,480
I don't give a shit is it is like an IV drip of vitamins in

850
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:18,680
Literally what I want. That is exactly what I want. I fuck eating. I'll literally give it up. I don't care

851
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,680
I just want enough to worry about it

852
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,680
Have you tried pissy baby food?

853
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:34,400
Suckling I would not be perhaps I fucking I fucking would not be surprised if there's like an adult baby food

854
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:42,760
Pedialyte pedialyte that like yeah, yeah, have you seen recently on Twitter?

855
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,520
They're rebranding it that it's not just for babies because they want

856
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:58,920
That's literally their their their slogan is not just for babies. Oh my god. This ain't your daddy's baby food

857
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,960
By the way, I don't believe there's any ABDL food yet because the ABDL like

858
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:10,800
Yeah, well because like the companies that supply like products and like merchandise for that

859
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,300
I don't think they have quite the supply chain yet to like have like refrigerateable and like

860
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:20,660
Just eat baby food. Yeah, I didn't I didn't particularly mean it as like like an RP thing

861
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:26,860
I mean it was like as a thing as a Nate thing like I want just a slurry of like protein enough for an adult

862
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,860
I'm the real ABDL

863
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,820
That's so that's my record

864
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,700
Yeah

865
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:40,860
Have the brain the size of a fucking mountain in this baby's body

866
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,300
Wide and

867
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:11,460
Cooking right the reason why I was trying to like figure out like how much more we have to say is because yeah

868
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:16,820
Okay, it seems like we're basically wrapped up with food, but I kind of talk about kitchens specifically

869
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,820
I don't know if we should save that for a later episode

870
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:25,900
We're right right right up down time I think here's the main issue for me wait

871
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:30,180
We we've only been going for an hour, but we've got we've got segments to get to we've got

872
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,700
I mean if we go for 50 more minutes, that's perfectly fine with me. I got no problem with that

873
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:45,140
The people want the kitchen rent give us the kitchen rent in all caps. Yeah 10 minute video and it has monetization on

874
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:48,700
Oh, true. So, you know, here's the thing about kitchens, right?

875
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:53,260
I have had a lot of different kinds of kitchens in my life like for you know

876
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:57,620
And what I found what surprised me is that this little rink eating kitchen

877
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:04,780
I have in my new apartment is by far the best kitchen experience. I've ever had which surprised me so a

878
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,140
Kitchen my family's kitchen in the in the house

879
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:12,220
We live in the nice big old house that we bought specifically because we're an older family, right?

880
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:17,380
The kitchen there is too fucking big. It's like a whole section of room

881
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:25,380
That is like a kitchen and I totally took for granted the fact that doing anything is a pain in the fucking ass

882
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,380
It's like oh shit forgot the milk

883
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,380
Yeah

884
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,940
Renting

885
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:37,100
Football field like honestly if I were to sprint the amount of breaths

886
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:41,420
I took would be accurate to the amount of fucking space. Oh shit. I forgot this spice

887
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:47,860
Spice, you know, it was just pain in the fucking ass and then like oh, what's up hippo?

888
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:51,060
Well, I was my kitchen has like um

889
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:57,540
And it currently is it's got like the the two sides, but then there's like an island in the middle of the room

890
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:02,540
Yeah, so like you don't need to go very far. You can just make a 180 to get anything

891
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:04,540
I don't like the islands at all

892
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:12,820
Like constricted and if there's something that you want that's on the opposite side of the island

893
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:18,380
It's basically like a fucking like Odyssey to get there and back, you know, it's a it's a small enough island for that

894
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:20,540
But like I mean it works well, right?

895
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:25,040
So my mentality towards kitchens is obviously like crafted under the

896
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:30,020
Situation of basically just making food for me and my fiancee so like I don't have a family yet

897
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:32,740
So a small kitchen is perfectly fine, right?

898
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,940
And like yeah, yeah, my family's kitchen not only was it big

899
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:41,180
But like it was laid out in a way where it was like almost like two or three different like sections and so yeah

900
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,500
The kitchen I'm at right now

901
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:48,980
It's like all in one spot and almost nothing is more than two steps away from anything else, right?

902
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:52,180
It's like there's the sink and then the stove is right behind it

903
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,100
So I barely even have to move anywhere

904
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:58,900
It's like it's like I am the fucking guy from a spirit of the way with all the arms like controlling the furnace

905
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,940
It's just like I don't even have to like move that much. It's super cool, right?

906
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:08,940
So I would say one of the better kitchens I'd had that I've experienced is the kitchen at the how at the bro house

907
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,260
You know their last name mr. Bro

908
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:15,820
It was a cool kitchen, you know, and it was laid out like in a circle

909
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:17,580
So like everything you didn't have to walk too far

910
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:24,940
The only problem with that kitchen is that everything about it was fucking dying the light. Yeah, I had a good light

911
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,820
I would have ranked it as probably the second best kitchen I've had

912
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,980
Except it goes down a couple ranks because it wasn't maintained well

913
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:36,540
So like it has a nice like a fluorescent light because I think fluorescent lighting is like nice and relaxing

914
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:39,580
Which I guess is the opposite of how it should be. I don't know what's wrong with me

915
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:42,020
But the light went out like a couple of times

916
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:48,100
So most of the time it was like we were using this shitty little like study lamp for the fucking kitchen at night

917
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,780
Which made it kind of like disable and depressing which was kind of cool

918
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:56,280
Especially when you're cooking with Ben, it's like yeah having like depressing cooking time. You know what I'm saying

919
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,300
But then also like the electricity around the whole house was like kind of fucked

920
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,300
So like I had bought like an electric kettle so I can make myself tea

921
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:12,820
So I can make myself like coffee and those little instant coffee pots, but it fucking zapped my goddamn electric kettle

922
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,540
Probably because it was a cheap $20 one

923
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:19,300
But the point is I spent the rest of my well those things also draw a lot of power and you're not supposed to plug them in with

924
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:22,740
Other shit that may have happened. It's supposed to be like it has to be on like its own circuit

925
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,500
Oh, I didn't know that I will keep that in mind because yeah

926
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:30,060
So basically I spent the remainder of my eight months there like just cooking it on the pot

927
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:34,220
And then like forgetting about it and overflows and like shade would come in be like oh you've got your

928
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:37,380
For your water and I'm like I remembered when I had my own water

929
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:42,460
My electric kettle would turn off automatically and then let's see what else like oh

930
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:46,780
Well then there was the dishwasher, but the dishwasher died

931
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:53,540
Literally the same day I moved in and it wasn't repaired everything was fucking right it died the same day

932
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:57,620
I moved in so I never used it and it was only repaired like a week before I moved out

933
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:03,420
And so the thing is is that there was water in there and the water just stayed there the whole time

934
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:07,100
I lived there and every couple of months. I'd be like I have to do it

935
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,220
Okay, mold it all right

936
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:14,620
You know I would do that like every couple months and then the coup d'et gras of this of this kitchen is that the sink clogged up

937
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:18,060
The the garbage disposal wait there was never a garbage disposal there

938
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:22,300
Oh, there was a garbage disposal there it stopped working and the stink the sink clogged up

939
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:26,980
And if only I had known what was coming like the stink is right right right?

940
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:30,380
So it just sort of built up and then like food just food ish water

941
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:37,060
Like just stayed there and it took like two days to drain and it just felt like total ass like Ben's crock pot

942
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:42,340
Malfunction was nothing compared to this like the last entire month of being in that kitchen

943
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:48,740
It wasn't a misfunction so much as malpractice right now practice. Yeah, yeah, I'll practice and nobody doing anything

944
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,740
Yeah, why are you standing as a bummer?

945
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:56,020
Because it was basically like how do you have a kitchen without a fucking sink?

946
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:00,620
That was the question that we all had to figure out so like I had so much processed food that month

947
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:05,660
Like I had lost like fucking like probably 30 to 40 pounds while I was there because I was eating

948
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:11,060
Water sautees and also like not eating a whole lot because I had a broken ankle twisted ankle

949
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:13,820
I just didn't get up much so like I just lost a lot of weight

950
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:17,940
But I gained a lot of that weight back right before coming back because I was eating so much processed food and just like avoiding

951
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,940
the sink the whole time so it was sort of like a

952
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:25,980
The whole situation in the kitchen was just sort of falling apart in us in a death spiral the same way as like everything

953
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:30,740
Was then so it's pretty cool. Definitely like top-keck memories. I would say

954
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,900
But I'm glad to have a normal kitchen that just does shit now, you know

955
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,020
that whole arc was like it was it was like a

956
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:44,360
Sort of a waking nightmare, but also like a perfectly aesthetic experience to have in like your early to mid

957
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,580
With all these dudes

958
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:02,620
Guys yeah, I want you all to know that while diva was telling that story

959
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:08,380
There was plenty of time for me to master the blade which I have now done which I have now

960
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:12,760
Accomplished were you in the dojo? I was I would well and well no

961
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,700
I've long since mastered the blade in in a variety focus cop killers terms

962
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:21,300
But this there's a little kitchen knife that was in my kitchen that I've got it's got a little sheath

963
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:27,260
It's got a little sheath here, and I want you all to know that I've been practicing E. Ido during this entire podcast

964
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:34,500
The eye the art of the quick draw you see and I have now become a full-fledged level 99 master

965
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,460
That's what I want. Yeah, now you know now, you know

966
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,220
My my kitchen is pretty good. It's kind of it's pretty like compact

967
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:46,700
I can easily get anything the only problem is that it's so compact and I live with so many people yeah

968
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,860
Whenever I'm cooking something they're always trying to get something out of the fridge

969
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:55,820
I hate that and they're all sweating and heaving and fucking vomiting all over me

970
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:58,260
And they've all got their bodies pressed up against me

971
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:02,700
It's the worst when I come downstairs during the week days and my 4-chain uncle is there because I know okay

972
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:06,620
Got a timer 4-chain uncle five minutes before he starts talking to me

973
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,780
So I have to run downstairs

974
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:13,300
I have to like get the the butter in the in the pan as fast as possible turn that shit all the way up

975
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:17,780
Get some fucking eggs in there, and then like always like as I'm about to put the eggs in the plate

976
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:20,940
He's like so I was reading this book about Ramo the other day

977
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:29,100
Yeah, yeah, I didn't mention that that was one of the things that drove my neatism and wanting to like like sleep

978
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,860
It weird times and like making food on my own terms to not be in the kitchen with anyone else

979
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:35,780
Especially when I'm a fucking angsty teenager. I'm like oh, oh

980
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:41,420
What's that you needed to get like a thing out of a shell that's near my torso area

981
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,420
Okay, yeah, go ahead just be

982
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:51,460
For you be within three feet of proximity to me. Yeah, sure. I'm not like trying to like what's hold yelling here

983
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:57,980
Go ahead do it. It's so awful. Oh, oh, it's like trying to draw when people around. Oh, yeah

984
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:03,100
Yeah, yeah, and I think I think I've mentioned this on the previous episode also like looking for something and if your mom is there

985
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:07,940
She's just like what are you looking for? I don't think we can find it together. No, no, I don't know

986
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:16,940
I'm looking for something. I can't find it. What I would do is pretend to be finding stuff constantly

987
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:20,660
So that I don't look like I'm having an issue so she won't ask who I'll be like

988
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:28,540
Open shelf. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, open up drawer. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah

989
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:32,940
I think what I actually did was I just was so weird that she was just too scared to approach me

990
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:36,860
But you know, I got the results I needed right she didn't fucking ask me what I'm looking for right

991
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:39,140
That's practicality

992
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:44,100
The same thing when I was living at home or like half the time like I want to cook

993
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:48,580
But I so didn't want to be around anywhere where anyone would look at me or talk to me

994
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,580
Yeah, I just wouldn't do exactly

995
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:54,540
Wait till everyone else is gone. Yeah, you will you avoid your parents? Oh, yeah

996
01:23:54,540 --> 01:24:00,020
Yeah, I don't want my parents to be like, oh what inspired you to cook today. Are you not or you're not gonna cook ever again?

997
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:02,020
Yeah

998
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:11,100
Even more the kind of oh what you doing like did you just told me that you would go around into the backyard to go

999
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,500
Into the garage to then come out the garage door when you come home

1000
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:20,500
So that it looks like instead of coming home you just came from the garage so that your dad wouldn't ask where you go when you were out

1001
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:26,460
Which is I would right. Yeah, that's me even though. It's not like I was out doing anything

1002
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:32,480
I just have I just I would have the intense anxiety that anyone would talk to me and because I get so like

1003
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:38,620
The I used to be very frustrated when I was trapped at home. Right. It just like when I'm angry

1004
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:41,220
I know if I if anyone tries to ask me something

1005
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:44,060
I'm just gonna like give a every action that they're not like

1006
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:48,780
So I just like want to avoid all back in this like one like period of

1007
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:52,760
Teenagernessness where before I had to work, but when I had to clean the dishes

1008
01:24:52,760 --> 01:25:00,100
I would just be like, oh, I'm not doing them in right after breakfast. No, not doing them after dinner. No, I do them at 3

1009
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:03,920
Fucking a.m. So like it was in the house where the kitchen was far away enough, right?

1010
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,360
So I would just like ah, it's 3 a.m. Fucking perfect, right?

1011
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,500
And I would just like put on podcasts or whatever and it's like, ah

1012
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:16,800
Everyone's asleep. I'm completely alone. I could watch all the dishes. It was beautiful

1013
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,000
I think that was probably why I like washing dishes to this day is because that was a good experience

1014
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:27,760
Just being completely alone. No one's gonna talk to me the whole the whole like thing with not being like wanting to start a

1015
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Conversation with somebody but so you avoid like the places where people would

1016
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,680
Likely be is probably the reason I to my brothers always just start like if we see each other

1017
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,320
We say nothing we say like a weird

1018
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:48,620
Acknowledge like each other's presence without having to say so

1019
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,140
How you do it like we avoid that by being fucking strange

1020
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:56,980
That's what me and shade do every time we see each other me and shade just go like

1021
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,820
Me and my brother know exactly the kind of things that makes us uncomfortable

1022
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:08,140
So like if something awkward happens one basically the way we do it is we go, huh?

1023
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:11,740
I can't believe you just did that like well like like if something wrong happens

1024
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:18,060
You'll imagine like what is the worst possible thing someone could say to judge you and we'll just like say that judging thing like jokingly

1025
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:22,860
And it like relieves the tension right and then like I can't stop doing it with other people

1026
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:27,940
So people think I'm being super fucking rude right or like if something awkward is happening instead of trying to like be like

1027
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:33,540
Oh, man, are you okay? Because it's like that pisses me off when someone says that so my brother's always just like ha suffer, right?

1028
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:39,860
I just sort of like do that to other people and other people are like what the fuck you like you make it fun to me

1029
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:43,460
I'm like no, I'm just I'm just I'm just telling you to suffer

1030
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:52,980
It's always awful when you're like downstairs and you're doing something and then and then your parents begin with so

1031
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:56,620
And you know are all right. What's the lie? I have to say this time

1032
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:01,620
What do I have to fit what I have to stretch the shoes to make sure that they do not ask any more questions?

1033
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:06,940
This is what concentration camp. I have to make sure that they don't ask any more questions after this

1034
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:10,980
Yeah, what concentration camp can I be shipped off to to avoid this kind?

1035
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,180
Yeah, I would do anything to avoid

1036
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:20,580
The way I sort of dealt with that yeah, is that I try to like have answers to questions

1037
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:26,860
They're likely to say and say them before they can so that it so that it feels like I'm being yeah

1038
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:30,420
And then they don't feel the need to ask that much

1039
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:35,180
I think we're kind of cannibalizing the future PCP episode about like dealing with talking to your parents

1040
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,740
But yeah, I do want to say like since we've already just cannibalized most of it

1041
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:44,580
Like it was a weird like I think the most coming-of-age thing about me was deciding to stop watching TV with my family

1042
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:50,540
Because they wouldn't stop watching fucking cop drama shows and it's been fucking 14 years since and then they still haven't stopped

1043
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:54,220
So I was just like I'm done. I don't want to keep watching movies with you

1044
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:59,620
I don't want to keep watching TV and my dad was legit offended because like for like the modern 21st century man

1045
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:05,000
There's no more wars to fight no more fucking boars to stab no more fucking minorities to fucking

1046
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,480
Like kill right there's no more manly things to do well

1047
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,960
We just don't have the excuse anymore

1048
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,560
Except to fucking watch TV

1049
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:17,240
It's the only thing dads have left that and grilling but like it's true

1050
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:21,160
And so when you stop watching TV because your parents have shit taste in shit

1051
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,640
And you just want to be on the internet where everything is much better

1052
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,480
My dad was just like why why aren't you watching this movie?

1053
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:32,360
And he finally like two movies in a row that I refuse to watch he was just like fine. Don't watch the movie

1054
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,360
I mean, he

1055
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:43,120
Once he got the message he he never bugged me about it again like my parents they they fucking understood that

1056
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:49,600
I'm an anti-social recluse and they got it eventually, but like it was really funny and I didn't you know being 14 at the time

1057
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,800
I didn't have the emotional depth to understand what I was doing the way I do now

1058
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,400
It's probably like like write him a fucking apology actually

1059
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,800
Even though

1060
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,200
What say is a real millennial thing

1061
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:05,000
I don't know if any of you will get this and and if someone were to say this to me

1062
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,760
I would make fun of them as well

1063
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,600
But I know it is true and I have noticed it in my life

1064
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:17,240
Whenever I'm like in the car or something and I have my headphones in and my family tries to talk to me

1065
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:22,720
I just cannot like I cannot express the deep like I don't describe it

1066
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:29,760
Like guttural like primal feeling of rage that I get I have headphones in I don't want to talk to you

1067
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:37,320
Leave me alone. I'm looking out the window and blasting music. I obviously don't want to talk to you about my day

1068
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,720
Please stop mom, please. Yes

1069
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,400
Yes

1070
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,640
Well, that's one of the joys of moving out and getting away from your parents

1071
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:49,000
Yeah, you get to mellow out and not be pissed off at them like 100 yeah

1072
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:52,120
For absolutely no yeah, yeah, there's like no

1073
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,960
No, yeah, I can't wait

1074
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:57,960
I can't wait to like come go back home to my family and visit them and be like cook with them

1075
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:02,960
You're like, oh you want to like get a thing in front of my shelf three feet around right like around my general area

1076
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,200
I'll be totally fine with it and I'm just gonna be like oh

1077
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:13,800
I can be around human beings and I don't feel like a wound up stress ball ready to pop brilliant

1078
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:19,160
Indeed exactly. All right. It is really fun the end

1079
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:25,040
Yeah, and a munchie. No cooking is not fun. It's over is what cooking. Oh, yeah

1080
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:29,480
Well, what do you say this slams head into grill and sizzled to perfect

1081
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,040
Now that's what I call alchemy. Oh

1082
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,240
Only a one in a billion. He's very rare

1083
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:45,440
Hey, well team. I will you so that's the end of our of our main show I mean course

1084
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:52,180
Damn, yeah, it's let's let's let's prepare this one. Well a base

1085
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:57,920
Good. All right. Here's what we're doing team. Here's what we're doing. We're not going straight into questions

1086
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,320
We're doing a couple of things where we're trying out some new shit, but here's the first of all so this PCP theme

1087
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:09,440
Contest thing is still happening and you've all been a colossal failure

1088
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:20,280
Because we have proof that that's not true because we do still have that one submission that I mentioned last episode

1089
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,880
So we're gonna play it right fucking now on the show. We're all gonna listen to it

1090
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:30,480
I wait from it's from our boy AJ Shoup and if you if you think you can do better

1091
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:35,080
Yeah, invite you to try you fucking coward indeed hashtag

1092
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:40,520
PCP theme send it to us on Twitter or if in the discord if you're the patreon, that's fine, too

1093
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:45,120
But send us this shit cuz we're this is not a failure. This is real

1094
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:51,720
This is for real. I swear dad. I'm I'm actually able to pay my bills with my internet career. It's not a joke

1095
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:56,200
It's not fake. I don't have to live off food stamps. I actually will make something on my life. I'm not desperate

1096
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:59,280
I'm not a failure. Munchie play the song

1097
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,600
Play the song

1098
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:09,440
You are a robot Nazi techno state Jesus Christ. Okay. All right. Here we go

1099
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:16,480
I'm just gonna be work to death day-in day-out without an extra pay to be the robot slave holder here. That's right. Here we go

1100
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,960
Yeah

1101
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,480
Oh

1102
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:54,360
What happened in rad con 17 like montage, you know what I mean?

1103
01:32:55,240 --> 01:33:00,800
AJ that was excellent. Yes, pretty much like that a lot. Yeah, and it's kind of

1104
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,960
I don't think it has the right tone to be an OP though

1105
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,400
We could we could shorten it to make it like a very

1106
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:14,140
Tone of it doesn't like make me doesn't feel opening to me

1107
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:19,800
Let me let me can I can I share an anecdote with you guys about the creator of that of that jingle?

1108
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,560
Yeah, please so the other day so the other I was making a new discord and I got carried away

1109
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:30,360
Invited pretty much everyone. Yeah, everyone on my friends list into this new discord, right?

1110
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:35,520
And it became you know it wrap it spiraled out of control and I had no idea or you continue your anecdote

1111
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,520
I have an anecdote about your anecdote

1112
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,280
Okay, Ben is a recluse

1113
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:46,400
Ben is not someone who goes out of his way to like talk to people at least from my perspective

1114
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,520
He does not like initiate conversations about anything that aren't awful

1115
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,600
When I get like a

1116
01:33:55,120 --> 01:34:00,800
Discord link like a link from him out of the blue like like just just you know one damn on my phone

1117
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:07,440
And there it is a discord link and then he sends the same link again two times in a row not saying anything

1118
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:14,960
Yeah, I was too soon. He's like hacked or like so he's like like like some sort of sleeper agent for the Russian government

1119
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:21,520
My mind and and now he seems sort of like Islam bomber or this is like some sort of like suicide stunt

1120
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,120
Where he just needs to be doing this and he's in a giant like group call and sick. All right guys

1121
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,120
This is it. I'm going to kill myself live on air

1122
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,680
I get blood to my kick started to kill myself

1123
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:40,000
Shock of anxiety that runs up my spine when Ben sends me a link to something without saying anything that that's how I feel

1124
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,640
When I talk to you, I mean it was funny that both you and mage were like really concerned and I was just like well

1125
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:49,480
Of course Ben would do this. Like of course, you just like randomly make a chat and then like not explain it at all

1126
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:54,080
Okay, so so go on. Okay, so I said so I invited everyone on my friend

1127
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,920
I just like spammed invites to basically everyone. Yeah

1128
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:01,960
Um, it everyone jumped in it it spiraled out of control. I had no idea what was going on

1129
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,440
And I was like, you know what nevermind so I didn't delete it

1130
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:07,520
But I just left it for a while a couple hours later. I

1131
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:14,600
Well like later that day at my discord account got deleted or got deactivated because of spamming because I had

1132
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,880
Done this it got reinstated today. So it's all fine

1133
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:22,040
But for a while I was dead and I and I couldn't keep up with what was going on in there a couple hours after I made it

1134
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:28,440
I just happened to see AJ Schoop say mod me. So I did then my then my account gets gets deactivated

1135
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:35,120
Two days later, it gets back. I come back in I look and now I see that what I think I created the there's like a

1136
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:43,200
Space station like aliens like roleplay like bot thing going on like there's like there's like commands and stuff

1137
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,640
It's like a mini endless war, but like set in space or something

1138
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:53,860
Well, you are you are the the god in the religion of deism like you just created it then left and then like came

1139
01:35:53,860 --> 01:36:00,480
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't know what's going on there anymore. So is AJ responsible for this?

1140
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,880
I mean, I can only assume so I don't know

1141
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,040
Probably well sounds like there's two bends in the chat

1142
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,720
Huh?

1143
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,240
Is this why there's two bends currently in this chair

1144
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:17,760
Well, I'm the other one I made be when the other one my real account was was temporarily deactivated

1145
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:23,320
He will be dealt with that that road. Yeah, he will be sent to the school. I lost all of your slime

1146
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,000
How fucked up would that be?

1147
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,440
Well, I would have just had crack transferred or something. Yeah, it would have been fine

1148
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,080
It would have been fine. That's like as far as rowdy fuckers

1149
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:35,600
That's when you die in a Minecraft server and then you say your friend

1150
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:42,040
Like TPed me and your friends like no you have to walk back here. Those are the rules. I can't I can't cheat. It's like

1151
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,280
No moving on

1152
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:52,600
Okay, well, I mean that's our one submission right now was pretty fucking tight AJ nice job

1153
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:57,560
But we want more people we want fucking more. I demand more send more to us

1154
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,920
We want to play each one of these as the theme one after the other before the show

1155
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,920
It kind of like my way

1156
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:08,600
Like a whole album a whole album of PCP themes before the show every single

1157
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:14,480
Yeah, that'd be funny. I mean, yeah, just send more people you've heard it now. They're real

1158
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:18,320
We'll play them on the fucking show. So send them to us send them immediately

1159
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,440
Saying things on the show

1160
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:27,960
I think we're gonna start like reading comments or at least responding to general sentiments of comments on the show as well

1161
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:33,240
So if you want to be read or have the general sentiment of what you're implying or saying be

1162
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,960
Acknowledged by us

1163
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:41,760
I just imagine this the starry-eyed fans with their poster of us on their wall

1164
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:47,160
We like I can't wait. I dream for one day the general sentiment of what I think of their content to be

1165
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,920
But I mean but on that front other other new thing

1166
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:58,200
That'd be I don't know if this is what you were building to but we're talking to we want voicemails people

1167
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,000

1170
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:16,080
So it's got one of those don't make don't make a visual for YouTube video

1171
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,080
We're not gonna watch that. It's not what it's about. It's not what it's about

1172
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:23,480
And and to anyone to anyone who's listened to those podcasts

1173
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:30,560
Please do not simply import the biggest problem versus style of humor into the voicemails that you do come up with your own thing

1174
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,880
Yeah, it's funny. I don't care. Well, there's this very specific style

1175
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,240
I feel like some people might think it's just the default for voicemails. It is not it's just that universe

1176
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:42,880
We have our own sense of humor. We were original around here. We don't want to get copyrighted

1177
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I

1178
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,760
Happen to fancy myself quite derivative

1179
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:56,800
I fancy myself quite the sketch charm if you will but I don't think I've said a funny thing in my life

1180
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:04,360

1188
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,400
That aside it's time for the fan art

1189
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:55,160
Section of our program here fan art corner over the fan art corner hashtag PCP fan art PCP has such a visceral and

1190
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:02,440
Voluptuous ass it is back heavy and it is like super bloated now. That's what this entire show is gonna be

1191
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:07,720
Yeah, yeah, it's good. It's gonna be two hours of topic. It's gonna be eight hours, right?

1192
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,000
Maybe at some point if it gets bloated enough

1193
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:16,600
We'll just have like a like a bi monthly like fan response video. You know what I mean? Wait a minute wait a minute

1194
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,520
PCP mail time

1195
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:24,040
Guys, I there actually is another entrance in the PCP theme thing already

1196
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:30,760
No, I mean this is from May 29th. I'd like I just searched for hashtag PCB fan art and this came up

1197
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:37,000
Yeah, three days. Okay, let me let me get the fucking link. All right, hang on. Hang on. I will play it in the thing

1198
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:43,640
How the fuck does this got no work? Please fucking? Okay? Okay. Here it goes. Let me fucking

1199
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,380
Do the thing. I'm doing the thing. I gotta push the button

1200
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:53,500
Play this go punk bitch motherfucker

1201
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:04,380
I have AIDS

1202
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:19,380
I

1203
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:37,060
It's the PCP bitch

1204
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:44,740
You know what I think that was maybe a little better as like an ending song I mean, yeah, the slower

1205
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:53,540
Yeah, yeah, okay, I think I think the the do-do-do-do-do-do by the way be like while we're talking like and welcome to the procrastinators while

1206
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:59,740
It's playing. I think that's so sorry. I forgot to say that is from at Peter John death pay PJD. There you go

1207
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:05,500
So I can speak only for myself of the cheat sheet to getting a thumbs up on

1208
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:07,620
OP

1209
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:11,940
Entrance for me at least is what's in an OP Davoo. Tell us what's in an OP?

1210
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,720
To bring Jeff back to help us judge

1211
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:23,580
Join Jeff join that that server that got me fucking booted from this

1212
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:32,740
OP reference I was thinking oh, how would I impersonate Jeff? I guess yell and have a lisp. Oh shit

1213
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:39,540
That's already me. Anyway, so the way to get a thumbs up from me on your entry is focus on like really, you know

1214
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,980
pour yourself over tone and

1215
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:46,300
Catchy melody and like especially tone like what's the tone of an OP?

1216
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:50,180
What's gonna like make you feel like yeah listening to an episode right now because honestly

1217
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:56,940
I think there's very few podcast openings that make me that that feel right to me and don't put an emphasis possibly avoid

1218
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:01,860
Like showing off how many random things what the PCP you know in your audio clips

1219
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:05,780
Like I don't care how actually like dedicated level of a fan

1220
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:10,940
You are of the group for as far as I'm concerned someone who just like has the right musical sensibility

1221
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:16,380
But like has listened to like five episodes could very well be the one to decide to make the perfect theme

1222
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:22,500
Sure, sure. I mean, yeah, I like the the little clips of stuff in there

1223
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,180
But I guess I would say for a theme song

1224
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:28,740
I mean, it's possible that one of us could fucking die or whatever

1225
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:34,060
If that person was in the theme, I'm just saying I'm just saying right it's complicated

1226
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:38,220
I'd go without it if I would I would almost never

1227
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:44,140
Give the green light on a theme that has any audio clips like of us at all because I just I don't know

1228
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:48,820
But I just agree. I think it's cool. I would never like I like the audio

1229
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:57,940
Definitely almost certainly never hit the upvote on a theme that has like very clean

1230
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:01,380
Not even altered audio clips because then it's like what am I already listening to the podcast?

1231
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:03,380
It's just kind of like weird and dissonant for me

1232
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:09,580
I mean that opening I think is like starting with Digi like come on Digi's fucking dead. We all know this. He's out

1233
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:12,260
He's gone. This is just it's just weird to get

1234
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:15,300
Voice in a podcast thing. I'm not into it

1235
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:21,980
If you could get the voice of the PCP guy if you could interview PCP guy and get him to do the intro somehow

1236
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:25,460
You know enter the anime land and we'll actually know

1237
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,980
Does this back come on have an anime

1238
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:34,220
Let's spend the the next eight minutes coming up with funny voices for the PCP guy

1239
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,500
Hi guys, it's me the PCP guy

1240
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:41,340
Oh, that's it. No, we can't do it. We got one and done baby. There we go

1241
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:46,100
All right settled settled well true voice actor

1242
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:50,540
So, I mean that was it so okay, so those two are the contenders right now

1243
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:54,020
I gotta say between these two I'm leaning towards AJ because I just like the upbeat

1244
01:44:54,900 --> 01:45:00,460
Yeah, I really like both. I think for an opening. I think AJ's is more of an opening

1245
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:04,820
I mean fuck why don't we we can fucking use the first one to open and the second one for closet?

1246
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:06,820
We can use it all we can have it all

1247
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:11,140
Yeah, rid of the original fucking son. We can get rid of the original. It doesn't have to be gone forever

1248
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:14,700
I mean we could see I mean it's all it's like a million years old now

1249
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:20,540
I mean, I would yeah that that first one that we listened to I would use that as the ED sometimes

1250
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,820
That's as far as I would go

1251
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:27,940
Well, there you go. There you go. Well, hey, we keep sending people where this this whole thing we're figuring out

1252
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:34,340
We're role-playing sexually. We're gonna keep at it. Hey Victor. I bet you're glad that you stayed for this

1253
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:37,540
I'm sure you have a lot to say and I'm glad I think you're bet that you're glad you're here. I

1254
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:40,100
I am playing Fire Emblem Warriors

1255
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:44,380
And listening to the PCP, which I would do anyway

1256
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:47,540
Did you fucking hear the rumblings?

1257
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:55,580
Did you hear the ground fucking shake with this drop cuz I'm about to tell you and the audience all about the greatest game of the

1258
01:45:55,580 --> 01:46:00,060
Fucking century is out right now. Jurassic World alive

1259
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:09,500
Are you fucking serious? I'm coming in my pants. I know I'm the next all summer long

1260
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:14,980
I'm gonna be running up and down the street pots and pans banging on my neighbors doors

1261
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:21,900
Screaming for their first board and getting them to come out and play Jurassic World alive with me. I'm gonna be catching dinos

1262
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:24,460
I'm gonna be running from the cops

1263
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:27,100
And I'm gonna get that sweet ass

1264
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:32,180
Sores up on my sore ass and it's gonna be sick as hell

1265
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:36,340
Nice. I like the idea that playing a dinosaur catching game

1266
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:40,580
Mean like like in the game. You also have to avoid the police

1267
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:46,220
Oh, like oh, yeah, like a need for speed a cops and dinosaurs are dying

1268
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:50,220
I'm actually more dangerous than a t-rex. This is the police commission

1269
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:54,740
This is all real viewers click the show notes for it for some hot screen caps

1270
01:46:54,740 --> 01:47:00,820
Oh Jurassic World alive. It is fucking out and you better believe after the pockets. I'm gonna be running

1271
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:05,140
Sprinting down the street cash in those fucking dino

1272
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:14,420
It doesn't even look not it doesn't even look bad. I want to play. Oh, it's it's like a Pokemon go sword thing

1273
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:20,140
It's a ripoff of Jurassic World alive

1274
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,940
You know, this is this is very different

1275
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:31,140
I see this is the real shit. This is like Victor you like you like look how Florida smells

1276
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:33,140
You're like chlorine

1277
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:38,140
It's chlorine and come the game

1278
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:41,740
Yo, all right

1279
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:46,460
Fan art corner. Here we go. There's there's slim pickings. There's slim pickings once again

1280
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,900
I searched PCB fan art on the fucking

1281
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:53,140
In Twitter and there's like nothing. We're still building up here

1282
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:55,140
You know what there's infinite fan art of

1283
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:00,900
Endless war every day is a fucking torrent

1284
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:10,060
Day in day out. We're in the family because we care about them. It's a it's a vicious cycle

1285
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:16,980
It's a vicious cycle. We have the lore people draw the lore people expand the lore through their art and then that becomes new lore

1286
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:23,760
I am so fucking grateful for every single fan artist for the right. Okay, I'm going through

1287
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:30,880
I'm going through the archives right now saving every fucking piece that has not been archa. I'm going to I'm gonna be fucking putting them up in the

1288
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,520
Excellent

1289
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:36,840
It's all precious. It's all precious and part of the culture

1290
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:46,600
Like in like 10 years a fan who's like 11 years old right now is doing a lecture on a variety of cop killers to like his friends

1291
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:50,480
You know I'm saying we're gonna do one ourselves or even fucking even fucking yeah

1292
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:54,240
We got to beat that fucking kid to the punch. Well, okay. Here's the good news

1293
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,800
But all right much finish your point finish your point

1294
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:02,080
I'm not saying like like it's like nice to see fair just for the masturbatory like oh like here's my things

1295
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:08,120
Remember people are doing an aren't I hot shit, but it's just like it's so nice to be like aware of the fact

1296
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:13,400
You've made something that people like so much that they're willing to like waste their lives making stuff for it

1297
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:17,360
Yeah, of course kind of like kind of like we wasted our lives making it in the first place. Yeah

1298
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:21,640
Yeah, I mean ways exactly shout to no be retro pk and

1299
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:24,280
Oh god

1300
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:28,320
All right enough of this rowdy fuckers terrible bullshit. Here's the real deal

1301
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:35,160
There is one submission and it is glorious by Simsie. This is a 100% accurate depiction of me

1302
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,440
There is there he is

1303
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:49,000
That it's basically a chibi baka it's pretty close. What is this pencil get out of here pencil we've

1304
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,720
Digital only

1305
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:58,040
It's not it's a really good drawing that is

1306
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:07,760
He's got a picture here he should trace over this and computerize it and fucking digital art if I

1307
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,840
Digital or otherwise

1308
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,960
It's very solid to be in ASCII. They should be in ASCII

1309
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:23,520
And when you put it into a coder it will actually play a video game the ASCII is actually code

1310
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:29,960
You know you need it needs to have a fucking scan code so that you can scan and get best guy ever in Skylanders

1311
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Right, that's what this is

1312
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Fucking PCP amiibo

1313
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:44,360
Oh my god, that's cut like in two days check the red bubble. Hey. Hey some some guys linked like like old fan art of

1314
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:46,680
Like the the draw cast stuff

1315
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:51,320
I don't know if now here's like the right place to show them cuz like we get a lot of still fan

1316
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:54,720
I get a lot of dumps of draw cast stuff whenever a new draw cast comes out though

1317
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,720
So like to show all of them in a PCP is

1318
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:03,480
I'll tell you this yeah, we will show them on the draw cast themselves about that you fuck that's a good idea

1319
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:10,360
That's a good idea silly disheveled popper. Yeah, good. Good. Thank you. All right. Well, that's literally it for today

1320
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:12,240
There was one sketch

1321
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:18,160
Guys hashtag PCP fan art on the Twitter. I know you're drawing it. I know you're drawing it

1322
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:22,000
You're being a little shy you're being a little timid you don't want to show it because you want to get bullied by me

1323
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,240
It's almost like as soon as we asked for it. It dried up. I mean to a degree to a degree

1324
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:31,000
Yeah, cuz then they knew that we would actually be talking about it

1325
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,880
Cuz then they knew you would actually be commenting on it and like and they know that like Ben might comment on it

1326
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:41,200
And like Ben is like I mean I am also like most of us are pretty fucking like straightforward

1327
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:46,840
Maybe like this sucks or like here's why you suck or here's what sucks about you. Are you saying that they're intimidated of me?

1328
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,040
Yeah

1329
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:55,360
I mean we started doing that we started doing the segment because we were getting like a lot

1330
01:51:55,360 --> 01:52:01,760
We're literally on D platforming them by giving them a platform by showing their shit

1331
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:08,360
So you got you got nothing to lose people you got nothing to lose and everything to gain so

1332
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:13,520
Like fucking fucking nexus just made like a bunch of like best guy ever art like well

1333
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:16,400
He was doing is like me a math of a style challenge and it's fucking incredible

1334
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:21,580
It's just like the animation he did like holy shit. It's because people aren't connecting with the podcast to connect

1335
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:28,060
Yeah, individual hosts. I think that's it. I think that's it streams or I remain Ben from our right frickers cop killer series

1336
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:32,740
It's interesting care about the PCP anymore. That's all yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's what I'm getting as well

1337
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:39,220
But do it anyway, you know cuz we yeah cuz like rad cons don't happen enough like a rad con generated fan art

1338
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:41,220
That's true. That's for sure

1339
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:43,980
Um, right for when?

1340
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:47,420
Soon radcon for ASAP. Yeah

1341
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:50,180
All right, well, I guess that's it for that

1342
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:55,020
But but it's time for everybody's favorite part of the fucking podcast. It's time for the Q&A

1347
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:25,820
Asks, why does Vic hate wearing shirts so much? I've been wondering that

1348
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:29,620
Is it because you were all naked children when you were born?

1349
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:32,500
Vic oh

01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:37,620
He gone dead. Oh, I keep like sometimes I can't hear you guys for like 20 seconds

1351
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:41,140
Maybe I guess just connection. I think you just died as well. Yeah

1352
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:44,460
Okay, can you hear us Vic? Can you hear us? I don't ever know

1353
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:48,220
We'll never fucking know why it's wearing shirts so much

1354
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:51,860
I think just the Collins family are just naked children and they never stopped

01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:14,860
And all the buffalo burger there is pepper jack bacon and then you get witch's your sauce and a one-sauce and you drown it in it

1371
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:21,300
Right last I heard this was the munchie, but what all right? I guess things change. Okay, there you go. There you go

juice from a from a bottle of

01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:45,220
Maraschino cherries a couple of the cherries themselves and ice do you blend that you just mix it okay?

And the well, there's also the Ben my real name, which I don't even know why I'm not bothering to say because it's not even a secret

1381
01:55:54,340 --> 01:55:59,620
Whatever, it's a lame name anyway, but yeah, there's the real Ben or the fake Ben whatever you choose to believe

1382
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:01,740
Who is the real Ben?

1383
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:07,180
Hot coffee and chocolate protein powder

1384
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:16,660
I had that decadent to even like like acknowledge as true because it will just kill you

1385
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:21,980
Sometimes whatever I want to make a bin saying instead of having milk. I'll have orange juice. What?

1386
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:24,340
But dude, but dude you been yeah, I actually

1387
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:27,340
Why is that you they're both?

1388
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:29,140
How is that right?

1389
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:35,060
No, that's like the city. Yeah, I think it's with the cherry shit is it just sounds gross

1390
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:40,620
I mean, there's no milk. So it's not gonna orange in it. Do you put the orange in in addition to the cherry or instead of the cherry?

1391
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:44,620
No, right? No, no, no, no, no, yeah, both but there is no milk

1392
01:56:44,620 --> 01:56:48,780
There's no milk, but I gotta say I don't know if I've ever heard well, then that's just juicy fucking

1393
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:53,620
Ever heard you describe the bin sainte before but I actually recently just like a couple weeks ago

1394
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:57,700
Just like thought to put some chocolate protein powder in my coffee. So that's that's kind of

1395
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:07,300
Dude one time I was elevated through the ceiling and I had to repair my roof because of this energy drink

1396
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:09,060
I drank one time I

1397
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:10,260
It was okay

1398
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:16,500
I got a scoop of chocolate ice cream then I put in milk and like chocolate syrup

1399
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:21,660
I mixed that around then I put in two like Starbucks a double shot energy drinks into it

1400
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:28,540
I swirled it all around Jesus and I drank it and I could not stop I could not stop my wife asked me to stop

1401
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:30,540
I

1402
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:40,620
Um, I guess I guess that a fried Oreo with a with a Swedish fish flavored Oreo is is might be a Ben a Ben recipe

1403
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:41,980
Uh

1404
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:46,380
So yeah, I guess so I guess that would be called the red the red

1405
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:49,020
Let me well that red stain

1406
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:55,780
Do you remember my suit my Swedish fish addiction at anime expo? I do I do there was pictures of that and what not

1407
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:59,460
Well, here's here's another recipe that Ben cooked up

1408
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:02,620
I want to find what's another name for a recipe that would be Ben named

1409
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:09,060
What can we give one real quick like the the Ben Jaman sandwich the this isn't well, okay

1410
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,580
It's the I'm gonna call it a I'm gonna call it a

1411
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:20,460
Because I'm gonna call it a so ugly this is a so ugly and what it is. It is it is you take you know your your plastic case of

1412
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:26,220
Gummy vitamins and you melt it down into one solid puck. Yes, that's so

1413
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:32,160
Congealed gummy vitamins. Yeah, it's not even bad. It tastes a little metallic tastes a little like blood

1414
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:36,920
But it's quite delicious. Yeah, that's just your own mouth bleeding, but go on munchie

1415
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:43,060
I have a recipe called Ben's soul and you get nacho cheese and beer you put in a crock pot and wait

1416
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,560
And

1417
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:54,800
You know, you know, you know it's soul eater how like everyone's soul looks like a certain thing and you can like see it like

1418
01:58:54,800 --> 01:59:00,680
That's what Ben's soul looks like looks like that goopy film that crusted dry acidic death Valley

1419
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:04,000
You know cheese and beer melted crock pot

1420
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:14,680
Victor can you hear us? I'm trying to connect I can't can you still hear me? Yeah, now I can hear you now

1421
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:21,760
Yeah, okay. Well, did you have an answer the question from our boy about why you never wear a shirt or why you hate shirt so much

1422
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:26,800
I didn't I didn't okay, so it was no you may ask why does Vic hate wearing shirts so much

1423
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,880
That was a full question because shirts are hot and they fucking suck

1424
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:33,940
Clothes are stupid, and I wouldn't wear any clothes if I didn't have to I

1425
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,120
We're in a shirt right now

1426
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:43,080
I'm so against this. I feel the exact opposite way where whenever I'm forced to be naked to take a shower

1427
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:49,400
It's most uncomfortable like unpleasant experience of my entire life. I hate hat like I feel just defenseless

1428
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:53,400
I feel like if some animal were to come up and fight me I would lose if I don't have my

1429
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:58,960
I feel similarly it gives me like plus one defense. Why would I give that up? You know? Yeah? Yeah?

1430
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:04,920
Being naked is not like fun. It's overrated. I don't yeah

1431
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:11,360
I don't love being shirtless around other people sure sure fucking looking at like I hate attention

1432
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:21,760
It's the same fucking thing ever and I hate all the comments about about me and and the fact that I'm sure yeah

1433
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:26,440
Yeah, I also hate wearing a shirt because it makes me itchy and hot, and I'm always itchy and hot

1434
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:33,280
Understandable throw them on but I'm more used to wearing no shirt than I am wearing a shirt

1435
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:40,320
Actually, yeah, Victor you being around you with your shirt off is actually what motivated me to like stop fucking gay

1436
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:45,640
So that I can become like as unbellied as possible so that I can one day like just not wear

1437
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:49,000
Unbellied to say Finn right well

1438
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,600
I didn't quite work because I wasn't losing weight the correct way

1439
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:57,680
So I'm just like I want to fucking lose weight and like be somewhat fit just so that I can

1440
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:01,160
Not have a shirt around a higher percentage of society

1441
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:04,520
It would be fantastic, but even Victor here who's who's

1442
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:09,640
Significantly fit still doesn't generally not wear a shirt unless he's like at home

1443
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:13,080
I'm not nervous around people

1444
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:15,080
I'm just

1445
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:23,840
In here when I said I just make people uncomfortable and don't give a shit

1446
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:32,360
Like I don't mind not wearing a shirt around people

1447
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:35,720
But it obviously depends on who it is when it's a hot day

1448
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:42,240
I'll usually just like wear like a Hawaiian shirt open and that and no shoes and that that that feels good

1449
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:45,360
I like it. I like no shoes. No socks or shoes. Oh, yeah

1450
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:51,800
I'm coming right from California and wearing shirt is just like what to do. Yes sandals

1451
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:55,480
I'm wearing flip-flops every day when I come home. It's a ritual. I take off my shoes

1452
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:59,280
Take off my socks. That is ultimate pleasure that put on my sandals, and it feels great

1453
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:03,160
I also take off my pants, but I'm yeah, and the reason I feel up there

1454
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:05,840
The reason I feel like wearing no shoes is okay

1455
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:10,440
But like being naked is kind of you feel defenseless is because like when

1456
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:13,040
When you walk on your feet a lot

1457
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:19,920
They get tough they get the skin gets feels tough and you stop like yeah, you know if you walk on rocks a

1458
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,560
lot then you

1459
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:26,840
Will not get hurt get hurt so much with with don't wear a shirt a lot

1460
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:31,200
Then you toughen up like your skin and you become like you become like the thing

1461
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:33,560
You're like made of cement around your whole body, you know

1462
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:36,360
I'm not saying that that's what's happened what will happen

1463
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:39,960
But if you have like toned muscles, and you feel like your skin is tough

1464
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:46,960
It will feel you will feel like you already have like padded armor on yeah, okay rather rather than be like a weak like easily

1465
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:49,040
Pissable

1466
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:55,120
I feel like also it like even though the feet your feet and like legs are probably the limbs you're like maybe

1467
02:02:55,240 --> 02:03:00,760
Least in control they feel the most powerful, and they feel like the things that you could most easily attack someone with

1468
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:05,480
So you put your legs. They're weird. Yeah, your legs are your most powerful weapon

1469
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:09,320
That's true except for your cock of course can't beat the cock, you know

1470
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,440
Well, that has that's why it's physical and psychological

1471
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:19,120
She was single combo. It's that's true. Look out everyone duck down here comes a question from line slimes

1472
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:24,160
What would you change about your upbringing literally get castrated and that is not a joke

1473
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:29,080
But your testosterone levels though, they'll fucking plug

1474
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:38,160
Okay, if I just be a barra and have no dick that would be my ultimate dream, okay, okay here

1475
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:41,360
You know what I would have had more money

1476
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:49,040
Okay, what if but why what if you could you could get your dick chopped off and keep your balls having more money well

1477
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:53,840
Everything easier and you don't have to do. Yeah, I disagree money

1478
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:59,040
Everything is easy. I fundamentally disagree. No libido and just like it have enough you in phase me

1479
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,760
That would have made my life so much better. I would have

1480
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:07,080
Yes, having no libido. I think is what he's going for I would have want to have been poorer and

1481
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:13,000
Live in a more packed environment, so I could have interacted with more people so that I could

1482
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:20,360
Become like a like like like fucking like Steve Jobs his dad was like a Syrian immigrant and

1483
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:25,600
Like I don't think they were very well off at the time, you know, I haven't fucking looked at the point

1484
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:31,280
The what I'm just reading here is a tale of like when you're poor and it makes you scrappy and resourceful

1485
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,280
And you become a man faster

1486
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:38,880
It's not a fucking rule it just it is the thing about that is like when it when it works out

1487
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:44,000
It is such an unexpected thing that it becomes an event that people talk exactly exactly hippo

1488
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,940
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say like like it doesn't actually do that like sometimes

1489
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:54,360
Someone can become scrappy and escape from poverty, but that's the exception and like it's notable because it doesn't happen

1490
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:59,800
Right poor and being underprivileged is not like yeah a thing that like separates the week from the yeah

1491
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:03,160
It is a thing that makes people weak and disenfranchises them

1492
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:05,240
This is yet another like future podcast

1493
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:11,440
I'm just gonna like gut right now, which is the whole mentality of things going wrong can then be good

1494
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:16,200
It's like no things being good is good now. I know challenges. No fuck you guys

1495
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:18,200
You don't know what you're talking about

1496
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:21,600
You're right

1497
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:28,680
It's when people try to rationalize pain and suffering by saying what makes me stronger

1498
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:33,560
Here's the thing though if you don't have to actually shit if you don't have if you don't have to have pain

1499
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:40,120
We're at least not as much right you can still choose to get strong through your own will now

1500
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:44,520
I know there's plenty of people who will end up in why are you rich people so much more depressed

1501
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:52,160
It's because they have too much shit. I don't work hard. I don't trust any statistics that say as much and I do

1502
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:57,480
I'm pre-emptively saying I don't know stats on that and like so here's the thing right

1503
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:04,080
I got some stats. Let's say there are like there is a scenario where people probably get diagnosed with depression more often because

1504
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:06,400
I have more free time to put this way

1505
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:12,800
There's four scenarios right there's people who suffer and as a result they keep suffering and they become shitty people because they've

1506
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:20,900
Never had time to grow then there's people who suffer and then make something of themselves become excellent individuals. They they emerge from that

1507
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:28,300
That disparity from that difficulty and they become great then there's people who don't have to suffer and then don't become particularly

1508
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:35,740
Remarkable people at all. That's the third scenario the last one is people who don't have to suffer and become great

1509
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:44,060
Which do exist not every billionaire walking the earth today in their mega yachts was actually poor like you know like Bill Gates was not poor

1510
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:45,980
Right he wasn't like a billionaire

1511
02:06:45,980 --> 02:06:51,300
But he had like access to a fucking computer way before most people did and he made even more out of it

1512
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:58,580
That is the ideal scenario that you can actually become good because you want to become good because like what I see for most people most of my

1513
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:04,420
peers the the classic stereotypical millennials who don't know what to do with themselves generally in

1514
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:10,500
Proportion to how fucking like stunted they've been or hurt. They've been by shit not by how much stuff they have

1515
02:07:10,820 --> 02:07:16,460
All right, this does completely irrelevant because it doesn't matter. No one's asking you why you would be less privileged

1516
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:21,980
It's a question for each of us individually. I answered my fucking question here by saying that like

1517
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:29,980
Well, you don't know this is totally not irrelevant. You don't know my fucking life the point is I

1518
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:34,140
Grew up with you. Yeah, I'm talking to DeVue

1519
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:37,540
The point is when I got to be a certain age

1520
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:39,940
I figured out that I needed to work hard to get stuff

1521
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:45,220
I just didn't fucking figure that out until I was like 23 and if I had figured that out sooner

1522
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:48,020
I think my life would have been better. That's my whole point. So

1523
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:57,660
Yeah, that's true like you need like a you need like a push you see because I don't think my family's as well off as yours

1524
02:07:57,660 --> 02:08:02,580
Is is I had that I had basically the exact same thing and it was a push when I was like 18

1525
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:06,220
So, yeah, that was very advantageous to me. You're right. Well, that's what I'm saying

1526
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:08,540
Maybe that's my only point. Maybe you're fucking right

1527
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:11,780
Maybe I have the same kind of mentality as you I had to just get pushed

1528
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:14,420
It was just a little bit of a nudge and then I was fine from then on out

1529
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:19,940
I think everybody needs to get well a lot of people the pushing doesn't work the pushing becomes shoving and then it becomes

1530
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:20,500
struggling well

1531
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:25,220
It's it depends on the type like if you always have a good like if you if your parents say you should get a job

1532
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:26,140
We're gonna get you out

1533
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:30,700
I think if you're the type that's gonna work hard and realize that you need to work hard to achieve your goals

1534
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:33,740
I think yeah, but that will that's gonna happen pretty much. Yeah

1535
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:38,740
You're saying that it's all having more money is just gonna make you better poise to accomplish

1536
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:43,340
Well, but you're just saying that it's all nature and no nurture and I don't agree with that

1537
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:48,860
I don't think it's all nature. Okay. All right. All right. So I think what would probably because it's hard for me to say like

1538
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:54,440
How would it change by upbringing without it being a change to like individual people or like I'm trying to think of like

1539
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:59,660
Living situations and not people situations because there's a million ways I could think about people and interactions

1540
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:07,100
But like life style wise. Yeah, I would say if I were to like go use a time machine to turn me into more of a fucking art

1541
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:14,460
Monster I would say that my family somehow becomes extremely dead broke around the time

1542
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:18,420
I'm like 12 so the point that I have to like get a part-time job when I'm 14

1543
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:21,900
And therefore I would get the same push I got but like four years earlier

1544
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:23,420
Yeah, and that would give me a little bit of an advantage

1545
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:29,620
Otherwise, I can't really say because I'm really scared of like well obviously I want to be in an environment where I had lots of friends

1546
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:31,820
I'm like, but if I had friends growing up

1547
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:36,940
I might have never become anywhere near the person I am now and therefore would never like have any of the same thoughts

1548
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:40,860
I mean, it's in theoretically possible. You might have just become a way better person

1549
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:44,180
I wouldn't become a better person. You would definitely not be you though

1550
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:47,860
So it's basically saying that DeVoo would not exist. Right. Is that a plus?

1551
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:54,580
I would have changed that like my father would smash

1552
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:59,820
Destroy my shins with a 2x4 every day to strengthen them so that I could

1553
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:04,580
Like you mean like break them or something or like yeah smash

1554
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:15,460
Yeah, that guy that guy got it all figured out. I wish I was retarded. I wish I was autistic and retarded

1555
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:20,220
You know that means that you need to be mentally retarded as well so you can run really fast

1556
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:24,100
Oh, so that's what worked well for Forrest Gump. That's what worked out for him. He wasn't retarded

1557
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:27,160
He was just a little slow learned differently

1558
02:10:28,700 --> 02:10:36,940
What I like about removing my libidos that they probably would not change who I become in the sense that like I would probably still be in the PCP

1559
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:40,940
I just would have experienced less pain in my life. That's probably true

1560
02:10:41,740 --> 02:10:44,680
Yeah, I mean having a little sex drive is kind of hell

1561
02:10:45,460 --> 02:10:47,460
In general just in general

1562
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:53,180
Well, that's that there was another question. There was another pity question that I thought was

1563
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:59,840
Yeah, that was pretty good. Who was that again? Who is that question from again? That is from Lines Lines

1564
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:04,420
Not bad killer not bad slayms. Yeah. Yeah confirm killer a

1565
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:09,780
Confirm killer. Oh, that's good. Here's a here's a question from Never Paint. All right

1566
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:12,660
This is listen to the whole question before you respond, please

1567
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:20,300
It is uh, do you eat dried nasal mucus? What are your thoughts about it? Listen? Listen delicious disgusting

1568
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:22,800
It seems to be a very divisive topic

1569
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:30,900
Where I feel like this question is some kind of statement, but I don't know what the statement is this man is telling me

1570
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:34,380
Never paint here is saying that like there's a there's a hotly debated

1571
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:40,900
It's a contested issue whether or not it's good to eat and dried nasal. I guess he means boogers

1572
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:46,180
Yeah, it's when it's dry it's disgusting and you got to get rid of it. It's like eating a

1573
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:49,980
Ironic joke well

1574
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:57,780
I know I know that some people eat their own like they they they eat snot because it's in their throat

1575
02:11:57,780 --> 02:12:03,220
Well, that's fine. I mean, what can you do? I mean if it doesn't come out of your mouth then swallowing it is not eating it

1576
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:06,100
If in the in the past make any sense in the past

1577
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:10,540
I have no idea what anyone would do that. I don't understand us at all or relate to us at all

1578
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:16,220
What I don't know right that nothing to say however now my fiancee does in fact do this

1579
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:26,100
She has all sorts of tics like she knows she's like, you know like she's like

1580
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:30,380
She eats her like nails too, right? I'm like, you have to

1581
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:36,100
I mean, I mean, do you eat them? I mean, no, I don't I clip my nails

1582
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:41,600
So I don't get biting them that sounds like hell and then she also eats them. I'm like what the what and then like

1583
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:44,100
I don't eat the nails. I

1584
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:46,420
Like I like bite my nails

1585
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:50,140
Yeah

1586
02:12:50,580 --> 02:12:54,420
I'm too. I'm like what the fuck and then she gets whenever she's whenever she eats her boogers

1587
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:57,820
I'm like why she's like a it's actually a lot of nutrients. It's actually like good for your immune

1588
02:13:00,380 --> 02:13:02,380
Oh

1589
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:04,740
You got the fucking excuse

1590
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:09,060
This is rich proteins

1591
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:15,260
I mean, I recycle my semen, you know

1592
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:27,020
The reason why I don't think about it much is that it's not even like in the top tier of like like tics nervous

1593
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:29,020
She hasn't like

1594
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:44,500
She pops pimples, but she also wants to pop my pimples it's therapeutic for her to pop my pimples now

1595
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:53,060
Someone who pops my pimples unless it's in the state

1596
02:13:53,380 --> 02:13:57,900
Hold on. I mean if you have a pimple, what are you gonna do but pop it?

1597
02:13:57,900 --> 02:14:02,620
Yeah, I just leave it like that goes away and then wash my face fucking better and have a better diet, right?

1598
02:14:02,620 --> 02:14:04,180
Well, why would you not pop it?

1599
02:14:04,180 --> 02:14:08,940
Well, I only pop it when it's in like an annoying spot like on like ear or like it's right next to my nose

1600
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:12,540
Why would you not pop it because it hurts fucking hurts you?

1601
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:17,100
All right, and then like it hurts. I guess I have a low pain threshold

1602
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:21,420
I think I think I have like sensitive skin and shit, right guys. Do we have to talk about this?

1603
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:22,420
Can we get away from this?

1604
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:23,420
I'll be like laying in bed.

1605
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:25,420
Wait, this is a pimple popping contest now!

1606
02:14:25,420 --> 02:14:29,700
All right, all right, and I'll be like laying in bed and she's like oh hold on you got an acne right here

1607
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:35,340
And I'm just like fucking screaming because sometimes they like really really really fucking hurt and like her

1608
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:36,340
This is a nightmare.

1609
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:37,340
She's got very...

1610
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:38,340
Yeah, this is... this is dark.

1611
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:41,180
She's got very different skin for me like her skin is very tough

1612
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:47,180
Like just to be able to scratch an itch, she does a level of scratching that would like leave my skin red afterwards, right?

1613
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:50,740
So that was one of the things we had to get used to was our very different like she'll just like

1614
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:55,060
Hey, when we're gonna like dry off your back with a towel and she'll like do it so hard to like fucking give me rug burns

1615
02:14:55,060 --> 02:15:01,220
Like no, no, no my skin is like way thinner than yours. So like for her acne doesn't really hurt that much to pop

1616
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:02,220
I've taken my headphones off.

1617
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:07,260
But it's super fucking like hurts to have I guess like it's just annoying for her to have it so she constantly has to pop it

1618
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:10,180
So like yeah, like there'll be times where I'm like

1619
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:14,380
Just like hey, let me pop this pimple and I just fucking scream. She's like why are you using a baby?

1620
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:15,380
I'm like it hurts.

1621
02:15:15,380 --> 02:15:17,380
I missed it. I missed a DeVoo.

1622
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:23,060
When I'm walking down the street playing Jurassic World Alive to him

1623
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:29,220
I'm walking out with my cane and all these fucking whores and Jezebel's throwing themselves at me

1624
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:35,420
Oh, can I pop your pimples? Oh, can I eat your boogers? It's just so fucking taxing. So you have to walk down the street

1625
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:41,420
I have to worry about that. No, no, you fucking succulent bitches. No, those boogers are from my own

1626
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:44,980
Those pimple puzzles are from my own steaks and garnishes

1627
02:15:45,820 --> 02:15:48,780
You're not good to have my delicacies. I lost my appetite

1628
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:52,340
Cooking has been

1629
02:15:52,580 --> 02:15:57,780
This day, it's it's well, it was a fucking question askers fault. No, I mean this true

1630
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:03,420
I guess it was my fault for choosing but whatever doesn't matter. Anyway, let's go back with a fucking lounge pick some real questions

1631
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:09,060
I have one. Okay. All right. I think this could be the last one, which I quite like I think you guys might think it's retarded

1632
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:11,940
But I like my chipmice win. What's your food?

1633
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:15,620
Sona if you were an item, what would oh avocado rice?

1634
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:18,260
all right, I

1635
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:22,780
Would be something they would be a cheap Jim Ben would be a slim. I think I'd be now

1636
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:28,780
I think I'd be a paw paw what the fuck is up. I got a look this is a PAW like PAW. I think

1637
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:35,380
Is it PAW? Okay, I see it. I would just be an avocado. That'd be my my thing. Yeah

1638
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:38,540
You're very you're very millennial

1639
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:42,400
Yeah, no, I would be something cheap

1640
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:46,420
Yeah, I would be I would be like

1641
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:52,420
You're something cheap mysterious and you don't know why you're eating it, but you are and this is your life now

1642
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:55,740
All right, I got mine. I would be

1643
02:16:56,820 --> 02:17:00,300
Delicious mashed potato with onion gravy. That's pretty good. That's not bad

1644
02:17:00,300 --> 02:17:03,100
I was thinking I'm soft and deli

1645
02:17:03,860 --> 02:17:05,860
That works like

1646
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:09,980
I hate fucking white gravy white gravy sucks brown gravy is awesome. I

1647
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:14,780
Hmm, what I'd be I feel like it'd be some sort of meat product

1648
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:18,980
Protein shake, I mean a protein shake. Yeah

1649
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:25,180
There's people who are way more protein shake people protein shake with raw meat in it. You know what I'd be

1650
02:17:25,180 --> 02:17:30,060
I know what I would be my classic drink. Oh, I'm calling this. This is the Nate best man

1651
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:31,860
It is water

1652
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:38,060
Chocolate protein powder and fruit punch creatine. I'm drinking. I'm drinking Nate best man's every day

1653
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:41,260
They're the worst tasting thing in the world

1654
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:45,380
But they have nutrients that I want in my body so I consume them

1655
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:53,540
Send me a picture on my Twitter at bestest guy ever of you drinking a Nate best man, please go buy your creatine

1656
02:17:53,940 --> 02:17:55,940
Nobody's

1657
02:17:56,340 --> 02:18:02,260
There's gonna be some lifters out there who already have it around fruit punch creatine chocolate protein powder and water

1658
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:04,940
There you go. That's what I am

1659
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:09,060
That the ultimate the utilitarian snack. That's what it is

1660
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:14,020
It's hard to think what kind of food I would be cuz I don't know like it's not like what food you like

1661
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:16,140
It's like what food like like in

1662
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:21,420
I mean you do resemble a stacked hamburger quite a bit in most ways

1663
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:28,900
Like you would be a fruit hamburger. Are they what are they quirky?

1664
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:35,420
Yeah, you you would be a like a burger, but with like candy

1665
02:18:35,420 --> 02:18:39,660
I was I know what munchie would be munchie would be what appears to be a burger

1666
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:45,140
But when you bite into it you find out that each layer is assembled from different pieces of doughnuts to deceive you

1667
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:47,140
You know think

1668
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:52,020
Children one sex dreams. Wait, wait. What did we munchie if he was a food

1669
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:54,900
He would be that like doughnut burger that we once had

1670
02:18:57,500 --> 02:19:02,740
Made of it honey do that's right. They made it is like a joke and we ate it for real

1671
02:19:03,820 --> 02:19:11,060
There's a restaurant boss boss burger company that I like and they have a bunch of weird like retarded like novelty burgers

1672
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:16,060
One of them is like a burger with like a ton of like honey on it. I would probably be that okay, dude

1673
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:19,340
Yeah, I guess to like add in a random like cooking comment

1674
02:19:19,340 --> 02:19:22,100
I have an idea for a breakfast burger. I've done which is bagel for the bun

1675
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:27,140
You still have a hamburger right right and you have cheese and egg and then maybe like mustard or something like that

1676
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:29,140
Just breakfast burger, you know, it's great shit

1677
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:35,320
I don't know I've not been to restaurants that have that necessarily

1678
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:38,900

02:19:58,260 --> 02:19:59,180
