Jim Priest is Georgia Tech's kicker, and he's bored.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
By the time this game is all over, he will have kicked 18 extra points.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,040
He bested he made a steak dinner that he can kick a ball through the uprights on a kickoff.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,520
But then he went off himself, and he turns on the jets.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,880
Morris Gouger, while lining up for the catch, smacks into the goal post.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,760
The ball bounces off his head and into Priest's arms.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,200
Jim Priest has just caught his own kickoff for a touchdown.

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,800
Boss, I got the opponent's wife in my peripheral. I have them. I have them locked inside it.

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,120
I'm ready to pull the trigger whenever the game starts. I'm ready to shoot them,

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,680
and then the game will start, and they'll be like, wait, I can't play the game. I have to go.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
My wife was fucking blown. Her head was blown off her fucking shoulders.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,920
Stand by for orders, Munchy, and lastly our... We got a reverse JFK situation on our hands here.

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,120
Football is an American colloquialism that is just wrong. They just got it wrong,

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,160
and they're wrong, and they don't know what they're doing. Also, I love basketball.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:02:08,560
Me too, dude. All right, let's go. All right, there you go.

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,720
There's our highlight, folks. That's the end, you can believe.

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,600
So we're talking about sports today, everybody. We're talking... It's sports center today.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,720
Here we are. Okay, let's settle down and get to our public service announcement from Urban

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,240
Dictionary, definition of sports. Okay, here's the top one. I can't fucking wait to hear this.

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,920
All right, here's the top one that sucks shit. It's one of those... It's like a dad joke.

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,680
Sports, America's state-sponsored religion. All right, let's... Okay, here we go. Here we go.

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,800
Number two is sport. So singular, but this is still good. The name your dad calls you

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,360
by that makes you feel like a total loser, which you probably are anyway, synonyms, champ, chief,

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,200
etc. We're really getting to the bottom of what sports is. I know, we really are. All right,

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,160
tell me, who's played sports? Who's been a contender out there on the field? Yeah?

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
I may not look like it, but when I was a little kid, I was a big sports guy. I used to play soccer

35
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,960
every single day of my fucking life. Soccer? I wouldn't have guessed, okay. You seem like a

36
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,200
football guy to me. American football. The only thing I'm going to be able to say intelligently

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,640
is that I like watching football on TV. I like doing it. That's what I know about sports.

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,560
I've played soccer a little bit. I used to do baseball. I used to do football. I used to do

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,080
all that. I used to do fucking tennis, but now I'm an esports kind of guy. So I'm just going to tell

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,960
you about how esports is the fucking future and how I'm a god. That's what I really want to get to

41
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,880
at the end of this. Okay, but let's build up to it. I kind of want to talk about normal sports

42
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,320
as well, mostly. Of course. Because E is gay. E-electronics are gay. We can do another episode

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,760
entirely on esports. Believe me, there's a lot to cover there. There's a lot to go into with my

44
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,600
personal investment. What's the future of fucking society? Yeah, I agree. All right, hang on. What

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,560
were you saying, Jesse? You know, when I was a little kid, like really young, like five or six

46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,440
or whatever, I was a sports prodigy. This is true. This is a true story. I could hit the

47
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,760
baseball really far and good. I could throw a hoop from anywhere on the court. I could do like

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,120
trick shots, and then I got a Sega, and that was the end. E-sports, dude. Fucking esports.

49
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,560
I threw it all away for esports. It's the worst mistake I ever made. He sacrificed being a blast

50
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,920
down on the field for all that blast processing. I sacrifice being a black

51
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:48,240
for being a blast person. I was like, I'm not black. I'm OJ. Okay. Okay. Well, what about what

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,400
about, what is it? It's like NBA three on three hoops, you know? Or no, it's NBA Jam, like the

53
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,040
greatest sports game ever made. I can do one better Mario, Mario sports, three on three hoops.

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,320
That's kind of what was infecting my brain there. I like that game. That's a good one.

55
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,520
That is a good game, because it's got white mage and black mage from Final Fantasy and its

56
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,760
character. What about we esports? What about we esports? The greatest sporting challenge on the

57
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,880
modern console? Weesports is probably like the, I think, isn't that like the most popular game of

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,720
all time? It's like number one most popular thing. Yeah, exactly. It's up there anyway. I do like

59
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,680
but I want to talk about real sports. I want to talk about when I was a little boy, because we

60
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,280
are sort of doing that. I was into like sports because you had to be, because you had to do

61
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,120
sports for school. And I was actually very competitive and very, very vicious and I didn't

62
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,040
care about it. You're a competitive guy. You've got that beast inside you. Especially when playing

63
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,920
soccer. I wasn't good at passing. I was never good at like a technical like knowing where to

64
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,520
kick. But I did know that if you kicked people, they would not attack. They would just back off

65
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,840
and I was a perfect defender. So I would go around kicking people to make them cry. And I didn't

66
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,200
care. And that's why I didn't have any friends. But I was such a good defender and nobody would

67
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,760
fucking go anywhere near me. And I felt powerful for the first time. If that was too off the field

68
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,560
too. Oh, that's damn dude. That's effective. Especially also in basketball. I'm a very small

69
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,680
person. I've always been. But in basketball, surprisingly, because of how aggressive and

70
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,800
like I just don't I don't let up. Because I just hate people when I'm playing sports. I just

71
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,520
like I'm your enemy team. You are going to die somehow by my hand. So I would leap up at people

72
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,800
even like the black kids who are like really tall, I would just leap right up with them.

73
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,120
I obviously look really stupid while doing it. But like they, they, you know, people are scared

74
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,760
of how how how seriously I took attacking. I love I love attacking people. Yeah, it's it's

75
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,680
the mental game. I fancied myself. I fancied myself more of a tactician, more of a tactical

76
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,720
player than a physical player in sports. Of course, you know, I played my I played my share of sports

77
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,640
in school. I was in I was in like Little League Baseball or whatever. And like one of my one of

78
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,280
my shittiest childhood memories is there was like a big fucking game or whatever. It was like, oh,

79
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,560
we're gonna were we gonna win the game or lose the game? Who knows? And I was playing in the

80
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
outfield and I was bored and I was looking at the sky and I had to pee. And I was like, man,

81
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,080
the game's almost over. I'm just gonna hold it. I'm just gonna hold it until the end of the game

82
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,040
so we can win the game. And then but then time wore on and I just had to pee really bad. And it

83
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,200
started to like hurt. It started to like be physically. And I was and I was like, I can't,

84
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,240
I can't find. So I like ran in and I was like, coach, let me go pee. And he was like fine.

85
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,160
So I went and peed and I came back and we had won the game while I wasn't there.

86
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,640
I was like, oh, man, why did I just go earlier or something? But but on the subject of being a

87
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,400
tactical player, being a sports genius. So one day in gym class, we were playing like soccer or

88
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,720
something. And I was like, I know I can't compete. I know I can't compete with these bullies with

89
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,600
these bullies and trolls and jocks and chads, physically, but I can't compete with their brute

90
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,760
strength. But my mind, my mind is sharp like a like a like a whetstone. My mind is keen like a

91
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:21,680
blade stones aren't sharp you. So I so I so I I engineered what I called the reverse sneak attack.

92
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,200
Wait, which is actually the exact opposite of a sneak attack, because you

93
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:35,200
loudly announce that you are performing a sneak attack while simultaneously not performing a sneak

94
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,560
attack. So I was just dribbling up the field and a defender and a defender just came up to me

95
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,400
just trying to you know, just being do you know the internet bully and troll just trying to

96
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,720
just trying to take the ball from me like a normal idiot doesn't he isn't seeing like a brilliant

97
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
strategy coming his way. And he says he's coming up to me. I just yell in his face as loud as I

98
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,800
can sneak attack. And then I just kicked the ball past him. And he was too dumbfounded. He was too

99
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,480
dumbfounded to do a thing. What I'm saying is the plan worked perfectly and I broke sports forever.

100
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,400
Actually, that technique was banned in professional sports because it was too powerful.

101
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,920
Is that true? Wow, Ben, you're the coolest. Yeah, good story, Ben. I definitely heard all of it.

102
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,520
I didn't leave and then just hear the end of it. Me neither. Let me tell you, Ben, I've had to

103
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,560
I've had to contend with some IRL cyber bullies a few times myself on the on the field of battle.

104
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,880
Let me tell you about one day in the life of a young boy where he transcended humanity and became

105
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,600
a literal sports guide. Okay. So this was in middle school sometime and we were playing this

106
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,640
game called poison ball poison ball. It's a dodgeball type game. But instead of having people

107
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,440
like restricted to to either side of the field, there are actually there is two active balls at

108
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,960
any time. And basically the entire field is in place so you can run around anywhere and just

109
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,040
tag people. And the way it works is like just the two balls sort of act as like opposing magnets

110
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,520
and like where one is basically what you do is you go to where the ball isn't if you've got one

111
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,760
and you just pick off weak people one at a time on the fringes. And eventually it works down to

112
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,280
there's just two people each with the ball and they just matrix duel each other and try to like

113
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,920
fake each other out and shit. Okay. So on an average gym class day, we play this during gym

114
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,320
class, of course, on an average gym day, you could get around four of those games in. Let me tell

115
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:28,000
you on this one day, something happened deep down in my brain's dick. And I became the god. I was

116
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,600
a I would I had watched the matrix recently. So I'd internalize their their mad skills. My dodging

117
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,840
game was insane. I won three out of four of those games. And I only lost the fourth one. And remember

118
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,360
this is everyone against everyone. There's like there's like 30 people in this class. All right.

119
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
I trounced them all. I defeated them all. The only reason I lost the last game was because the two

120
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,160
people who got the ball at the very start of the game before I had a chance to get my hands on it,

121
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,280
because I would have turned the tide. They both they grabbed the balls, they looked each other,

122
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,320
they nodded, and they both marched over to the corner where I was. And like a fucking hero,

123
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,520
I just stood them in the I looked in the I said, just do it. Just do it, you fucking cowards.

124
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,280
You can't handle me and my best. You don't deserve me at my worst. That's what I said to them. And

125
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,840
then they put me down. They was like the end of Braveheart. They put me down because they knew I

126
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,120
was too fucking powerful. If I'd won one more game, I would have literally floated like a god

127
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,240
into the heavens. And and life would never have that those jealous bullies just wouldn't just

128
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,320
wouldn't allow that. This is this is this is them dragging down all of humanity's evolution. It was

129
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,160
like it was like in 2001 space Odyssey. I was that baby in space. And they just they pulled me,

130
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,040
they put their hooks in me. They pulled me back down to earth. And they devolved me back into

131
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,760
a lowly human being once again. That's what happened. But I'll never forget that day. I'll

132
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,880
never forget that day. Jesus Christ. There was the assassination of Julius Caesar, like everyone's

133
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,360
conspiring against him because he was just too fucking powerful. Exactly. Exactly. It was exactly

134
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,680
like that. I have something similar, but it was more like it was more like me sering my dominance

135
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,040
and then everyone like deciding that I should be eliminated a little bit. Okay. So we were playing

136
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,040
soccer. I was playing soccer like happened to Hillary in the election. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

137
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,640
We were playing soccer and these fucking these these fucking these fucking cowards and these

138
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,880
these children were just trying up not playing the game correctly. And there was being believe

139
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,120
they were breaking the fucking rules. And then I was I was going to allow them to fucking sully

140
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,120
the name of soccer. And so I kept I kept fucking walking over them and like saying if you don't

141
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,920
play the game right, I'm going to fucking like kill you. I'm going to destroy you and your family.

142
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,320
But they they just they just fucking wouldn't they just they just wouldn't and I forgot the

143
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,600
exact move is one of them got it and then like and like fucking like like like somehow like

144
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,960
like like they had like fucking like picked it up and then like moved it or something something

145
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,680
fucking so like obviously like breaking the fucking rules that it had to be dealt with.

146
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,440
So when they kicked it, I jumped and thrown the fucking ball, I caught it in midair,

147
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,640
slammed on the ground like like held the ball to my chest and I screamed the word hell and this

148
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,440
was in fifth grade. And so everyone's eyes like locked on me instantaneously because I said a

149
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,440
swear word. And then I made like I made like a big old speech about how these people need to be

150
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,760
fucking driven from our lands because they do not respect the sport and they must be fucking

151
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,000
eliminated because they do not they do not appreciate the craftsmanship that it has to go in

152
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,640
to creating sports rules. And so I just held the ball I just held the ball in my fucking hands

153
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,120
and let anyone take it until the until they were marched off in shame and everyone like booed them.

154
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,480
Yes, actually, justice won this day. Yeah. By the way, can I just can I just also share a

155
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,080
quick story about the word hell specifically? Just just one time in third this is in third grade.

156
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,080
I was talking to a friend we were we had just read anamorphs. All right, he had read volume one of

157
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,400
anamorphs and I was going to read it that night hadn't gotten to it yet. And when he said the

158
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,560
name of the character Chapman, who I believe was the principal in the book, I say vice vice

159
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,720
principal Chapman that you're exactly right. Vice principal Chapman. I said this exact word

160
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:09,120
to this exact inflection. Who the hell is Chapman? That's exactly what I said. And they

161
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,480
immediately were like, Nate, what have you done? They pulled me aside. They called my parents and

162
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,440
had them come pick me up because I was disrupting class by being a monster a little swearing monster

163
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,000
while in the most tortured way possible. Yeah, I just wanted to be cool so bad. Stunning.

164
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,400
Yeah, so funny to me because like, hell isn't even a thing like I know it's not even a swear,

165
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,960
but not only that, but I remember like a like a little kid. I think it was like, like, seven or

166
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,160
10 or something like really young. And he got in trouble for saying fuck. And all the that happened

167
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,520
was the teacher yelled at him and made him like feel bad in front of like a class of older kids

168
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,600
like it was like he said fuck. And he got in trouble and he got shouted at and humiliated

169
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,880
in front of another class. And that was it. It wasn't like calling parents fucking parents and

170
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,120
shit. They made it a federal fucking case. That sounds like much more justice than than Nate got

171
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,920
the poor bastard. It's true. One time I was tricked into flipping someone off and then they got me

172
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,320
in trouble. Were they playing a mimic game or something? No, I remember. I remember somebody

173
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,040
telling me to do that and I didn't know what it was and I got in trouble. Yeah, that's what happened.

174
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,440
This fucking stupid, this fucking like like like virgin for life fucking like like twig

175
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,840
like football star. Fuck him. Daniel, Daniel, if you are fucking listening this, I'm I never

176
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,440
forgot about you and you will be fucking eliminated. You know, you know Daniel's listening. Yeah.

177
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,920
I know Daniel is just seething with jealousy.

178
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,040
That you became a member of the PCP and he was left to flounder. He was left to flounder in his

179
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,760
pathetic sports stardom. And this is what you fucking deserved, you stupid piece of shit. You

180
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,720
know why? Because in third grade, I was sitting next to you and you said, Hey dude, check this out.

181
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,040
And like, like, like, like, okay, okay, put up, put out your fucking hand and then lower all of

182
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,280
like, like, pull your entire like, like, make it like a fist, but then have your middle finger be

183
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,240
out. Just, just, just try dude. Wouldn't it be funny if that happened? Wouldn't that be fucking

184
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,560
Larry? So you did that one day? Wouldn't that be interesting? And then I'd be like, yeah,

185
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,120
dude, that'd be really fucking funny, dude. And then I did it. And then he was like, Hey,

186
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,800
teacher, look what Anthony's doing. I was fucking pummeled. I was beat in the fucking street. I was,

187
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,040
I was pulled aside. I was putting like a will or one like, like, like abandoning your post,

188
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,400
like like firing squad, blindfolded, fucking executed in front of my entire class.

189
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,600
They really brought the horrible, whorey hammer of the gods down.

190
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,200
And I'll never fucking forgive you, Daniel, Daniel, ever, ever. You and your fucking yacht club.

191
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Just because you, just because you can fucking, you can count better. Just because you fucking

192
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,080
read Harry Potter while I was reading Diary Wimpy Kid, doesn't mean you're fucking better than me.

193
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:11,920
All right. It doesn't fucking mean anything. I got aside with Daniel on that one, but you know.

194
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,920
You fucking bastard, you fucking traitor, you fucking broodist.

195
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,680
Yeah, I've been looking for a chance. I've been looking for a chance to betray him.

196
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:29,520
Okay, let's, let's refocus on sports, I guess. What do we got here? What do you got to say?

197
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,080
All right. I want to talk about sports I like, because I do like watching a few sports,

198
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,640
not the biggest, biggest ones, but I like watching Wimbledon when that's on. And the Olympics is

199
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,960
always kind of interesting. And, you know, horse racing, stuff like that, stuff that's not,

200
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,800
not like the most popular. Horse racing? Horse racing, I believe.

201
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,200
Well, the Grand National specifically, it's like, it's like the big horse race of the year.

202
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,720
And they've never even seen a horse. Is that like NASCAR for horses? Is that the idea?

203
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,160
It's like when they get all the smallest people and all the biggest horses and they just put

204
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,360
them together and see what happens. Okay, all right. And let me tell you, there's some chemistry

205
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,880
out there. Yeah, okay. But I have not watched a sport. I have not watched a sport in years. Like,

206
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,440
I watched the Super Bowl maybe like several years ago, just on a lark, just as a joke,

207
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,600
just ironically, I watched the Super Bowl. And that was pretty much the end. I have not watched

208
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,520
the Olympics. I can't, people, people act like I'm weird because I'm not watching the Olympics.

209
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,440
Like, I feel like I'm supposed to be watching the Olympics, but I'm like, I can't imagine a thing

210
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,760
worse. I can't imagine a worse fate than watching the Olympics. It's kind of nice to just have it on

211
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,320
in the TV, on some TV nearby. Then you feel watching the Olympic girls do the gymnastics is

212
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,480
more sexy than having actual sex. It's the only attractive thing in the world. I gotta give a

213
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,800
shout out, I gotta give a shout out to the women's volleyball team. The volleyball team is the perfect

214
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,640
mixture of like, they wear the least clothing and they're doing the most active activities.

215
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,960
It's the best. Volleyball, that's the way to go. These are like fucking, these are like fucking,

216
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,840
like, buff, like athletes. These are, these are the kind of girls that played softball in college.

217
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,880
But dude, compared to American fatties, they're a thousand times better. There could be no

218
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,280
comparison. I don't, whatever, whatever, man. I'm committing. I'm not, I'm committing. I'm not

219
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,520
feeling it. You know, I, that's a, that's a growing sentiment, I think. People just being like,

220
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,680
bored of the, the, oh, oh, fucking curling semi-finals is up. Just watch it. Yeah, I don't know. Like,

221
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,920
there's a lot of shit. I can't keep track of it all. I kind of like it the way Gib does, I guess.

222
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,200
Just watching it in the background, like, oh, yeah. I guess like, when, yeah, yeah, I'm totally,

223
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,720
so in other words, put it on and don't watch it, which is something that I could probably

224
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,800
have a great time doing. Yeah, because like, because like, whenever there's like a big thing,

225
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,120
when there's like the ashes, which is like the, the cricket tournament between Australia and England,

226
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,840
there's like, the, there's Wimbledon, which is obviously the biggest tennis tournament in the

227
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,280
world, like something big, but like, I don't care. But I'll watch the final and I'll be like,

228
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,960
glancing at the TV because other people are watching it. It's just sort of nice to know that

229
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,040
it's a thing that's being talked about. It's just like, oh yeah, you know, I know what's going on.

230
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,840
You know, Gib, I have never felt a bigger cultural divide between us than I do right now with these,

231
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,480
this, the ashes, I, all right, here's the thing about the ashes. Cricket is a, is a big English

232
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,280
thing and it's also big in Australia and there's a big fierce rivalry. There's, there's other like

233
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,880
actual cricket tournaments that go on. I think, I think, yeah, the ashes is just England and Australia

234
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,880
or maybe it's everyone, I forget. But the thing is the ashes is like, it's literally a thing of

235
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,280
ashes, which is the trophy because of something that happened a long time ago and I can't remember.

236
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,960
I was going to say, do they burn the losing teams and then they become the ashes?

237
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,480
Wait, I remember, I remember from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the ashes is like a wood,

238
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,320
like an ancient wooden artifact that was burned and like, yeah, yeah, there's some,

239
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,400
the ashes are like a thing in Hitchhiker's Guide and like the third, like the third book.

240
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,360
It's a, sorry. That's important. Yeah, yeah. Anyone who knows what I'm talking about, comment

241
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,440
and remind me. Might be related, yes. But um, yeah, there's that, uh, fucking,

242
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,080
my, I don't know, this is totally a tangent, but my, uh, my neighbors,

243
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm trying to think of like culturally divided, divided things. Like,

244
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,400
rugby is like the coolest, rugby is like the coolest sport in the world and anyone who does it

245
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,880
is like 10 times more of a badass because like there's no padding and it's super cool and they

246
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,080
just run at each other for like an hour and they all die. They are the, the big rugby thing is called

247
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,360
the five nations because it's like, it's England, it's Wales, Scotland, uh, France and Ireland,

248
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,560
I think, and they're all like, they're all big fat, tough, all well-known independent nations,

249
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,680
Wales, Scotland. No, they're all just, they're big rugby people and they're all nearby and they're

250
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,400
just like, we fucking love rugby and eating meat and being big, beefy guys and we want to beat the

251
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,000
shit out of each other with a ball. Why don't you guys invite France to play sometime? That'd be nice.

252
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,880
We did. That's why I said the France is part of it. Oh. Oh no. The five nations you

253
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,840
fuck. Okay, all right. But yeah, like, the cool thing about watching a rugby match is that people,

254
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,320
it's like the same sort of size as a soccer match, but the crowd is so, so quiet and so respectful.

255
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,720
It's like, it's more nowadays, it's, yeah, it's, it's more quiet than a fucking golf match,

256
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,600
sometimes a rugby match. When something's really, like, you know, they don't do stupid

257
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,600
chants, they don't do screaming constantly, it's just like, oh yeah, yeah, we're watching a thing.

258
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,480
Fuck my asshole, fuck my asshole, let's go. It feels the, the manliest sort of thing ever.

259
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,000
I like it. I mean, I do like, uh, when I go to a sporting event, I like to be able to take it seriously

260
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,080
what's happening on the field and sometimes, like, a lot of people I've noticed go to like

261
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,320
football games just for like the experience of going and, you know, buying the beer and getting

262
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,240
the food and stuff. But at a certain point, I do want to be able to pay attention to the actual

263
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,120
game and be interested in what's happening down there. I mean, like, I go to football games

264
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,240
more than anything else, which is to say, like, I've been to one in the last year. Uh, so that's,

265
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,720
that's pretty fun. That's pretty fun. I, I, a while, when I was a little kid, I used to like, like,

266
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,120
like maybe like three or four times I went to the baseball stadium near my house, specifically

267
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,440
because I liked their brand of pizza, like the best. So I, so I went there just to eat pizza

268
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,720
and then like, I would see like, oh, there's a buy ticket to get it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Well, okay. Yeah. Yeah. And so that was cool. And I had like, like every time I did it. So yeah,

270
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,000
I was just popping against the pizza. Then I realized, but baseball takes like fucking a year.

271
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,840
Like it is the longest sport ever made. And it was, I have been to like two or three baseball

272
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,560
games in my life and never, ever have I enjoyed baseball. Yeah, baseball is pretty boring. Not

273
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:01,040
a big fan. I think baseball is like the coolest sport, but not one that I ever want to watch.

274
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,760
Like I think, I think that all sports are great and I love them all. I just don't want to watch any

275
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,360
of them. I think that's the thing about baseball, I feel like baseball generates just an absolutely

276
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,200
outrageous amount of like numbers and statistics to analyze. Like I feel like baseball is like,

277
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,640
people just do that. I feel like baseball is like analyzed, maybe like proportionally more

278
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,560
than other sports. I agree. And I don't know why that is. I mean, I'm sure you said maybe basketball.

279
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,400
I mean, I hear a lot of people talking stats with basketball too. I feel like the biggest

280
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,080
sports nerds are baseball nerds. I agree. I agree. Moneyball was a good movie.

281
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:46,320
I was just, so I was just, all right, so I just put out a video about 17776.

282
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,640
Oh, here we go with the shilling your videos. No, no, no, I'm not saying this to show my video.

283
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,400
I'm saying that like the guy who made that is like a big like sports nerd stats analysis guy.

284
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,320
And I, and I like looked into his work and I went and I watched a bunch of his old

285
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,960
videos. Well, they're not even, they're like a year old. And just going into some like

286
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,600
weird sports happening and his name is John Boyce. And some of them were really fucking

287
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,960
fascinating. He takes one where he looks at Barry Bond's batting average and he says,

288
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,080
okay, this is so fucking good. How and like a lot of his batting average is high because people

289
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,400
just deliberately walk in because they were so scared of having him hit the ball. And so he's

290
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,760
like, how good would he have been if he had not even had a bat, if he had never swung in a pitch?

291
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,160
And like he, he did this to the stats analysis and he was still the best hitter in the league

292
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,040
by a mile, even if he never swung. And there was, there was another one. There was like an old

293
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:47,280
game in like 1916 that ended in like a score of two, a football game that was 222 to zero.

294
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,920
And he just like walks through the whole game and just be like, absolute incompetence and like,

295
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:00,640
like wild, wild dogs chased the players in the middle of the game. Yeah, there was, there was

296
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,600
the first play of the game, the losing teams of quarterback got like knocked the fuck out.

297
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,240
The halfway through the game, they brought him back in clearly with a concussion, but like they

298
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,960
brought him in, they snapped the ball, it hit him with in the face and he just, there was, okay,

299
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,960
there was a kicker who kicked the ball and it flew across the field, hit a defender on the helmet,

300
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,560
and then the kicker caught his own kick off of the defender's helmet and scored a touchdown with it.

301
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,920
There was, there was a guy, there was a guy who was just there to impress his, it was a college

302
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,640
game. There was a guy who like, he got the ball, he wasn't there to actually play, he was just

303
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,080
impresses professors, he didn't know what to do, he like throws the ball, runs off the field,

304
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,760
hides behind a fence, but there are, no, no, it gets better, but they're all ready because he was

305
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:56,160
scared. There were already, no, no, listen, there were already two other players hiding behind the

306
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:02,560
fence, and, and, and they don't want him to give away their hiding spot, so they throw him back

307
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:11,200
over the fence onto the field. What the fuck? Okay, all right, so like this, this is some pretty

308
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,880
hot shit, and um, yeah, so sports, so sports, I was watching this and I remembered, I remembered

309
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:26,400
that sports can be cool. He's just filled with abject terror. Like he tries to escape in the

310
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,400
future. All right, that's the coolest thing I've ever heard. Yeah, I highly recommend, uh, yeah,

311
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,800
that video. What's that guy's channel called again? It's John Voice. Right, okay. Yeah, yeah, and,

312
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,720
and the video is called 222-0. I will definitely watch that, but I was gonna say, what I, the

313
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,440
thing about me in sports is the, the best thing about sports, I do like watching football because

314
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,920
I think the game is fun, and I understand it pretty well, and I like to watch guys, and I root for

315
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,800
the Patriots. I'm a Patriots fan, um, and, and they're the fucking dominating team all the time,

316
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,560
so it's fun to watch your team win, so that's nice. Uh, uh, plus I grew up, you know, close to

317
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,680
Boston, so whatever, I don't make fucking excuses for this. Uh, uh, uh, plus my friend John likes

318
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,080
the Eagles and they always lose, which is really nice, but anyway, what I'm getting to is that my

319
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,760
favorite type of sports are the ones that make the players look the most attractive. So I'm talking

320
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,680
about, that's right, that's right, I'm talking about weightlifting specifically, like, like

321
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,680
powerlifting. Powerlifting guys actually get a little fat though. Yeah, powerlifting guys are

322
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,720
way fat, they're all bare-foot. The best sport, the best sport is competitive bodybuilding,

323
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,800
going on a stage, and flexing your muscles, and showing how cool you are. No, if you think those

324
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,360
guys look cool or good, you're fucked up. They do look good. They don't look, they don't even look

325
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:48,000
they're heroes. They don't. Yeah. Well, silly. They do look really silly. I would say I'm a bit of

326
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,280
like a traditional bodybuilder enthusiast, if anything, like, uh, like, like Frank Zane back

327
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,160
of it, like before, before, uh, uh, you know, fucking steroids were just like, you know, defined

328
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,080
everything, even though like guys like Arnold, like are, are beautiful and they're on steroids.

329
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,480
All right. Uh, Arnold is like, yes, like, I understand that. I've seen some bodybuilders

330
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:14,160
that go so over the top that they literally look like a fucking mutant zombie bitch. Yeah,

331
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,720
I'm not into that as much. You know what's funny about those guys is that, you know, they, they

332
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,320
work out, they make every part of their body humongous. What's coming next, but there's no

333
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,040
weightlifting to make your wiener bigger. So they're standing there in their underpants and these

334
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,040
little like G strings and their whole bodies are huge, but it just makes it look like they've got

335
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,480
little tiny wieners. Yeah, true. And their heads look small too by comparison. They, you can't do

336
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,720
anything about either of those. That's why you should never work out ever. They ought to, they

337
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,200
ought to make them take your pants off and judge who has the tiniest wiener and give that guy the

338
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,560
golden. Yeah, guys, there's nothing to do but just to, just to take off our pants and just,

339
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,000
you just got to do it. There's, there's nothing else we can possibly just have to do it naked,

340
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,400
guys. They should just have the who has the tiniest wiener competition. Oh, and also they're

341
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,080
all really big and muscly for some reason. Well, you know what it is? I kind of, I wonder sometimes

342
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,320
why is there not a biggest dick competition? I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm dead serious. It's,

343
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,320
it's so important, right? Like culturally, like having a big dick is so important. And yet there's

344
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,320
no big dick contest. And I understand that it's not much of a contest because someone would just,

345
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,480
someone just has the biggest dick, right? The same guy would win every year.

346
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,120
But like, they do that with like dog shows, right? Like dog shows, like they just show up and like

347
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,560
whoever's got the best dog wins. Wait, maybe you have to train the dog. You can't train your penis

348
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,840
to be larger. You can do some tricks with your dick. Like cock pushups, for example, you know,

349
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,800
yeah, you got a jelk. They're a tick, you know, I'm on board. I'm ready to sign up for this thing.

350
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,000
I thought there was already like a world record, largest dick.

351
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,320
It's, it's, I've like, okay, this is real gay, but I've looked into like I've tried to find like

352
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,920
video evidence of like the biggest dick and you can't like there is none. Like there's like rumors

353
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,920
and theories. I know exactly what you're talking about because I've looked it up too for scientific

354
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,600
purposes. You look up like who has the biggest winner. The guy who has it will show up, but

355
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,160
they won't actually show you it. Yeah, yeah, Jonah Falcon supposedly has a 13.5 inch dick,

356
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,160
but there's no fucking evidence of it. Like, are you fucking kidding me? Because, because all

357
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,920
the pictures have him like with like a sock over it or like, you know, you know what I'm talking

358
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,320
about? It's just because he has a really small body makes it look bigger. Well, this is like,

359
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,520
if you guys are talking about the same guy I'm talking about, this is like an average looking

360
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,960
dude, but he's got this monster cock that actually causes him, you know, a lot of like, it's like,

361
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,040
it's huge. It's like a problem that is so big. Yeah, I was just about to say is his name Mike Mate.

362
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,600
No, it's not Mike Mate. It's some other guy. I mean, it's just fucking, it's just fucking

363
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,840
ridiculous to me that like, there are like, it's so important. Like we talk about having,

364
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,040
we talk about big dicks like so much in our society. And they're just like, you try to find like,

365
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,400
okay, well, like show me, like show me like a 12 inch dick, like with a fucking ruler next to it,

366
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,360
to prove it. And you cannot find it, even though supposedly they're out there. All you can do is

367
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,200
look at porn. I guess that's like the biggest reason. It's all like, it's all like weird camera

368
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,520
angles and like, I just want to know for sure. Like, I just want to see it like laid out performance

369
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,280
so I can be like, Oh, so, so, so that's what it's like. So that's what's out there. But there's

370
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,480
no taboo. There's no fucking cultural taboos. That's why I wonder. That's why I wonder about that.

371
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,560
You know, it's bizarre. I find it bizarre. I'm with you. I'm with you. You probably have to go

372
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:35,040
in person and us to see it. Well, then he'll show you. Let's go. Hippo come. Well, let's go on an

373
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:44,240
adventure. Hell yeah. Yeah, we club. I'm ready. The reason I start a vlog series, Hippo and Ben's

374
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:51,840
quest for the biggest dick. That sounds like a rowdy fucker's cop. You know, yeah, that's a road

375
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,120
trip. So the reason I brought a bodybuilding in general is because I actually do do bodybuilding

376
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,440
myself, you know, as best I can. And I would consider myself a sport guy in that three times a

377
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,800
week I go and exercise and then go running sometimes. So it's not really a sport. It's just

378
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,640
like a training thing. It's just a separate category. That's just exercise. If you're not

379
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,960
competing, it's not a sport. You know, I guess that's fair. I guess that's fair. I'm competing

380
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:26,880
with myself. I always try to do my best. My favorite sport is gaming this YouTube system.

381
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:34,160
Oh, that's a good one. I'm not very good at it yet, though. No. I always lose. YouTube is the

382
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:40,240
ultimate eSports competition. It is. What about eSports? That's the greatest admission of all time.

383
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,600
What do you got about eSports, Manchu? Let's hear it. I love eSports because I can do it without

384
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,400
any work because video games are easy and you're pathetic if you play in them. But have you tried

385
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,560
getting into League of Legends? That's like a month-long endeavor to even understand the gist

386
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,520
of the game and all the fucking games and shit. Honestly, as games, there's nothing I detest more

387
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:13,440
than MOBAs and eSports. I've watched a few eSports. Mostly because I know the person who

388
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,120
was commentating them was a person I follow. I was like, okay, I'll have a look at this.

389
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,920
It was like StarCraft II, which I got the gist of pretty quick because I know what an RTS is.

390
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,800
It's like, whoa, they're clicking so fast. There are so many fucking shortcuts and clicking,

391
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,680
and moving stuff. It's pretty interesting. I couldn't watch a whole tournament, but that's

392
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:39,520
alright. The other one was Hearthstone, which is a game that I had played. I don't play anymore,

393
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:48,000
but I was really into it. That was the most potential you could actually be good at Hearthstone

394
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,880
because all you need is to play the game a lot. I've heard it's really random, though. I've heard

395
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,040
there's a lot of randomization. That's why I feel like I could do it. If I just get lucky,

396
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,960
I just say, oh yeah, I got the card I need, and they didn't. Similar to Hearthstone, I was a pretty

397
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,560
active follower of Magic the Gathering in general back in the day. For a time, I tried to keep up

398
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,760
with professional strats and know what people were up to. This was in college sometime, and I went

399
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,960
to like some tournaments and stuff and just tried my hand at it. I had friends who were far more

400
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,520
professional. I had a friend, actually, who was like a judge. He was a higher level guy. He had

401
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,560
gotten to a place where he could do consistently as well in tournaments enough to make. Because

402
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,680
when you win tournaments, if you're the grand prize winner, you get money. But if you just win

403
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,320
in general, you get a certain amount of the rarer cards from the pool. He was able to get to a

404
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,560
place where he could win enough that he could sell those cards and completely cover all his entry

405
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,000
fees and his transportation costs and shit. He just loved Magic, so it was the perfect

406
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,320
situation for him, and he was only getting better. I don't know what happened to that guy, but that

407
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,600
was that. That was my experience. I would say that esports in general is fine. Things like

408
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:05,520
competitive Counter Strike are kind of fun to watch, but they all pale in comparison to my

409
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,960
actual favorite type of esports. I would call this a sport, and that is speedrunning in general.

410
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,480
Speedrunning is the coolest. No, it's the best. It's the best. I love it so much. I like speedruns.

411
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,080
I love watching speedruns. I'm the biggest fan in the world of speedruns. Every GDQ is my birthday.

412
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,160
It's great. Well, before we get started talking about speedruns, I just want to say

413
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:34,560
SalTV, S-A-L-T-V. He commentates TF2 competitive. Some of that shit is really fun to watch

414
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,960
if you like TF2. Are you sure his name isn't Salt-V? No, S-A-L-T-V or something like that.

415
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,080
I used to watch his videos. He hasn't made one in a while, but they're kind of fun to look back at

416
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:52,160
to see a commentated TF2 competitive 6v6. To explain my background of esports real quick,

417
00:36:52,160 --> 00:37:00,320
I watch esports all the time. I would say every week, if not more, which is more than I play

418
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:09,040
actual video games. I mainly follow Smash, all the games, and most FPSs. Right now, Overwatch is

419
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,560
big, so I'm watching that even though I'm not the biggest fan of Overwatch. In any FPS, I enjoy

420
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,920
greatly. I fucking love Smash. I know everything about Smash is the greatest game of all time,

421
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,040
and it's the... excuse me. That's actually a party game. Yeah, it's not a fighting game.

422
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,200
It's not really a fighting game, actually. It's a Republican party game. It has more fucking

423
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,680
inputs than anything else in the entire world. It's just a baby game, dude. It's just a baby game.

424
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:47,680
Now he's mad. Listen to the anger in that laugh. The closest thing to esports ID would be playing

425
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:56,480
Pokemon Showdown. I've always kind of wanted to compete in a tournament. I kind of don't even

426
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,320
know how to get started with it, but whatever. I would have no problem showing up and just losing,

427
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,120
but I would just kind of like to do it just to do it. Yeah, sounds fun. It's great because it's so

428
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,360
accessible. There are so many games you can play and go esports, and it's so accessible and easy to

429
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,840
do. Obviously, the high level is super resource-intensive and stuff. You have a great computer

430
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,800
and it'd be all technical and with your hands and shit, but in TF2, you can just fucking boot up

431
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,800
and then play for a little while and then go into competitive mode and fucking play, and it's great

432
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,280
and it's fun. Not the Valve competitive mode. You can do the fan shit because the Valve one

433
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,160
sucks. You know what I mean, though. It's super easy to go competitive with games, and I love them

434
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:48,640
all, and it's great. And you get Mad Dosh. And if you're lucky enough and you play Overwatch,

435
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,760
so you can get on TBS right after a Seinfeld episode, you can watch the TBS tournament.

436
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,160
I can watch Seinfeld and then Overwatch on TBS. Oh my god, it's the perfect combination. They go

437
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,960
together. You make so much fucking Mad Dosh playing Overwatch that frankly, you can't afford,

438
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,080
you, the viewer, cannot afford not to buy Overwatch right now. You could be raking in the

439
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:19,120
dough as a competitive, multi-shooter bullshit game, worst game in the world. You could be

440
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:25,760
collecting, you could be making dividends, and here you sit listening to me for shame.

441
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,640
The globalist conspiracy directly prints money from the Federal Reserve and distributes it to

442
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,760
Overwatch players, flooding the world economy with worthless US dollars, inevitably drying us

443
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,200
off of the poverty. We live in a post-scarcity world. We live in an Overwatch-based economy now.

444
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,920
We're going to move on from a petrol-based dollar, no more petrol dollars, it's now Overwatch

445
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,720
dollars, where the US dollars are completely comprised on Overwatch points, and that determines

446
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,720
your pay. What were you saying? I want to talk about that, because Overwatch is such a huge game,

447
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,320
and I have no desire to play it, but the amount of, like, if you want to get big at streaming,

448
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,960
you play Overwatch, because it's the big thing. If you want to, you know, to get, like, if I was

449
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,120
playing Overwatch instead of Minecraft, I mean, Minecraft is pretty big, but I would be getting,

450
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,440
like, so many new followers constantly, and it doesn't matter how good I am. Well, actually,

451
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,280
it probably does. But, like, it's like, it's a game, and you're supposed to play it to have fun,

452
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,160
but there are so many benefits to playing it, like, for an audience, like, monetarily, that I feel

453
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,520
some sort of, like, some pulling in the direction of playing it, even though I don't like it.

454
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,000
Here's what I think about that. I think when you're playing a game, like, super competitively,

455
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,600
like, eventually, you understand the game so well that you stop even seeing the game, and you become,

456
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,560
like, Neo in the Matrix, just seeing the ones and zeros. Like, it all becomes fucking code to you.

457
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,640
So I kind of think, to that extent, it almost doesn't matter what game you play, because eventually,

458
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,800
you'll reach an understanding where you've just, like, gone beyond what the game is even supposed

459
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,120
to be, and it just becomes, like, crunching numbers in your head and doing that. So it probably

460
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,320
doesn't matter to, like, a high-level player what game they're even playing.

461
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:14,240
There should be an eSports for Undertale, and the contest is just,

462
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,240
the winner is whoever doesn't do Skeletor as Papyrus.

463
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:33,360
The winner is whoever has the best time and has the best friendships at the end, whoever enjoys it the most.

464
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,200
What's funny about the way you say that is, like, you're framing it like, you know, to make Undertale,

465
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,240
like, a competitive thing, but that's exactly what speedrunning does. It makes any game into a

466
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,840
competitive thing where it's about optimization and strategy, and I love that.

467
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,400
It's a single-player game, and that means it's gay.

468
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,480
It does make it feel sad, though. That's bullshit. It's still competitive. What are you talking about?

469
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,680
The thing that I like about speedruns is that, like, you'll take a game that might take, like,

470
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,280
weeks to beat, like, I don't know, Mario 64 or something, and you watch a speedrun that's,

471
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,120
like, I don't know, beat it in, like, two hours. And what that basically does is take the entire

472
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,080
experience of playing a game and compress it down to, like, movie length, or, like, show length.

473
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,400
So you can, like, experience the entire game in, like, you know, in, like, a digestible

474
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,000
formula. You can sit down, and an hour later, you've watched someone play, you know, the entirety of

475
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,640
Banjo-Kazooie, and you're like, yeah, that was a good hour.

476
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,240
You know, Ben, I experienced Banjo-Kazooie.

477
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,240
I agree that that has a certain appeal to it, but I would say that, like, a lot of what you

478
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,080
end up doing is, like, skipping content. Like, if you can skip content in a speedrun, you skip

479
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,520
that content. Like, that's what you want to do.

480
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,960
Well, that's why you watch specific, like, hundreds of games.

481
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,000
Depends on the cent runs.

482
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100% runs.

483
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,040
Oh, you know, that's true.

484
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,280
Some of them.

485
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,240
Yeah, that is true.

486
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,640
I just watched a Mario 64 one the other day that was really good. It was, like, two hours.

487
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,000
Just the parkouring was incredible.

488
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,600
It was just, it was just breath, yeah, yeah, it's breathtaking.

489
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:01,760
I've been getting, I got into this guy recently who's been doing a really good service of making

490
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:09,520
videos detailing the legacy of the progression of speedrunning world records for various games.

491
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,880
And when it started, like, when people started speedrunning it and how, you know, over time,

492
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,480
people have figured out techniques to make it go lower, the time go lower and lower.

493
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,560
And it's really interesting and really well put together, sort of, like, just instruction,

494
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,440
like, like, like a history, sort of a timeline.

495
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,320
Those are fascinating.

496
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,360
The guy's name is Summoning Salt, if you type that in, you should find it.

497
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,400
Speedrunners talk about, like, when they discover a new technique or, like, a new strategy that

498
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,920
cuts their time down.

499
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,800
They talk about it like, new tech was discovered.

500
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,320
Like, a new technology is created.

501
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,280
There's so much hype.

502
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,160
I love it.

503
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,880
It's great.

504
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah.

505
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,600
And I love all the, like, when you, exactly, exactly, that kind of, that kind of, like,

506
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,680
putting on a pedestal, it's like, it's like giving a little pomp and circumstance to, like,

507
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,120
these kind of, like, these sort of mundane things that you find.

508
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,480
And, like, you build a whole community around those things and everyone's, like, in on the

509
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,240
joke and you can get in on it, too, and be, like, a member of a community and understand

510
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,800
these things.

511
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,680
It's so cool.

512
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,320
I really love it.

513
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,920
It's like, it's like, it's like this cliff here, yeah, the way, the way that I'm about to,

514
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,440
like, you know, do, like, a high jump, backflip, wall kick right here and, like,

515
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,360
glitch through the wall, like, this, like, this technique was in development for months

516
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,280
and it finally paid off, you know?

517
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,920
Like, it was experimented with.

518
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,080
The way that people, like, know that there's, like, a choke point coming up where, like,

519
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,600
oh, this is where I make a break, like, if I fuck this up, like, I lose five minutes off

520
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,200
my time here, I go and they do it and everyone's, like, yeah, I fucking did it.

521
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,560
I really like the community aspect.

522
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,440
I was, I was watching, I was watching a Pokemon speedrun.

523
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,720
I don't remember what Jen, but Worcester was speedrunning and there comes a point where,

524
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,840
because Worcester's making, he's making all these strategic decisions that are going to

525
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,040
save him time later.

526
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,680
And then, like, he's having a fight and, like, he gets, like, it gets low and then he gets

527
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,240
a crit and he wins, he wins the fight when he wasn't, and the crowd goes crazy and cheers

528
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,920
and Worcester is, like, visibly annoyed.

529
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,800
He's, like, really?

530
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,320
You cheer for that?

531
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,480
You cheer for that completely random thing that I had no control over and you don't even

532
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,360
notice, like, all these things that I put months of research into?

533
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,960
Like, he says it, too, and, like, the look on his face is, like, really pissed off.

534
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,600
And I really liked it.

535
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,200
Understandable, but not exactly the greatest crowd reader, but that's okay.

536
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,240
Not really.

537
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,920
Well, I, I, yeah, imagine, imagine my surprise to find out that this professional speedrunner

538
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,200
wasn't a people person, was actually kind of a big fucking nerd.

539
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,840
Well, well, not every speedrunner has to be a weirdo.

540
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,600
I, you know, whatever.

541
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,320
I, I, I, I'm playing up my page for speedruns.

542
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,760
I actually really like them as well, but, you know, I just, I like a bit of, I will say

543
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,960
the greatest thing that ever happened to speedrunning is the video Street 112.

544
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,920
Was it GoldenEye?

545
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,240
What?

546
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,200
Oh, well, there's this, there's this GoldenEye video of this guy going beyond God mode as he's

547
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,320
just, like, commentating on his, like, record-breaking GoldenEye run.

548
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,840
Yeah, it's a big meme, but I forget.

549
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,120
Yeah, but what year is it?

550
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,680
I don't know.

551
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,120
No, no, that's what it is.

552
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:03,680
Street 112.

553
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,480
Oh, that's it.

554
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:04,720
Yeah.

555
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,360
Okay.

556
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,360
I never even seen 113.

557
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,800
And I never fucking will.

558
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,320
But like, about time we got a fucking lucky break in this fucking game.

559
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,120
Look at my, look at my insane pace.

560
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,720
I am fucking clutch.

561
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,240
It's, he's, he's right in the fucking head.

562
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,160
He does some masterful moves, for sure.

563
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,280
Like, he has practiced this for months or possibly years.

564
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,960
I mean, GoldEye's a fucking old ass game.

565
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,360
Like, these guys become little gods of the worlds that they're in.

566
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,440
Like, it's like they, it's like they've lived their Groundhog Day a thousand million times

567
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,240
and have perfected it on a technical level.

568
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,080
It's just like Groundhog Day.

569
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,720
Except they're actually aging and getting older and wasting their one life on this planet.

570
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,200
That is, you know, I mean, it kind of comes back to the thing we said about video games

571
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,120
the other day about how, like, like, video games, like, if you are like a,

572
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,440
becoming a master speedrunner is like sort of finding a way to become a master of something

573
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,120
that's like not real life.

574
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,040
It like gives you something that you can be in control of and get really great at.

575
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,960
And I mean, you know, obviously like you can like, oh, maybe you can like build a business

576
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,360
and like, oh, I got to like economically strategize.

577
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,000
Like optimize my fucking tax, you know, minimize my tax and optimize my income.

578
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,040
But that's fucking boring.

579
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,280
And I want to be Super Mario jumping on Bowser and kicking my shit in as fast as possible.

580
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,080
You know, once again, like when you're playing it at that high level, like,

581
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,880
I'm sure it stops feeling like, you know, you're Kirby fucking bouncing around in Dream.

582
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,200
Right.

583
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,560
Like you start thinking inputs.

584
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,360
You're thinking inputs.

585
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,120
You're thinking inputs and you're thinking frames.

586
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,520
And you're thinking about, I mean, that's, that's how we felt during the,

587
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,600
that's how we felt during the Dark Souls speedrun.

588
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,720
I'm sure like, I practiced that so many times, I was just, you know,

589
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,160
like, I know, obviously I had no longer any fear of the enemies there.

590
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,360
It's just like, okay, this is a guy.

591
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,440
I know I need to like step back at this moment and do X, Y, Z, all that shit.

592
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,840
And the race that is an editing that's coming up, you know, in the future.

593
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,160
Let's keep that under wraps for now.

594
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,520
Race coming up soon, guys.

595
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,120
Race war.

596
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,160
Race war.

597
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,480
Yes.

598
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:03,440
Okay.

599
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,800
Do we have anything more to say about sports?

600
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,520
Should we go to questions?

601
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,120
We haven't even talked about sports.

602
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,400
We've been talking about speedruns for the last 90 years.

603
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,160
We've done with the sports.

604
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,040
Sports is fucking awesome.

605
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,520
I'm going to talk about you.

606
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,120
I like to dunk the ball.

607
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,840
Okay, go on.

608
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,120
Okay, okay, okay.

609
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,520
Learning?

610
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,320
Okay, okay.

611
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,600
Here's my like my experience because it was not because like a few years ago,

612
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,880
I was pretty like anti-sports.

613
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,040
There was one of those fucking guys like, oh, it's so fucking boring.

614
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,400
Why would you watch sports?

615
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,440
What are you fucking?

616
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,360
Dude, go read a fucking book.

617
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,320
Am I right, bros?

618
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,680
You didn't even expand your mind.

619
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,800
Hey, where do you work out?

620
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,680
The library?

621
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,200
I was one of those guys.

622
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,480
Damn, damn.

623
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,000
But then I got into esports.

624
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,640
I realized that like the cool thing about sports isn't the sports.

625
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,280
It's the players and how they evolve and like their personal like meta narratives.

626
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,080
Sure, sure.

627
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,840
Cause like, okay, smash.

628
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,800
Smash is like a fun game.

629
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,840
I like to play it.

630
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,440
But the real cool thing about smash is how these fucking gods have like molded these

631
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,200
fucking specific play styles and how they have so much fucking history.

632
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,440
Fucking like 10 years of history playing tournaments together, fighting like fighting

633
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,720
for fucking domination.

634
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:12,320
Just fucking like what like two years ago, uh, Hungrybox played fucking Jigglypuff.

635
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:17,200
Like the character that's like not usually considered a top tier until then.

636
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,040
And he fucking won EVO.

637
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,200
He fucking won EVO with like an unconventional character against fucking, I think it was

638
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,760
like maybe something like top tier like Fox guy.

639
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,560
All these so called gods and none of them could beat me with items on.

640
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,920
Oh, true.

641
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,880
So true.

642
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,600
So true.

643
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,760
But yeah, it's just like the entire point of it is just to see these people grow and

644
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,680
expand and evolve and that like that is the cool thing about it.

645
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,840
And then they're like they're fucking like like villains.

646
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,760
They're like people who you want to see get beaten.

647
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,480
There are people who you want to like see like fail or like succeed.

648
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,520
And it's all it's all about them and the way they use the game to like tell like stories.

649
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:02,240
Kind of sports sports is like this weird chaotic crucible or it's like it's like this.

650
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,280
It's like a strange excuse to like put all these elements together and jiggle them around amidst

651
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,480
unpredictable circumstances amidst like the chaos of like a ball flying around and like

652
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,920
weather and like random chance and like all this stuff.

653
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,040
It's it's just this it's this chaotic crucible from which like narrative can like sometimes

654
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,120
be be be what's the word be like distilled out of like that that and also like numbers

655
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,520
like like sports is like it's just a big thing.

656
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,720
It's just a big like black box into which like players and rules are put in and what comes out

657
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,240
as an endless stream of data that can be endlessly analyzed by fucking nerds by sports nerds like

658
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,200
to find to find trends and like make predictions and like discuss things and you know kind of like

659
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,320
kind of like playing video games and speedrunning video games is a way to like exert mastery over

660
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,280
a thing that isn't real like like analyzing sports statistics and looking into and looking into

661
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,360
like the progression of like of like sports players and like and doing like predictions and stuff

662
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,600
like that's like that also is a way that people can like look at something that's not real like

663
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:08,320
it's not real life it's just sports but they can like analyze this data and be like I have come to

664
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,400
like a great understanding about something and it's important and it's important within like a

665
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,520
certain subset of people it's sub culturally important like to be able to like to know like

666
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,160
what it means that like so and so like has such and such odds of doing whatever you know what I'm

667
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,960
saying these are like yeah I hear these are like the points of interest I think that that are that

668
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,720
are what drives like the continuing interest in sports and why we haven't all just gotten

669
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,400
why everyone hasn't just gotten bored and being like I know how this ends they get the ball to

670
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,720
the end zone and we haven't had football games that like travel the entire distance of Nebraska

671
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:47,040
and have states is fucking in stone in soon soon we will though uh one one moment one my favorite

672
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,720
my favorite e-sports moment of all time that like like embodies that like like this like the game

673
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,320
itself doesn't fucking matter is one smash moment at the salty sweet where this where this uh player

674
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,280
this player now known as Bizarro Flame was supposed to fight another like he plays Ganondorf

675
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,720
in melee the greatest character of all time and he was supposed to do a ditto of another

676
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,480
Ganondorf guy but he like he like flicked and he didn't show up he was like sandsie yeah exactly

677
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,880
and so they had they got another I've got another guy to like fill in as like the Ganondorf guy and

678
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,040
he was he was like another he was like another you know well-known Ganondorf but but like the the

679
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:27,280
game itself isn't really the important part it's it's that it's like it's that guy exerting his

680
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,560
fucking dominance over the character it like in real life so it's like that that match starts off

681
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,280
like hey how do you like the company's like hey how do you feel like like like the guy didn't show up

682
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,640
and then he said oh he's a fraud he's a fucking fraud and then and then like like what do you think

683
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:48,880
about this match what do you think is going to happen and he just said easy money and then he did

684
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:55,200
like a he did like a real life super special like move to the guy in real life oh my god and then

685
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,880
the match starts out the match starts out like one two three go and then he just does like one of

686
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:06,720
Ganondorf's like hardest moves to pull off like five times in a row and fucking eviscerates this guy

687
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,880
in front of like thousands of people meanwhile just talking shit about how he's the greatest

688
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:17,280
fucking Ganondorf of all time and fucking like like blowing him the fuck out it's fucking great

689
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,080
and like the game itself yeah like like a guy who's better than another person like beat him

690
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:28,080
at a video game big deal but like like the things are like the politics outside of the game is what

691
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:34,560
makes it legendary yeah yeah I saw zero walking into like a tournament recently and like the guy

692
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,800
behind him was like you know he had a buck and he was throwing banana peels just as he walked up to

693
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,840
the stage because he plays diddy kong of course yeah it was uh it was pretty yeah I like all that

694
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:51,200
shit I like when they really like buy into their character diddy kong racing yeah it's just me

695
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,320
I'm winning

696
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,360
I was I was interested like in in in like you know what I was gonna I was gonna talk about the

697
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,440
race that's coming up but actually I don't want to spoil it so I'm not gonna get into it but yeah

698
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,960
plenty of time for that in the future but I would say that like a lot of what you just talked about

699
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,920
applies and of course you would agree to like you know normal sports as well and which is

700
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,880
clearly why a lot of people get into it yeah like in principle it's the same yeah that's right

701
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,560
like like guys like bill burr who I've just been listening to him a lot like he's a giant sports

702
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,360
fan he's always talking about like players and like their their role and like oh fucking so and so

703
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,600
got his first touchdown ever yes he's just so excited for this that's uh you know people get into

704
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,360
that I I don't follow closely enough for that I basically only follow the level of like is my team

705
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:44,640
doing okay yeah brady did it oh my god I mean there's so many there's so many characters there's so

706
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,760
many like secondary and tertiary and bit player characters in sports it's they're all characters

707
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,120
none of them are real they're all characters I guess you got to get into it like you probably pick

708
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,200
out like you know the top players and like the MVPs and like those are the main characters and then

709
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,200
as you get more into it like you start to like pick up on the nuances of what's going on with more

710
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,880
people this is like one of the not a great example because it's just like one of the most famous

711
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,320
guys in the game but like Tom Brady you know like fucking quarterback of the Patriots is like

712
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,520
he has now won like the last Super Bowl they was on the table for him to win more Super Bowl

713
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,880
champions than any quarterback in history and he did it and obviously that was very exciting for me

714
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,200
and I was just like I was totally pumped about that that was really dope so uh no it's that kind of

715
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:30,880
shit it's that kind of shit yeah you want to see you want to see your guys win yeah uh the best

716
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,880
thing coming out of sports is the little b-song fuck Kevin Durant which have any of you heard of this

717
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:42,000
maybe I don't know Kevin Durant is basically I have a very limited knowledge but from what I can

718
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,760
understand this song it's a diss track and Kevin Durant is just this basketball player and then

719
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,880
this fucking guy little b who's like fucking like three feet tall just just made a just just made a

720
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,440
song about how he's gonna fucking he's gonna fuck all the NBA girls in the mouth and like and like

721
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,560
destroy Kevin Kevin Durant in a fucking in a basketball match even though he's like two feet

722
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:09,600
tall and it's awesome I hope he does so I hope he has already done so

723
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:15,920
probably all right are we going to you guys have like a javelin teacher in school the

724
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,440
javelin teacher no all right I guess you don't know what a javelin is munchie it's like a spear

725
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,840
it's like a spear oh oh oh you throw it no not like fucking joust you don't throw it it's it's

726
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,320
part of the olympics you know you have like you have the discus you have the shot put you have

727
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:38,160
the javelin yeah okay those three things we got learned them at school I don't know how common

728
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:45,040
I was but um I wasn't never very good at the shot put because I had weak arms the discus it was

729
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,680
like frisbee and I was terrible with frisbees so I couldn't do that but the javelin I got I got

730
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,120
really far with one I thought now I have the power to kill people and this is great I never

731
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,760
followed up on it but I really enjoyed throwing javelins and from then on if I had a really long

732
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,720
pointed stick I would throw it and see if it's it landed in the ground and got stuck in the ground

733
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:11,200
because sometimes it did and that was awesome sick speaking of discus I was I was actually

734
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,000
researching discus the other day like like high level discus and I never really thought about this

735
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,960
but they are like buff they're like buff guys they're they're like bare mode discus yeah I mean

736
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,680
everyone's better at sports when you're just stronger in general yeah true and it was interesting

737
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,040
to see them just fucking like go ham fucking throwing because like the discus have to they

738
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:36,320
have to be like really heavy in order to fly straight so basically they're throwing like like

739
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:43,760
like rock or or metal frisbees basically interesting very cool all right guys are we

740
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:53,520
done with sports now I don't know I don't know we haven't even talked about bicycles or swimming

741
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,400
yeah we're at like the hour mark I like it would be appropriate to switch over to questions

742
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,160
if we hadn't just completely fucked up everything up to this point

743
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,640
well perhaps yeah true true no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm having a great time I'm having

744
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,360
a great time here with all you guys my best friends yeah I fucking love ping pong even though I'm bad

745
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:25,680
at it that's a fun game I was pretty great tennis tennis is cool it's like I like it because it has

746
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:31,440
to do with your hands it's mainly just using your hands and I like using my hands don't mainly just

747
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,960
using you gotta run around you gotta run around you know you gotta you gotta make sure you hit the

748
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:40,400
ball with your thing that's that's the hard part the running around isn't the part in infinite

749
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:46,480
just infinite just taught me the tennis is basically like chess and war combined

750
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,640
tennis is like tennis is the ultimate test of a person's mental and physical okay the only thing

751
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,680
I would say about that is that like literally from all the sports manga I have read which is a million

752
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,040
you can make that case about every single sport ever invented and talk about the beauty of the game

753
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:08,480
and yeah my god these rules are the best rule like I'm reading um I'm reading robo laser beam

754
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:14,000
right now which is a uh a shonen shonen jump manga by the guy who did kuroke no basque uh kuroko

755
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,720
no basque um which is about golf this is a golf high octane sports manga and like it too like

756
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,080
because they all do goes on my god the game is fucking beautiful it's nothing is as powerful as

757
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:31,680
golf uh yeah it's like I I'm just assuming that everyone who thinks their sport is the best in

758
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:37,600
the world I'm with you well I know that that you know ishield 21 told me that american football

759
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,680
well they were actually correct because that is the greatest sport in the world and ishield 21

760
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,560
is the greatest manga in the world so they were correct it's a great manga I was actually thinking

761
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:53,120
about this the other day I was wondering whether there is like a chess uh anime or manga and people

762
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:58,320
said oh no well they they have shogi they have the japanese thing and I was like I fucking hate that

763
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:04,560
fucking weeb shit where is chess where's the ishield do they even know I don't think they

764
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,880
even play shogi in Japan I think it's just a joke that they if they're all in on them they're not

765
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,240
and they're not explaining it to the rest of us probably probably I want to see like I want to

785
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,320
only likes picnics baskets with sushi in it

786
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,840
okay actually you know what uh here's a slightly better question uh at its judgment day

787
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,440
asks uh what is the oldest work of art that you are passionate about slash would recommend

788
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,840
the oldest work of art that's like good the stone in karta

789
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:31,680
yeah stone in stone i consider that a nice sculptory sculpt

790
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,240
that's pretty good uh i like wait wait wait the the the the the the the white horse on the hill

791
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,800
things what are they called uh the spanks they're like old uh gaelic uh Celtic

792
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:51,440
fucking english things they're like hills where they carved in white rock the shape of a horse and

793
01:02:51,440 --> 01:03:01,520
it's like huge whoa uh that sounds like that thing google it guys uh i'm gonna go with uh the

794
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:07,680
works of Mozart in general i think i'm quite fond of them uh i like listening to him and i i don't

795
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,520
know maybe uh oh maybe the sistine chapel it's pretty cool i never like seen it though i just

796
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,640
think it's pretty cool cave paintings they're so old yeah yeah you can't get much older i'm trying

797
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,920
to be the oldest guy so whatever anyone says i'm gonna say i like something older because

798
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,240
that's like the hipsteriest uh i would say i really like the pyramids of geese because

799
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,560
specifically because they have that love of battleship fifty feet below it so fifty feet

800
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,560
below the pyramids of geese there is there is a love battleship that can only be powered in

801
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:42,480
times of need so so so for for instance if you need a battle in alien in alien race

802
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,440
trying to overthrow the united states government in the in the 1950s then you a south american

803
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,280
woman from peru can can mosey on over to the pyramid visa and then locate the love battleship

804
01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:00,400
that that is 50 yards 50 miles across and three atoms thick you can you can look at that that

805
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:07,120
battleship and and you can power it and and and and when once inside using the power of love and

806
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:12,720
you're aligned chakras you can drive you can drive the aliens from your land due due to

807
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:18,160
instantly making them all have the black plague that that's my favorite part about it and that's

808
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:24,240
my favorite sculpture in the entire world that's good i'm gonna say that my favorite uh my oldest

809
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:32,080
favorite work of art is the actor william hickey this is uh he played he's like this really scary

810
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:40,160
old guy he's the scariest oldest guy in every movie ever he died in 1994 and he's still the oldest

811
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:47,120
that's how old and scary he is um he played he was like this old man with like a haunted cat in the

812
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:52,000
tales from the dark side movie the cat killed him and crawled out of his throat it was really gross

813
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,800
and cool cool he's like he's so he's he's got this like scary tongue he's like he's always got a

814
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,840
scary tongue that's his main feature as an actor he played uh pete and pete's grandfather

815
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:09,680
on the adventures of pete and pete everybody go look up go go go look up like arty versus the

816
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,760
bowling ball on pete and pete he's the guy like the bowling ball kicks arty's ass and like his

817
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,640
extended fight sequence of arty versus this evil bowling ball and it kicks arty's ass and at the

818
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,200
end of it arty is like laying on the ground the bowling ball is like pinning him it's defeated him

819
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:34,880
and and like the grandfather comes out and he's like foolish man brave but foolish

820
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,960
is this is this like mystery men uh bowling ball rules where it's you know got its own will

821
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,520
and it's flying around doing shit yeah it's like like they didn't have the special effects to make

822
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:50,800
it actually fly around and do shit so it's all the actor who plays arty just like pantomining fighting

823
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,600
the bowling ball and it's the best thing ever but yeah the guy who plays pete and pete's grandpa

824
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:01,360
is my favorite work of art so canonically this character could have a mental illness and actually

825
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,440
just think that he's fighting a bowling ball no arty is a real superhero that is a real evil

826
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:12,880
bowling ball okay its power was too great for this world uh okay here we go here's the next question

827
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,400
um this is a baffling question that i want to shame this person for asking uh it's uh at dragon ring

828
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:26,880
34 asks do you think english song are inherently worse than the original song oh that's worse that's

829
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,680
the question is this person playing that every song was not in english i think that's what they're

830
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,320
proposing uh is this like an anime question or something i want to shame you for asking anime

831
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:41,440
related questions person we don't have to shame let's shame them for asking what we can only infer

832
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,560
is an anime related question but there's no other explanation i have an answer i have an answer

833
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:54,640
at this man his his his uh accusation is wrong that the english song is worse than the non english

834
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:00,960
song because on the first gorillas album there's a song called latin simone and it's a song that

835
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,240
for some reason is in spanish and it's just this like spanish guy singing the song and you're like

836
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,400
what is this you skip it every time you listen to the album you skip that stupid fucking song

837
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,080
but then on the b sides album the e p that they released entitled g size right after their first

838
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,480
album there was an english version of that song that 2d sang and it was way better and listen to

839
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,240
it and you're like oh wow this is actually a really cool song i didn't know before because it was in

840
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,640
spanish and ain't nobody speaks that shit so that's why that guy was wrong about that thing he said

841
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:35,440
just now pretty well he he said do you think english song are inherently worse than the original

842
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:45,600
song a nice my answer was gorillas right yeah shut up dude that's a bad question okay um here's

843
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:50,400
okay here's an interesting question i actually like this one a lot okay at hero cactus asks well it's

844
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:57,280
not a question but videos you would show at a job interview so which of your videos would you use at

845
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:05,200
a job job uh i don't know mine would yeah depends on the job of course uh it would be the entirety

846
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:11,840
of the japanese juggalo arc yeah that's good that's good i i would show the ending of my rayman 3s uh

847
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:19,680
three part uh where i got all the all the people playing the the band but it's oh yeah one shot

848
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:24,640
and that yeah it's if it's like an editing job i'm saying look look at what i can do with all this

849
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,200
stupid shit i don't i don't know what i'd personally pick but for you gib i think you should definitely

850
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,640
go for uh like why clopping is okay you know sexuality of my little pony i definitely go for

851
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,960
that you know that yeah they've definitely got to know my my stance on that of course it's important

852
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:50,240
agree god i love clopping jesus christ rose agree i clopped to not even ponies i clopped but not as

853
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:57,360
in mastery i just i just go to do that's what clop it sounds like probably okay here's a strange

854
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:06,720
question um at auto jk asks what is biggest letdown in your gaming history what like um i think

855
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:10,560
you say why do we have fucking well that that's because i'll tell you i have a great action for

856
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:17,120
that question my my my greatest disappointment in my gaming career was on that digi bros episode

857
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:23,680
ben owns it at downwell um was the fact spoilers yeah was the fact that i got so close and i didn't

858
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:30,480
win um it was like it was like right down to the wire but i like just fucking barely didn't do it

859
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:35,840
and if i had done it it would have been the most legendary performance of all time but alas i came

860
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:41,120
so close so that was a big that was a big letdown to me and got so far but in the end it doesn't

861
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:46,240
even matter i was gonna say that because i got killed to me it's too soon dude it's too fucking

862
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:54,000
soon chester jeez poor guy i was like debating maybe it's too soon but i bet that demon munchie

863
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,520
will say look look i'm sorry the guy's dead but to stop saying the memes that we've been saying

864
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:09,040
for literally decades now somebody watch told me the next one died don't say it oh no uh yeah i want

865
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:13,040
is about my biggest gaming disappointment i of course had to bring up my loss in the pokemon

866
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:18,080
race which was absolutely devastating uh on a deep level everyone go watch that and the other one

867
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:24,000
the other one that that comes to mind is uh yeah long ago when ben and i were first playing uh mario

868
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,840
rpg legend of the seven stars oh god i know we've talked about this before i i think but like so

869
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,520
we had gone through the whole game i was watching ben play as i as i used to because we were very

870
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,440
little back then this i was like seven or eight or something and ben was playing and we were both we

871
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,680
just both i'd watched him play like the whole game and he was fighting smithy the final boss

872
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,720
and on our we was down to the wire only malo i believe was still alive and on like we there's

873
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,760
this move psychopath that just tells you how much hp the enemy has i don't remember exactly who was

874
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,080
alive but i remember that the last thing that happened was we right we used psychopath to see

875
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:02,480
how much hp smithy had and he had around like 34 or something and the average attack did like a hunt

876
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:07,840
like would have killed if we had just attacked we would have won and then he killed us all on his

877
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:14,800
next turn and we wept we wept like we babes in the crib it was brutal it was absolutely brutal

878
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,040
but even though like we could have just tried again like we were just such babies at video games

879
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,520
then we like didn't it was just so sad to like lose to a final boss because we'd been we'd been

880
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,240
trying like for a long time like we'd been trying like all day i think and we were like so we were

881
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:33,120
so close yeah yeah and it was and to our little pea brain minds it was just devastating and we

882
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,920
tried and did we did we get our hoots back up and like fight again immediately like later that day

883
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:43,040
no i think we tried i think we tried again another day yeah i think you're right guys i think i think

884
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:50,640
that was the end for for that time for that session i agree it was brutal yeah there have been

885
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:58,080
multiple times where i've like tried like tried really hard and failed so many times i've just

886
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,080
given up and said fuck this game i'll never play it again and then you know a week later i'll pick

887
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:08,000
it up yeah so but there's not like one specific one that's so notable that i can remember it

888
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:15,040
i'm just i just know that sometimes i get mad at video games yeah yeah that's all i know as well

889
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,360
that's the only thing i know about video games is that they make me mad sometimes but you know

890
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:27,520
what easy come easy go you never shine if you don't grow whatever uh all right well okay here's

891
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:33,760
just a question to for us to go out on at jam skmain something like that asks uh this isn't easy

892
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:39,200
this is a little fucking lab which pcp member do you think will die first it's bumpy it's obviously

893
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:45,440
bumpy oh yeah yeah it's definitely he's gonna kill himself there you go um any debate any debate

894
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:52,080
about this actually um yeah um i think he's uh i think he's coward and i challenge him to do it

895
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,960
and prove us all wrong oh i i i think i at what i don't remember which episode but i i i i i've

896
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,800
got i'm just kidding please god i'm just kidding i i did i think i also said that in a different

897
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,000
episode pen yeah in this in the suicide podcast i think we made bets on this and i believe i

898
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,640
bet that he would never commit suicide it was actually my bet you know you know here's the

899
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:17,760
thing i would i would say i would say he's not gonna do it i would say that about most people

900
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,360
but you know what then you say that and then they do it and then you look like you then you get

901
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:28,320
all over your face yeah he wants that you know i've been going around all this time saying

902
