00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm back. I'm not dead. Tom's back. Tom's back. Tom will never die.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Special guest, Tom Oliver.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It was true what they said. They said you wouldn't die and you didn't. I'm sorry if I got really loud right there. I'm fucking with my audacity volume.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not that affects Discord, so I probably can't hear that at all.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, you wouldn't hear that, but the audience will have to deal with it.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, Eleazar, fix that.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nah, Eleazar, let them cope. Let them cope and sieve.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So let's wake up those headphone users. Let's give them something to think about.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That I was momentarily loud. Yes. Long time no see. You haven't been on one month. It's got to be like a month now, right?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
At least. It's been ridiculous.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What have you possibly been doing that could be more important than our business here?

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
On The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Working on secret projects.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh god, not you too.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Dude, we all have secret projects. I saw your secret projects. It's pretty cool.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's pretty cool. Thank you. It's not secret anymore, I guess.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's a project. It's just a project now.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now it's just a project. Now it's just a project.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The mystique is gone, but the glory remains.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Wait, I want to...

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Last week, I had five people have beaten the demo.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It was a crack, munchy, shinny, Sean, and Tio.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And one more shining god joined the ranks for a total of six.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Earning the name. Six ascended beings.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And his name was Roboblo. Roboblo has ascended.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Six people. Notable failures to complete the game include Gib and Take, the best guy ever.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And the other, and you know, they're in good company though.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The other seven plus billion human beings on the planet.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Everybody else on the planet, you know?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
All embarrassments. All embarrassments.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They're just not willing to put the work in.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a test of patience and they fail.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Like any good RPG, it's all about the grind.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And the first step on the grind is to go to patreon.com.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you have the will? Do you have the sheer resolve to click?

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
To type your mom the funny little numbers on the back of your mom's.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It demands a lot of you.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It really is the dark souls of role playing games.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, that's the first hurdle you got to get over.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Only then can the challenge truly begin.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I mean, that sounds ridiculous.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But when you think about it, every video game, the first step is to pay for it.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So really, you're asking nothing more than any other video game developer would.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I guess so. I mean, I mean, I only play free games a lot of the time.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Or I guess that's not true anymore. I guess that's not true anymore.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You've been playing Noida for like,

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
About 600 hours.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I've clocked about 600 hours in Noida now.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's insane.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's fucked up. It's horrible.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I had a run. I had the run the other day.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I finally got to a state where I was immune to everything I needed to be immune to.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And I got a glass cannon, which, among other things, just makes everything you do do way more damage.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And all explosions have like five times their radius.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then I got nukes.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And I had fire immunity and explosion immunity.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So I was immune to my own nukes.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And my nukes were five times as big.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So I could literally like, I could literally just bomb an entire biome out of existence with a single nuke.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I crashed the game because I nuked the vault so hard that all the dead enemies that died to a single nuke blast just rained gold down on me.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And there was so much gold raining down on me that it crashed the game.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Is that what it feels like to have bought Dogecoin at a fraction of a penny?

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Not anymore.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And when it puked 71 cents a few days ago.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
A few days ago, not anymore.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Everyone was waiting for Elon to fucking bring the second coming of Doge, but it tanked like 40%.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Elon was too cringe.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Elon was too cringe on SNL and it tanked Dogecoin.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I mean, did anybody expect, I mean, no one expected it to be cool, did they?

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, but honestly.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The man's many things, but cool is not one of them.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Honestly, I was like thinking, I was like, Elon's going on SNL tonight.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There will never be a more like mainstream moment for Dogecoin to be mentioned.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I thought to myself, I probably should just buy Dogecoin because he's going to mention Dogecoin on SNL and Lyon go up.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Lyon will go up.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm shooting myself in the foot by not buying Dogecoin, but I didn't do it.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I was totally wrong.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Lyon went down.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was expecting it to go up too.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You would think so because every time he mentions it, it goes up.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, I guess when you put on a Wario suit, you kind of just lose all that goodwill.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't understand.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't understand.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The pattern was so clear.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't get it.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's recovered a little bit, I think.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And then I saw people angry on Twitter because just like with GME, not Coinbase,

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Robinhood was not letting them cash their Dogecoin out as it was falling.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They were like, what the fuck? Why can't I cash my Dogecoin out?

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's why it wasn't updating because I was looking at it last night.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That was happening.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There were just no numbers.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I was like, oh, is my internet fucked up or something?

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, I guess Robinhood once again decided to be scum.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I mean, what would we expect at this point?

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They've shown their hand.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
They really have.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The fact that I still use that service is a blight upon my name.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I signed up for an account when the shit was going down, but I never ended up using it for anything.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Good.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I did an account with an app called KuCoin that Brian from Clear Value Tax recommended.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And I fucked around with it a little bit.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I put in like $100 to just kind of fuck around with some of the shit in there

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
because they got weird things in that app.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You can sort of design parameters for a bot that will autotrade for you.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What's the other one?

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You can put your money up for micro loans that other people will borrow from you

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and then repay with interest.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is this the thing you were talking about before,

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
where you're running it to see how long it would autotrade and min-max your gains?

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah, I mentioned it a while ago.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because I did that a while ago.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And I mean, Brian from Clear Value Tax says that he gets like a fucking 25% return on his investment per year,

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
which is like an unbelievable return on investment.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But I realized that the downside is that you have to check it every day

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and you have to update your parameters every day.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And I'm just not willing to do that.

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Come on, boring things to do, like make video games.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But I'm fucked because the money that is in there is in crypto.

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I can't just withdraw the money from it.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have to send it to some transfer service.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I have to make use of some third-party another app to cash my own money back out.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So fuck that.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Maybe it could make huge gains, but I'm just, I won't stick with it.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I won't check it all the time.

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm not Brian.

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm no Brian.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And you're right, making video games is more important.

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It is.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In the grand scheme of things.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's way more important.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I have to prove once and for all that 2D video games are just better.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I have to make the ultimate two-dimensional video game.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's a shame.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're choosing the inferior dimensions.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I can hear you.

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Are my headphones dead?

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh my God, my headphones are dead.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
One sec.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Typical attitude from a 2D scrub, not having his headphones ready to go.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Meanwhile, the Chad 3D over here.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm back.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm sorry if I was talking over you.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If it was, it was because my headphones died.

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was just giving you shit for being a 2D person.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I just think they're neat.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I just think sprites are where it's at.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Pokemon peaked in Gen 5 and it's all been downhill from there.

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So, I mean, what more proof do you need?

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't know.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Final Fantasy 7 is 3D.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's pretty good.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
People seem to like Final Fantasy 7.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I like 6.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I like 6.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I've never played Final Fantasy 7, so I can't say.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm just going off what other people have told me.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is that right?

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You never did?

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Have you played 6?

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I own it.

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I haven't played 6.

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I didn't have a Super Nintendo back when I was a second kid.

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I never beat 6.

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
7 was the first Final Fantasy I played.

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I think I played 8.

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think I played 9.

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I never beat 9.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think I went back and I played 6.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I got to the end of 9 and then my memory card died.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I got to the end of 9 and I didn't beat 9 either.

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Same story with 6 and 9.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I just lost.

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's the worst.

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I just lost momentum at the very end.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Some day.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now they have the PC ports where you can speed up the battles and stuff.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Maybe I could justify in my busy life going through the game at Mach 10.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't care because I got to the only good part of 9,

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
which is the part where you're not alone plays.

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I got to that part.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I've seen the best it has to offer.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't need anymore.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The whole game is great.

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But to each their own.

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's fine.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's got 2D and 3D.

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's got 3D characters and 2D backgrounds.

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's a marriage of two contrasting mediums.

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I guess it does have 2D backgrounds.

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Kinda.

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are they all 2D?

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Does it have all painted backgrounds?

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The overworld and the battle areas are modeled,

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
but all the actual environments you move around in, they're all pre-rendered.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I didn't even know that.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, wait, 7 and 8 are the same, right?

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Are 7 and 8 like that?

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, they all use the pre-rendered backgrounds.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Right.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah.

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's pretty cool.

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
My game is an RPG.

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's it.

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's true.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're not wrong.

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's all I have to say.

214
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Incredible.

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This week, I've been spriting.

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I've been spriting.

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I wanted fancier animations for the things that Phantom does.

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I made a nice animation for when he drinks.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I made a nice animation for when he throws.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I was right before we started.

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I was working on one, a better one for when...

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Wait, I'm not going to say what the last one is.

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's all just totally aesthetic stuff that doesn't actually get me any closer to releasing the...

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, but it feels good.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm not doing it for money.

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm not making this game so that I can make ends meet and put food on the table.

227
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Why not just let it take however long it takes and just make it a masterpiece?

228
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's how you do it.

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Just ignore the proper production and just chase whatever weird, fancy, straightforward stuff of the day.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Exactly.

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Progression doesn't need to be a straight line.

232
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Fuck that.

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Exactly.

234
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Do I know what your secret project...

235
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Have you mentioned it to me or do I also not know?

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have not mentioned it to anybody.

237
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't think.

238
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Anybody?

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't think so.

240
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't think I've talked to any of you guys about it.

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll probably be revealing it soon, though, based on the progress that's being made.

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But I haven't just been doing a secret project.

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I did a bunch of Patreon stuff, like I send out physical rewards to patrons, and I'm finishing up those.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I made a Zoomie...

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll put a picture in the chat.

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I did a Zoomie cookie cutters, and I did a Zoomie little figures, and then I printed and folded up some little boxes.

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So you can put little figures in boxes.

248
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It looks pretty cool.

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let me see.

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Not that I'm complaining, but what possessed you to make a Zoomie cookie cutters?

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What gave you that idea?

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It was just something I learned how to do, and so I was like, oh, let's try.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's see what happens.

254
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And it worked.

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because I had a 3D printer.

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I had 3D modeling software, and it's like, alright, let's make a cookie cutter and see what happens.

257
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And it worked.

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And there they are.

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's pretty sick, and it took a lot of figuring out.

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But that was one of the things I've been doing instead of being on the podcast, was figuring out how to make all that.

261
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
My headphones are dead again.

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh my God.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Pat.

264
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Jesus.

265
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Pat, oh my God.

266
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
How is this possible?

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What did you do last time if you didn't fix the problem?

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Has he been this unprofessional the entire time I haven't been on the podcast, or is this a new thing that happens just when I show up?

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm back.

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't know.

271
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know.

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The batteries are fucked up.

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Have you made cookies with them, though?

274
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I have not, because cookies aren't keto.

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, right, your keto.

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, so.

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I have been eating so many Parkview cheddar brats.

278
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, I get those all the time, too.

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
From Aldi?

280
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yep.

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Hell yeah.

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Hell yeah.

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They just, they finally restocked the keto bread at my local Aldi.

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I've never seen that at mine, which really sucks, but.

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They don't, they don't stock it there?

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So I just, to make lettuce wraps, it's fine.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Honestly, I need to eat more greens.

289
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I need to eat more vegetables.

290
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The only vegetables I eat these days are like, sometimes I'll put a slice of tomato on like a BLT or something.

291
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's not enough.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's not enough.

293
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No, you gotta, I don't have enough vegetables either, but whatever.

294
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's so much easier and cheaper to just get a cheddar fucking thing.

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Just get a cheddar brought.

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, just put it in the fucking microwave or whatever and be like, all right, whatever.

297
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Fuck it.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Just eat a cold slimy out of the fridge, you know, whatever.

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's true.

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
They're pre-cooked.

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's fine.

302
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I do that sometimes.

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Sometimes I get like the, the ballpark Franks they have there and just be like, I don't

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
need to fucking do good and just like whatever.

305
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I got work to do.

306
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The best, I was shocked, I was shocked by this, but the best deal.

307
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think one of the best deals on like fatty meat, you know, the cornerstone of any keto

308
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
diet that I have found is at Costco, no, not Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club.

309
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
They sell like boxes of like six packs of like five hot dogs.

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So it's like 30 hot dogs in a box.

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
They're Oscar Meyer, which you would, you would think that like name brand wouldn't be as cheap,

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
but BJ's Wholesale Club, these boxes of hot dogs, they're so, they're really cheap.

313
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
They're really cheap.

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I think, I think like the Instacart like just started servicing BJ's.

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So I've like, I've recently gained access to these dogs.

316
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Also, little disappointing story, disappointing story for me today.

317
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I ordered sparkling water and Instacart said that sparkling water, that there was like a

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
different set of flavors.

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Whereas before I would always get berry, lemon and lime.

320
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It said that, oh, now we're selling packs of berry, lime and peach, ginger.

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I was like, oh my God, this is going to change everything.

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is going to shake up my routine.

323
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I ordered them and no, it was a lie.

324
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They're the same.

325
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They got the same old, same three.

326
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Nice.

327
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's great.

328
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You just can't trust Instacart.

329
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
A lot of the times like the shoppers I get from Instacart, they'll just swap things

330
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
without telling you that they've swapped things.

331
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And so you just get completely random shit that you didn't ask for.

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That has happened very rarely.

333
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That has happened very rarely to me.

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And I have taken, I take great pains to like, if I'm concerned that like they might make

335
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
like now whenever I order from Aldi and I get the gridlocks, I or I like specifically type

336
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
in the text box like, hi, please only get the red and white gridlocks.

337
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you.

338
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Or if I'm ordering the ice cream, like please only get the keto ice cream.

339
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Like I specifically tell them because like I've had some people like, oh, they'll just

340
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
replace it with some other ice cream or oh, they'll just replace it with some other bread.

341
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Like, ah, bread's bread, right?

342
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No.

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Fools.

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But it's, it's when I, when I'm fucking let them know, they generally don't fuck with

345
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
me.

346
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I've had pretty good luck with my, with that.

347
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And I always get, I always give them a five star review, even though I don't know if it

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
helps them at all.

349
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Probably doesn't, unfortunately.

350
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Probably not.

351
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah.

352
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Sad.

353
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Probably just boost the app in the algorithm or something.

354
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You're just helping the corporation.

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We just don't know.

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't.

357
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Speaking of corporations, I love how Facebook is super pissed.

358
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Did you hear about that?

359
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No.

360
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What's up with Facebook?

361
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So do you know how like there's been a big spat between Facebook and Apple for the last

362
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
like couple months?

363
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No.

364
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You heard about that.

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So Apple is rolling out this new feature and it just launched like a couple of weeks

366
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,700
ago in the new version of like the iPhone's OS where it will, every time an application

367
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,000
tries to track you, a little pop up will come up.

368
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's like, this app wants to track you.

369
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,800
Do you allow it to and that like fucks Facebook's entire business because they're, it's all

370
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,800
about stealthily tracking you across all your fucking shit and selling that data to advertisers.

371
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,000
And Apple's like, well, we don't sell ads.

372
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So let's just let our users know that all their data is being stolen.

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,100
And so like, I guess the opt out rate has been 96% in the first like month that this

374
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,840
feature has been available and Facebook's like fucking panicking because like their entire

375
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,560
business is like being blown up right now.

376
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
It's pretty funny.

377
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Is it Apple's fault?

378
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,280
I don't, I don't quite understand.

379
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
So key.

380
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,120
So the problem here is that people are opting out of having their data harvested, right?

381
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Like that's the problem.

382
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Yeah.

383
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,480
I mean, it's a problem for Facebook.

384
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,320
It's good for the users, arguably, because like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

385
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,200
All these applications, you know, there's, there's something, there's like a unique code

386
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:57,160
attached to your iPhone and that code allows the data to be transferred between applications

387
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,600
because it puts, it basically puts a name to the face, right?

388
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,120
It's like every time you do something, it matches us up with that code.

389
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,720
So other apps know what you're shopping for, what you're searching for and things like

390
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
that.

391
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,840
And so Apple added a feature where instead of it just doing that automatically and sharing

392
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,240
that number, it's like, if you don't want to share this data, you can opt out and we'll

393
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,840
just send zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero for the number.

394
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,520
So it can't match you with anything.

395
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,400
So the data that it gets is useless.

396
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,320
So this was like Apple being like two pro consumer, right?

397
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,920
And it like fucked Facebook over.

398
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
That's the problem.

399
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Exactly.

400
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Yeah.

401
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,280
And they like took out a big like ad in the New York Times saying Apple's attacking small

402
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,600
businesses that rely on our ad platform.

403
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,520
So we're sticking up to Apple and all this shit.

404
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,200
But then you listen to their earnings call and all the investors are like, oh, we're

405
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
so fucked.

406
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Oh, shit.

407
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
This is really bad.

408
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Our business is going to be so fucked.

409
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
And it's pretty funny.

410
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I hate.

411
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
I just hate them.

412
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,200
So fucking sucks so much.

413
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Jesus Christ.

414
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Yeah.

415
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I mean, it's it's grimy.

416
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Did you see those?

417
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I don't know.

418
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Did you see those?

419
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,720
Um, the ad, like you seem like anti-union ads.

420
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:14,200
Oh, they're the worst, the worst, like the one from I used to be in a union, take my

421
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
idea.

422
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,000
Why would I pay dues to a union?

423
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,200
My employer handles it all better for me anyway, you know.

424
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,720
Do you remember last year all the right to repair for your mongering ads that were airing

425
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
in Massachusetts?

426
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,680
I didn't really see the ads, but I heard about the repair stuff.

427
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,920
They were so funny.

428
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,920
There was this one ad where like it was like first person of some like creepy guy in a parking

429
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,120
lot and some like vulnerable young woman walks over to her car and tries to unlock it.

430
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,840
And then this guy comes and like, it cuts to black as like she gets like assaulted and

431
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,600
it's like, right, to repair will allow your family to get raped.

432
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,840
And it's just like, no, come on, that's not it.

433
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,160
What does that mean?

434
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,280
It just means they're just fear mongering like, oh, if anybody can access the proprietary

435
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,520
information of your car, they can like remotely unlock your car and hack your car and attack

436
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
your family.

437
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,960
Like he could get into the car because he hacked into the mainframe.

438
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Yeah.

439
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Yeah.

440
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
It's some really dumb shit.

441
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,920
I'm so embarrassed for my state right now.

442
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
So it's a security.

443
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,720
They're saying that a right to repair prevents a secure, presents a security risk.

444
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,600
I guess I see, okay, fair.

445
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,960
You know, I'm convinced no, no one, no one article, whatever.

446
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Yeah.

447
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Whatever the fuck it was.

448
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Yeah.

449
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Or that, oh God, what company is it?

450
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,280
Which one of the airlines was like, instead of paying your union fees, you can buy a new

451
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
game console.

452
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Yeah.

453
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Shit.

454
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Fuck yeah.

455
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Delta was Delta who did that.

456
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Right.

457
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,040
They were, why don't you fucking buy me a fucking.

458
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,920
Jokes on you Delta, no one can buy a fucking video game console.

459
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
They're all sold out.

460
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Oh yeah.

461
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Oh yeah.

462
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,200
They still, people still can't get PS5s.

463
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,440
The, the silicon shortage is probably going to be going all the way to the end of next

464
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
year.

465
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
The rate things are going.

466
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Jesus.

467
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,160
Like $300 graphics cards right now are being resold for almost 1500.

468
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,000
That just because they're impossible to find.

469
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,520
That is fucked up.

470
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,160
The shortage is so bad, like before, like they would launch a card at MSRP, they'd immediately

471
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,600
sell out because like people are using bots to like scalp them all.

472
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,960
Now like now the stores are just selling them for three times as much because they're like,

473
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,480
if they're going to sell for that, we might as well make three times the money.

474
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Yeah.

475
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,400
And it's just like, it just doesn't, you can't get cards for normal prices.

476
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,800
And there's like, all of the manufacturing is done in Taiwan and Taiwan's facing a huge

477
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
drought right now.

478
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,800
And one of the most important things you need to manufacture silicon is like fresh water.

479
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,840
So it's just going to get worse.

480
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,160
It's so fucking bad.

481
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Wow.

482
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Yeah.

483
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
It's a nightmare.

484
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Fuck.

485
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,720
Well, like, God, I hope nothing happens to my fucking computer, man.

486
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,040
Oh, shit.

487
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,320
It's like really bad.

488
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,040
And then like there was another cryptocurrency that's trying to mine using hard drive.

489
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,680
So now like hard drive prices might start skyrocketing too.

490
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,440
And it's just, yeah, it's great.

491
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
It's super cool.

492
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Very good.

493
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Very good.

494
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Yeah.

495
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,640
That's unfortunate.

496
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,520
I've just wanted a new graphics card and I can't get one because they're just impossible.

497
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,600
It's like, I'm not going to spend $2,000 for a $400 graphics card.

498
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
I refuse.

499
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:36,720
I was watching stream highlights from your movie Sucks where he was watching the Dar Man

500
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
videos.

501
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,320
Do you know what those are?

502
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
No.

503
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
What's that?

504
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,120
I mentioned it just because there was one video.

505
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,280
It was like it was about like Christmas where like a girl wants to be a girl gamer, but

506
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,760
her mom doesn't think girls can play video games.

507
00:24:52,760 --> 00:25:01,440
So her brother gets a PS5 for Christmas and she's not allowed to play it because girls

508
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,240
can't play video games.

509
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
The Dar Man.

510
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,320
Is this a new thing then if it's a PS5?

511
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,880
Well, the video was new.

512
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,040
I mean, this is a huge channel.

513
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,680
It's got like seven million subscribers and it gets like tens of millions of views.

514
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Okay.

515
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,120
I hadn't really heard about it, but like I've seen things like it before.

516
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:28,320
The Dar Man is basically a guy who runs a channel where the thumbnail and the title

517
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:41,360
will be like something like Lady Accuses Black Man of kidnapping a child, but instantly regrets

518
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
it.

519
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Right?

520
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,320
It's sort of phrased as though it's like candid footage of like, oh, we caught someone

521
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,560
being racist or we caught someone.

522
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
But it's not that.

523
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,880
It's a skit.

524
00:25:51,880 --> 00:26:00,800
It's like an overly dramatic, like sort of tear jerking skit that like where like someone

525
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,600
is mean to someone or bullies someone or is racist or bigoted or something.

526
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,040
And then they are made the fool and they learn a valuable lesson.

527
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:17,760
And it's always like, you judge me for being a black woman raising a white daughter.

528
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:25,800
Well, you see, I knew her mother and she died of cancer and she was my best friend.

529
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,760
And I promised to raise that baby.

530
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,960
And I'm so sorry I judged you for being a black woman with a white daughter.

531
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,640
You ever forgive me?

532
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Fascinating.

533
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,560
So of course they have millions of subscribers.

534
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,640
They have so many fucking views.

535
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,480
They get so many fucking views.

536
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,200
They get and it's like, what are we doing, Ben?

537
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Why are we doing this?

538
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,520
We're doing an hour long podcast every week, trying to make art with integrity when all

539
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,760
we need to do is just Eleazar, what I want you to do.

540
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,320
I want you to make the thumbnail, go to the Darman YouTube channel and see his thumbnails

541
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,480
and just make the thumbnail for this episode look like that big text on the left and a

542
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:24,200
face on the right and title this one, I don't know, podcasters, podcasters, I don't know,

543
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,360
make a new episode but instantly regret it.

544
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
That's just every week.

545
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
What are you talking about?

546
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,960
Yeah, but we got to make it a title and it's got to be in all caps.

547
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,240
And yeah, yeah, we're going, we're going corporate.

548
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,000
We got to appeal to lowest common denominator.

549
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,760
The only market that's left, it's the only market that pays, got to get those 15 year

550
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,440
olds to click on our links constantly.

551
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,040
And it's like, you know, every every episode he ends with like, you know, share this video

552
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,280
around if you like this message, share this video around because you're not just, we're

553
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,000
not just telling stories, we're changing lives, right?

554
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,800
The message is like, yeah, the message is like, this is a video about how racism is

555
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
bad.

556
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,680
If you think racism is bad, you'll share this video.

557
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,720
Left unsaid is and if you don't share this video, then what is that fucking thing about

558
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
you?

559
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Jesus Christ.

560
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,240
Oh, there's one, there's one that's like pro cop.

561
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
People in my discord were showing me these this morning.

562
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,720
There's one that's pro cop and it's like the lady is like, fire all cops, all cops are

563
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
bad.

564
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,600
And then she gets mugged and she's like, oh, help police.

565
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:45,040
And the cop is like, anytime, ma'am, you see, everyone judges me for being a cop.

566
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,460
Everyone thinks that I'm bad and I'm racist.

567
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,440
But actually I'm just trying to put food on the table for my black wife and our mixed

568
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
race daughter.

569
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:59,400
And so you see, before you hate me, get to know me before you judge me and it's treated

570
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,160
exact same being a cop, being a cop, it's just the same.

571
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,640
It's just the same as being a hard put upon black mom raising a white daughter and nobody

572
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
understands you.

573
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,600
It's the same goddamn thing.

574
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,400
Every goddamn time, tragic.

575
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:22,560
Oh, my God, pure art over there, it's hideous, it's hideous, hideous abomination of a channel.

576
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
It's a nightmare.

577
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,800
And of course YouTube rewards it, I don't know, I droves, I guess it's kids, I guess

578
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,920
it's kids that just, I don't know, want to be preached to or something.

579
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
I don't.

580
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,800
It's the calls to action, dude, I was because I was thinking about this because I was like,

581
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,840
it's the clickable thumbnail, it's the clickbait title, and it's the calls to the irresistible

582
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
calls to action.

583
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,080
I was thinking about like, because I remember Fred Letter Media hit a million subscribers,

584
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,520
like, I think last year they finally hit a million subscribers despite being around

585
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,120
for like a decade.

586
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,200
And I think it might have been on the podcast, we were asking the question like, why is

587
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,320
Fred Letter Media like so prevalent in popular culture, but like didn't have nearly as much

588
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,520
subscribers as they should get sitting all along, they've been active, and it's because

589
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,720
they have no calls to action.

590
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,040
Like people are just that fucking brain dead that they would need to have to like end every

591
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,000
video, like comment, subscribe, and they don't, and that's probably why they've only grown

592
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,720
like a tenth of what they probably should be considering their otherwise cultural impact.

593
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Maybe.

594
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Maybe.

595
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,160
I think people, you know what, because like I think about putting calls to action in

596
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,600
my content, but I'm just like, nobody needs that.

597
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,080
And I'm like, no, the brain dead masses need to be told what to do.

598
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm not, I'm not above, I'm not above a call to action.

599
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
I know it works.

600
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm, well, that's the whole thing.

601
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,640
Like I'm not saying that I'm above it.

602
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,440
I just feel like my natural like gut reaction is like it's not necessary, but it really

603
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
is.

604
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
Yeah, it really is.

605
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,680
I mean, I mean, you know, people like the red letter media guys because they come off

606
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,160
as pretty genuine.

607
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,240
And part of that is that they don't do a lot of calls to action.

608
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,000
They don't do a lot of like, you to be like, comment, subscribe stuff.

609
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,480
They can't because as soon as they do, it's like, don't you guys do the nerd crew?

610
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,720
Like this is blurring the lines a little bit.

611
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,520
Like they've kind of locked themselves into not being able to, I mean, they obviously

612
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,680
they don't need to because they're still really successful, but it's just like it's, they're

613
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,660
just such a good case study for like, despite making great content consistently for a long

614
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,040
time and like really having a large like impact on just like the kind of like internet culture

615
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,800
at large, their subscriber count really doesn't reflect it because they're not jingling the

616
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,440
keys in front of people.

617
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:43,880
I mean, is their content like, I know to you and I, maybe like red letter media seems like

618
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,280
very digestible, like appeals to everyone content.

619
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
But is it though?

620
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,040
Like is, like it's film, even like humorous film criticism, is film criticism like the

621
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:03,500
kind of thing that like, you know, is it, is it universal in the same way that like a melodramatic

622
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,000
skit about how racism makes people feel bad is universal?

623
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,040
You're not going to get to fucking whatever that channel is called.

624
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Dar man.

625
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Dar man.

626
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,480
You know, you're not going to get Dar man, J station numbers off of Plinkett reviews,

627
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,960
but it just seems like they're still, they're still underrepresented.

628
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,120
Like I think they probably could have like two or three million subs if they actually

629
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,000
like promoted themselves.

630
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:39,280
Maybe the struggle struggle is real struggle this week, I know it's been time has been

631
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,040
going faster and faster, but this week in particular, like I feel like we just did

632
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,200
the last one.

633
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,560
I've been, I've been working on the game, like the whole week and I feel like I didn't

634
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
get anything done.

635
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,720
I feel like all I did was I got some sprites done and I, and I put in some animations and

636
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,600
I'm like, that's, that takes a long fucking time.

637
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,960
I've been doing animation stuff for the last like couple of weeks and it just takes forever.

638
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,840
Cause like you just have to like stare at the frames and be like, do I tweak this?

639
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,680
Do I tweak that?

640
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,440
And it just, it's a lot of like monotonous, just like tweaks and shit.

641
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,840
It's, it's pretty fun.

642
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,520
I like it a lot because I get, I get lots of little like moment, like I get lots of

643
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,600
making this game.

644
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,400
I do find some things are very difficult, but other things are simple and give me lots

645
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,880
of opportunity for like small moments of success that I can enjoy.

646
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:46,120
Like, you know, I, I, I mentioned all those like new animations that I added this week

647
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,040
and every single, each time I successfully made one, I'm like, yes, it looks really

648
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
good when he does that now.

649
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,440
Like, oh, another one.

650
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,080
Yeah, bam, another one in the bag.

651
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,520
You know, I had to make one, I made, I figured out one little change I could do that would

652
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,960
make them like when you take damage instead of the number just changing instantly, it

653
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,600
like kind of rolls down sort of like earthbound and it looks way better.

654
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,120
And I'm like, yes, I nail it.

655
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,760
It's just got to get that juice.

656
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,240
It's all fucking good.

657
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,080
It's like, it's like that physics professor I had that one year who told us that when

658
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,200
you solve a problem, feel good about it.

659
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,720
Let yourself feel good when you solve a problem so that your brain will learn that

660
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,200
solving physics problems is good and you'll be motivated to do more.

661
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,000
Your physics professor was the best game dev teacher you could ask for.

662
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,560
He was a fucking Buddhist hippie.

663
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,840
And he was huge.

664
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,680
He was huge, huge, like fat or huge, like swole.

665
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,200
No, just very tall.

666
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,880
He wasn't, he wasn't fat.

667
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,160
He wasn't skinny either.

668
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,040
He was like, he was, you know, a normal build, but he was like, he was like six

669
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
foot eight or something.

670
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,640
He was just like, yeah, he was a giant.

671
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,720
Yeah, based.

672
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,120
That's pretty sick.

673
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,640
Yeah.

674
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,920
Are you coding the game in Python or like, I am coding the game in GML, which is just

675
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,920
like the proprietary game maker code.

676
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,040
It's very similar to Python and a lot.

677
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,600
Like I've, yeah, it's, it's, it's a lot like Python.

678
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,920
Cool, cool.

679
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,600
What it, I don't know, what do you fucking do?

680
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,680
What do you fucking do?

681
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,280
Huh?

682
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,120
What do I do?

683
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
What do you fucking do?

684
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,400
I make polygons move.

685
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,200
Do you, do you, do you code shit?

686
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,320
Um, I've done a little bit of Python and I've looked a little bit into C sharp and a

687
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,120
little bit into, uh, what's it called?

688
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,760
A GD script, which is Godot's native scripting language.

689
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,120
I'm not good at any of them.

690
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,760
Remind me, which we're interested in the animation side, but I don't.

691
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,280
Okay.

692
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,600
To, to make like the, to make like the, like the combat, the, like the turn based

693
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:11,280
combat system, I basically just followed a, a, a, a tutorial that I found on YouTube.

694
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,960
Um, there's a lot of junk code in there that is just like, like there's a whole

695
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,360
like magic menu that's in there that I just put in there because the tutorial told me

696
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,720
to, um, but it doesn't do anything and you can't access it, but it's just there

697
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,000
because I was following the tutorial.

698
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,360
Um, that's in there.

699
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,440
And then that, like that part was hard and like, there were parts of it where like,

700
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,640
okay, well, he told me to do it this way, but I want to modify it.

701
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,240
I want to change it.

702
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,840
So it does this.

703
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,160
Okay.

704
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,240
And like that was hard, but like after that, basically everything else that I've done

705
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,200
code wise, almost everything else that I've added on top of it is just like increasingly

706
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:59,440
complex, like sets of if else statements and it's just, I don't feel like I'm, I know

707
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,280
anything, I don't feel like I'm doing anything.

708
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,240
It's surprising how far you can get with if statements, variables and like a basic kind

709
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,200
of like state machine and you're just like, Oh, that's like, yeah, that is exactly what

710
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,760
it is.

711
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
That's exactly what it is.

712
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,560
It's like the basic loop of the game is that like, you know, the character is there.

713
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,080
Then like the menu is active.

714
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,120
You select something in the menu, you select it.

715
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,760
And then the menu goes into wait mode.

716
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,520
The character does a little thing.

717
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,920
He has a little timer that counts down while he does his thing.

718
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,520
And then when he finishes doing the thing, it ticks the box that makes him go back to

719
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,080
wait mode and the menu goes back to active mode, rinse and repeat.

720
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,920
And then in those little actions, it's just a series of, you know, calculate these

721
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,400
numbers, apply these numbers, move it here and there, change his right to this and that.

722
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,400
Yeah, yeah, it's amazing how much of video games is just if those statements.

723
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah, I used, I used a list.

724
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,320
I used a list function because the tutorial told me to.

725
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,640
So I used one list and everything else is just like, if this statement is true, then

726
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,680
do this when you hit the spacebar.

727
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,320
I think the most complicated thing I did in the Izumi and Vertical Slice game was

728
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,960
putting in the dialogue system because I couldn't find a tutorial for it.

729
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,040
And I wanted to have it so it would pull text, put it into the box, have it like

730
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,040
print out in a typewriter text kind of format, and then also pull up the

731
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,680
character's name and portrait with different expressions to go with each line of dialogue.

732
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,560
So I ended up using like a 3D array.

733
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,800
Oh, it was really weird because like I put all the 3D array.

734
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:53,120
Yeah, it's like so as in like so as in like dimension like like axis one is like

735
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:58,080
what character axis two is like what expression and like what axis three is, I

736
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,000
don't know, I don't know.

737
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,120
It was like it was like X and Y.

738
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,760
And then the Z was just that like each Z was like different array.

739
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,320
So it was like arrays nested inside arrays.

740
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,400
So there would be like you would have, oh God, it's been so long.

741
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,840
I have a whole video explaining how I did it.

742
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,560
But there was like one that had the name of the character that was speaking, the

743
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,600
line, and those would be two different columns with the same row.

744
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,400
And then the rows would have a number and it would just like iterate through

745
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,400
those numbers and then on the second array and like the third, like the Z axis, that

746
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,040
would be the, it would call the animation frames for the portrait sprite.

747
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,320
And so it would just count down and that one column would match up to both all the

748
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,120
rows and kind of have everything sync up is very strange, but it's pretty cool.

749
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,280
Yeah, portrait sprites are something I need to make a bunch of, I used like a

750
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,560
placeholder one in the demo, but I want to make a bunch of expressions.

751
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,120
And I kind of want to like just like lightly animate them for the final game.

752
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,840
The speaking of which, though, I did manage to do a little shortcut because

753
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,920
the champion game that I made a while back, it had, I made a little fancy

754
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,440
like dialogue boxes that like sort of like type out all the characters and it

755
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,280
makes the little undertale sound.

756
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,840
So I like basically just copy pasted like those, that like text box code, like

757
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,560
directly from that game into the new one and just use it again.

758
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,600
And it works great.

759
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,640
It's reusing code.

760
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,880
That's like the one on one of like being smart with your design.

761
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,520
Yeah, why reinvent the wheel?

762
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,760
Exactly.

763
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,760
I believe I also followed a tutorial to make those text boxes in the first place.

764
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,400
So I'm just, yeah, stealing from myself that thing, which I borrowed

765
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,680
from some other guy.

766
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,760
That's how you learn.

767
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,560
It's just like going through tutorials and figuring things out and reverse

768
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,240
engineering it.

769
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,680
And then you start iterating on that and be like, OK, I understand how this works.

770
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,880
How can I tweak it so it does this instead?

771
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,400
And that's kind of how you learn.

772
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,880
And then it becomes kind of second nature.

773
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,280
Making games is sick.

774
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,120
It's it's it's pretty sick.

775
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,800
I'm getting into it.

776
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:17,400
And it's, I like, I like that it's a series of small tasks that I can that I

777
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,320
can complete and I can finish.

778
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,240
I can be like, I can have like a list.

779
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,640
I wrote out like a list of like here are a bunch of features that I want to add.

780
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,640
And I would like work on one for like an hour and then like done, cross it off,

781
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,400
work on another one for like two hours done, cross it off.

782
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,720
And like, by the end of the day, I've got like four or five crossed off.

783
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,080
I'm like, yes, I made measurable progress.

784
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,560
That's fucking wild.

785
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,240
Yeah, it's always super sick.

786
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,560
Feels good.

787
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,040
I like it.

788
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,120
Let's see.

789
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,920
Do I have anything else to say about that?

790
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:54,920
No.

791
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,800
Sick.

792
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,680
No.

793
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,920
Ben, have you ever seen on the internet, on like Twitter, where they'll take they'll

794
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,920
take like designs of like a corporate logo or something and like switch it with

795
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,760
like another company.

796
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,080
So like be Burger King, but like it looks like a McDonald's logo and like vice

797
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,320
versa, and it looks really weird and off-putting because it's like this is an

798
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,480
iconography I've recognized, but they've changed the brand or something like that.

799
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:29,160
So like like a like a logo for McDonald's, but presented in like a Burger King aesthetic.

800
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:29,880
Yeah.

801
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,840
So like they'll take they'll take like the font choice and like the graphic design

802
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,960
of like Burger King, but make it say McDonald's or like take Coke and make it

803
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,080
say Pepsi, just like switch the designs and just like is really weird.

804
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,080
I can picture it, but I don't think I've seen posts like that.

805
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,080
No, I've seen a couple of them.

806
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,240
The only reason I bring that up is because I walked into Comby's yesterday.

807
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,760
Comby's I haven't been in a Comby's in years.

808
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,080
Shout out to Comby's and Comby's and that's that for anyone for anyone who

809
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:06,160
doesn't live in like the very specific part of Southern New England that we live

810
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,720
in that's short for Cumberland Farms.

811
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,880
It's a it's a local institution.

812
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah, it's just like a convenience store.

813
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,440
So I walked in I walked in the old Comby's and they had sitting in the cooler

814
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,640
when I went to go get my Red Bull, they had monster like monsters,

815
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,600
like the sugar free monster, but it was in a 12 ounce can

816
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,080
like Red Bull, they have a new size and I have the 12 ounce cans.

817
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,280
They have a small size.

818
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,880
They have a small size now.

819
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,800
Why would you want that?

820
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,040
Why would you want less of it?

821
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,760
It confused me to no end because it was like one of those tweets where it's

822
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,760
like it's a Red Bull, it's a Red Bull can, but it has a monster in it.

823
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,920
And it looked like a Photoshop.

824
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,320
It didn't look like it was a real thing.

825
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,400
And I was very confused.

826
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
I was taken aback.

827
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,760
That's I'm not in the market for that product at all.

828
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
It was cheaper though.

829
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,680
It was cheaper than buying the bigger ones.

830
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,320
They were running a sale on it because it was new.

831
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,200
So I got three of those and well, if it's cheaper, if it's cheaper by volume,

832
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
then sure it was.

833
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,280
I did the math, you know, good.

834
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,360
I'm a frugal man when it comes to my fake money I get from the government

835
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,280
to buy things.

836
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,160
Absolutely, absolutely.

837
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,680
That's how you got to do it.

838
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,480
Yeah, well, my fake money has been biting me in the ass as you heard.

839
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,320
But yes.

840
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,800
Oh, God, we didn't talk about that.

841
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,320
There's nobody knows what I'm referring to.

842
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:27,440
Gee, I mean, we give it like came up on the stream and I said, like, we

843
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,800
shouldn't go into detail about it if you weren't there.

844
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,720
But if you want to complain about it, like I don't even know how to complain

845
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,200
about it. It's just ridiculous that like, yeah, because like I've been

846
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,640
collecting pandemic unemployment because right, why wouldn't you, right?

847
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,080
And everything seemed to be going fine.

848
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,840
I re-upped the because you have to like recertify, you know, every every year

849
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,480
or whatever, because I did my taxes and I got a notification saying like, yeah,

850
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,680
you're re-upped for it.

851
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:02,880
And then like last week, I got another message saying, actually, we changed

852
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,640
our minds, you're not eligible for any payment since January.

853
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,440
You know, oh, that's $10,000.

854
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,680
And I was like, oh, no.

855
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,240
Did they did they ask you for like, oh, God, what is it?

856
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,720
Like, like a like a document discovery, like you had to like resubmit your.

857
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,600
Yeah, they did.

858
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,160
They sent me that the day after they said I qualified and I just didn't see it.

859
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,320
But here's the thing on May 4th is when they were like, actually, you no

860
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,360
longer qualify, we're taking all your money back retroactively.

861
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,520
But the notice that they sent me for the certification says you have until

862
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:42,080
July or June 21st to recertify and like go into your account to this link to

863
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,040
recertify and there's just you go to the link and there's just nothing.

864
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:53,400
When when I when I got unemployment like years ago, like when I this was

865
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,520
after I got laid off from a job and I was just collecting unemployment

866
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:05,360
insurance, like, you know, from the employer, basically, I got like they

867
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,400
ended up like overpaying me, but like only by like 200 bucks or something.

868
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,480
And I think I don't know.

869
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,960
Yeah, I think I just like appealed it and they like waived it.

870
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,600
I'm like shocked that they can just say like, hey, we overpaid you.

871
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,920
We decided that we didn't want to give you that like thousands of dollars.

872
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:26,880
Right.

873
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,760
Give it back.

874
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,600
It's super fucked.

875
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:35,280
I'm shocked that that's something that they can do and will do.

876
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,440
Yeah, they're doing it to me right now.

877
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,480
So I file an appeal, which I did fucked up.

878
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,360
Yeah, yeah.

879
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,800
But like the thing is, is like you file an appeal and just nothing changes.

880
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,440
So like it's it's not saying like it's in dispute or anything.

881
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,080
It's just still saying there on the homepage like you oh 10 grand.

882
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,040
But they're like, you still need to keep collecting every week.

883
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,160
Yeah, but we won't pay you.

884
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,720
You'll just be claiming it.

885
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,480
And then when we schedule your later, maybe in like four months, if you win,

886
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,040
then we'll give you all the back pay.

887
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,920
And if not, we'll just keep all the stuff.

888
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,200
So like between now and the appeal, you just don't get paid anymore, which is cool.

889
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,680
And I got on the phone and talked to somebody on the helpline and like.

890
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,120
So I have to do this and like, yeah, we're not going to pay you.

891
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,640
Like, so how do I live?

892
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,360
And they were just like, we don't know.

893
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,440
Is there anything else we can help you with?

894
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,440
And I'm just like, I'll just go have a panic attack now by.

895
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:37,160
Did they, OK, because I know that they have the there's like regular unemployment

896
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,920
and then there's like the pandemic unemployment assistance, which is like

897
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,560
the extra on top of the regular.

898
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,680
Did they retroactively cancel like all of it or just all of it?

899
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,840
All of it, both all of it's gone.

900
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,160
But here's the funny thing.

901
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,960
It says on because, you know, you've you've gone on the website, you know how

902
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,080
like there's a side that there's like one column that says like what you're

903
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,200
what you qualify for every week.

904
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,880
And then the main column is like, you know, fill out your claim here or whatever.

905
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,240
It says like all the ones that are pending or whatnot.

906
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,320
Yeah. On that column, it's like you owe 10 grand.

907
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,360
On the other column, it's like, you still qualify.

908
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,480
You have 44 weeks remaining.

909
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,000
Here's what you get every week.

910
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,680
I'm just like, you guys are sending me mixed messages right now.

911
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,760
I'm very confused. Oh my God.

912
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,480
So my God.

913
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,480
Yeah.

914
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,640
I told my dad about it because like he loves dunking on the state.

915
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,680
And I'm like, look at the state did now.

916
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,240
And he's like, oh, I know a lawyer.

917
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,800
Talk to my lawyer friend.

918
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,880
So now I'm going to go talk to a lawyer tomorrow and see if good.

919
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,040
That's what you should be doing.

920
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,200
Take some fucking legal action.

921
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,040
Yeah.

922
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,200
I almost don't want to step too much into the muck because I feel like

923
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,840
at some point someone might be like, so you just sit at home on the internet.

924
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,040
You've been collecting unemployment.

925
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,760
Like, do you really not need it?

926
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,400
And like, I could make my case that like, well, I can't go to conventions.

927
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,960
Nobody needs nobody.

928
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,880
A bunch of people are fucking bleeding.

929
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,920
Like every month I lose like three or four patrons a month

930
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,920
because they don't have any money.

931
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,880
And like my whole like, if you're if you lose your job,

932
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,960
the first thing you're going to do is stop paying your artists on Patreon.

933
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,640
You know, so like, oh, I don't know.

934
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,840
Unless unless they all get unemployment too,

935
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,160
and then they can put their unemployment money towards all the fun bucks go

936
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,320
kind of just all over the place.

937
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,120
I see, I see.

938
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,120
Why not?

939
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,240
I mean, why not?

940
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,120
It's as good as any.

941
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,120
It's all fake anyway.

942
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
It is all fake.

943
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,800
It is all fake.

944
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,600
Speaking of fake money, I saw an article saying that if you had

945
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,320
taken all your stimulus checks and invested them in Dogecoin,

946
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,240
you would have made four hundred fifty thousand dollars in gains.

947
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,200
And that hurt my soul.

948
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,840
Wait, no, four hundred and that's not true.

949
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,040
That can't be.

950
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,400
No, because like the last the last the last check was like,

951
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,960
well, like two months ago, right?

952
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,040
Like when they put it out in February.

953
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,960
In February, it was still only like like ten cents at the most.

954
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,920
So when Oh, in Dogecoin.

955
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,600
Oh, yeah, you know what?

956
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,280
Oh, yeah, yeah, like the first one.

957
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,760
So if you had put all fourteen hundred, that first you would have like over,

958
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,720
you know, like fifteen K just from that.

959
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,280
And then if you the first two was when it was under a penny.

960
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,440
So you would have been fucking you would have like times fifty.

961
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,720
You would have like fifty times that initial like that initial, you know,

962
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,600
twelve hundred, you're at now, you're I am.

963
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,160
Yeah, fuck fuck.

964
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,240
Yeah, it hurts.

965
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,600
It hurts to think about it. I hate it.

966
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,000
I hate it. So fuck you.

967
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,360
I hate cryptocurrency.

968
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,320
The thing that hurts the most, dude.

969
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,480
The thing that's where I hate owning cryptocurrency and I hate my whole fucking thing

970
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,120
into Doge, I almost put that fourteen hundred into Dogecoin.

971
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,800
But I was like, no, I'm going to be safe.

972
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,120
I'm going to bank it. I might be moving this year. I need money.

973
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,680
You bought some little. Did I know?

974
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,920
Oh, yeah, I have I still have

975
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,360
a little over three thousand Dogecoin.

976
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,160
So it's like about eighteen hundred dollars right now.

977
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,280
And I've only I only spent one hundred twenty five on it.

978
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,880
So so that's pretty good.

979
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,680
It's pretty damn good.

980
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,480
And like every time it like hits a peak, I pull one hundred.

981
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,680
So I've already like pulled out like seven hundred dollars of my one hundred twenty

982
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,960
five investment. I still have almost two grand.

983
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,120
So you've so you've made you you're at your net zero, right?

984
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,080
Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, I'm Gucci.

985
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,160
So like it can go it can go to zero now and I'll be upset.

986
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,080
But like I won't have lost anything.

987
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,320
A couple people in my discord were saying a few a few people have made

988
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,760
like a couple grand on Dogecoin.

989
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,800
And I'm like, I hate Dogecoin.

990
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,920
I hate that it's going up.

991
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,240
But like good for them, like good for anyone who isn't like

992
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,960
some fucking Wall Street hedge fund manager or like the board of directors

993
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,000
on some fucking corporate good for anyone who not like that,

994
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,120
who manages to squeeze some money out of it.

995
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,240
Yeah, I know, I know, even though I know

996
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,800
that those people are the main beneficiaries of this kind of thing.

997
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,280
Yeah, I know.

998
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,560
I know Paleo, he put in

999
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,800
money before I did.

1000
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,880
I think he's close to making 10 K off Dogecoin right now.

1001
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,720
Oh, God, which is insane.

1002
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,640
I. I don't know.

1003
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,560
I don't know. I I feel like.

1004
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
Bubbles got a burst at some point, right?

1005
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,000
Well, it has to because like they're the reason

1006
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,680
like I kind of wish I'd put more money into Ethereum

1007
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,040
because I have a little bit of Ethereum that I got for free.

1008
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,360
I mean, that's doing like really fucking well

1009
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,640
because Ethereum's like doubled in the last month.

1010
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,640
But like the reason I've always been bullish about Ethereum

1011
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,480
ever since it kind of like became a thing because.

1012
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,520
Oh, look at you.

1013
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,600
Oh, look at you throwing around fancy terminology bullish.

1014
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,920
Oh, oh, it's just a real word.

1015
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,880
Oh, excuse me.

1016
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,520
I'm bullish on Ethereum.

1017
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,360
Oh, well, Ladi Ladi, my dick's been rock hard about Ethereum

1018
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,040
ever since I first heard about it because people actually build

1019
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,360
like applications on top of it, whereas like Dogecoin's just a meme.

1020
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,280
So it's just a meme, but you would have made four hundred thousand dollars.

1021
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,080
I know invested in that meme.

1022
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,520
Bro, I invested in Ethereum.

1023
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,080
I would have made like four hundred million dollars at this point.

1024
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,920
What? Not not since the pandemic.

1025
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,720
Well, no, no, but like when I first got my first

1026
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,840
Ethereum because I have point one six three Ethereum

1027
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,400
and I got that in twenty eighteen for free from what's that worth?

1028
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,000
Like twenty bucks.

1029
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,680
When I got it, it was worth twenty five dollars.

1030
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,840
Now it's worth six hundred and fifty.

1031
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,960
Wow.

1032
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,840
So if I had like actually bought some

1033
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,440
ETH back in like twenty eighteen when I first started thinking about it,

1034
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,920
I would have had like, I don't know, ten, fifteen thousand dollars in Ethereum.

1035
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,640
It hurts, man, hurts my soul.

1036
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,000
I mean, yeah.

1037
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,800
I mean, if I if I had bought if I had bought a Bitcoin ten years ago,

1038
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,720
I would be worth, you know, fifty four thousand dollars right now.

1039
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,160
But I mean, it's it's on the one hand, it's super easy to be like hindsight.

1040
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,360
You know, I could have done anything.

1041
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,840
But like when like you were like right there with your finger over the cursor

1042
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,200
and decided no, that's when it really stings.

1043
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,360
Yeah. Yeah.

1044
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,400
The only good thing I did is that I had half the amount of ETH that I do now.

1045
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,560
But because like the way it was done is that M dots always been big into

1046
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,840
Ethereum and like crypto and stuff.

1047
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,760
He's like big into that shit.

1048
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,600
Why do why do you get Ethereum from M dot?

1049
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,280
Well, that's what I'm about to explain.

1050
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,280
He like had sent for like Christmas, twenty eighteen.

1051
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,880
He had like sent a bunch of people like hand drawn postcards like art on them,

1052
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,600
just like people in his discord server.

1053
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:29,680
And then he's like, I've put like two digits of like an Ethereum address

1054
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,880
on each one of these postcards.

1055
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,480
So if you all get into this discord server and solve it and like put the

1056
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,160
the number together, you can get this wallet and everyone gets a little bit of

1057
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,440
Ethereum. And so we did that.

1058
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,080
And then half the people are like, I don't want this Ethereum.

1059
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:42,960
I'm like, oh, give it to me.

1060
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,040
I'll take it. I like it.

1061
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,040
This is cool.

1062
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,400
And so I like doubled my Ethereum from people just not wanting it.

1063
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,080
And now it's worth six hundred and fifty dollars.

1064
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,640
I'm like, you idiot.

1065
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,960
Suckers.

1066
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,080
I mean, that's what you got to do.

1067
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,360
I guess you just got to step on your fellow man.

1068
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,960
You just take whatever you do, whatever means necessary.

1069
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,120
Exactly. I'm a good capitalist like that.

1070
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,480
I just need Ethereum to get as big as Bitcoin.

1071
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,560
And then I'll have like six or seven grand and then I'll feel like a god.

1072
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,120
Exactly. I didn't learn anything.

1073
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,600
Special guess Applejack today.

1074
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,200
That doesn't apply to the situation.

1075
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,040
No, it really doesn't.

1076
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,520
I just wanted to say it.

1077
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,960
That's what the hedge fund managers say when they get bailed out by the government.

1078
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,680
I didn't learn anything.

1079
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,160
I was right all along.

1080
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,160
I was too big to fail all along.

1081
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,920
Yee-haw, Sweet Apple Acres is getting subsidized by your tax dollar.

1082
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,200
Oh, they fucking they fuck.

1083
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,160
Where do you think they took that fucking farm from?

1084
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,360
It's an apartheid state.

1085
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,960
Ponyville is an apartheid state.

1086
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,720
They took it from the native.

1087
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,880
I don't know, Windigos or whatever, the native fucking goblins or whatever.

1088
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,640
They used to live there before.

1089
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,000
Built on zebra labor.

1090
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,280
It's disgusting.

1091
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1092
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,120
It is, though.

1093
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,840
Sad but true.

1094
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,320
Yeah, they had to clear out.

1095
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,800
They had to clear out the Everfree Forest.

1096
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,520
It used to be a thriving, you know, we turn our nose up.

1097
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,200
Oh, we say that all the Everfree Forest is so savage and untamed.

1098
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,320
But, you know, the zebras had a thriving society in there before we clear cut it all

1099
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,360
to build Sweet Apple Acres.

1100
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,080
It was worth it.

1101
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,360
That sweet, delicious cider was worth, was worth it.

1102
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,680
Worth every drop of zebra blood spilled in the struggle.

1103
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,160
Remember how Rainbow Dash was a drunkard?

1104
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,440
That was pretty good.

1105
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,440
That was pretty good.

1106
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,080
What a great show, 10 out of 10.

1107
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,080
10 out of 10.

1108
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,360
There's still Dr. Wolf, man.

1109
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,720
Dr. Wolf is still uploading videos.

1110
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,240
What a legend.

1111
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,280
He's he's actually, I just happened to look the other day because someone

1112
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,160
someone posted in my discord, someone posted Little Shy.

1113
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,320
You remember Little Shy?

1114
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,640
That's a name that I remember.

1115
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,000
Little Shy if I am.

1116
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,040
Yes.

1117
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,400
He's still posting.

1118
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:04,160
He's still getting like, you know, in like the 10, like the mid 10 K's views.

1119
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,120
And Dr. Wolf also still getting in like the like the 10 K's of views.

1120
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,720
Lately, he's been posting a lot of like, you know, speculations on the

1121
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,320
trailer for the new, the new movie and the new show and stuff.

1122
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,240
Yeah, I was about to say they're all biding their time till Gen 5 when they're all

1123
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,360
research. Yeah.

1124
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,360
And people are still watching.

1125
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,800
You know, I mean, good for them, I guess.

1126
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:25,840
Cool.

1127
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,160
Oh, good.

1128
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,160
Good on you.

1129
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,960
You got your thing in this work.

1130
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,680
You got your thing in this working for you.

1131
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,920
Yeah. Yeah.

1132
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,560
Well, Ben, you just got to you just got to market your game towards the pony

1133
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,120
fandom that's still active.

1134
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,920
I'll have you know that I that I retweeted it on the T-Bap account.

1135
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,320
Well, what you really got to do is you got to send it to Seth at Equestria Daily.

1136
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,760
That's that's the bump you need.

1137
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,600
Honestly, honestly, I think I probably will do that.

1138
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,120
I probably will be like, hey, this is I made a pony fan game.

1139
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:08,680
This is a game that I made about my pony OC, my my bro analysis community OC.

1140
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,000
From years ago, remember Phantom Horn?

1141
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,520
He's back and I made a video game about.

1142
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,880
I mean, why not?

1143
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,200
Right? Yeah, yeah.

1144
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,640
Why just got to like have like the cover art image, just have an unrelated

1145
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,400
picture of Trixie for no reason and Seth will click on it for sure.

1146
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,400
You mean the pony Trixie the pony, not Trixie.

1147
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,880
Right, our associate God, I don't want to put no, no, no.

1148
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,160
I've got I've got I've got I've got a vision.

1149
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:40,520
I've got a vision of how I might want the the title screen to look.

1150
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:46,000
But I tried sketching it out and like it looked awkward, considering that I had

1151
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,240
to fit like the title and like the like the start options.

1152
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,880
So I'm like, I have this really cool idea for a visual image.

1153
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,880
But like, I don't know if it can actually squeeze it in to make it

1154
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,920
look good and like a man in like a start menu.

1155
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,240
Maybe you could just be a little like cinematic image that plays like

1156
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,160
when you hit the start button or something.

1157
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,560
I don't know.

1158
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,520
I don't know.

1159
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,600
Or maybe you could play before the menu pops up.

1160
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,280
Just got to start doing some thumbnails, put some animatics together,

1161
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,160
see how it flows before you commit to the bit.

1162
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,320
Yeah, just spend them like a whole a whole month just designing

1163
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,840
like the animation for the title screen before I actually get back to making

1164
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,360
the game itself. Yeah, you know, whatever.

1165
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,800
Fuck it. Take as long as I need.

1166
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,840
Why not? Why not just make it a masterpiece?

1167
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,920
Yeah, I mean, what's the point of doing something half ass?

1168
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,440
Got a whole right?

1169
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,880
It's true. It's true.

1170
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,320
Got like the whole damn the whole point.

1171
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,400
Not the whole point, but like a big part of like my idea for this game

1172
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,640
is like this is going to be, you know, it's fairly simple.

1173
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,080
It's pretty limited in scope.

1174
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,000
It's just like there's no walk around sections.

1175
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,400
All it is is just a series of menu driven JRPG battles.

1176
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,240
And it's like, just keep the possibility space low.

1177
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,160
Just keep, you know, keep the the the amount of things you can do fairly limited.

1178
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,240
Limit the possibility space limit the amount of work you have to do.

1179
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,560
And like that's true.

1180
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,600
I did that and it's true.

1181
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,160
It is limited compared to what it could be compared to what I'm sure

1182
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,280
a lot of other games are, but it's still taking me months.

1183
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,920
It's still taking me month.

1184
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,200
Even your solo diving again, like it's super fucking hard.

1185
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:23,240
Like you're doing the right move by keeping it like you're not overscoping,

1186
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,280
which is like the death of every indie game.

1187
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,080
No, I mean, I mean, I do keep thinking of things to add,

1188
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,320
but it's not like big things.

1189
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,920
It's just little things like, haha, what if what if I made him burp?

1190
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,040
What if I made him burp when he drinks the soda?

1191
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,320
Probably the best thing to do is like to come up with like a minimum viable

1192
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,640
products, you know, like like just like this are the airline things

1193
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,320
that needs to launch and then you can just do post launch updates.

1194
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,160
And just that'll be way to keep interest in the game going.

1195
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,080
That's kind of what the what the demo was.

1196
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,400
Like I released the demo at the point that I was like, this is the minimum

1197
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,720
point where I can say I have a game, you can play it.

1198
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,000
It doesn't have all the stuff that I want in it because I, you know,

1199
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,320
it exists as a vehicle for the story.

1200
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,400
And like a lot of the story elements are hard.

1201
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,720
And I have only even only just barely started to like add those in.

1202
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,440
And those are going to be kind of a hassle.

1203
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:24,680
But, you know, other than that, it's yeah, minimum viable product

1204
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,080
is kind of what I was going for with the demo, as well as like, you know,

1205
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:34,880
letting letting people play test it in that form, just to see, did I fuck it up?

1206
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:41,520
And yeah, oh, fuck, where was I?

1207
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,720
Was I complaining about making games too hard?

1208
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,240
It is pretty hard.

1209
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,520
It's too hard.

1210
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,760
Even it's too hard.

1211
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,840
And even though like I'm doing it baby mode, like doing it in GameMaker,

1212
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,400
it's like it's like fucking baby mode.

1213
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,240
Like GML is it's like baby pseudo code.

1214
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,040
It like couldn't it couldn't be any easier.

1215
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,080
I mean, it's not even it's on the one hand, it's like baby mode,

1216
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,440
but like it's not really baby mode.

1217
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,200
It's like optimized mode because like you can make it in unity,

1218
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,640
but like C sharp is a general programming language.

1219
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,160
It's not designed to make games.

1220
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,560
Like people kind of like is C sharp in unity.

1221
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,160
Yeah, unity uses C sharp. OK.

1222
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,880
But like GML and GD scripting Godot, they're like proprietary languages,

1223
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,520
which kind of suck because they they're not transferable.

1224
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,880
Like you only can use them in those applications,

1225
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,280
but they're tailored designed to make games with.

1226
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,080
So like they're more efficient if you're just trying to make video games.

1227
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,880
Yeah. So yeah.

1228
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,840
I mean, I mean, I like to think that in a way it's baby mode,

1229
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,920
but like it's not like it would it's not like it would improve the product

1230
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:53,560
if I had to like hard code in a function for me to like,

1231
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:59,240
you know, find the square root of a number that so that I can make

1232
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,040
a projectile move in an arc, right?

1233
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,360
Nobody, nobody at the end of the day cares how you made the game.

1234
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,200
They just care that it works, you know?

1235
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,320
Yeah, yeah, which is why I always find it funny

1236
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,400
because like I was building the vertical slice in a visual scripting language.

1237
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,320
I wasn't even doing any coding for that.

1238
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,280
And like you'd go look up tutorials for it.

1239
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,320
A bunch of people would be like, oh, this is so dumb.

1240
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,960
Anybody who does this is an idiot.

1241
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,920
Like you'd only have to code and it's just like nobody cares.

1242
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,000
Nobody cares that it wasn't hard coded.

1243
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,560
They just care if the game's fun.

1244
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:31,760
I when I when I made the champion game,

1245
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,640
you know, I started with Game Maker and, you know,

1246
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,800
Game Maker comes with this comes with a suite of.

1247
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,800
But comes with a suite of, you know, drag and drop functions.

1248
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,160
And I started making it using the drag and drop.

1249
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:49,480
But like I regretted it because I realized that like a lot of bugs

1250
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,760
that I ended up being really hard to fix just came from the drag and drop

1251
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,600
because the drag and drops don't work that cleanly.

1252
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,520
For some reason, I just found that they introduced a lot of problems.

1253
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,480
That is something and I just ended up I ended up coming away

1254
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,680
thinking like the drag and drop game functions are like a noob trap.

1255
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,560
That's like it's easier to just it's easier to just write the code

1256
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,640
and tell it what to do than to like put these fucking put these fucking

1257
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,360
black box drag and drop functions in and make a weird fucking flowchart of them.

1258
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,720
Like that's it's just easier.

1259
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,320
It's just easier to just write it out in a bunch of if else statements.

1260
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,800
Yeah, I think this time I haven't used any of that at all.

1261
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,520
And I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't really recommend it.

1262
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,840
I think it's just it didn't.

1263
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,440
I don't think it ended up saving me like any effort at all

1264
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,400
when I tried to use it the first time.

1265
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,160
I I kind of disagree.

1266
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,520
I feel like visual scripting was a way for me to get into game design

1267
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,280
and what is what is visual scripting like like the the drag and drop thing

1268
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,800
like you're talking about making game logic without doing actual programming

1269
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,040
in in Godot or in anything because there's a bunch of engines that do no code.

1270
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,000
Like I used construct three to make the vertical slice

1271
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,560
and that's all using an event sheet.

1272
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:08,200
So instead of writing lines of code, you can pick from like pre assigned blocks

1273
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,560
that do certain things and it triggers them like downward,

1274
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,680
like from top to bottom, it goes through the event sheet.

1275
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,280
And you can make make like basic state machines and stuff using those.

1276
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,440
And that.

1277
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,760
Eventually, I ran into issues where I couldn't figure out.

1278
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,560
I think it was more of a me problem than than like the the visual scripting

1279
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,440
itself of like getting my states to work properly, like with interacting with enemies.

1280
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,120
But that was.

1281
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,680
For me, as someone who's much more visual learning,

1282
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,160
like being able to like demystify the code and like break it down

1283
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:45,080
into like actual English, it helped me learn a lot of like underlying

1284
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,160
programming concepts that when I was reading tutorials for like GD script

1285
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,120
and she sharp didn't make any sense.

1286
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,440
Like I didn't understand functions until I did them visually.

1287
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,600
And then I realized, oh, the the parameters are placeholders

1288
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,040
for values you pull when using the function later.

1289
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,480
Like I didn't get that when I was reading the GD script documentation

1290
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,920
because the documentation on Godot is like really bad.

1291
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,960
It just assumes, you know, Python, it's like the documentation is like

1292
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,520
it's like Python except this.

1293
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,360
And as someone who didn't know Python, I was like, I have no idea what you're talking about.

1294
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,000
So I mean, if you're someone who's like predisposed to computer science

1295
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,040
in general, just program.

1296
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,680
But if you're like afraid of it, I think like having visual scripting

1297
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,520
stuff is a good kind of like first step to just like.

1298
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,760
Get something done.

1299
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,040
I think the most important thing is to get something shipped and out of the door.

1300
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,280
And like when you make like your first little baby like pawn game

1301
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,840
that might just be like dragging a couple blocks in and it works like it goes

1302
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,000
from something you can't do to something you can do.

1303
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,160
And I think that's a huge, big, important first step.

1304
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,280
Did you did you do any like math in college?

1305
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,800
No, no, no, maybe maybe that's the difference.

1306
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,880
Because I mean, I didn't even do like like advanced high school math.

1307
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,800
Like I was so dumb at math.

1308
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,000
Oh, you're just not you're just not a math guy at all.

1309
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,080
Not at all.

1310
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:09,040
I mean, maybe that's the difference because like I, you know, I got my physics degree

1311
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,720
and I had to take a bunch of like I had to take a bunch of like semi advanced math

1312
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,880
and stuff, maybe, you know, I mean, writing in GML is just it's a lot of like

1313
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,040
it's not math, but it's, you know, you you put a you take a function

1314
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:27,440
and you put the operand in the fucking brackets and then the operator operates

1315
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,040
on it and then it, you know, iterates on it in a sort of math like way.

1316
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,200
And I don't know, maybe I just find that maybe I'm just kind of practiced

1317
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:41,160
at the at the sort of thinking that, you know, writing code in that way demands.

1318
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,960
Yeah, I mean, now that I've done like a lot of visual scripting stuff,

1319
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,080
like I can look at code and understand much better what it's doing.

1320
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,360
Because it's just like it's just being able to translate.

1321
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,240
It's like any other language being able to understand like what the basic kind

1322
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,720
of linguistic functions of it are for lack of a better term.

1323
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,560
You know, like once you know what an FL statement is, you can look at code

1324
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,400
and be like, oh, I understand what's going on there.

1325
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,920
Whereas before you'd be like, what the fuck does this mean?

1326
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,160
Yeah, it's all good.

1327
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,880
It's all about finding the right tool for your skill set.

1328
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,320
Sure. I mean, whatever, whatever.

1329
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,960
At the end of the day, it's whatever works.

1330
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,960
I just I just found that I went in to Game Aper being like make her being like,

1331
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,000
oh, I'm so glad I don't need to learn code

1332
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,840
because I have these drag and drop functions.

1333
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,760
And I and I left thinking like, why not even bother with the drag and drop functions?

1334
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:34,360
The code is like not significantly more difficult to understand.

1335
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,000
At least that was that was my experience with it.

1336
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,800
Sure. But I guess I guess my point is just that, like,

1337
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,560
if the drag and drop thing wasn't there,

1338
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,600
which you've ever made a game in the first place, you know,

1339
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,440
it's it's that breaking down to the barrier that's really helpful.

1340
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,080
You know, you know, I turn my nose about it now.

1341
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,000
But at the same time, yeah, there there must have been a period

1342
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,560
where I was dragging and dropping.

1343
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,960
And then I was because like you can take a drag and drop function

1344
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:05,240
and then you can say like, OK, actually, just show me the code.

1345
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:09,000
Just convert this drag and drop block into raw code.

1346
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,400
And it will just turn it into code into a block of code for you.

1347
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,880
And you can look at it and edit it as you want.

1348
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,600
And you can like see what's in it that made it do the thing.

1349
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,440
So, yeah, actually, I probably did go through a bit of like

1350
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,600
a transitionary period where and I come to understand what is going on

1351
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,200
inside the blocks, open them up and look around inside them and go, Oh, I see.

1352
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,880
Well, all I really need is this.

1353
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,720
So I could just take this and put this over here and instead,

1354
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,840
and instead of all this other stuff that's in here or whatever.

1355
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:44,080
And yeah. And then I'm like, OK, so now I know how to do it

1356
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:48,240
without the blocks, but like I built it with the blocks in the first place

1357
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,640
that kind of got me there. That's probably true.

1358
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,960
Yeah. And now that you mentioned it.

1359
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,320
Yep. Make it.

1360
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,720
Hey, there are my headphones dead again.

1361
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,720
Oh, OK, hello.

1362
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,760
Charge the fucking battery, Ben.

1363
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,960
I. You're right.

1364
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,520
You're absolutely right.

1365
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,960
Or just use wired headphones.

1366
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:09,720
You're on your desktop.

1367
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,400
What do you need wireless for?

1368
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,240
Um, I just my wireless are my best ones.

1369
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,600
They don't have like a oxport you just plug a cable into.

1370
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,600
They not I am not like a signal cable.

1371
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,560
They have a plug that they can charge with.

1372
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,000
Oof. No, they don't.

1373
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,600
They don't have a signal cable.

1374
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,760
Brutal.

1375
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:33,560
I forgot to mention I want I mentioned that this week I had.

1376
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,960
I had the run in Noida and I just want to mention

1377
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,320
that I had my nukes.

1378
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,000
I had all my immunities.

1379
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,600
I was a complete God.

1380
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,080
I was running around nuking entire biomes,

1381
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,120
raining gold, so much gold on me that it crashed the game.

1382
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,480
And I just died fucking around with wands.

1383
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,520
I just died fucking around with my wands

1384
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,600
and like shot myself with a bullet that killed me by accident.

1385
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,920
It was I will I will try not to go too much into detail about it

1386
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,000
because I could explain it all day.

1387
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,960
But the short version is I was using modifiers

1388
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:17,360
that add extra damage at the cost of making the bullet deadly to you.

1389
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,640
But I was further modifying them with a

1390
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:26,080
another thing that makes they the bullet the projectiles lifetime equal to zero.

1391
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,000
So it doesn't travel at all and it can't hit you.

1392
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,760
Long story short, I took off that

1393
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:37,440
no no lifetime thing that makes the projectiles disappear.

1394
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,200
So the projectiles were, in fact, flying around and I fired a shot

1395
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,360
and the bullets whizzed all around and I was like, oh, wow,

1396
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,320
those are like incredibly deadly.

1397
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,760
If any of those had hit me, I'd have been fucking dead.

1398
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,680
Ha ha. And then I shot it again and they killed me.

1399
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,960
And I was like, why didn't I just not do that?

1400
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,440
Why didn't I simply not do it?

1401
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,720
I was fate telling you to start working on your game again.

1402
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,600
You know, honestly, that's how it is now.

1403
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,920
I'll get on.

1404
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:10,920
If I boot up Noida and I have a good run, a good run takes a long time.

1405
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,520
I'll be playing it for like several hours and I'll be like, yes, this is the run.

1406
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,400
This is the run.

1407
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,160
And then I die in a stupid way.

1408
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,720
But I'm just like, you know what?

1409
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,920
Good, I shouldn't play anymore, Noida.

1410
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,400
I'm free now.

1411
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,800
You've said that multiple times, though, and you keep dragging yourself back to Noida.

1412
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,800
Please forgive me, baby.

1413
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,440
I'm sorry. I just shout on you in the procrastinators podcast.

1414
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,720
Just one more run.

1415
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,560
It'll be different this time.

1416
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,720
But it's never. But it's never different.

1417
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,080
No, this no, no, no, baby.

1418
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,840
This time, I promise you'll get explosion immunity and fire resistance

1419
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,360
and glass cannon and nukes this time.

1420
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,120
This will be the run. This will be the run.

1421
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,760
But it's never the run.

1422
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,480
That one could have been the run.

1423
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,480
Whatever, I I I I met the goal.

1424
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:01,000
I met the goal that I wanted, which was seeing what it's like to fire a nuke

1425
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,480
with glass cannon and survive.

1426
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,320
And it was I mean, I I already told you about the gold.

1427
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,480
I don't need to explain.

1428
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,480
I don't need to explain how glorious it was.

1429
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,480
What more can you what more can you ask for?

1430
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,920
I guess it's finally time to move on to another game.

1431
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:23,640
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1432
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,720
You know, it's a little thing about Noida is that like

1433
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:35,360
as a run goes on, I always eventually find myself

1434
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,680
gravitating towards the same kind of bill in the same way that like all life

1435
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,760
forms will eventually evolve to resemble a crab.

1436
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,440
Every every Noida game eventually evolves so that I have my main damage

1437
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:52,720
wand, which shoots one bullet, which then explodes into lots of tiny bullets

1438
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,680
that have huge damage modifiers on.

1439
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,120
That's my damage dealer.

1440
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:59,000
And then I have a teleport wand that shoots little short teleport bolts

1441
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,680
that go so I can go really fast across the map.

1442
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,080
And then I have a third one that shoots a bunch of black holes

1443
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,080
infinitely that can dig me through any terrain I want to go.

1444
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,000
And then the third one is just whatever else I fucking feel like carrying

1445
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,400
because it's just those three.

1446
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,600
Those are the three things.

1447
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:19,160
Huge damage, teleport really fast, dig through anything with infinite black holes.

1448
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,640
And that's all you need.

1449
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,080
So, you know, in a long enough time frame, every Noida game kind of ends up

1450
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,680
looking the same, if I'm being perfectly honest with myself, which I always am.

1451
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,840
It's good. Yeah, sad, but true.

1452
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,560
People were trying to get me to play Isaac.

1453
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,760
I don't know.

1454
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,960
I don't know. I want to go back to classic.

1455
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,000
I mean, I used to be really into it.

1456
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,200
I played a lot of it back in like twenty fifteen or so, fourteen.

1457
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,640
They were just like an updated version, didn't they?

1458
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,880
Yeah, people were telling I think pretty recently they did.

1459
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,280
And apparently like people really like it and it's got a lot of stuff in it and like.

1460
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,080
But I mean, I feel like I had my fun with Isaac years ago.

1461
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,440
I don't know if I want to do it again.

1462
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,840
Well, it's always there. Time to I know it's I know it's a good game.

1463
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,720
It's a fun game. I like it.

1464
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,360
But do I do I need it, though?

1465
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,480
What will it do when needs video games?

1466
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,040
Nobody needs video games, except for our video games.

1467
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,200
Those ones you need pre-order now.

1468
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,000
People need Phantom's Revenge.

1469
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,120
Yes, the the Brony community needs the shot in the arm.

1470
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,160
That will will be the Phantom's Revenge.

1471
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,720
Just going to split the fan between between Gen five and Phantom's Revenge.

1472
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,760
The two camps.

1473
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,080
I maybe I'll it would be really funny to like.

1474
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,680
Phantom's Revenge comes out.

1475
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,000
It's a huge hit.

1476
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,760
It shatters the glass ceiling.

1477
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,240
It transcends the boundaries between YouTube and My Little Pony

1478
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,920
and and whatever the fuck else.

1479
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,120
And it's like it's it's a smash hit.

1480
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,320
It makes me a million dollars.

1481
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,720
And then I'm like, damn, got to make a sequel.

1482
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,960
So I just take the engine and I just kind of build a sequel.

1483
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,120
That's like the same game.

1484
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,120
But I don't know.

1485
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:17,200
I'll just set it and I'll just set it in the world of Gen five.

1486
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:21,600
I'll just have Phantom killing a bunch of like the Gen five ponies or something.

1487
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,280
You know, that'd be good idea.

1488
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,040
Can you imagine that actually happens and then the peak,

1489
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,280
the procrastinators podcast comments section just full of bronies

1490
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,920
and like we come full circle.

1491
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,560
Could you?

1492
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,720
We have to go back.

1493
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,920
We've been saying it for years.

1494
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,840
We have to. This is it.

1495
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,120
This is our ticket, our ticket back into the limelight.

1496
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,360
If G five does well.

1497
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,960
Horace return, we have to go to Brony Con again.

1498
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,000
God, I wonder.

1499
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,760
Right.

1500
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,960
Somebody, somebody must own the rights to the name.

1501
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:53,760
Brony Con, right?

1502
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,120
Like somebody would have to either the owner of that IP.

1503
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,880
But do you think someone owns that name?

1504
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,280
They have to, right?

1505
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,160
There's no way they just let that lapse.

1506
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,080
Because if not, Radcon six, Brony Con is happening.

1507
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,920
I.

1508
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,120
Well, I don't know.

1509
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,200
Do you think maybe it's too generic a name to be copyrighted?

1510
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,600
I don't know.

1511
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,320
If no, if nobody owns that name, I would say that, like,

1512
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,040
probably a gen five will see a return of Brony Con.

1513
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:32,080
If it is like a trademark name, then I still think it's pretty likely.

1514
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,200
We'll return in spirit, if nothing else.

1515
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,320
There will be another big convention.

1516
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,240
I would think that at that point, whoever owns the copyright

1517
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:44,400
could just sell it to somebody who wants to make do another one.

1518
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,920
That would be a good move.

1519
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,720
I don't see why you wouldn't do that.

1520
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,680
But yeah, even if it's called something else, honestly.

1521
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,840
Yeah, I bet it will.

1522
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,680
I bet it will, because it's looking at little shy F.I.M.

1523
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:00,200
and Dr. Wolfe, like the audience is still there.

1524
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,040
I'm sure it's not what it was at the height of the Brony craze.

1525
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,440
But there's still an audience for my little pony content.

1526
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,920
Look, and a lot of it is the old audience.

1527
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:13,360
We need to get in on the ground floor if Gen five starts doing well.

1528
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,320
We don't have to change anything.

1529
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,240
We just have to have every week we're talking about the new episode

1530
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:22,440
and the PCP becomes the the the pony consuming podcast.

1531
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,800
And we just kind of just don't even mention anything.

1532
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,000
It just it just kind of happens.

1533
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,040
God, you know what?

1534
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,040
I'm fucking I'm fucking ready.

1535
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,800
I'm fucking ready to just be a fucking pony tuber again.

1536
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,800
Just take me back.

1537
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,320
Just take me back to the simpler time.

1538
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,360
I'm not kidding.

1539
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,160
You laugh, but I'm totally serious.

1540
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,360
I'm better times.

1541
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,360
It was fun.

1542
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,520
I there are times when I do miss it.

1543
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,160
I was all it was all it was all fun and games back then.

1544
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,560
Oh, I didn't get my closure.

1545
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,520
I didn't even get to go to the last Brony con.

1546
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,600
It's a it's a hole in my heart that will never heal.

1547
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,800
Why didn't you go to the last bro?

1548
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,760
Oh, because you were sick.

1549
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,760
Or are you not sick?

1550
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,680
You had him.

1551
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,040
He had mobility issues.

1552
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,120
Yeah, I was still waiting to get my surgery back then.

1553
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,040
Right.

1554
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,040
No pun intended.

1555
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,680
No, you know what?

1556
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,480
I think there will be another Brony con.

1557
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:19,600
I think I think it'll and I'll be I'll be curious if it's like

1558
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,680
half the size of the old ones or if it's like really small,

1559
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,800
like not even like enough to be in like a con.

1560
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,400
Or I mean, or maybe it would just be.

1561
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:36,080
I guess the alternative is that it just becomes subsumed by furry conventions.

1562
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,880
Yeah, maybe, I guess.

1563
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,880
It might just might just become a facet of furry.

1564
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,600
The fandom's still alive.

1565
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,920
There are people who like I still follow some pony artists

1566
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,000
and they're making their shit.

1567
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,520
Yeah, but I mean, I don't know.

1568
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,840
I guess I could just see like if it doesn't.

1569
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:01,280
Unless there's like a real resurgence of the Brony culture, like it depends

1570
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:05,200
on how well Gen five does, I guess, unless there's a real deal.

1571
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,360
Yeah, if it's not a big deal, I feel like the natural thing

1572
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,560
for bronies is just to become a subset of furries.

1573
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,440
Yeah, become the diet furries.

1574
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,840
They were always accused of being.

1575
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,440
Yeah, exact.

1576
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,640
Exactly.

1577
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,160
I didn't learn anything.

1578
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,680
Oh, I got to.

1579
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,800
I have something funny happen.

1580
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:37,040
So did you have you heard me talk about the the Cato anthology that is seen?

1581
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,320
Mentioned, but I don't know anything about it.

1582
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,480
Well, yeah, they were they were a comics anthology that's going to they're

1583
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:47,320
going to do a Kickstarter in this pretty soon.

1584
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,120
Actually, shit, the Kickstarter might even be running by the time

1585
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,280
this episode comes out or like pretty close.

1586
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,120
Yeah, and they last month, they were looking for submissions.

1587
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:01,080
I think submissions are closed now, but they they they asked me if they could

1588
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:06,640
publish The White Lion, which is like, you know, that'll that'll

1589
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:12,120
chestnut. And I was like, sure, yeah, we can put that in if you want that.

1590
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:18,360
And I they they asked me like, you know, for the files.

1591
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,880
And I was like, OK, sure, I'll get you the the image files.

1592
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:26,520
And I was looking through my computer and I could only find the ones

1593
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,680
that I have that are saved at website size.

1594
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:35,320
So like 900 pixels across as in like completely inadequate for print.

1595
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,640
And so I'm like, well, fuck.

1596
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:43,280
So I had to dig up the originals, which I happened to have in my closet here.

1597
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,640
I dug up the original like drawn versions, the inked pages of White Lion.

1598
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,920
And I am going to rescan them at high res.

1599
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,400
And so I will be giving the Cato anthology the like

1600
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,000
I guess the the the the HD remasters.

1601
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,560
It'll be the HD remasters of the White Lion.

1602
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,680
It'll be never never before printed, never before seen anywhere.

1603
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:12,240
They will be making their their debut in one point five remix.

1604
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:18,160
Yes. Three three eighty six over two pages.

1605
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,400
Key key blade, whatever.

1606
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,400
Yeah, yeah, like that.

1607
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,080
Yeah, the the White Lion remaster.

1608
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,240
I should I should make a new like title page.

1609
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:35,280
Just says White Lion remastered just because it's funny.

1610
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,160
I don't know, maybe.

1611
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:42,920
But yes, that's going to be that's going to be in that book.

1612
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,600
And they're going to do.

1613
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:49,760
Yeah, I think they said they're starting the the Kickstarter on the 14th,

1614
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,360
which is only five days from recording this.

1615
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,600
And I got to fucking draw a cover for them.

1616
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,600
I told they asked me to draw the cover for the that, which I said I would do.

1617
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,640
And so I must do it soon.

1618
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,040
This is just that's just another I didn't even get to do any of that.

1619
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,440
This week, but that was just like the other stuff that I had to do for that

1620
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,760
was just another thing like this this week went by.

1621
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,120
Faster than usual, I really feel like only like.

1622
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,960
I feel like we just recorded the last episode.

1623
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,240
It actually really freaked me out.

1624
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:28,120
Well, like yesterday when I was I'm like, oh my god, it's Sunday tomorrow already.

1625
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,840
We just recorded.

1626
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,360
We just recorded an episode.

1627
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,200
What the hell?

1628
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,960
It like it actually kind of upset me because it's like it's a very strange

1629
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,600
feeling when it felt just like what did I even do?

1630
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,600
And you start having like a minor kind of like freak out.

1631
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,600
You're just like, so what would happen yesterday?

1632
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,640
What I do the day before that?

1633
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,680
And what about the day before that?

1634
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,080
What where did it all go?

1635
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,200
Yeah, I got it real bad this week.

1636
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,320
I got it particularly bad.

1637
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,600
Mm, mm, yeah.

1638
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,080
But what can you do?

1639
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,960
That's life.

1640
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:03,960
And they say, you know, every time the older you get, the older you get,

1641
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,800
the smaller a fraction of your like your total experienced time is like.

1642
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:17,680
Yeah, you're like relative perception of time gets faster because like every day

1643
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,600
your your total life being alive is longer.

1644
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,880
So each day is like a fraction smaller.

1645
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:27,480
When you're when you're 10 a year is 10% of your entire life.

1646
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:32,760
And when you when you're 50 a year is 2% of your entire life.

1647
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,680
So there you go.

1648
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:40,480
I don't know the worst, the worst, terrible, terrible, awful nightmare.

1649
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,040
Nightmare world we live in.

1650
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,040
Yeah.

1651
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,480
What do you think about voicemails?

1652
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,760
It's the part I've been dreading this entire hour and 20 minutes.

1653
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:57,560
We last episode, we did two hours of voicemails.

1654
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,560
I don't want to hear that.

1655
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,960
There's no way.

1656
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:06,120
I don't know how much of a penalty do I take if I leave early?

1657
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:11,760
We we have a formula.

1658
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:18,080
Oh, God, no, we can't surely surely we won't do that again.

1659
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:22,120
Surely because last time we scolded everyone and we told them, hey,

1660
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,720
script your voicemails.

1661
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,240
Don't just ramble like, like, I just kind of think like,

1662
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,520
so surely these will all be succinct and to the point and not annoying.

1663
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,040
Our audience always listens to us.

1664
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,880
They are.

1665
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,520
Cherubs, absolute cherubs, every single one.

1666
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,600
We have a page and a half, a page and a half, which is about that's normal.

1667
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,360
OK, let's do it.

1668
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,280
No, no, bullet, bullet time of bullet round.

1669
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,040
First one is called Dead Leaves.

1670
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,400
Three, two, one, go.

1671
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,520
Hey, Ben, you should check out Dead Leaves, if you haven't already.

1672
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,560
It's a 2004 anime by Hiroyuki Yamaishi.

1673
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:07,640
It is 45 minutes of constant frenetic action and they shoot a ton of cops.

1674
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,480
You probably enjoy it.

1675
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,720
I think I've seen it.

1676
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,600
It sounds cool.

1677
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,200
It's not a big ask.

1678
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,720
It's the one with the guy with the TV head, right?

1679
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,720
The one guy's got a TV head.

1680
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,080
I think I've seen it.

1681
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:28,160
Uh, and I think it was cool.

1682
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,520
I don't honestly don't remember.

1683
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,200
Thanks for the recommendation.

1684
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,200
Sounds cool.

1685
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,200
I'm going to check it out.

1686
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:39,760
If you if you Google it, you'll you'll recognize what it looks like.

1687
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,520
It's the guy with the TV head.

1688
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,040
That's that's what I think of.

1689
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:49,640
It doesn't look that it doesn't look like it should be called Dead Leaves.

1690
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:50,760
I don't know why it's called.

1691
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,800
I searched dead leaves and I just got dead leaves like leaves on the ground.

1692
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,520
No, you got to go dead leaves anime.

1693
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,120
Yeah, now I'm seeing it.

1694
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,800
Yeah, yeah, there it is.

1695
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,680
This is a trigger thing.

1696
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,960
It looks very trigger.

1697
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,600
I don't think it is trigger, but it does look very.

1698
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,440
They're definitely trigger inspired.

1699
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,440
Yeah.

1700
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:17,320
OK, next voicemail is called The Digital Indra three two one go.

1701
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,120
Hello, I just wanted to say I've been a long time listener of the podcast.

1702
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:27,040
And by a long time listener, I mean, I've listened to probably about 10 episodes

1703
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,680
and figured so many.

1704
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,920
That's like 30 hours.

1705
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,600
I'm in on all the jokes now.

1706
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,120
Anywho just wanted to let you know I'm seizing the means of production

1707
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,120
and producing my own podcast.

1708
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,840
No, you can't do that.

1709
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:41,600
And hookers.

1710
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,320
You can't do that.

1711
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,480
You're not allowed to do that.

1712
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:47,840
So that's basically a keep on keeping on.

1713
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,400
Return the scrolls, Ben, and Tom will never die.

1714
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,640
Keep it sleazy, bitches.

1715
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,200
What was the point of this voicemail

1716
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,280
that we've inspired him to create content?

1717
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:04,800
I don't care.

1718
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,280
Well, I'm happy.

1719
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,720
I was I was I was going to be annoyed

1720
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,080
because I thought he was just going to plug his own podcast.

1721
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,360
But then he didn't plug his own podcast.

1722
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,840
So I'm like, OK, well, I guess I shouldn't be mad.

1723
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,200
But then well, if he's not going to shamelessly plug himself,

1724
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,720
then what was the point?

1725
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,840
It was it was a point.

1726
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,960
Thirty nine seconds.

1727
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,840
I'll never get back. Oh, God.

1728
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,560
Do you think I'm proud?

1729
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,240
Do you think I'm proud to think that there are more podcasts

1730
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,360
out there in the world because of me? No.

1731
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,760
No, I'm ashamed.

1732
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,800
I do. I've done harm.

1733
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,480
You're not making pony fan games.

1734
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,920
You're not using your time correctly.

1735
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:47,920
No, no, you do as I do, not as I say.

1736
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,680
Next next voicemail is called.

1737
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,280
Oh, God, it's a minute, thirteen.

1738
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,160
It better be worth it.

1739
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,920
It's called Super Volteca. Three, two, one, go.

1740
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:02,160
So, guys, how would you feel of all the kick

1741
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,560
starters that the PCP made over the years?

1742
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,920
Ended up being featured on an episode of Six Gamers.

1743
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,960
Now, for those who don't know, Six Gamers,

1744
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,120
this is a great series on YouTube posted by this guy named DJ Slope.

1745
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,000
He's also like a frequent collaborator with Guru Larry.

1746
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,920
I feel like I've already gotten the gist of the question now.

1747
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:26,480
Well, you see, Six Gamers is a show where he covers some of the oddest,

1748
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:30,200
stupidest and most dreadful, crowdfunding campaigns to ever grace

1749
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,920
this invisible hellscape that we're forced to call Earth.

1750
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:37,040
I ask this because, you know, the shit that Tritsey has done

1751
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,280
is about you and the fans, whether it be the BronyCon lecture

1752
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,200
or those curses that you leave in the V-blue rays.

1753
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,680
You know, that would be something for Perfect for either an episode

1754
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:52,200
about like five terrible podcasts or like a kickstarter.

1755
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,760
Hell, you know, Tritsey herself would be an ideal subject alone

1756
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:01,720
when it comes to like, I don't know, five shitty anime related kickstarters.

1757
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,440
You know, I bet Slope would get a fucking kick out of her

1758
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,640
messed up history and all the drama shit.

1759
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,600
So, yeah, what do you guys think?

1760
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,720
All the OK, he starts the voicemail by saying,

1761
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:17,720
how would you feel if all the kickstarters that the PCP made over the years

1762
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:22,840
went on this, whatever, this like kick scammers thing or whatever?

1763
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:26,680
Um, well, uh, none.

1764
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,640
First of all, none of none of the PCP kickstarters

1765
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:35,520
have failed to deliver on anything, except for unless you count Radcon four.

1766
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,720
But we are still delivering on that.

1767
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,880
So that one is that one is incoming.

1768
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,840
So none of those none of those qualify.

1769
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,560
The Tritsey stuff.

1770
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:50,480
I mean, yeah, Tritsey did kind of fail to deliver on some kickstarter promises.

1771
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:57,080
I don't know if it rises to the level of like a like a like a hilarious

1772
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:00,040
scandal or anything. Yeah, I don't know.

1773
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:04,480
I mean, I don't know if it, yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah.

1774
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,800
And then, I mean, I mean,

1775
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,880
and then he goes off on a tangent about, I mean, would be funny

1776
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,800
because Tritsey is weird in other ways and like, yeah, true, but not

1777
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,440
the kickstarters are not because the kickstarters.

1778
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:25,520
The kickstarters are a small footnote in that history of I would, I would agree.

1779
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,160
Yeah, I would agree.

1780
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:30,360
So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1781
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:36,520
Next voicemail, Alaskan Weeb, three, two, one, go.

1782
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,000
Ben St.

1783
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,440
You pawns, you fool, you rude, you simple capitalist overloads.

1784
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,320
The whole reason that you can fire somebody for failing to prevent a shop

1785
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:48,720
lifter while also allowing them from preventing shoplifting in the first place

1786
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,200
is so that you can discriminate against people who otherwise are perfectly

1787
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,720
acceptable employees. You can't fire someone for being gay.

1788
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,040
You can't fire someone for being trans.

1789
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,720
You can't fire someone for being non-binary, but you can fire them

1790
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,640
for failing to prevent someone from shoplifting.

1791
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,600
And that's how you fire people, how you discriminate against those people.

1792
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,880
That's why that loss still remains.

1793
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:09,560
Well, I.

1794
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,880
I feel like you could fire someone.

1795
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,160
You could make up any fucking reason you want to fire someone if they're gay

1796
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:18,760
and you just don't like them.

1797
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,760
Yeah, you can't say I'm firing because you're gay, but you can say like,

1798
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,920
you know, you're you're I don't know, you're lazy.

1799
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,640
You were you were five minutes late today and you're late.

1800
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,480
You don't do your duties, you know, the you don't get along with it.

1801
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,480
You could you could make up whatever fucking reason you want.

1802
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:38,120
And like, yeah, sure, failed to prevent a shoplifter is could be one of them, I guess.

1803
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,760
Uh.

1804
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:46,000
Yeah, maybe it's I'm sure in some places it would be a perfectly reasonable.

1805
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,760
I mean, you don't always even have to give a reason why you're firing someone, right?

1806
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,720
Like, that's I think that's state by state.

1807
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:57,200
And I don't think every state requires that an employer like specifically tell you why

1808
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,880
maybe they do fucked up, but it would be it's kind of fucked up.

1809
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:01,880
Yeah.

1810
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,440
Do the next voicemail.

1811
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:11,000
Oh, God, I'm going to have to hear my own voice on the episode three, two, one, go.

1812
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:16,200
OK, I go to make a shitpost, like take take the garbage yelling thing

1813
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,920
and pretend it's about the egg.

1814
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,760
But no, no, OK, I go on to Trixie's Twitter and she posted tech talk where it's

1815
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,520
it's literally her just just reviewing rest stops.

1816
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,000
Why isn't Riley stopping her?

1817
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:34,240
Doesn't Riley want want to make sure that nobody gets

1818
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,120
they don't get docs and no one calls the police whenever,

1819
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:41,000
whenever they're straight up saying what rest carriers they're at.

1820
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,120
Why post them later?

1821
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,160
She posted why they're already gone.

1822
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:50,080
I thought you didn't want to show the RV so people could call it.

1823
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Why?

1824
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,000
OK, this is what's passed to me later after they've already left.

1825
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,680
So it's not it's not docs worthy.

1826
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:06,520
I I just want to say funny, funny thing, funny thing that happened this week.

1827
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:12,240
Just got to mention it is I actually caught Riley in the comments

1828
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:18,680
of the video claiming to have an RV when they don't have an RV.

1829
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,840
He straight up said or someone said RV and he said, oh, no,

1830
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,680
this video was before the RV.

1831
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:29,000
This was before we got the RV when they don't have an RV.

1832
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:33,280
He's straight up just lying about it and it's so fucking funny.

1833
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,840
OK, I'm sorry.

1834
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,640
It's tangent. It's not important.

1835
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:39,120
It says whatever. It's just that's for me.

1836
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:45,960
Next voicemail is called Apologies, Benjamin and Gibb for two in a row.

1837
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,720
This one's short.

1838
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,920
Thank you. Three, two, one, go.

1839
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,880
Also, in one of them, she's in a car.

1840
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:57,320
She might just be taking the car and then sleep in the RV.

1841
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,800
But there's no RV.

1842
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,360
That would mean the RV exists and it doesn't.

1843
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,080
Just so there's no RV.

1844
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,520
It's the same car.

1845
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,320
It's the same car that they've used in all the previous road trips.

1846
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:12,320
You can tell because it has a telltale crack in the windshield.

1847
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,600
And it's been there the whole time.

1848
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,600
So that's fun fact.

1849
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,800
There's some deep lord of this already.

1850
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,720
I've been I've been away for a few weeks and there's all sorts of layers

1851
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:23,360
that I didn't even know.

1852
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,840
Internet, internet, internet sleuths,

1853
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:29,120
internet sleuths have cracked this case wide open.

1854
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,520
Much like the windshield.

1855
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,560
Got up, got a plug, got a plug.

1856
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,920
And, you know, if there were any doubt about whether the RV exists,

1857
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:42,520
all you have to do is go to isthereanrv.com and you can have it answered.

1858
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:45,720
And you will always you will be up to date on the answer to that question

1859
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,360
at all times.

1860
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,120
We've got you covered.

1861
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,680
Next voicemail is called Frost Drive.

1862
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,680
Three, two, one, go.

1863
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:04,240
Gip and Ben and Tom, you guys really like video game commentators.

1864
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,960
YouTubers that talk about video games.

1865
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,920
I do. I'm ashamed of it, but I do.

1866
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,520
There's a YouTuber I know who's virtually unknown.

1867
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:15,080
His name is Ray R. Reviewing and his videos are really insane.

1868
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,160
I think you guys would like him.

1869
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:19,720
He even has puppets in his show and everything.

1870
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,680
And it's oh, it's so good.

1871
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:24,840
Some videos are an hour plus long and it's amazing.

1872
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:28,880
If you like video game commentators, check out Ray R.

1873
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,320
Reviewing, maybe talk about him on the show because that'd be pretty cool.

1874
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,480
But if not, I mean, at least check him out.

1875
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,000
Ray R. Reviewing.

1876
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,640
Let's see.

1877
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,960
All like all one word Ray R.

1878
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,480
Like the word R.

1879
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:48,160
Do you think this is his YouTube channel?

1880
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:50,360
No, I don't think so.

1881
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,240
Frost Drive has his own YouTube channel.

1882
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,560
That'd be pretty funny.

1883
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,400
It'd be a good bit.

1884
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,800
It'd be a good joke.

1885
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:00,640
Ray.

1886
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,200
Let's see.

1887
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,960
A filter by channel.

1888
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,680
When I search Ray R.

1889
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:14,760
OK, I'm searching Ray and the space, the letter R, space,

1890
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,640
reviewing and the first result is Dame Drops.

1891
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:22,720
Is it supposed to be like Ray R as an A R E reviewing?

1892
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,160
I'm searching that I tried searching for that, too.

1893
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:27,560
And I didn't get it.

1894
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:29,520
Now, let's see filters channel.

1895
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:34,200
I get one called Ray reviews and it's a puppet.

1896
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,360
Ray reviews now.

1897
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,720
That's not it.

1898
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,720
Maybe maybe no spaces.

1899
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,440
Yeah, I'm doing those spaces right now.

1900
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,280
Maybe.

1901
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,160
OK, I think I found it.

1902
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,440
I think I found it.

1903
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,320
And it's like a guy with like a purple mask.

1904
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:05,520
And it's all one word, R A Y A R E reviewing 837 subscribers.

1905
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:08,880
I don't know.

1906
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:09,920
Fuck it.

1907
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,240
I'll give I'll give one of these videos a watch later.

1908
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,080
Why not?

1909
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,640
Why not?

1910
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,640
I'm watching a bullshit.

1911
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,840
Oh, he's got a real mask.

1912
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:21,920
He's got a mask in real.

1913
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:22,960
Oh, he's costumed.

1914
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,040
Oh, he does costumes.

1915
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,440
Oh, that's nice.

1916
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,440
Oh, that's good.

1917
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,720
It's gonna be really cool when it's in my other tab,

1918
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:32,320
not being viewed as I just listened to it.

1919
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,440
But I appreciate the production value regardless.

1920
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

1921
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:41,200
Next voicemail is called YoyyTuber.

1922
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,760
Three, two, one, go.

1923
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,840
Also, sorry, I'm not that YouTuber girl.

1924
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:47,560
Sorry.

1925
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:49,720
Also, please, please, please watch.

1926
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:50,920
Also, please watch.

1927
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:55,240
Odd Taxi, please, please, please, please, please.

1928
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,920
I am watching Odd Taxi last last week.

1929
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,040
Someone I think the same person told us to watch Odd Taxi.

1930
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:01,600
You've seen it.

1931
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,040
I think I'm tweeting about it.

1932
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,240
Right. I am watching Odd Taxi.

1933
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,400
It's very good.

1934
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,160
I like it.

1935
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:08,040
Oh, wait, someone.

1936
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:09,200
They said. OK.

1937
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,680
They said like, oh, yeah.

1938
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:13,760
Odd Taxi is about like a world of animals

1939
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:17,320
and there's like a bear or a hippopotamus

1940
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:20,280
or something who drives a taxi and there's a murder mystery.

1941
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,280
And I was like, Snore sounds shit.

1942
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,080
Sounds dumb.

1943
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,760
Sounds bad. It's pretty good.

1944
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,600
It's pretty good.

1945
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,800
It's it's like a it's kind of like a slice of life thing,

1946
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,360
but it's like kind of esoteric in that like the guy drives a taxi.

1947
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:38,320
So like he's just doing his job driving his taxi

1948
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,320
and people get in the cab and like have conversation with them

1949
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,200
and then they go back out.

1950
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:44,520
But all these characters that are coming in and out of his cab

1951
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:48,160
are called part of this like bigger interconnected kind of murder mystery thing.

1952
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,120
And it's some of the storytelling kind of synchronous.

1953
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,880
So characters who come into the cab in one episode,

1954
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,440
you'll get their backstory later and see what brought them to getting into the cab

1955
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,040
and having that conversation.

1956
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,200
And there's like some bigger

1957
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:02,120
meta narrative with a lot of other characters.

1958
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:03,600
And like everything's kind of like coalescing

1959
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,280
and like all these characters that seem unrelated to each other

1960
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,040
kind of cross paths with each other.

1961
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,000
And like there's a bigger interconnected story

1962
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,680
that's slowly coming into focus as each episode continues.

1963
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:14,520
It's really cool.

1964
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,920
It feels it feels like there's like a world happening

1965
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,720
because all these characters are doing things and following their own goals.

1966
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,920
But it's happenstance that brings them together rather than like

1967
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:29,160
a kind of like more blatant kind of like schlocky plot.

1968
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,320
It's just like they're just doing their own lives.

1969
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,920
And and they're just getting into this cab and talking to this one guy

1970
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,040
is like the thread that like starts connecting them

1971
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,200
and like bringing them close together.

1972
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,240
It's pretty cool. I recommend it.

1973
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,080
Hmm. OK.

1974
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,600
All right.

1975
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:45,560
Listen, I'm here.

1976
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:48,160
Yeah, I feel you down with this.

1977
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:50,960
I'm down with picking up what you're throwing down, dog.

1978
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,840
OK. It makes sense. Sounds good.

1979
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:54,320
All right.

1980
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,640
Prize. I probably won't watch it.

1981
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,120
But I don't know.

1982
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,240
I'll watch the two hour YouTube man,

1983
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,400
but not a twenty three minute episode.

1984
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:07,240
Absolutely, because I can fucking draw sprites.

1985
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:10,920
I can draw sprites while I listen to YouTube puppet man.

1986
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,520
Only we knew Japanese.

1987
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,520
I mean, well, I mean, you got to watch a show.

1988
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,880
I don't know. I can't like some some bullshit on YouTube.

1989
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,400
Some guy talking about video games.

1990
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,400
I can just listen and I don't have to look at it.

1991
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:31,640
A guy, a show, though, like a cartoon, like you got to you got to watch that.

1992
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:35,160
OK, then if you have to watch it, what's the problem with it?

1993
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,800
Not being you're not going to watch another tab anyway.

1994
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,880
So just like put aside 20 minutes and watch it.

1995
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,800
But I don't want to put those 20 minutes aside.

1996
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:44,880
I want to make sprites.

1997
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,320
I want to play Noida for 600 hours.

1998
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,400
Yes, I want to if.

1999
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,160
And that's that's my Noida time.

2000
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,400
That's my Noida time.

2001
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:56,400
And I can't it can't sacrifice any of it.

2002
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,720
Well, I can argue with that.

2003
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:03,880
I can and I do listen to YouTube video game man while I play Noida.

2004
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:07,080
That's like my favorite thing to do is those two things at the same time.

2005
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,200
That's that's it for me.

2006
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:11,200
That's that's that's all I need.

2007
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,520
Playing video games while listening to something.

2008
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,000
Yeah, I'm not into that.

2009
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,680
You don't want to get absorbed into the experience.

2010
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:22,080
Dog.

2011
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,440
Dog. No, that's so fucked up.

2012
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,320
No, that's what I do.

2013
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,720
I put on I put on a fucking two and a half hour.

2014
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,280
I two and a half hour retrospective on why

2015
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:38,760
on why Platinum, Pokemon Platinum is better than Pokemon Crystal.

2016
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:43,560
And and then I and then I played Noida for that long.

2017
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:47,000
And then I just said I guess I guess something like more roguelike

2018
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,400
like like Noida works in that.

2019
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:55,400
But I usually play like linear games that are a bit more active thinking.

2020
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,560
Yeah, I guess it probably wouldn't work well with like a story driven.

2021
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,840
Active thinking is not the right word, because obviously there's a lot of active

2022
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,760
thinking going on moment to moment in Noida.

2023
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,760
But like something that's more narratively engaging, I guess.

2024
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:11,440
Yeah, if I'm going to be engaged by a narrative, I don't want some fucking

2025
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:15,600
white guy telling me how nostalgic he is for, I don't know, Banjo-Kazooie.

2026
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,200
Like that's yeah.

2027
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:25,080
Next voicemail is called Bleach Fan 17 3 2 1 Go.

2028
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:42,000
OK, 15 seconds in.

2029
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,320
Those who do not know what love is liking it to beauty.

2030
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,160
Those who claim to know what love is liking it to ugliness.

2031
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:58,360
Bleach volume 20 and a hypnosis.

2032
01:43:58,800 --> 01:43:59,800
Beautiful.

2033
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:04,880
More piano.

2034
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,800
This would be better if you played the piano yourself.

2035
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:14,480
But, you know, we all have to work within our limitations.

2036
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,360
Yeah, well, you know, the struggle.

2037
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,600
But thanks. Thanks, Kubo.

2038
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,920
Thanks for the thanks for the wisdom.

2039
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,000

Is that her name?

2051
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,280
No, I don't know.

2052
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,440
You know, this this cosplay lol cow.

2053
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:02,960

01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:06,680

Yes. OK, the channel is Cecil McFly.

2059
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,360
The video was the a Pixie Terry story.

2060
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:24,040
And this is the story of I had heard of this person before.

2061
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:28,840
But this is basically like an in depth, like her whole story on the Internet.

2062
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:33,560
And she's she's she's basically like, like, you know, I was going to say female

2063
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:39,120
AFAB Chris Chan, who wanted to be like a cosplay,

2064
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,760
wanted to be a gravure model.

2065
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:46,000
Basically, it was like trans Asian like claim to be Japanese,

2066
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,640
even though she wasn't like what else what else.

2067
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:55,800
Um, oh, but the I guess she had there was a time when she had kind of like

2068
01:45:55,800 --> 01:46:00,120
a breakdown and she like closed all her accounts and went offline for a while

2069
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:05,080
because Tite Kubo got married and like she had always wanted to like be with Tite

2070
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:07,520
Kubo, he was her husband.

2071
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,600
Oh, yeah, but he got married and she couldn't take it.

2072
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:13,440
Good, good stuff.

2073
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,360

Great. That's it.

Doing how are you doing?

2080
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,520
Thanks for the voicemail.

2081
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,320
If only there were all that simple.

2082
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,840
Yeah, right.

2083
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:46,320
The next one is called a message from your gaping ass.

2084
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:48,920
Three, two, one, go.

2085
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,960
Are you actually kidding me, Ben?

2086
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:55,320
You've made me sit here for over a year,

2087
01:46:55,320 --> 01:47:01,560
waiting on the Sonichu 102 lecture so you could sit around making a shitty game.

2088
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,280
Yes, I can't believe this.

2089
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,480
That's exactly right.

2090
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,960
I put all of my faith into you and you betrayed me.

2091
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,520
I'm so shit. This will not stand.

2092
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,080
I will fucking fly out there and I will hunt you down.

2093
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:20,200
And I swear I'll destroy your kneecaps.

2094
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:24,080
Have fun making a video game from a fucking wheelchair.

2095
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:27,480
A loser. That's like the optimal position to be.

2096
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,040
Then he can't get up and do other things.

2097
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,360
All he can do is sit his computer and finish the game making a video game

2098
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:35,240
from a wheelchair. Who am I? Tom Oliver.

2099
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:37,760
Yeah, seriously.

2100
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,240
God forbid.

2101
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:43,040
OK. Yeah, I fucking did it.

2102
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,840
Yeah, I fucking made you wait a year so I could make a shit.

2103
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,120
He's going to do it again. Good job.

2104
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:51,960
I will if I so if I please.

2105
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:55,040
Next one, a message from your gaping ass.

2106
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,920
Two, three, two, one, go.

2107
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,880
And another thing, you stupid piece of shit.

2108
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:03,800
I want to hear another thing.

2109
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:06,240
I hope you go to hell.

2110
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:09,200
By the way, Gib, I think you're really cool.

2111
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:14,000
OK, she didn't hear you stupid.

2112
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,360
I'll take that compliment for myself, though.

2113
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,120
No. Fuck.

2114
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,400
All right. Next one is called Conky Kong.

2115
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,360
Three, two, one, go.

2116
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,680
No more voicemails.

2117
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,840
And while we're at it, you're right.

2118
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,280
No more P. C. P.

2119
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:37,040
Agreed. Oh, God, if only we could be free from this curse.

2120
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,280
Agreed on all counts.

2121
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:42,480
Anyway, on to the next voicemail here on the pro

2122
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:45,840

from your gaping ass. Three, three, two, one, go.

2124
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:54,920
So turns out I was wrong.

2125
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,600
I just played the game.

2126
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,520
It's actually kind of fucking based.

2127
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,480
Yeah. Sorry, Ben.

2128
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,040
This will never happen again.

2129
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:03,600
I apologize. Better not.

2130
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,320
Stay in your fucking lane.

Next voicemail based Joker seven.

2138

Three, two, one, go.

2139
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:32,480
You know, some people find themselves

2140
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:34,920
waiting for the other shoe to drop.

2141
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:37,760
I was really happy I was waiting for the shoe to drop.

2142
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,560
But she no one's ever waiting for the other poo to plop.

2143
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,160
Why did he echo me?

2144
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:51,120
I mean, just to remind me that I said that one time, you know,

2145
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:55,120
you've got to have it's like that grayscale, you know, flashback sequence.

2146
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:57,840
Oh, I saw. Oh, I saw it in grayscale.

2147
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,080
Oh, absolutely. Of course. Absolutely.

2148
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,680
In slow motion. Yeah.

2149
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:02,520
Blurry. Blurry.

2150
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:07,480
It's like grainy, you know, kind of like superimposed over the over

2151
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:09,360
the negative space of the image.

2152
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,720
Yeah. Yeah.

2153
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,920
It's a cinematic painting, a picture.

2154
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:14,160
It's beautiful. Textbook.

2155
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,720
It's textbook. Next voicemail.

2156
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:18,400
A message from your gaping ass.

2157
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,160
Four, three, two, one, go.

2158
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,360
God damn it, Ben.

2159
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:28,480
You and your fucking shitty roundabout ways and loopholes.

2160
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:31,080
You just fucking took away all the power I had.

2161
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:32,320
OK, rape you.

2162
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,960
If you give me consent, dumb piece of shit.

2163
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,320
Oh, yeah. Great.

2164
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,440
Now, what am I supposed to do?

2165
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:39,480
Just jack off thinking about raping you?

2166
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,880
That's no fun. I wanted to actually do it.

2167
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,680
Now I can't. Can't do it.

2168
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:46,600
I did it. I cracked the code.

2169
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:49,160
I cracked the code. No more rape.

2170
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:51,880
No more rape. Universal consent.

2171
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:55,600
You know, if Andrew Yang gets elected mayor of New York,

2172
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,040
I hope he does away with his stupid universal basic income

2173
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:02,040
and implements the policy of universal basic consent.

2174
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,320
And that's where we can abolish rape.

2175
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,720
You know what? This joke is played out.

2176
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:12,360
You get it. You get it. Ha ha. Funny stuff.

2177
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:14,920
Next one. Audio borked a bit.

2178
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:18,360
But anyway, video games. Three, two, one, go.

2179
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:21,520
Then talking about his game got me thinking

2180
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,640
that it would be real cool to do like a PCP game jam or something.

2181
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,040
It's real easy to set one up on itch.io.

2182
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,120
You can just set the dates and tweet it out.

2183
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:31,880
You could have a theme or restrictions or it could just be free form.

2184
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:34,160
And then you can do a little stream to play through the games

2185
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,520
or a special podcast episode where you discuss them

2186
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:39,400
and it would be a fun community event, even outside of games.

2187
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:41,280
I think comic jams or other things like that

2188
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,320
would be a neat way to engage with the community

2189
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:45,320
and help foster people's creativity.

2190
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:47,680
Because making and discussing art is way more cool

2191
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:50,040
than talking about Twitter drama.

2192
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:52,200
You know, you know. It's got a point.

2193
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,400
You know, actually.

2194
01:51:55,360 --> 01:52:00,760
My server, some people in there made a channel.

2195
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:07,080
One of my mods, Spork, made a channel for doing game jam stuff.

2196
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,200
And three of them.

2197
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:11,600
And also one other person who I think is not in my discord,

2198
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,520
who I don't know, but three of them, Sporktown,

2199
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,400
Heroin, Tio and Roxanne Kaiser,

2200
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,080
they have been making a game.

2201
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:25,920
And you know what? I will I will link a tweet

2202
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,880
because like they're actually making it and it's actually like turning into.

2203
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
I'm like watching it turning into an actual video game on Twitter,

2204
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:37,840
you know, smugly snickering to myself that, you know,

2205
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:44,600
it started from like a jam sesh or an arrangement agreed upon

2206
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:48,760
in my discord server, which means that I get partial ownership.

2207
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:51,880
I get residuals. That's the deal.

2208
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:54,440
You signed it when you joined my server.

2209
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:57,400
Let's see here.

2210
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:02,240
Tio was tweeting it.

2211
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,360
Yes, I found it.

2212
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:06,920
There it is.

2213
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:10,200
Well, as you can see, if you if you follow the link.

2214
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:15,400
Yeah, they got this game that they're making where you're like some kind of bat girl

2215
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:21,720
and you like skate around on rooftops and you glide on your bat wings.

2216
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:23,920
And you I don't know, you do stuff.

2217
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,960
And it's looking it's looking good.

2218
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,840
It's looking cool.

2219
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:34,600
So, you know, you might you might call that a sort of PCP game

2220
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:38,920
jam of sorts, they just they just did it on their own.

2221
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,360
They just fucking did it.

2222
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,720
I just realized I posted my picture from like two

2223
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:47,080
hours ago on the wrong chat because I'm an idiot.

2224
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,840
Wait, where'd you post yours in the main?

2225
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:52,000
I'll just put it in the the place it should be.

2226
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,920
Oh, oh, the cookie cutters.

2227
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:55,880
Yeah, you did.

2228
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:00,080
Well, true, dumb, dumb.

2229
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,720
Eleazar can't see that shit.

2230
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,800
He's not allowed in the real server.

2231
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,120
Forgot.

2232
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:09,120
Keep in this wild garden.

2233
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:14,720
Next voicemail is where is it?

2234
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,720
It's Jackass.

2235
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,480
Yes, yes, Jackass.

2236
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,560
Three, two, one, go.

2237
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:24,080
Hey, guys, you want to know what I just realized?

2238
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:27,960
It's called self-abuse because if you beat your beat hard enough,

2239
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:30,120
your dick starts to cry tears of life.

2240
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,640
And unlike a battered woman, it can't call the cops on you.

2241
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,760
Said.

2242
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,000
I mean.

2243
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:42,200
OK, duh.

2244
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:45,280
You think you tell me that?

2245
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:46,800
Oh, you just figured that out.

2246
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, bad, bad.

2247
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:51,600
Great. Thanks for the voicemail, sucker.

2248
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,320
Next one is called Munky needs a hug.

2249
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:57,960
Three, two, one, go.

2250
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,960
You know what, Ben, I heard you saying you don't know why

2251
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,360
Munky would want to be back on the podcast if not to talk about Trixie.

2252
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:09,840
Have you ever considered that maybe he just wants to talk to some god damn friends?

2253
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:13,560
You know, like the PCP was mentioned, originally meant to be

2254
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:17,080
excuse for some friends to come together every week and talk to each other

2255
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:19,240
to help keep the friendship together.

2256
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:22,480
That may not have worked for the vast majority of you guys, but fuck.

2257
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,160
I'm just sad you don't even seem to consider that angle.

2258
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:28,880
Oh, well, would Munky ever want to hang out with me if not to

2259
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,200
shit talk someone who used to be friends with?

2260
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:33,800
I mean, I believe in the power of friendship, man.

2261
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:35,120
I mean, we haven't.

2262
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:36,200
What are you talking about?

2263
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:36,880
We haven't talked.

2264
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,400
I haven't talked to him in like in like two years.

2265
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,560
I don't know. I'm not.

2266
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,000
I hope it. I hope it's not.

2267
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,800
I hope it's not the I hope it's not inflammatory to say.

2268
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,240
I don't really think we're friends.

2269
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:53,200
We don't like talk, so I don't I don't know, man.

2270
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,960
Whatever, who knows what the future holds.

2271
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:58,120
But yeah, I just I just thought.

2272
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:03,320
I just thought it just seemed obvious that if we were going to talk,

2273
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:07,360
that what else that just seems like something that would naturally talk about.

2274
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:12,880
What? But for for content, anyone that doesn't know, I asked.

2275
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:17,440
I asked Munky if he wanted to because because nobody else wanted him to be on the show.

2276
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:21,680
But I was like, well, I mean, maybe I'll just could record something with him

2277
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:25,000
and just talk about Trixie on our own.

2278
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,520
And he was like, no, I don't want to talk about her.

2279
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,480
I just want to be back on the show.

2280
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,520
And I'm like, well, I mean, I get.

2281
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:36,040
But no, I was the only one that wanted to do that.

2282
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:38,040
And I got out of voted.

2283
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,840
So I don't know.

2284
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:42,160
I don't know. I don't know if I don't know if that's going to happen.

2285
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,480
And like, why and why?

2286
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,200
Why would we do it?

2287
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:49,160
If we weren't going to talk about Trixie, it just seems obvious.

2288
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,360
It would be it would be just seems natural.

2289
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:52,520
It would be strange.

2290
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,200
That's the thing I want to talk about.

2291
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:56,400
That's the thing I would want to talk with him about.

2292
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:00,280
That would be like the obvious launching point, I guess. Right.

2293
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:03,160
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought.

2294
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,560
That's what I thought. And that was my plan.

2295
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:07,080
I don't know.

2296
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:08,360
I don't know.

2297
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:11,840
Um, anyway, next voicemail is called

2298
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:16,360
Sanity check at the silent rave. Joker socks optional.

2299
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:18,320
Three, two, one, go.

2300
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:23,800
Bear and I are locked up now

2301
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:29,880
at the clusterfunk hell sanatorium.

2302
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:34,760
Nothing to do but sing and dance.

2303
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:38,880
Sing and dance and misbehave

2304
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:45,200
at the clusterfunk asylum, silent rave.

2305
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:59,800
Oh, that ended suddenly.

2306
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,840
I wasn't expecting it.

2307
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,440
Feels like it's a transition piece.

2308
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,720
The next like emotional high point of the arc.

2309
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:11,080
Yeah, yeah, I feel like the next one starts right where this one cuts off.

2310
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:12,080
Yeah.

2311
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:14,640
Silent, a silent rave.

2312
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:16,840
That's the thing where like that's a real thing, right?

2313
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:20,640
It's when it's a rave, but like instead of them playing the music,

2314
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,480
everyone's got their headphones in, right?

2315
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,680
I believe so.

2316
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,640
And they're all they're all raving to the music.

2317
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,840
But like, if you don't have your headphones in, you can't hear anything.

2318
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:29,800
Yeah. And everyone's dancing.

2319
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:31,320
Just look like freaks.

2320
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:34,160
Yeah. Yeah.

2321
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:38,000
I went to a rave once in Poland.

2322
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,120
It was pretty cool.

2323
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:47,600
OK, next voice is called Ben.

2324
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:49,520
Read one piece, please.

2325
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,120
Still trying, huh?

2326
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:54,720
Really, it took forty seven seconds for you to deliver this voicemail.

2327
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:58,080
Let's let's see what you let's see what you did with the with that time.

2328
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,800
Three, two, one, go.

2329
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:01,000
OK.

2330
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:06,960
Ben, real quick question about the Sanju one or two, not like,

2331
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,920
when is it coming out?

2332
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:09,840
Yeah, this time.

2333
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:13,200
But I don't really follow all the pony shit.

2334
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:14,760
I don't care about it.

2335
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:17,200
I am I'm never going to care.

2336
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,080
Why would you need to?

2337
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:20,880
I mean, you guys are so into it, but I don't give a fuck.

2338
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:26,560
But what does that have to do with Sanju one or two?

2339
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:30,640
Can you explain that a little bit?

2340
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:34,760
What was it just like you wanted to get one project done before you do another one?

2341
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,240
No, it's not like you had one or two done.

2342
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:40,560
And that was content related reasons before.

2343
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,920
I feel like I explained this already, but I'll explain.

2344
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:46,720
Also, go to the dentist like your mommy told you it's good for you.

2345
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:49,120
I have. Oh, God.

2346
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,760
Oh, God, this freaks me out.

2347
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:53,800
Speaking of the dentist, I think I have a.

2348
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:58,640
I was looking at my teeth the other day and I think I have a spot on one of my

2349
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:04,240
teeth that I think I think is something called a root carry,

2350
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:09,040
which if you Google that, you will find horrifying pictures.

2351
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:15,480
Mine is not like that bad, but I think it is like a very early like root carry

2352
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:19,720
that I was I was reading about like treatments for it.

2353
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:24,880
And I don't know, maybe I'm hope I'm hoping it's not as bad, but like,

2354
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:29,280
you know, if they get bad, they can like destroy your tooth.

2355
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:32,320
You got to just fucking lose that you got a fucking root canal that shit.

2356
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,800
And I'm so I'm so fucking scared.

2357
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,760
Yeah, I've been ignoring my teeth for like a year.

2358
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:40,600
And I'm pretty sure I got like I went to the dentist.

2359
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:46,760
Like maybe a year and a half ago and because I went there because I thought

2360
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:49,240
I had a really bad cavity and like, yeah, you have cavities,

2361
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,360
but you have so many we can only do half your mouth right now.

2362
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:54,120
We'll have to do another one later.

2363
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:56,520
And so they did like all these fillings.

2364
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:59,680
And then ever since then for like a year and a half,

2365
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:03,600
my mouth's been bleeding almost constantly on the side that they did

2366
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:05,760
the fillings and the other side that they didn't is fine.

2367
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,520
So I didn't go back because it's like clear, you just made the problem worse.

2368
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:10,480
I don't have.

2369
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:12,040
But I've just been ignoring that.

2370
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:13,600
It was probably a bad idea.

2371
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:17,240
Nothing in my mouth like causes me discomfort or anything.

2372
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:22,360
Like I don't have any like pain or irritation or anything like that.

2373
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:29,800
So I feel like probably nothing is like super advanced to the point

2374
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:31,400
that it's like awful.

2375
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:33,640
But I don't know.

2376
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:35,720
I googled.

2377
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:42,280
I googling, googling about root carry has really made it sound like a dire

2378
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:43,400
any medical issue.

2379
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:45,400
It always makes it 10 million times worse.

2380
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:51,400
And then I'm hoping I'm hoping that that's was the effect that was going on

2381
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:55,000
with that because it was it made it sound like if you've got one of these,

2382
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,560
your tooth is fucking done.

2383
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,480
You are going under the knife.

2384
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:00,800
You got to cut your whole fucking job.

2385
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:03,160
I mean, at that point, I just like just pull the fucking tooth.

2386
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,640
I don't give a shit.

2387
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:07,760
Oh, God, it'd be cheaper, easier.

2388
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:12,440
Fuck it must must just must just suck to get your tooth pulled, though.

2389
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:13,920
Right. Oh, I've never had a.

2390
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:17,120
Sure, it's a bitch, but Jesus.

2391
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:19,880
But about Sonichu.

2392
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:25,640
Yeah, the reason why it's not it's not just pony shit.

2393
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,440
My comic Slime and Punishment is Sonichu Canon.

2394
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:33,360
It is official Sonichu Canon.

2395
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:37,480
It is technically Sonichu special number.

2396
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,480
Hold on.

2397
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:44,200
It is Sonichu special number seven or eight, I think.

2398
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:47,280
Let me let me find that out for sure.

2399
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:50,960
Sonichu, Sonichu comic.

2400
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:55,000
Go down to the chapter listings, Sonichu special number.

2401
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:58,960
Yeah, Slime and Punishment is Sonichu special number seven.

2402
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:04,400
So in covering the lore of Sonichu, I had to talk about

2403
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,840
Slime and Punishment.

2404
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:11,600
And so I wanted Slime and Punishment to be done before I released that video.

2405
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:17,160
And the game is the end of Slime and Punishment.

2406
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:19,920
So that is why I waited.

2407
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:22,560
I wanted to wait to release Sonichu 102

2408
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:28,120
so that all the canon could be out when I talk about it.

2409
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:31,120
And that's it.

2410
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:34,880
Next voicemail is called a simple misunderstanding.

2411
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:36,960
Three, two, one, go.

2412
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:42,360
Hey, Ben, just wanted to clarify some things.

2413
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:46,800
When I said that you would stop being a dumb leftist,

2414
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:50,280
I did not mean that you would stop being a leftist altogether.

2415
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:51,440
You mean I would stop being dumb.

2416
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:54,840
I just meant you would start being a based and history

2417
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:59,640
pillow leftist because my bastard is very good and very funny.

2418
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:06,400
Well, and you would get a better understanding of why your beliefs are based.

2419
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,040
That was all.

2420
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:13,760
Fair enough. I apologize if that I wasn't specific about that.

2421
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:14,680
Don't apologize to me.

2422
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,360
Apologize to that guy.

2423
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:18,320
Anticipate the misunderstanding.

2424
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:19,400
Sorry about that.

2425
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:19,840
It's fine.

2426
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,000
My bad. It's fine.

2427
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Have a great one.

2428
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,400
You too, buddy.

2429
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,480
Yeah, OK.

2430
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:27,600
All right. Love you.

2431
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:31,840
I understand.

2432
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,880
I get you.

2433
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:40,640
Cool. I mean, yeah, it's always more based to know more than to know less.

2434
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,440
True.

2435
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:45,080
I should be more history pilled.

2436
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,800
I don't I don't once in a while

2437
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:53,400
I will listen to like a history podcast or something and like I like it.

2438
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:56,480
And it's cool, but I don't do it that often.

2439
02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:02,200
And so I often am like, I just don't know as much about some things as maybe I ought to.

2440
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:08,800
Yeah, next voicemail is called Autism 101.

2441
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:11,080
And oh, my God, it's a minute 26.

2442
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:13,320
This is better be good. Three, two, one, go.

2443
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:21,080
Hey, guys, just wanted to explain some things about autism that you guys seem to have had difficulty last week's talk

2444
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:23,320
because that's kind of frustrating.

2445
02:05:23,320 --> 02:05:25,760
You guys don't know about that, but that's OK.

2446
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:26,760
I'm going to try and explain.

2447
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:28,880
I got a lot of things to talk about, so I'll be quick.

2448
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:36,960
So autism, it is, in fact, two spectrums because it affects two areas of behavior in humans.

2449
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:42,360
And to be autistic, you just have to land somewhere on those two spectrums.

2450
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:48,840
It can be very high on one and very low on the other, et cetera, et cetera.

2451
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:59,760
Those two areas of human development and behavior are the interpersonal communication and ability to socially communicate.

2452
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:08,960
And it is the repetitive behavior and limited interest areas of human behavior.

2453
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:19,080
So, in essence, autistic people will generally have some inflexibility, be very attached to their routines to various degrees,

2454
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:28,320
and they will also have a varying degree of difficulties with interpersonal communication or communication in general.

2455
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:32,440
And that's pretty much the basics of what autism is.

2456
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:35,040
Hope that was helpful.

2457
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:36,040
I see you.

2458
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:37,040
Love you, Deb.

2459
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:38,040
Love you, Ben.

2460
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:39,040
Fuck you.

2461
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:43,040
I'm out.

2462
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:47,680
With all due respect, no, that wasn't very helpful because I already said all that.

2463
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:52,400
I literally said all those things last week.

2464
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:53,840
I don't get it.

2465
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:56,080
What are you trying to clarify here?

2466
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:58,920
What about that did I get wrong?

2467
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:06,920
I mean, I'm not trying to antagonize you, but I don't get it.

2468
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:07,920
I don't get it.

2469
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:08,920
What are you correcting me on?

2470
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:09,920
What's the problem?

2471
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:10,920
I don't know.

2472
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:11,920
I don't know.

2473
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:15,920
Thanks for the voicemail.

2474
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:19,920
Next one is called Riley is bad at his job part two.

2475
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,920
Three, two, one, go.

2476
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:22,920
All right.

2477
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:25,920
So I want to make some clarifications on my voicemail segment.

2478
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:28,920
Riley is bad at his job from last week.

2479
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:34,800
So I know that he calls himself a producer and not a promoter.

2480
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:38,000
I also wanted to argue that he's a bad at promotion.

2481
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,600
So that's why I said promoter.

2482
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:43,960
He's also a terrible producer because he fucking can't produce an RV.

2483
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:47,200
He can't produce sound because his audio sounds like garbage.

2484
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:51,040
He can't produce fucking fans because he drives them away every time the smug little

2485
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,520
dipshit opens his mouth.

2486
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,520
So he's also bad at that part of his job.

2487
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:56,520
That's true.

2488
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:57,880
Ethan Ralph bit.

2489
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:02,080
So what had happened there was after the fight, both parties agreed to go on the Dick

2490
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:04,040
show and like talk about it.

2491
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:05,040
Yeah.

2492
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:10,480
Fucking Ethan Ralph called in and he was comparing himself to the Joker and it was really cringe.

2493
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:13,640
People on the Dick show also hate Ethan Ralph.

2494
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:17,960
So you know, really anybody could have taken it, but Riley chose not to call in.

2495
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:22,240
He said he was busy on the discord thing, even though he was there the entire time.

2496
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:23,240
What?

2497
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:25,520
He just looked like an absolute bitch.

2498
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:26,520
Why?

2499
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:30,240
You'd think that as a hip hop guy, he'd know that beefing is good for business, but that

2500
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:34,440
would imply that he's good at his job, which is I mean, they made that whole video to

2501
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:36,120
make beef out of PCP forever.

2502
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:37,120
Tom will never die.

2503
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:38,600
Call me back.

2504
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:40,600
Okay.

2505
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:44,760
That actually, I didn't know that that actually does really baffle me.

2506
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:48,240
Like it's like the whole thing cloud chasing.

2507
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:50,200
Like why would you not chase that?

2508
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:51,200
Yeah.

2509
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:54,920
If you're making the video, like you're make the video.

2510
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:57,480
It's all about the beef you have.

2511
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:02,880
And I mean, those the the Yig people, like they love Dick, they love the Dick show.

2512
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:05,320
Like they want to be on it.

2513
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:10,080
They they they'll go, I don't understand that and there's like a perfectly good opportunity

2514
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:11,080
to go.

2515
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:15,920
I that actually really throws me and I don't know what to make of it.

2516
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:17,680
It's very good.

2517
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:26,720
If someone can explain why I, I mean, I, I mean, I, I don't agree with a lot of their

2518
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:31,640
choices, but if you make the choices that they made, you know, you get in that situation,

2519
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:33,640
you make that video about it.

2520
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:34,640
Why then?

2521
02:09:34,640 --> 02:09:37,240
No, I don't want to talk about it.

2522
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:38,400
Why would you do that?

2523
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:39,400
I don't get it.

2524
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:42,160
I don't get it.

2525
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:47,040
But yeah, just another reason he's bad at his job.

2526
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:52,760
Why next voicemail is called why you got to assume three, two, one, go.

2527
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:57,600
Why you gotta assume every color's gender been always like, thank you, sir.

2528
02:09:57,600 --> 02:09:58,600
Okay.

2529
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:04,720
Mr. I think he said, just say they make it, you ain't gotta assume.

2530
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:06,200
You're probably right.

2531
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:07,360
You're probably right.

2532
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:16,920
I have a bad habit of just kind of assuming male by default, which is our analytics.

2533
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:19,520
You're probably right more often than not.

2534
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,520
Probably.

2535
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:28,200
But I also, you know, I feel like it's becoming, I think I'm becoming less and less probably

2536
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:30,320
right with each passing day.

2537
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:34,080
Everyone's getting, everyone's getting pink pilled and you know, it's, it's, it's starting

2538
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:36,800
to cause an inconvenience for me personally.

2539
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:39,760
So I don't like trans people anymore is what I'm saying.

2540
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:40,760
Oh no.

2541
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:41,760
Pink pilled.

2542
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:45,200
It's funny you say pink pilled because I, I misheard the colors as colors and I was

2543
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:47,080
like, did I miss something last week?

2544
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:48,080
Yeah.

2545
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:49,080
Yeah.

2546
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:50,080
I thought that's, yeah.

2547
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:51,080
I thought so too.

2548
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:52,080
But then I got the context.

2549
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:53,080
I was like, oh, callers.

2550
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:54,080
Yeah.

2551
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,080
Yeah.

2552
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:56,080
Yeah.

2553
02:10:56,080 --> 02:10:57,080
No, this, this color is right.

2554
02:10:57,080 --> 02:11:02,200
I probably should just default to they more, I, I advocate for everyone to do that.

2555
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:06,280
But I don't, I don't always put my money where my mouth is.

2556
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:08,560
They is just the perfect pronoun.

2557
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:12,400
More people, more people should use it more often and I should, I should be the change

2558
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:13,640
that I want to see in the world.

2559
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:16,160
I wish all pronouns, they for everything.

2560
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:17,160
Yeah.

2561
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:19,360
Well, all pronouns except that one because that one's good.

2562
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:20,360
Yeah.

2563
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:23,840
I guess, I guess you can stay and I, I can stay.

2564
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:28,640
No, they, only they for all those.

2565
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,640
Yeah.

2566
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:30,640
Yeah.

2567
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:31,640
Yeah.

2568
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:33,640
We is right out.

2569
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:40,480
Next, next voicemail is called perpetually two weeks behind three, two, one, go.

2570
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:43,520
Hey, I wanted to ask.

2571
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:48,560
What's the ideal fame to money ratio?

2572
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:53,120
Because if you have a lot of fame, you can get a lot of money and people will recognize

2573
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:58,280
you on the streets in like your entire life is now a public figure.

2574
02:11:58,280 --> 02:12:02,240
But if you have no fame, chances are you're not going to get much money.

2575
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:07,240
And I think it's very interesting how the different members of the PCP and previous

2576
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:13,960
PCP all had like different levels of fame and what they wanted from fame.

2577
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:23,080
Like Ben, he, he is pretty famous, but he's not so famous that most people would recognize

2578
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:24,160
him on the street.

2579
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:25,160
I wish I was more famous.

2580
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:26,160
Even less famous.

2581
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:33,000
Like I, I'm a fan of the PCP and I don't even think I'd be able to identify him if I saw

2582
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,000
him outside.

2583
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Wait, who?

2584
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:39,600
I was assuming you who were very famous.

2585
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:41,400
You know, I'm sure they got a lot of money.

2586
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:45,000
I think it kind of went to their head, you know, so I'm just curious.

2587
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:52,200
I wouldn't even call Trixie very famous, optimal level of fame, I mean, Trixie is Trixie at

2588
02:12:52,200 --> 02:13:00,280
her peak was like approaching like baseline internet at her, at her peak.

2589
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:05,360
I mean, she, she did rarely get recognized in public.

2590
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:08,160
Like not often, but it happened.

2591
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:15,800
Actually, I mean, I got recognized by something by a stranger just completely at random, at

2592
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:18,120
least like once or twice.

2593
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:19,120
Same.

2594
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:20,880
So did you?

2595
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:21,880
Always the most.

2596
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:22,880
Yeah, twice.

2597
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:23,880
It was very awkward.

2598
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:26,000
Um, mine was, mine was fine.

2599
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,880
It was just like, it was awkward on my part because I was not prepared.

2600
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:31,920
It's like, bye.

2601
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:32,920
I thought it was awesome.

2602
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:35,040
I was like, oh my God, holy shit.

2603
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,960
Uh, million views, baby.

2604
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:46,920
Um, the, the, uh, I mean, I just, I don't know, I don't like this question because

2605
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:49,800
I feel like more of both is always better.

2606
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:56,400
Oh, like the optimal mix of the two is just as much of both as I can get, please.

2607
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:58,120
I mean, there's definitely a limit for me.

2608
02:13:58,120 --> 02:14:03,680
I don't want to be like so famous that like I, when I go outside, like I get recognized

2609
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:04,680
left and right.

2610
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:09,920
But I think like in the sphere that we're involved in, that's not even an option.

2611
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:15,240
Like I think like, yeah, you can be, you can have like 10, 15, 20 million subscribers

2612
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:19,280
or something and still not get recognized when you go outside because like the internet's

2613
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:25,000
just like not big enough, you know, so, yeah.

2614
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:31,680
I mean, yeah, fame, fame on the level that it would like interfere with my daily life

2615
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:38,160
is like so far away that like doesn't happen in our pursuits at all.

2616
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:39,160
Yeah.

2617
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:40,160
Yeah.

2618
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:51,200
So I mean, I mean, just if I, um, I mean, I guess it would be bad.

2619
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:56,840
I guess I would lean a little more towards money just because if you are very famous,

2620
02:14:56,840 --> 02:15:00,480
but you have no money, like you're still, you're still poor.

2621
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:01,480
You're still fucked.

2622
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:02,480
Yeah.

2623
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:06,400
Whereas if you, if you're not famous at all, but you have tons of money, then like you

2624
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:08,400
can become famous.

2625
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:11,920
This guy implied, sorry, this person implied, I shouldn't assume gender.

2626
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:12,920
It's true.

2627
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:16,280
I say that like it's a joke, but I actually mean it sincerely.

2628
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:22,760
This person implied that like having more fame implies that you have more money.

2629
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:29,640
No, no, no, no, they said having more money implies that you have more fame and like that's

2630
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:31,200
not true at all.

2631
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:32,200
You can just like.

2632
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:35,640
Chris Chan's pretty famous, doesn't have a ton of money.

2633
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:36,640
That's true.

2634
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:43,360
Also like in the verse, you could just inherit a bunch of money or maybe you just fucking

2635
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:49,440
invested like a thousand dollars in Bitcoin in 2008 or whenever it started.

2636
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:58,040
And now you are, now you have fucking 500,000 is lying around somewhere and like you don't

2637
02:15:58,040 --> 02:16:00,360
have to be famous at all to do that.

2638
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:05,720
And once you've got a bunch of money, it's easy to turn that money into more money and

2639
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:06,720
like.

2640
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:07,720
Yeah.

2641
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:08,720
Or turn it into fame.

2642
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:09,720
You can buy attention.

2643
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:10,720
You can buy attention.

2644
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:13,040
So yeah, I would probably say money.

2645
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:19,520
I would lean towards money because like having no fame, having tons of money can solve all

2646
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:20,520
your problems.

2647
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:24,760
Having tons of fame, having tons of fame doesn't necessarily solve every problem that you will

2648
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:27,600
face as a result of having no money.

2649
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:28,800
Yeah.

2650
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:33,720
So that yeah, okay, satisfactorily answered.

2651
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:37,560
Next one is called it's all downhill from six.

2652
02:16:37,560 --> 02:16:40,800
She her three, two, one, go.

2653
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:44,640
I recently rewatched the final fantasy lecture.

2654
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:48,480
Still a pretty good watch, even though it's mainly just Wikipedia plot summaries of all

2655
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:52,440
the games and that's my least favorite one really and gotta be honest, like my least

2656
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:53,440
favorite one.

2657
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:58,640
But Ben, you had mentioned that Final Fantasy six is your favorite, which is based as fucking

2658
02:16:58,640 --> 02:16:59,640
I agree.

2659
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:00,640
It is the best one.

2660
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:01,640
Yes.

2661
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:06,520
And it seems to generally stand seven, but you know where it's at.

2662
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,600
Who's your favorite party member?

2663
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:09,600
Cool.

2664
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
My favorite.

2665
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:18,200
My favorite party member.

2666
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:26,080
God, I don't fucking know.

2667
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:27,080
I don't know.

2668
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:32,840
I feel like maybe my I'm drawn to six.

2669
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:40,200
Honestly, maybe a little bit out of a contrarian urge to be like, to be like, seven's not

2670
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:41,200
that great.

2671
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:42,200
Six is where it's really at.

2672
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:47,920
But at the same time, I genuinely had moments in six that like were really good.

2673
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:50,840
And I mean, seven's got great moments too.

2674
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:56,040
But you know, like the part where you catch the fish for Sid, it's like that part's great.

2675
02:17:56,040 --> 02:18:01,240
You know, the opera house, the opera house is so like cheesy.

2676
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:03,800
It's a little it's a little like goofy.

2677
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:09,080
But like, you know, whatever, if you just if you just let yourself enjoy it, it's like

2678
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:10,080
it's fun.

2679
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:11,080
It's a fun.

2680
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:12,080
It's a fun time.

2681
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:13,080
I don't know.

2682
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:20,080
I don't know if I, I mean, it's been a while since I played.

2683
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:21,400
I like Saban.

2684
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:26,080
I like Saban's like fighting commands for his his special moves.

2685
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:30,680
I think that's pretty cool.

2686
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:33,760
The I don't know.

2687
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:35,360
I don't know.

2688
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:40,240
They're all they're all kind of they're like mechanically all pretty similar to each other

2689
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:41,320
story wise.

2690
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:45,440
I guess I like.

2691
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:46,440
Oh my god.

2692
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:47,440
Is it Cyrus?

2693
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:51,960
Is Cyrus the knight that you pick up like late, late, later in the game?

2694
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:53,360
I think he's pretty.

2695
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:54,360
He's a pretty cool guy.

2696
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:55,560
I don't know.

2697
02:18:56,560 --> 02:18:59,880
Oh, none of the none of the characters really have like a ton of.

2698
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:05,440
None of the characters in six have like a ton of like development, like they don't have

2699
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:06,560
as much as they get in seven.

2700
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:09,360
Like in that level, I think like seven's got better characters.

2701
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:14,720
Whatever. Sorry.

2702
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:16,720
I feel like.

2703
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:18,120
This is this is a six.

2704
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:19,760
This is a six aficionado.

2705
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:25,040
He might be disappointed with my inability to articulate like my my preferences about

2706
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,080
it, but it's been a long time.

2707
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:28,280
Fucking up your brain.

2708
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:34,920
I'm I'm fucking up my brand right now, my my six loving brand next next voicemail is

2709
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:38,320
called our pal Doug three two one go.

2710
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:42,200
Just to give you guys an excuse to talk about nostalgia critic again.

2711
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:48,880
I have the weird distinction of having seen Doug Walker in person twice before ever having

2712
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:53,320
seen his content, both of the same Walgreens, so he must live near me.

2713
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:58,120
The third time I saw him, I'd actually seen some of his videos and it was the Gallup and

2714
02:19:58,120 --> 02:19:59,120
Ghost Arcade.

2715
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:02,840
And I remember like, I fucking, it was so interesting because the first time I was

2716
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:04,560
like, oh, it's like, oh, it's all exciting.

2717
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:06,320
It was like, it was the internet man out.

2718
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:06,840
Look at that.

2719
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:07,800
He's like internet famous.

2720
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:08,880
I'd never seen one of his videos.

2721
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:10,480
So I was all like, oh, interesting.

2722
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,240
The third time I met him, I had seen his videos and I fucking hate them.

2723
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:17,920
And it was a completely different experience where I was like, oh, there he is.

2724
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:18,440
Look at him.

2725
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:19,480
Look at that goblin.

2726
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:21,440
I just think it's fucking funny.

2727
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:23,240
How.

2728
02:20:24,360 --> 02:20:29,920
How do you remember that you saw him twice before you knew who he was?

2729
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:33,880
I would assume he knew his face, but didn't see his content.

2730
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:37,320
Like just like, oh, I know that someone from the internet I've seen like screenshots or

2731
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:39,680
people talk about them on social media or whatever.

2732
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,120
But I've just never watched the content.

2733
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:43,320
Oh, like he knew who Doug Walker was.

2734
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:45,200
Just hadn't seen his videos.

2735
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:45,640
Right.

2736
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:47,800
Oh, yeah, that could be it.

2737
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:52,600
I was thinking that maybe this was just like a person that like you knew from

2738
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:57,440
around town to maybe like, why is this guy walking around with like a loose

2739
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:59,520
fitting tie and like a weird hat?

2740
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:05,400
And that was that was what keyed him in to getting interest in him.

2741
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:07,000
It's like, I got it.

2742
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,040
I got this guy's there.

2743
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:09,720
What this guy must have a story.

2744
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:12,720
I got a I got to hire a private eye to figure this guy out.

2745
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:17,760
And you find out he's a he's the head of a of a fucking global

2746
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:20,160
monolith of internet criticism.

2747
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:21,720
He started a revolution.

2748
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:24,440
He's that guy with the glasses.

2749
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,720
He's he's that guy.

2750
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,960
He's the he's the guy with the glasses.

2751
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:32,640
We have one brand.

2752
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:37,400
We have one more voicemail and it is called Autism 102.

2753
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:41,000
Oh, no, I hope it's better than the last one.

2754
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:43,960
Three, two, one, go.

2755
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:48,280
Hey, gang, just wanted to explain a couple more things about autism

2756
02:21:48,280 --> 02:21:49,560
before I left you guys alone.

2757
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:55,240
It's very hard for autistic people and non-autistic people to empathize

2758
02:21:56,080 --> 02:22:02,600
with each other because our brains work in very, very different ways,

2759
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:04,440
like fundamentally.

2760
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:09,040
And since, you know, when you try to like discern motivations or

2761
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:12,560
intentions, but I thought it was a spectrum, two spectrums, it's very hard

2762
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:16,840
because you don't have the same framework that led them to those decisions.

2763
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:17,360
I don't know.

2764
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:21,000
I'm not trying to defend tricks here or anything.

2765
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,400
I'm just, you know, it's hard.

2766
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:25,000
It's hard. I've done with this.

2767
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,360
She's not autistic life.

2768
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:27,880
She's not fucking autistic.

2769
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:29,000
Like I make a decision.

2770
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:34,240
I think about something and people look at me like, why the fuck are you doing?

2771
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:36,640
That's a logical step.

2772
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:37,520
Oh, OK.

2773
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:38,720
What?

2774
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:45,640
And so it's kind of hard to really know if when someone's autistic,

2775
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:48,160
what's going on in their head.

2776
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:52,480
She does or she's not even it's not even clear what she thinks.

2777
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:59,480
So, yeah, try not to, you know, scribe intentions and shit.

2778
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:03,280
It's kind of kind of leads to bad stuff.

2779
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:04,160
What the fuck is this?

2780
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:06,320
All right, that's what I want to say.

2781
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:07,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2782
02:23:07,880 --> 02:23:09,760
Am I speaking out of turn, but I'm annoyed.

2783
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:10,760
I this is annoying.

2784
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:11,760
I don't have a contact.

2785
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:13,640
So what are you talking about?

2786
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:15,920
Like, what the fuck are you talking about?

2787
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:21,760
Don't ascribe intentions to things that someone with autism has because

2788
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:27,400
non-autistic people and autistic people just can't empathize with each other.

2789
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:29,200
So I don't know.

2790
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:30,000
I get OK.

2791
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,440
I think the point is like an autistic person

2792
02:23:33,480 --> 02:23:35,320
operates with a different mental framework.

2793
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:40,520
So like you partially actions is not necessarily what they were coming at it from.

2794
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:43,920
But like that extends to people in general, right?

2795
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:46,760
Like everybody kind of processes things in their own way.

2796
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:48,960
And like it's easy to misunderstand intention.

2797
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:50,800
The the.

2798
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:56,640
Oh, God, like, OK, autism is two spectrums.

2799
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:03,840
So are you I mean, two people can be at different points on the spectrum,

2800
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:06,520
but still like share some things in common, right?

2801
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:11,000
Because they both they both two people exist on, you know,

2802
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,840
on points along this well-defined spectrum.

2803
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:17,280
They're they're not polar opposites of one another.

2804
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:22,360
They are all arranged along this linear continuum.

2805
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:27,200
So it's not like it's not like there's nothing in common.

2806
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:30,320
It's not like there's no understanding that can be.

2807
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:34,640
I don't I don't really know to what extent.

2808
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:38,080
I don't.

2809
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:40,520
First of all, first of all, OK,

2810
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:44,880
assuming we're talking about someone who is like really profoundly autistic

2811
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:51,040
to the point that I like a non-autistic person just can't empathize with them,

2812
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:53,120
can't understand the way they think their motivations.

2813
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:54,680
Sure, fair enough.

2814
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:56,360
Is Trixie that? No.

2815
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:58,200
Is Trixie autistic? No.

2816
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:00,720
Uh, I know I'm not a doctor.

2817
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:04,720
I know maybe she maybe she should get a diagnosed by a doctor

2818
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:06,760
or something before we say that for sure.

2819
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:07,520
But that's the point.

2820
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:09,280
She hasn't been diagnosed with anything.

2821
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:13,080
I mean, even if even if Trixie was to get diagnosed,

2822
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:16,400
like it would be a mild case, like because I mean, like, right,

2823
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:20,880
it's not it's not like there's like any sort of like communication barrier there.

2824
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:24,120
Like, yeah, on a fundamental level, like we've collaborated,

2825
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:27,800
worked on projects for years, like we've it's there's definitely

2826
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:33,560
you know, enough of a common barrier there that I think I think I'm comfortable

2827
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:38,640
saying that to some extent, the likes of you and I can ascribe

2828
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:42,080
some kind of motivation behind Trixie's actions.

2829
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:47,560
I'm pretty sure that we're capable of empathizing at least a little bit

2830
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:50,440
with what she with her brain.

2831
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:53,320
Right. I don't think the barrier there is impassable.

2832
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,480
I'm sure I'm a little annoyed.

2833
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:56,480
I'm a little pissed off.

2834
02:25:56,840 --> 02:26:01,200
I would just argue the entire like basis of our friendship going back

2835
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:04,440
to like the pony days is that we were all kind of doing similar things

2836
02:26:04,440 --> 02:26:06,000
and coming at things from a similar angle.

2837
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,480
That was kind of how our friendship was forged to begin with.

2838
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:11,200
So, yeah, I don't know, like.

2839
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:17,600
I'm being hard on this guy.

2840
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:20,520
I mean, I don't think there's anything wrong with making this case.

2841
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:23,040
I just don't know if it applies in this particular situation.

2842
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:26,640
Well, that's the point I I feel like it nakedly doesn't apply.

2843
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:30,400
Like to the point that I'm like confused about what is even trying to say.

2844
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:35,080
Well, again, I'm operating without context for prior episodes.

2845
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:40,080
But like, obviously, we know much more about how Trixie acts and is in person

2846
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:45,040
than this person. The short version is that I guess at some point

2847
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:49,280
or at one or two points in the past, Trixie has talked about being autistic

2848
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:53,640
or behaving as though she's she's like alluded to it.

2849
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:56,800
And people were saying and I said like,

2850
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,600
you know, actually, it's kind of I said, like, you know, that should be diagnosed.

2851
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,400
You can't self diagnose that.

2852
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:06,800
And some people were like, well, I don't know, it's like.

2853
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:13,280
And I know that like it's it's it is it's diagnosed through like a series of questions.

2854
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:18,280
So it's not like I mean, like in theory, in theory, if you really understood autism,

2855
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:21,240
you wouldn't necessarily have to be a doctor to make like a credible case

2856
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:24,960
that like, oh, yeah, this person is, you know, far enough along with whatever these spectrums.

2857
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:28,400
Like, yeah, you could probably like maybe that you would need some you would need

2858
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:32,600
at least some level of expertise, you need to be some level of expertise.

2859
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:35,640
Right. I would I would say if nothing for no other reason,

2860
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:40,400
like you can't objectively give yourself an examination

2861
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:45,040
because like your own biases are going to be clouding your own right that that too.

2862
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:50,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, yeah, I said, like, you know, you should at least

2863
02:27:50,480 --> 02:27:52,440
have some level of expertise.

2864
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:54,560
You should be to diagnose yourself.

2865
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:58,880
But yeah, it's probably even if you are an expert, you shouldn't be able to diagnose yourself

2866
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:02,240
because obviously you're going to be biased about when the subject believe it.

2867
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:07,520
And you can say like I resonate a lot with these symptoms and like I probably have it.

2868
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:10,840
But like until you get diagnosed, you can't really say for sure.

2869
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:13,920
It's like for a while, I thought that I had mild ADHD.

2870
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:18,840
But I didn't like say I had ADHD until I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist.

2871
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:20,880
And they were like, yeah, like here's medication.

2872
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:26,000
I made the argument last time that like being autistic since it's a spectrum,

2873
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:31,240
it's kind of like being tall, where like, OK, maybe if you like if you're

2874
02:28:31,240 --> 02:28:37,320
in the middle of the spectrum and you go to a professional and you they do a test

2875
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:42,920
and the result is like, well, you kind of display some autistic traits.

2876
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:46,120
It's like, well, OK, so are you autistic then?

2877
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:50,000
Maybe like there's not really an answer.

2878
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:54,240
But like it's just like any other human made category where like the category

2879
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:55,480
doesn't actually exist.

2880
02:28:55,480 --> 02:29:00,480
It's just a way of categorizing a sequence of traits and things like that.

2881
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:01,920
So like, right.

2882
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:05,360
It's all it's all fucking dicey if you really start like hacking away at it.

2883
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:10,080
It's a good well, well put, well put, it's it's it's a category.

2884
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:11,960
It's it's a line.

2885
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:15,960
It's a line that we draw around a certain cluster of traits.

2886
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:21,400
And we say these are we call we call these traits this thing.

2887
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:23,320
If you're like this, you're autistic.

2888
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:25,440
But it's like, well, I'm kind of like that.

2889
02:29:25,440 --> 02:29:27,400
But like, I'm not all the way like that.

2890
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:30,320
And like, I have a little bit like that, but I'm kind of on the edge.

2891
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:32,920
That's the whole point of saying it's a spectrum in the first place.

2892
02:29:32,920 --> 02:29:36,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2893
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:37,720
True, true.

2894
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:42,240
But like, I don't know where.

2895
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:44,960
What are we even talking about?

2896
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:47,840
What was the question?

2897
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:53,000
I'm I'm, you know, damn, I don't like this note.

2898
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,920
I don't like this as a note to go out on.

2899
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:01,520
Shit.

2900
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:03,680
Somebody quick, somebody send in the new voice.

2901
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:05,600
Five at five.

2902
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:07,400
Maybe someone left a voicemail.

2903
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:11,760
No, no, no, I'm refreshing, but there's nothing.

2904
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:14,040
What are you doing there?

2905
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:15,080
Ah, fuck it, whatever.

2906
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:17,800
You know what? We so what this episode sucks.

2907
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:19,640
We make these every week.

2908
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:22,600
They'll come back to the trough for more slop next time.

2909
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:25,400
And then we can make up for it.

2910
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:26,800
This is what happens when there's no give.

2911
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:28,280
The episode just sucks.

2912
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:30,400
The episode just sucks.

2913
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,800
And everyone hates it.

2914
02:30:31,800 --> 02:30:33,440
Apps in the chat for give.

2915
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:35,040
She wasn't feeling good.

2916
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:38,480
Oh, yeah, she said she was feeling sicker than usual today,

2917
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:41,160
which is very unfortunate because like, damn,

2918
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:43,160
she's been sick for like a

2919
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:44,840
kind of like almost a month now, right?

2920
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:45,760
Yeah, Jesus.

2921
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:46,760
That sucks.

2922
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:52,440
Hope it's not her liver, pancreas or whatever the fuck.

2923
02:30:56,040 --> 02:31:00,520
Gulp, she's coming down with a case of the autism.

2924
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:02,920
Yeah, it's it's it's contagious.

2925
02:31:02,920 --> 02:31:04,360
Actually, I hear.

2926
02:31:04,360 --> 02:31:06,600
Oh, no, we're all infected then.

2927
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:07,920
Trixie got it.

2928
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:10,280
She's spanked.

2929
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:12,160
See, more contagious than covid.

2930
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:14,600
What were we thinking?

2931
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:18,000
And deadly or two.

2932
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,480
There's no vaccine for that.

2933
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:21,440
There's no vaccine for that, baby.

2934
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:23,120
Are you vexed? Did you get vexed?

2935
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:24,240
Not yet.

2936
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:25,480
Did you see I got vexed?

2937
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:28,800
I got did I did I mention on the last episode?

2938
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:29,800
Did I get my shot?

2939
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:30,640
I was in here.

2940
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:32,080
I don't I don't remember.

2941
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:33,800
Whatever, if I didn't mention it last time.

2942
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:38,200
Yeah, I got my first shot and I'm getting another one in three

2943
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:42,800
at two, two, two to three weeks, going to be going to be cool.

2944
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:48,840
I saw the dev of that game.

2945
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:51,800
What game?

2946
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:54,000
Clarence is Clarence's big chance.

2947
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:57,160
You know that they talk about that is familiar.

2948
02:31:57,440 --> 02:32:01,520
It's the game where you play as like a fat, middle age,

2949
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:08,280
disgusting slob who has who has like who has like fucking

2950
02:32:08,480 --> 02:32:11,760
tricked his way into getting a date with a hot girl tonight.

2951
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:15,840
And he's got to like he's got to do his day perfectly so that he can be

2952
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:19,120
all set up to have like the perfect date and impress the girl.

2953
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:23,520
And he's got to like he's got to like find computers to like find her files

2954
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:26,880
so he can find out like what she likes and like buy her all the right gifts

2955
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:30,000
and like answer all of her questions in the way that will please her the most

2956
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:32,440
so that he can find his true love.

2957
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:38,160
Anyway, I saw the dev of that game saying that like the covid vaccine was

2958
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:42,240
really fucking with him and I said, damn, dude, sorry to hear that.

2959
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,560
Gone by and he liked it.

2960
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:46,480
He liked my reply to his tweet.

2961
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:49,000
So I thought that was pretty cool.

2962
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:54,480
Tobias Cornwall, the guy who got his fucking pineal gland removed

2963
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:57,240
because he had brain cancer or something.

2964
02:32:58,240 --> 02:32:59,120
Oh, God.

2965
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:00,560
I know, right?

2966
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:02,640
I'm only thinking about any of these things.

2967
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:04,320
No, it's scary as hell.

2968
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:07,120
But he fucking did it and he's he's good.

2969
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:09,120
He's good now.

2970
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:13,600
I kind of hope that we're young enough that maybe by like 2050,

2971
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:17,760
when we're like getting old, we'll finally have like artificial organ cloning.

2972
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:20,960
So maybe our bodies won't completely break down.

2973
02:33:20,960 --> 02:33:23,200
But I feel like God, I hope so thinking.

2974
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:26,800
I feel like even if they have that, that'll just be reserved for the rich

2975
02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:29,920
because we'll be in hardcore neo feudalism by then.

2976
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:36,480
Yeah, I mean, thanks for tuning in everybody.

2977
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:37,920
Have a good week.

2978
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:41,040
Pete, patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

2979
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:48,160
Speak pipe.com slash bzb voicemail to send us your thoughts on neo feudalism, baby.

2980
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:53,040
If you want to save us from neo feudalism, $5 a month gets you access to the bonus episodes.

2981
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:56,000
We can start pinching our pennies to get our artificial organs.

2982
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:59,040
We can keep making these podcasts for decades to come.

2983
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:03,360
$5 a month for more artificial organs for your old pals.

2984
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:04,320
Ben and Tom.

2985
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:05,440
Tom will never die.

2986
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:08,000
Make Tom never die at the patreon.
