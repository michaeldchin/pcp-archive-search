00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:20,000
the best guy ever and we're joined by Gibbontake. I'm so medium, I'm the medium guy ever. You've

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,320
never seen anybody quite as normal as me. Except of course for Ben Saint. Dab. I did it. An intro.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,720
Have you guys heard about the little game called Minecraft? Minecraft. There's been some rumblings

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,120
in the ether mod available for version 1.12 but not higher than that.

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,040
Welcome. I tried. It doesn't work. It doesn't work with the latest mods. They're fucking up over

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,200
there. What about, what's that one? Is it Technic? Is Technic the one that has like all this weird

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:08,240
technology stuff? Technic is the launcher. Technic is like an umbrella for a lot of mods. It used to

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,760
be one mod. I think a thing of Minecraft industrial or something like that. That's got like nuclear

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,920
reactors. No, I might be thinking because I'm just remembering the old the old Yogscast

11
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,840
series where they built like the the the Jaffa cake factory and they used the they used Technic

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,040
and maybe some other mods I don't remember. Mate, do you think we should like bring this up? Because I

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,400
am kind of curious what the audience of the actual podcast thinks. We should definitely bring it up.

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,880
Yeah. Okay, well let's just launch into it. We're changing the podcast to be a Minecraft

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,880
Let's play show. Minecraft only lads. What if the podcast was just us playing Minecraft

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,160
while talking? Duable. Literally doable. No video. Not really. Not really. So we've been

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,400
thinking, Meiji and I, it was a major proposal about setting up a PCP Minecraft server for

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,280
access for like patrons or something and there's been a great deal of discussion about basically

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,520
everyone thinks it'd be potentially a good idea. But the the hot debate has been how to roll it out

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,320
so as to not make it seem like weirdly expensive and then also to make it accessible to people

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,240
relatively easily. And oh boy, has there been some some I don't know struggles about what's the

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,200
appropriate plan? Do we make like a separate Patreon just for that? Well, that doesn't really feel

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,040
PCPS. Do we make it like a $7 tier? Well, now it seems like weirdly expensive and more price than

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,200
the bonus episodes, which are probably more value. I don't know. It's complicated. No, actually all

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,880
of those sounds like great, great values and whichever one we decide on you the viewer should be

26
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,280
excited to participate. If you haven't checked out the heckles for shackles live streams where we've

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,560
been playing Minecraft, it'll be like that except in real life. I love the idea of having our own

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,080
server may just been all the heavy work of like trying to experiment three days and nothing nothing

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,720
but Minecraft Minecraft on the brain. I've been doing nothing but sleeping eating bathroom and

30
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,880
Minecraft making server. So you know tragically, I tried to extend on Twitter. I put out a poll on

31
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,840
the PCP thing saying like, are you interested? I tried to make it as long as possible. It's going

32
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,960
to end like the day before this episode goes out. So it's not quite open. So people could hear it.

33
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,440
We could theoretically do another one, but I'd be very curious to hear people in the comments

34
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,400
if you're interested at all what you after that. Maybe I'll just literally do a second poll and be

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,400
like, Hey guys, what do you think? Yeah, like after this episode releases, we can make a poll

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,440
with the options we have discussed in this episode. Yeah, you know, why not? Literally why not? Let's,

37
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,480
we should do that. It's an ongoing discussion about what's the best plan. Because I mean,

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,880
yeah, go on. Go on. No, I'm just like, how people pay is like, I don't really mind. I'm sure they

39
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:11,520
think like, you know, okay, they care about like, not paying too much, obviously. I think

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,720
the simplest one is just have it part of the $5 tier. So you get bonus episodes, you also get

41
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:28,080
Minecraft. I just think, I just think that if we do that, we will probably end up making very

42
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,960
little money because probably most, most of the people that we are going to sign up are going to

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,760
be the people that already maybe have the $5 subscription. And the thing about that makes a

44
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,600
lot. Yeah, I agree. That's most of the people that there'd be some and like it probably would help

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,400
with like longer term people would stay pledged that. So it's a little hard to judge exactly how

46
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,040
that would affect things long term. Munchy for one thinks that's a good idea. But I think what

47
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
should be incorporated here is we'll get into some inside baseball because I find this stuff

48
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,080
fascinating. The semi-issue with that is like, for, Mage has been the one doing all the heavy

49
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,600
lifting. She's going to be the one running it if we, you know, get it off the ground and whatnot.

50
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,720
Until I lead the workers revolution. Of course. It's only fair that as someone doing a bunch of

51
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,640
work on it, Mage gets like some cut of the earnings from it. If we just lump it into the $5 tier,

52
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,760
I think it's only fair. I mean, really, no matter what we do, some amount of money that this thing's

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,200
earning really should go to Mage. So that means at a minimum, let's say we make it part of the $5

54
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,640
tier, we absolutely should carve out some amount of payment per month. Yeah, I mean, we should do

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,280
the same thing we do with you. Like you get like an ad, you get like an, a regular admin fee for

56
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,880
like administrating the, the, you know, the PayPal account or whatever and like doing all the, the

57
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,200
like fucking, all the charting money, all the charting stuff. We just, we'll do that. And like

58
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,160
how Tom gets the fee for doing the iTunes stuff. Right. But here's the thing about that. Because

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,680
like we were saying, if we make it part of the $5 tier, I don't particularly expect things to rise

60
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,400
that much. I'm sure we'd go up some. I think that's definitely true. But would that even be enough

61
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,880
to cover whatever potential fee that Mage is making for now doing the job? I mean, I don't know,

62
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,280
probably, but like that sounds like a pretty slim margin. I mean, it would, it would depend on,

63
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,640
it would just depend, I don't know. And, and think of like, it's going to take Mage up on time. Also,

64
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,640
how much does it cost to run the server? We're right now at $15 a month to, for it to be feasible.

65
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,320
Okay. So, so it'll be that plus whatever we pay Mage for it. So if, so we would need

66
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,920
seven more people to sign up for the $5 tier to cover that?

67
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,240
Uh, seven? Wouldn't it just be three? Oh, wait, you, right. You mean,

68
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,000
because I was sorry, I was assuming, I was assuming we were going to pay Mage like 20 a month to

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,920
administer the thing. I don't know if that's accurate or not. Whatever. I don't know. I mean,

70
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,080
I mean, something like that. But I don't, but think about like, here's the other thing about it.

71
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,720
What's my incentive? Let's just say, for example, let's say, or, I don't know, anyone who doesn't

72
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,840
play Minecraft that much who might want to do it. What's my incentive to spend time, dedicate time

73
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,600
to this community? If we don't already have like, like when you're on a PCP episode, you get a payment

74
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,280
for that episode. There's an incentive there. If you're on a heckles for shekels, there's donations.

75
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,760
There's an incentive to do that. What's the incentive to do this if we don't have like a

76
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,560
separate thing carved out? Well, I thought the idea was that we would be in, we would play in the

77
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,960
server on shekels for heckles. That does make sense. And I think we should and could like we

78
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,320
would stream ourselves playing in it. I could say that being kind of the way most of us play.

79
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,920
Yeah, like, yeah, I mean, that does make sense. I mean, I thought that was like the entire basis

80
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,080
for the idea in the first place was we should do heckles for shekels on our own server.

81
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,760
Yeah, that is a decent idea. I mean, I stand by. Okay, the only one that doesn't think that's how

82
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,200
we're going to do it. Well, I mean, look at mage is the one who expects to play a decent amount.

83
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,960
And I mean, like, there's, there's other things like managing the server regularly,

84
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,640
managing like the community, she'll have to whitelist people who join because, you know,

85
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,280
it's a private server and all that. I don't know, like working with the people on the game,

86
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,880
organizing private, like, I don't really know what it would entail. I guess it could just be

87
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,520
the heckles for shekels. And that's all that matters. But but just consider the alternative,

88
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,240
which is like, this is the idea that I currently think is the best one. Yes, there's downsides,

89
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,120
but it's still my favorite overall, which is a theoretical, totally separate Patreon,

90
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,360
because this is all new value being added. You know, we could say it's like the PCP one,

91
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,760
that's all fine, we could link to it in various places. And it's called like this is the PCP

92
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,280
Minecraft Patreon, it's just a separate thing. And you pledge $3 or whatever, and you get access

93
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,040
to the server. And you don't have to, you don't have to worry about it at all. If you don't want

94
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,680
to, all the costs now come out of the income from that. So nobody on the normal PCP loses any money.

95
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,200
And in order not to fuck over anybody who's pledging like $10, I saw that like Culek 64 or

96
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,920
whatever, whatever their name is. Pizza Chan. Yeah, Pizza Chan. They're like, Hey, I already pledged

97
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,320
$10. Like I want in like, I don't want to fuck over that guy or anybody pledging more. So we could

98
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,800
maybe just lump in for 10 or up people on the normal Patreon, they just get access to because

99
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,680
they're already, you know, doing good stuff. But like ideally, for everybody who wants a lower thing,

100
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,160
it's just a separate thing, which I think is clean. And I feel like that guarantees more. We already

101
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,920
have a $10 tier, right? Yeah. What do you get? What do you get at $10? What's the bonus? Literally

102
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:36,080
nothing extra. Okay, cool. Yeah. Yeah, just nice people who want to support. Why? I don't know. I

103
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,040
mean, let's let's examine the downsides of that. Why not make it the $10 tier? Like, because like

104
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,960
there's already the $5 tier to get to the bonus episode. So it's not like we're just, it's not

105
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,800
like we're just saying, Hey, $10 to get into the server, because that's not all you're getting for 10.

106
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,640
Right? Okay, okay. But then consider this, like there might be some people who aren't particularly

107
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
interested in the bonus episode, PCP in general, like on my side, at least there are a few people

108
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,440
that would like to play Minecraft with me, but they're not particularly into the PCP. So then

109
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,080
asking them to pay $10 a month just for the server is not fair. I don't think. Or I mean,

110
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,880
you're not, you're not wrong. You're not wrong. But I mean, it's a fifth question.

111
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,760
How many of those people are there? That is a reasonable question to ask. I think that the

112
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:29,920
people who would want to play in a PCP Minecraft server probably overlaps fairly heavily with people

113
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,240
who would want to listen to the bonus episodes. I agree. I agree. The question is how many people

114
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,880
don't fit in that is my biggest question because I don't know. I don't know. Well, I would imagine

115
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,520
it's in my mind. I mean, there might be people who maybe have not pledged the five dollars to

116
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,040
listen to it. Maybe like they would listen to the bonus episodes, but they don't feel like pledging

117
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,440
the five. And I mean, that's fair and all. Okay, just for those who are listening, me and Nate,

118
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,640
we're planning to make like, you know, if we're going to make a separate Patreon, the fee for the

119
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,920
Minecraft server a month, a month is just three dollars. That's how we were planning it. Yeah,

120
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,880
we like, we thought about some ideas. It seems like a three dollar pledge. So like, yeah, let's do

121
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,880
polls. We'll put some together. Are people with people? Okay, here's the other thing. We can ask

122
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,360
people what they think. And this is this is true of me. This is true of every person on the planet.

123
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,560
The consumer doesn't necessarily think in the same terms of like, what would work best for the

124
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,680
business? Yeah, you've got to be like, you know, I feel like making a second Patreon is really

125
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,600
multiplying entities beyond necessity, split kind of splitting people's attention between two things

126
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,080
in a way that I don't think is going to be optimal. I really don't like that. I already made a few

127
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,680
points. Like from a purely logical perspective, like in terms of like, perfect efficiency,

128
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,360
yeah, I think it makes the most sense. But in terms of like, how it'll actually work and how

129
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,880
like people will actually engage with it, I don't think that's the right way to do it.

130
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,120
Well, let's just examine one other possibility. Because you were saying make a $10 tier or

131
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,840
limited that that makes some sense. We were thinking, yeah, we were thinking even going lower for like

132
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:14,720
a $7 tier, theoretically, for doing that for and we actually said 750 or something. So if we did

133
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,000
that, that's actually you're paying less additional cost for that over. This is like the first

134
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,360
proposal that we do like a $7 thing or whatever. That's that was what I asked people in like the

135
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
Discord server. So you're you're still getting the bonus episodes and you're getting additional

136
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,000
value that technically is cheaper than what you'd be paying for like the $3 on a theoretical new

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,800
Patreon. But there's now the hurdle of this $750 mark, which is a psychologically sort of different

138
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,360
thing that could because when I asked people about this, again, this was fairly anecdotal. I only

139
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,280
asked a couple of people. By the way, I hope this is interesting to people. I find it legitimately

140
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,040
fascinating. I find it interesting. I was going to say that like,

141
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,520
inside baseball can be fun. But I feel like we're so inside this baseball that people can't really

142
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,400
relate. Okay, but listen, listen, like I was in a practice with Digi and Tom and then talking about

143
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,920
printing shirts for like half an hour, if not an hour. Some people really enjoy that others might

144
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,080
find out. Yeah, but I feel like Minecraft is slightly catching more people than shirt printing.

145
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,840
People like Digi quite a bit and they get caught up in his site. Not me. Actually,

146
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,080
that's not true. I felt I felt the warm and fuzzies yesterday. Did you did you made a pretty glowing

147
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,200
tweet about about my shit, which I don't want to I don't want to get on the subject of that

148
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,040
shit yet. We can talk about that after Minecraft. Sure, sure. I made a I made a warm tweet.

149
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,000
You also did. And I was very happy. So here, last thing I want to say because I'm

150
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,320
people when I when I propose like the I like talking. Okay, yeah, I enjoy this kind of inside

151
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,760
baseball. Like how much do we charge for stuff? How should we structure this? Because I think about

152
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,760
this kind of thing all the time. Right. Me too. I think about like, I stress about like, what is

153
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,880
what is a what what is a good and ethical and effective business model? I fucking sweat this

154
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,120
stuff. I find this not funny at all. Just purely fascinating. Yeah, the okay. But my last point just

155
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,080
I just for people's consideration for whatever they want to think of the like that $750 model or

156
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,280
whatever, a new tier, essentially, that's a Minecraft thing. Like when we propose that a lot

157
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,360
of people like in the patron server, I specifically when asked people what they thought, they were

158
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,320
like, ooh, it feels weird that we're paying more for a Minecraft thing than the bonus episodes.

159
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,760
It's like there's a weird incentive to like that, like you're saying it's valued more than the bonus

160
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,040
episodes. And like, ideally, if we were making a new patron from scratch, we might make this like

161
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,000
the $3 tier that currently doesn't exist. But the fact like we're trying to work with a model that

162
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,080
already exists. So, you know, there's not really much of a charge. We're not charging the more for

163
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,680
the PCP server than for the bonus that we're charging more for both put together, which just

164
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,760
seems like yeah, obviously. Yeah, exactly. But like people people feel and people say the thing.

165
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,680
I mean, not everybody does the thing. I don't want to shit on any of the commenters or anything.

166
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,920
But I mean, you know, obviously, they're going to be skewed in favor of, you know,

167
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,880
the consumer, right? They're going to want the greatest value for the consumer. And we,

168
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,720
owning the means of production and being petty bourgeois that we are, we want to extract the

169
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,720
most value from the proletariat, i.e. them, right? So, you know, the class struggle continues.

170
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,320
You know, there's another fascinating aspect to this that I think about that's

171
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,400
consider the perspective of those who are the most into this idea and who

172
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,200
likely will do the most work on it and stuff who would want to benefit from the most versus

173
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,840
someone like, I mean, just for example, Digi says, don't care, go for it guys, do whatever you want.

174
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,840
So like, I mean, frankly, Digi doesn't really deserve to benefit, particularly outside of the

175
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,320
outside of the reality. If I think it's fair that if this is a PCP branded Minecraft thing,

176
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,280
I don't think it's crazy for some of that income to go toward like the overall PCP earnings.

177
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,000
It's it's like part of the network or whatever. And I think it gets some benefit from that.

178
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,920
Some. Yeah. Some. Yeah. I mean, I put a pay a model out to like the guys in the Collier that I won't

179
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,480
go into now. But it's like, if it's if it's obviously made, just the main one, she's doing

180
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,200
the hard work, I plan on playing too. If those guys are like developing a community,

181
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,680
they're playing with people there, I don't know, organizing games, they're doing fun things.

182
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,560
They're the one like driving the incentive to play the game. That is a very different thing

183
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,240
from someone like, I mean, Digi or maybe Munchie or other people who are too busy,

184
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,560
not that interested or whatever, who are suggesting things like attaching it to the $5 one,

185
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,200
as opposed to making it like a $7 50 or a separate Patreon, because those guys,

186
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,600
they just want to not have to change anything, which I totally get. And they just want additional

187
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,120
value being provided to what's already there because they benefit from that. Whereas like we

188
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,320
want a separate thing where we can, you know, have the profits there in a place where those who

189
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,360
are working on it can receive that share, you know, being sent to them in a clean way. No,

190
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,520
it would be in a separate when you say it like that. Yeah. Suddenly, I'm suddenly I'm thinking

191
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,320
that maybe the the separate model makes sense from a from a business from a business perspective

192
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,640
in some ways, in some ways, kind of. Okay, I'm a little I'm coming around a little bit.

193
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,600
I mean, maybe for fun, we'll put out that poll. I'm coming around a little bit. It's just that I

194
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:47,120
feel like the numbers like I like I feel like it's not going to get I don't know. I mean, it depends.

195
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,720
I think that maybe a Patreon is not the right way to do it. And maybe there could just maybe

196
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,400
there's just a subscription service like that. I mean, I would do a subscription. There are like

197
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,280
PayPal, you can do like a monthly PayPal subscription. It's just that Patreon makes it really easy to

198
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,920
manage all that, which is kind of what it's for. But like I did the calculations. If they're doing

199
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,960
a if we're doing a $3 pledges, we lose about 9% off like that's basically what we're paying them.

200
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,240
9% is not a huge amount. Wait, they're paid through Patreon. Yeah, if we use Patreon,

201
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,440
because that's the way they break it up. Yeah. Patreon sucks. So like theoretically,

202
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,200
if we made it to our current Patreon, and we just made it like instead of $5,

203
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,840
now you pledged 750 or whatever, like now that additional loss is lessened.

204
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,160
So no, it's still it's still it's still 9% off of whatever additional money is made. There's a

205
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,440
couple reasons why that's not true. But the biggest one is because our PCP was our piece of Patreon

206
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,400
was made before the rates changed. So it's getting grandfathered in to the lower rates that are like

207
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:00,560
5% or something. Really? Yeah, that's true. That's true. Secret. Really? It's really true, you guys.

208
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,720
I am shocked. So that's something. That's something. But I mean, if at the end of the day,

209
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,360
if we can't agree, I think it's kind of funny, we all agree more or less that this would be a

210
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,560
benefit. There's there's some disagreement about what's the optimal way to do it. And those

211
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,920
disagreements could lead to an impasse. If that theoretically happened, me and Major just gonna

212
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,400
make it on our own as a separate Patreon, and then we'll make it like effectively the same thing

213
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:35,040
anyway. And you know, we'll as a person who like delves in and out of like caring about Minecraft,

214
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm sure I'll play for a bit and then stop for months and months and months. So I'm probably

215
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:46,800
not gonna be like making a community there. Well, okay, I mean, for me, like I like playing it on

216
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,400
Shekels for Heckels. I'm not I'm not just gonna be playing it by myself. I'm gonna be playing it when

217
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,120
you guys are playing and probably when we stream it. That's that's what I'm interested in doing.

218
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,480
I do like that. And that's my primary goal too. Definitely. Definitely. So, you know, it's on

219
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,000
experiments. And it'd be nice if we could figure out just some model to try. And then like if it

220
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,880
works, great. You viewer can make a name for yourself. You can be a star. You can be in the

221
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,960
streams, right? You can be on our screens in front of the like 100 people. Just imagine the vision,

222
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,920
Ben. Imagine you open your capitalist heart and just imagine the vision. We're playing Shekels

223
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,280
for Heckels. We're playing it right now. Let's say in this particular model, it's a separate

224
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,680
Patreon or whatever. We're like, Hey, guys, we're having so much fun. We're doing our like weekly,

225
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,280
bi-weekly, monthly stream or whatever. We've got this community going. You could join us right now

226
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,920
and literally be on the stream. If only you cough up those sweet three dollars. You could be griefing

227
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,840
us right now. Only for and three dollars is a is a is a ledge. I think most people are willing to

228
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,400
hop. Honestly, that's a real sweet spot. You know, I kind of think three dollars is I kind of think

229
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,600
that's low ball on it. Yeah, some people said three to five and said like I think I think five is

230
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:11,520
fair. Um, maybe I don't know. Okay, at the at the risk of sounding egotism, right? I know we're,

231
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,680
you know, we're not like, we're not fucking, I don't know, we're not gonna fucking. We're not,

232
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,680
we're not the Yogs cast or we're not like a big like fucking network. We're not, we know, we're

233
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,680
just the PCP, right? We're not some grow though. But yeah, but what I'm saying is so I know it's

234
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,560
not like, Oh, you need to play with the prestigious members of the procrastiners podcast. That's

235
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,800
the value of at least five dollars. But at the same time, I mean, how much would the entry into

236
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,040
like any old fucking, like private server costs? I don't know. I mean, yeah, you'd have to run your

237
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,840
own. I feel like three is like so little. And like, I feel like for what it is, you get a considerable

238
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,960
amount of value. I don't know. I mean, that's not unsure. And we're talking five dollars a month.

239
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,680
This is a pretty cheap, you know, that's not a huge expenditure. And I feel like most people who

240
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,600
would be willing to part with three dollars would probably be willing to part with five,

241
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,600
like, like how much difference does that $2 make? Because when we did the first poll, I said like

242
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,800
$7 on the Patreon for it. And people were like, that seems like too much. But but really like

243
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,080
psychologically, if you just make a separate payment of $5, a lot of people will think that's

244
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,200
less, even though theoretically, there might be paying more for less value than that $7 pledge

245
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,680
if they patronize the bonus episode. I mean, I kind of think rolling it into the $10 tier makes sense.

246
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,680
I mean, I get the idea. Like for business reasons, I really like the idea of like a clean,

247
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,960
separate way to manage how much money is coming for that specifically. But yeah, I mean, I mean,

248
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,160
theoretically, the idea of doing both so that, well, what appeals to me about that is just that

249
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,320
it makes it really clear on our end, like what value is being added by this particular aspect

250
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,480
versus everything else. What I want is I desperately want the ability for people to be able to choose.

251
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,200
If they want both $10 on our Patreon, if they just care about Minecraft or whatever,

252
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
just five dollars somewhere separately, they don't have to fuck around with both.

253
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,560
That would be a pretty swell deal. Wait a minute, brain blast. Is it possible to have two alternate

254
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,440
$5 tiers? Okay, that sounds like we're getting crazy.

255
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,080
I had that brain blast and everyone said it was stupid.

256
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,640
I don't think you can do that on Patreon, but I don't know.

257
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
Well, you can have a five dollar and one cent.

258
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,600
It's just that like practically speaking, if you're pledging five dollars for one,

259
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,080
I think you can go in and like change what your pledge thing is at some point. And we all know

260
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,600
axing the bonus episodes is not as hard as we would like if you're heavily motivated to do so,

261
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,120
especially if you're pledging that already. No, that's plain to lose. That's plain to lose.

262
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,440
We can't acknowledge that. Fair. Edit that. Edit that.

263
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,760
Oblivionfall edit. Oh, wait, shit. Oblivionfall is dead.

264
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,560
Oh, by the way, were people confused, Oblivionfall has retired in good spirits and it's all the same?

265
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,320
I think we just haven't said it out loud. We haven't literally went into it last episode.

266
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,280
Was it because the school year started? No, no, no, no.

267
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,560
It was super busy the whole time with other work. He has an animation work thing.

268
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,520
Yeah. Okay, apparently he was putting in like 16 hours of work on each episode,

269
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,840
which is like so much more than any of us ever did.

270
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,320
I'm curious, Ben, on your edits. Yeah, I'm really embarrassed for you, Oblivion,

271
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,280
that really sucks to be here. No, that's not what I meant. I meant for us.

272
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,400
When you were doing your like edits with like the art stuff, like how many hours would you say that

273
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,560
was? Okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh, like on the ones with the moving mouths?

274
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:40,480
Yeah, yeah. Okay, that did, well, okay. Yeah, that did take a lot of time, but I think that was

275
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,360
mostly just hassle. It wasn't that I was like doing like 16 hours of solid like creative work,

276
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,880
generating that. I was spending like, there would, it would be a days long process of like

277
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,200
getting it to render, like having something fail during the render, like having to try it again,

278
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,480
like, you know, waiting for processing to finish and stuff like dealing with errors,

279
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,680
having to redo stuff. Okay, so yeah, on those, I probably did put in like maybe

280
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,360
a similar amount of time, but not, but just because of like fucking

281
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,600
faulty hardware and not knowing what the fuck I was doing with like- Which I presume Oblivion

282
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,840
did not have the issues. Adobe Premiere and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, well fair enough,

283
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,560
God, I'm gonna fucking miss him, but we're gonna get an editor. At some point, Oblivion, I love

284
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:29,360
you, you two make work. He was so good. Nah, nah, he's so good. He gay. Yeah, that's fair.

285
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Well, whatever, I don't know. We'll put out some polls in the description, vote on Minecraft

286
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,600
things. I don't know if we do them. We'll figure something out. Don't worry, have no fear, have

287
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,160
no fear. And just voice off if you're interested in general, because I want to know, I want to know

288
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,680
how many people are into it. Anything else to say on the subject? I'm, I'm spent. I'm excited for

289
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,440
the glorious future of Bufalantopia. Indeed. Indeed. Well, we might need to make a new,

290
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,280
a new land with, I mean, are there going to be Bufalants in our new location or wherever

291
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,240
that happens to be? I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to find out. All right, we can, we can

292
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,480
send our old Bufalant to the glue factory and get some new ones. Indeed. Indeed. Oh, the new one

293
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:21,360
will be called Bufalantopia. Bufalantopia. I love Bufalantopia. I do too. It's just, it organically

294
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,040
grew. The people there are helpful and cool. I was like, next stream, we got to burn it all down.

295
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,280
I had such, I had such, I had such, I was filled with such pride. I was filled with pride as I,

296
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,840
as I was getting up there on the scaffold and making the sign, I was like, yes, this is going to be

297
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,360
the start, the mark of a new civilization. People from miles around will see the Bufalantopia sign

298
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,760
lit up in the night sky and say, huh, I wonder what the fuck is going on over there. When we,

299
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,480
whenever this happens and we migrate to our new server, we should burn the whole place down.

300
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,360
Oh, absolutely. With our Bufalant, trap our Bufalant inside. They have to, they have to go down with

301
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,920
the ship. That's, it's the right thing to do. Okay, let's move on. What else is going on in your

302
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:10,800
lives, everybody? Um, well, I got my, oh yeah, talk about your stuff. Oh wait, Ben was going to fight

303
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,480
me about Minecraft something. Oh, I kind of already, well, yeah, I just, well, you know, you're going

304
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,280
to be the motto and whatever, right? Cause you're, you're creating the thing and I just, that's fine

305
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,400
for now, but like once that's all established, um, you know, it's not going to be acceptable

306
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,360
anymore for you to own the means of production. Um, we're going to have to have mutual ownership. So

307
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,560
we are going to fucking, uh, we are going to fucking workers revolution.

308
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,440
Could we get a mod to, uh, to create guillotines in Minecraft? That's gotta be in there somewhere,

309
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,720
right? Yeah. And then when he crafts that soon, he himself will be on the gallows as,

310
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,760
you know, the new guy in charge. This is what happened to what's his face?

311
00:27:53,920 --> 00:28:00,080
That's to happen to all of us eventually. Uh, Ben, talk about vapors. Yes. The Vapors 2 kick

312
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,440
starter is going right now. And that's what I was talking about before. Digi and Nate and,

313
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,920
and hippo. And I think everyone, everyone's retweeting my shit and making nice tweets saying

314
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:16,720
it's a great value, which it is incredible value on offer at kickstarter.com slash project slash

315
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,520
Ben St slash vapors to, um, Lincoln, the doobly dude in the down there part. Um,

316
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,280
it's, it's going good. It's surpassed. It's we're on the third day and we're past, uh,

317
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:36,080
4,000 or $4,100 right now, which is, it's pretty good. Yeah. It's out. It's outpacing the last

318
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:43,360
year. The initial target was $2,586. So you win. You already I did. I passed it like

319
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,200
early into the second day. Um, yeah. And the stretch goal, uh, was 4,000. So you already

320
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,240
got that as well. Yeah. The stretch, the stretch goal was to pay for, um, the extra pages and

321
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
paying all the guest artists, which are, I will list them off right now. The people doing guest

322
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,120
art for the vapor arts are hypocrite, munchy wears tiny hats. Who's that? I don't know.

323
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:11,520
Nobody. Munchy wears tiny hats. Um, uh, nexus mania, cheesy manfredo, jade morrow,

324
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,640
and I'm forgetting someone. Who am I forgetting? You're forgetting fucking, uh,

325
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,480
God damn it. Cassey. Cassey. That's right. That's right. Yes. Yes. Cassey snap. Um, it's going to

326
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:28,000
be fucking cool. More like Cassey snapper fucking neck when she does it. I realized that chapter

327
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,480
two is actually a lot shorter than, um, chapter one, but I still wanted to make it its own book.

328
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,960
So I thought I would just write a whole bunch of scripts and, and like pay a bunch of, um,

329
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,600
good artists who like, you know, make like more, because like the first one had a couple of,

330
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,200
it had maybe like, actually it had, it probably had almost, it's probably like 16, 17 pages of

331
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,360
bonus content because munchies was like 11 pages long. This one, I kind of was expecting maybe

332
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,280
each vaporette to be like three to five to maybe seven tops. So six of those might be, might, there

333
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,400
might be like 20 or 30 bonus pages in there that are not on the internet. They're not even made

334
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,800
yet. No one will have seen them. Um, but I wanted to fill it out. I want to fill that page count

335
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,320
out. So it's not like half the size of the first one, you know, you know, I want that consumer

336
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,720
advocacy is what I'm doing. I, Ben, you know, you know, I hate you and you know, I don't respect

337
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,560
you, but I think if I can, okay, I've, there's no, I have to have this infinite jest pin to go with

338
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,720
my poobop. There's no, there's no question. So I think, God, I don't know. I, I'm looking at the,

339
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,720
at these amazing reward tiers with these incredible benefits. I think I have to go

340
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,000
tell me about it for the $150 tier. Maybe Michelle wants to split it because I mean,

341
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,880
I have to have a pin. I know Michelle's going to want to pin two and we get three pins from that.

342
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,120
And then I have some spare poobas. If I lose them someday, I want to have that. So maybe me

343
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,440
and Michelle can split the $150 one and you'll have a books, you know, the hundred, the $150

344
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,160
one is like, it's pretty, it's pretty good. It's pretty, it's a pretty good value. What do you

345
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,680
get? Like, you get like a sign. You get the signed copy, which I'll like, you know, I'll do a drawing

346
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,840
for you in there. Just write you a message and stuff. It's personalized. And then you get three

347
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,720
copies of vapor one, three copies of vapor two, three poobop pins, three infinite jest pins. That's

348
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,640
it's epic. And so I don't know. I'm thinking about, so yeah, we passed the the reward tier

349
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,880
that's or the stretch goal for how to afford, you know, the guest art and stuff, paying for the

350
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,040
extra page. By the way, that's not just, it's not a flat amount. I'm going to give, I'm going to give

351
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,920
the, all the guest artists are going to get like, they're going to get like a cut of each copy of

352
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:45,280
vapors. I decided that like 50 cents per issue of vapors to per person with the six, so that means

353
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,880
$3 total, but like 50 cents to each guest artist per copy of it was to last time there was like a

354
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,920
little over 200. So that would, if we do the same numbers, that would be like $100 to each of them.

355
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,640
But if we go higher than that, it'll be more. That's the plan. Also, I want to say, everyone's,

356
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,560
everyone agreed to do it for free. And then I was like, actually, I want to pay you.

357
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,720
That's the right thing to do. So here's, because I don't want to be a real doctor.

358
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,480
I don't want to be a doctor. I'm looking forward to seeing the script. I haven't seen it yet.

359
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,560
Okay. I have like four of them done. I gave one, one to-

360
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Did you write them with people in mind, Ben, thinking of their particular artistic senses or-

361
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:30,320
Kind of a little bit. Not exactly. But I did kind of think like, oh, what would be a good one for

362
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,920
like so and so. So I did write one that I thought Cheezy would be the most suited for. So I gave,

363
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,000
I gave him that. But all the other ones, all the other ones, I just, I'm just going to let people

364
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,640
choose. And I, but there's like two of them that I keep like thinking, like, should I rewrite that?

365
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,920
Should I rewrite that? And I don't know. So just, I got to do that. And then I can be like, here,

366
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,520
pick, pick, pick, pick. Are you a Tarantino with these? Do you accept creative changes if they

367
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,320
think that something would be better in- To an extent, I probably would, yeah.

368
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,920
The drawings are going to be like creative changes just inherently.

369
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,760
I mean, Munchies was in high school and it was not supposed to be right. So there was a change

370
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,080
right there. That's fine though. That's fine. That was good. That was good stuff. I like that lore

371
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,520
expansion. Um, yeah, no, whatever. I want everyone to get, get creative like that one video. I'm

372
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,440
just curious, like the, yes, like, like those guys, uh, have you in any way incorporated things that

373
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,480
people have produced in the, um, in the vaporettes? Like, like, I'm thinking of like the background

374
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,440
characters that like Munchie put into some of them. Have those in any way become canon or you want

375
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,920
to do more with? I'm just curious if the lore is expanded due to the vaporettes in any meaningful

376
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:48,160
way or a small way. I don't know. Uh, that's a very specific question and the answer is no.

377
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,200
Okay, great. But then, but the new vaporettes do expand the lore. Hey, you want to know,

378
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,960
you want to know something? You want to know something you'll learn about in the vaporettes

379
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:07,040
to this, to this in this issue? Yes. Magda and Vincent's parents. Oh no. Oh my god. Silver

380
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,880
screen. Silver tongue. Silver platter. I can't wait to meet all the siblings. It's going to be great.

381
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,120
Exactly. Exactly. Wait, what's the other one? There was another one. Silver lining.

382
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,800
Oh yeah. Silver line is the good. Oh yeah. Silver spoon is the other one. Yeah, yeah. That's the

383
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,760
family. Wait, no, silver. Yeah, yeah. Silver. Silver screen. Silver tongue. Yeah, tongue was the dad.

384
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,120
Yeah. That's right. That's right. By the way, for anyone who doesn't know, these are our fan

385
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,800
characters of the extended family of Silver spoon. Literally the greatest OCs in the game. They were.

386
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,920
Silver lining. So good. Silver lining and the Silver family. He deserves his own comic series.

387
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,840
I absolutely love those. I'm so fucking proud of these. I'm so fucking proud of these. Silver

388
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,560
lining. Like they're all evil. Silver tongue. Back up. Back up. So we start with Silver spoon,

389
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:58,160
the character, of course, for my little pony. She's the bully. She's like the lackey to Diamond

390
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,920
Tiara. Clearly a rich kid with a Silver spoon, obviously. Yeah. Her whole family's evil. Her

391
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,800
dad is like a slick lawyer named Silver tongue. Her mom is like an old screen actress or something,

392
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,280
a retired actress named Silver screen. Her brother is a spoiled snotty little bastard named Silver

393
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,840
platter, but she's got one good brother, the one good egg in the bunch, who's called Silver

394
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:30,240
lining, who always sees the bright side. Incredible. It's so good. He is the Silver lining of the

395
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,760
family. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's great. Oh, that's true. Damn. That's deep lore. And also horse fister.

396
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,360
Who could forget horse fister? And his cutie mark is a cloud, but there's just a little bit of sun

397
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:48,000
poking out the behind it. I know. It's beautiful. I'm a genius. Max revive T-Bap immediately.

398
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,760
As you can see in the famous video, thank you, KP. Check it out now on tbap.com. Or whatever.

399
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,320
I need to, so I've been spamming, so I've been spamming Magi Chan Sonichu on Twitter,

400
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,000
trying to get him to retweet the vapor's link. I think he's my best shot at an endorsement.

401
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,680
I'm just, I don't know. I need, I want to. Oh, you should have got him while he was possessing

402
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,600
Chris's body and that would have been easier to retweet, right? Well, well, he's, no, he's,

403
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,040
he's in, in the real world physically now. Didn't that, oh, oh, that's right. Yeah. He's, he, he,

404
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,400
he, like, just yesterday, he made the full physical transition to dimension 12, 18. Finally.

405
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,480
I know. And he says in his tweets, like, if you see that, if you see like a weird purple

406
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,120
somewhere, that's me. Like, that's, I'm watching you. That could be made just,

407
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,360
just a weird purple, like anything.

408
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,160
Um, I, okay. Okay. You know what I'm going to do? I had this idea. And I don't know when I'll do

409
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,000
this, but I am going to do this as a, as a, oh wait, sorry, I want to talk about stretch goals.

410
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,960
Last time for the stretch goals, one of the stretch goals was the card stock cover. I was

411
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,080
looking at the copies and the card stock cover, I don't know if I can really, I don't know how

412
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,000
much of a difference it makes. So what I did was I ordered two more test copies of Vapors II

413
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,760
with different covers, the glossy covers, just to see if they're better or worse. So I'm just going

414
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,440
to, I don't know, I'm not sure if I'm going to do that stretch goal or not, because I want to

415
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,440
compare the other options and see if it's actually worth like the extra cost. But what I am going

416
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,600
to do is one of my stretch goals, I'm going to implement communism. Okay. I'm going to make

417
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,040
communism real. What does that mean? What does that mean? You ask at whatever, at whatever

418
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,720
level I decide to do it. It's going to be, if we hit this goal, I'm going to redistribute the wealth

419
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,240
and everyone who play, everyone who's getting a package of any kind, I'm just going to give you

420
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,880
a dollar. I'm just going to put a fucking dollar bill in your envelope. It's like yang, but a

421
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,480
slightly more modest. It's like yang, but better because you get it in a cool black envelope.

422
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,760
I do want that envelope. You know, you know what it's like, it's like, you know, from each

423
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,320
according to their ability to each according to their need. Everyone's ability is to buy whatever

424
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,280
shit they can afford on my Vapors to Kickstart it. And what do they need? They all need the dollar,

425
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,680
dollar, dollar, that's what they need. And that's what they're all going to get.

426
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,400
What about people who are pledging with currencies from outside the US?

427
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,960
They will receive a one United States dollar. Okay, I'll put it on my wall. Epic.

428
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,800
And I'll probably write like burning on it or something.

429
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,960
Yeah, if you sign the dollar, then I'll keep it. Yeah, I probably will.

430
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Maybe. Or maybe maybe you just want to spend it. Maybe you just want to treat it as a rebate. I

431
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,400
don't know how to spend American money. The first one, I was tempted to get it because I always

432
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,440
did want a copy of this. I think that because you just gave me a pin, because that was nice of you

433
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,840
and you just had extras and I wanted one, I probably would have pledged it wasn't for that,

434
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,160
but I'll definitely pledge it. God damn it. I know, I know. Don't do that again. In fact,

435
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,400
if you could just like send me an infinite jest pin. In fact, okay, so what you're saying, Nate,

436
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,880
is that I should never do you any favors ever again. I mean, it disincentivizes me to use money

437
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,280
to achieve those same goals. Absolutely. Yeah. This is why capitalism doesn't work, but go on.

438
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,440
This is just worth the value, I think. I want the books. I want the thing. If I get them for

439
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,840
free, great. This is my personal life. I have to pay for them, then I will, then I will.

440
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:30,480
Dab, dab, dab. Cool. Cool, cool. I was thinking, you know what I could do as like another, maybe

441
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,760
if the thing goes really well, like maybe if we went like really high, like I don't know, like

442
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,760
$10,000 or something. Yeah. What I could maybe do, and like this is possible, I could do basically

443
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,040
the communism thing, but instead of with money, I could just make another pin and just everyone

444
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,560
gets an extra pin. I want those damn pins. I was thinking maybe like the Saint Heart pin,

445
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,600
which I've had, I've been kind of meaning to make for a while, and it would just, it would be like,

446
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,920
it would be a black pin with a silver border, but like the white heart logo with like the rays

447
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,520
coming out of it, it would just be that in silver. That would be, I could make that, and like if,

448
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,760
I mean, if we hit a tier like that, it would not be out of the realm. It would not be unaffordable

449
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,640
for me to just like make a run of like 200 or however many, and just everyone gets one for free.

450
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,160
Yo, that would be great. And sick undertale reference, dude, like totally. Sick undertale

451
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,960
reference. I just, I just, I just think that would look really cool in silver. I, I want to,

452
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,880
I don't know. I was thinking of making those pins, but then I was like, when would I, when would I

453
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,400
ever sell them? I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe now's the time. What am I waiting for? The thing,

454
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,800
the thing, like it does sound really cool. The thing that annoys me about pins though is I don't

455
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,680
have like things I can put them on and that I could like, you need like a rucksack and I don't

456
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,840
really have a rucksack for that. I've said this before. Actually, they're not there right. I think

457
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,400
I put them on the floor just now, but right next to my desk, I have my printer on my printer. I keep

458
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,800
my Radcon three pin and my Puba pin and they're always pointed at me and I get so much joy just

459
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,600
looking over at those because they really are tangible, little physical. It's the same reason

460
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,680
people buy like trinkets probably when they go on vacation, but these are so much more because

461
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,640
these are like, this is what me and my friends have accomplished. These little physical things

462
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,400
remind me that like, when you really put your effort into something, when you really try,

463
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,640
you can do great things and this is just a little reminder and those give me

464
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,840
a disproportionate amount of pleasure. You know, I think my name's Marie Kondo,

465
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,440
that lady who wrote the book about wanting to be clean and wanting everything to be nice and tidy.

466
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,280
The simple joy of tidying up, whatever that is, she says. You never read it, obviously.

467
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,680
Okay, people will know what I'm talking about. She's the cute little Japanese lady who loves tidying

468
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,120
up and Michelle's been reading her books and looking into her stuff and she's been getting me

469
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,080
into it too and Marie Kondo or whatever her name is, if I'm fucking it up, my bad, she says,

470
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,840
like, what's the point in owning things if they don't, this is the quote,

471
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:58,000
it's everything you own should spark joy. If you own things that don't spark joy,

472
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,480
literally why do you own them? Throw them in the trash. Those pins and in fact, I have my little

473
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,640
slime core pins that I made sitting next to me too from BronyCon and stuff. They spark so much

474
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,240
joy in me. Just to look over at them. Mine disintegrated. You know, mine are breaking down,

475
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,080
but they still are alive. Mine is pretty fucked up, but it's hanging in there. There you go.

476
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:25,200
I would love metal pins of those one day. At some point, no, at some point, we are going to do,

477
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,400
it might be its own thing or it might be as part of another campaign, but we are going to do a

478
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,760
RFCK pin kickstand. We're going to have a cop killer pin. We're going to have a rowdy fucking

479
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,880
pin. We're going to have a slime core pin. We're going to have a podre... Excellent.

480
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,360
Have you seen the podren pin that I designed?

481
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,320
No. Does it look like a Max Revive? No, no, it looks like... It's cool looking.

482
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,040
I spent a lot of time... Look at the show notes or something, so we are in the description.

483
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,360
All right, yeah, I can find it in a minute, but like, we're going to do, here's the thing,

484
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:59,360
and like, this is not insurmountable, right? We can get, but for some reason, and it's not just

485
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,520
enamel pin factory. It seems like every company is like this. Companies have such a hard time

486
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,160
printing green. Like, green is like just, yeah, so like, I mean, it's not, it doesn't...

487
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,840
That's rough for slippers, all the slimes. We could still do it, but like,

488
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,920
the options are limited. Like, they don't, they don't have like a really like bright neon green,

489
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,880
like I would really like to see. They just, like, just, they just don't come, like so many companies,

490
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,200
they just don't have that, which is really a shame, because that's like the most important one.

491
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,360
Yeah, yeah, there can, and there are, these are pins that exist in the universe already,

492
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,200
and of course, people want them, especially me, who's the prime example.

493
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,360
That's true, that's true. I don't know, but whatever, I worked around it. I managed to make

494
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,360
some pin design, like the podron pin, I managed to make it look good in spite of that.

495
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,320
Excellent. Anyway, but yeah, that's it, that's the thing. Okay, sorry, I'm trying to find it right

496
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,600
now. Yeah, no, no, no rush, no rush. Well, so that's, so that's what's up, that's what's up with that.

497
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,880
Dope, 28 days to go. 28, 23 from when you're hearing this, I think.

498
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,440
We, 101 backers right now. If we could, if we could, if we could quintuple that,

499
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:22,960
but between, between when, between when you hear this and, and next week, right? Go, go, go for

500
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:30,000
between, from when you hear this to when the next, for one week from today, listeners, 200, or bust.

501
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,640
Let's make communism real, everybody. Seems doable, and it's had a great success record in the past.

502
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:47,040
I'm looking forward to it. Debunked. All right. Well, lads, okay, what's next? What else we got?

503
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,160
I, well, I have been feeling very musical lately. I have been, I've been deep into

504
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:05,760
jazz fusion and, and cool, cool bands online. And I'm just going to link, I'm going to put this

505
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:14,320
here. Snarky Puppy is a, is a great, is a great band I've, I've heard. I don't really have much

506
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,480
to say. I just, I just love instrumentation. I just love musicians who are good with instruments,

507
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:27,040
and I, and I hate lyrics, lyrics bad. Instruments really funny. You know, and my favorite thing.

508
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,200
Most people know you as the dad rock guy when it comes to music. I mean, at least I do. I don't

509
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,440
know how, how pervasive that is. There's the podium. Oh, there's the podium. It's pretty neat,

510
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,880
huh? It's pretty neat. Yeah. But it was funny. I mean, my main exposure to jazz, I've listened

511
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,920
to some, my dad listened to smooth jazz, whatever, but like watching, watching whiplash is just very

512
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,800
funny. Watching these jazz musicians just roast. They're like, um, yeah, you could be a real musician

513
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,720
or you could go be in a rock band, lol. I mean, okay, I guess you could call that music. And I mean,

514
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,600
it's true. Now that's what I call music. I mean, it's not even, it's not even that like rock music

515
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:09,920
is worse. Like, um, it's just that a lot of the point of all this jazz stuff is that musicians

516
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,320
being like, so into like, all the cool things you can possibly do with an instrument and then

517
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,600
grooving and jiving and jibbing and jabbing. Yeah. And, uh, it's all about the groove. It's all about

518
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:28,000
the, the, the sort of like sweet solo that makes your face scrunch up like you bit into a lemon.

519
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,400
And it's just sort of like, oh yeah. Ooh, like crazy sort of stuff. Um, and rock is more about,

520
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,400
well, I mean, it's very like, like rock is a huge genre of spanning so many things, but like

521
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:49,760
a lot of music that has lyrics and is like less music like instrumenty. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's still

522
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:57,040
like good. It's just, there's a certain level of like bliss and like euphoria you get from hearing

523
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,120
a, like a brilliant musician at nay, a huge band of brilliant musicians all performing incredibly

524
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,360
well together. And it's just so tight. You just can't get that feeling anywhere else. This should

525
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:13,280
tell you, uh, evidence that like even I can play some guitar and I, I pluck my six string every

526
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,640
once in a while. But like when the idea comes up of like just jamming, no, no, no, I've memorized

527
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:24,640
my songs. I've memorized the specific chords. Do not ask me to go outside or to improvise.

528
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:31,360
Can't do it. We'll cry. Yes. I've really, I mean, here's another song, Wolfpick, really great band,

529
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:37,840
very funny, very funny guys. Yeah. Um, they do a lot of funky stuff. This Dean town is very popular

530
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,640
and the bass line to this is like overly complex and I'm not like a really good. Is it as good as

531
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,280
Monsters Inc opening bass line though? Oh, you know, that, that's a pretty good one. I kind of like

532
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,840
that one as well. I'll learn that one too. Um, but, uh, if you listen to this, like the bass line is

533
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:00,480
like 18 bars long or something, like the, before it loops, it's just really complex and I've, I've

534
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,880
really enjoyed the past few days just learning it, um, and trying to, to, to match the speed at

535
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:14,080
which the Joe Dart, the bassist plays it because he's really good. And, um, I'm so wrapped up in

536
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:19,360
like getting that right that like, I can't, I'm not like a jam musician. I know a bit. I know a

537
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:25,840
few chords. I know some scales, but I don't, I couldn't probably do much more than like a very

538
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:35,360
simple like rock solo in E. Um, just like, just go up there like, and then go back to normal chords

539
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,720
because I'm, it's, it's, it's a world that I can't possibly reach at the moment with the amount of

540
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,600
practice I put in, but I appreciate it so much knowing how much more practice I would need to do

541
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:52,400
to get there. It's just so fucking good. You know, I saw an interview once with, um, what's the guy,

542
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,600
the drummer from Nirvana who, who started Foo Fighters, um, Dave Grohl. Dave Grohl, yes. I saw

543
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,840
an interview with him and Kyle Gass of Tenacious D, you know, Jack Black's buddy. And he was, um,

544
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,040
like, there was, it was like the most eye-opening experience I had about like the levels of

545
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,760
musician because obviously Dave Grohl, seasoned veteran, he, he's a, he's a true pro, but he,

546
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,560
he does like big, you know, rock and stuff. And then Kyle Gass, total hack, total amateur.

547
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,720
He's like a, he's like a professionally, classically trained guitarist, I think, who then

548
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,960
went on to do, yeah. But, um, he, he like, allegedly, he was the one who, what was, I think,

549
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,320
him and Jack Black, when they met, Jack Black taught Kyle Gass, quote, how to act. Kyle taught Jack,

550
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,400
quote, how to play guitar or like something like that. And they, they were formed that thing.

551
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,000
In this interview, though, it was, um, Dave Grohl, I'll see if I can find it because it's

552
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,520
popular. It's a well-known one. Like Dave Grohl's just breaking down. He's like, yeah, like I,

553
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,800
I only write hits. This is what I do. I only write hits because like I just understand what my

554
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,680
audience wants. They want, uh, and he's like, he's just like most white people, they dance to the

555
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,160
lyrics. Like this is, and this is my, like this is what people sell. They dance to the lyrics. What

556
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,160
does that mean? White people dance to the lyrics. And this is the main market. What does that mean?

557
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,600
He's saying that like they don't, like the demographic that most, that consume his music,

558
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:17,120
they are looking for like catchy, repetitive lyrics that they can get into because this group

559
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:22,400
does not like vibe with the music the way like, I don't know, probably incongruous to like black

560
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,040
communities or whatever, get into like deep jam, jazzy shit. I don't know, this is the point he was

561
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:33,440
making. That is so weird. But think about it though. But I kind of get it, but that is such a strange

562
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,200
thought. When he framed it that way, I found that an extremely eye-opening quote. And I was like, I

563
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,680
mean, thinking about like, what, what do I like? I don't know. I went to a concert of fucking, um,

564
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,600
Incubus way back in the day and they're playing like Anna Molly. That song is like

565
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,600
fucking brain blast or heart hitting. It's what I mosh and got punched in the face

566
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,360
while I was dancing to that song. And like, yeah, I mean, I love the rock souls and stuff,

567
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,640
but I definitely see the point he was making. So, so all this is to say, like different people

568
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,800
have different appreciations for like what layers of music and rock songs are like repetitive,

569
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,960
on purpose. They're designed to be that way. So they're kind of like addictive and you want that

570
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,880
big, that big coom, which is a different appreciation from like appreciating a really

571
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,680
well put together like solo that's just instrumental. And I don't know. I mean,

572
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:30,320
a lot of rock songs have that like the different like the non repetitive and the intricate solo

573
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:36,960
stuff. Like it's not, it's not like rock can be defined as like one thing. I mean, like prog rock

574
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,440
is getting progressively more jazzy. Like I love Pink Floyd's solos and like crazy diamond and stuff.

575
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:48,960
So yeah, I get it. But like just for example, for Foo Fighters, those guys, some souls mostly,

576
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,440
you know, what would you describe them? I'm not like, I'm not savvy on all the genre names.

577
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,720
And I might even say, I'm sure people in the comments would know, but like, what would that

578
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,840
I mean, did you could give you a fucking paragraph about it? I'm sure pop grunge or something grunge.

579
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:07,440
Yeah, pop rock, hard rock, like some no band is any one thing. They're all like a mix and a fusion.

580
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,640
So something in there, but they're not Pink Floyd. They're not snarky puppy, you know, they're

581
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,160
a particular thing they're going for. And it's by design. Dave Grohl's like, yeah, like I'm trying

582
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,440
to be popular and appeal to this demographic. So I construct my songs in this particular way.

583
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,120
And like watching Whiplash, I mean, or anything about jazz, it's funny because like it's,

584
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,240
you know, what it's kind of like, okay, now guys, you're going to understand the point I'm

585
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,600
making. It's like video games. Okay, now my ears, my ears perked up now.

586
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,920
It's like, like jazz music is for basically just like the refined palette. So for guys like me,

587
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,120
I mean, people might like shit on a game like, I don't know, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse

588
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:58,400
for, I don't know, being too waifu bait, being too blah, blah, blah, whatever. But that game

589
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:05,200
has incredibly refined and beautiful movement mechanics that like a connoisseur of Metroid

590
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,560
Vanias such as myself finds to be basically the pinnacle. Now other people can prefer exploration,

591
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,160
and there are like specific things that you want to get at different games. Like for example,

592
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,000
I just did a rant on my stream yesterday about how Metal Gear Solid 5 was a catastrophic failure

593
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,880
in many ways, story wise, but the mechanics of that game are so satisfying. And I love just

594
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,880
physically playing it that, you know, there's things to appreciate. So like your jazz is a

595
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,840
more complicated intricate, you have to commit more to it and kind of study it a little bit

596
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:43,360
to get more out of it. Whereas I don't know, I mean, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe yeah, maybe less so,

597
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,960
I'm sure. But there's definitely jazz I've heard that is like really, really funny and how stupid

598
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,640
it is. And how like people, people like that they're improvising and they're going into weird

599
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,720
keys. They're so weird that it can't possibly be, I can't jive to this, to this noise, you know,

600
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:07,200
that. Trout Mask replica. That's one of the famous ones by what's his face? She can't remember his

601
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:15,520
name. Mr. Meat Man. Dizzy Gillespie. Mr. Meat Man. Be Meat. What's that fucking guy's name? It's

602
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,360
Captain Beefheart. Captain Beefheart aka Mr. Meat Man. Same guy.

603
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:34,960
But like, I feel like there's this, it's like with a lot of things, like the more like, quote

604
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,400
unquote, intricate and difficult and like skilled you need to be to play a certain thing, or to

605
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:46,640
like the, you know, the more brain cells you need to appreciate Rick and Morty, like the more

606
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:52,560
elitist people get about it being gooder than the things that they used to like, which were less

607
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:59,680
good. And I just want to say that jazz is fucking sick. But that doesn't mean that pop music isn't

608
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,720
and rock music isn't. It's just all good if you like it. Indeed. It's good if you like it. It's

609
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,440
good if you like it, but please listen to Wolfpac. If you, if you'll know if you like it once you

610
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,160
listen to Dean Town, you're like, you know, if you're bopping your head and you're twitching your

611
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:24,080
toes, then you should probably see a doctor. How do you, how do you feel about like songs that I

612
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:30,000
would consider like earworms? Like you hate them, but like, ah, you can't stop listening to them or

613
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,720
like, you know, you like them and you can't stop listening to them to the point where you hate them.

614
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,840
Eh, it is what it is. There have been those. Well, you know, I, well, you know, I love Avril Lavigne.

615
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:50,400
Who doesn't? There have been those like. There was this song recently that I was, that was earworms

616
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,360
back into my brain from like a few years ago by Alicia Dixon or something, which is like,

617
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,160
uh, does he brush up? No, he doesn't brush up. Does he clean up? No, he doesn't clean up.

618
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,240
Does he wash up? Does he wash up? He does nothing. The boy does nothing. It's just like a really

619
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,640
annoying song about her complaining about her, how her boyfriend is stinky. And it was really,

620
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,120
it was really popular for a little bit there. And I, I just remembered it. I was like, oh god,

621
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,600
not her, not that, not that stupid song. That sucks. It fucking sucks.

622
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,200
Doesn't gaslight her. He just body gas, you know, with like his odor.

623
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:34,800
He just, he just regular gas aside. Oh god, Holocaust joke. I'm not going to make it.

624
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,760
Somebody else's making sleeping gas, but okay, fair enough. I don't think a laughing gas, because

625
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:45,920
it's funny. Yeah, yeah. But like that got in my head and it was annoying for a bit, but it doesn't,

626
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,840
it didn't really stay because I don't know. I had the music in my, in my periphery to listen to.

627
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:56,480
I was talking to a, I was talking to a friend yesterday and I'm not going to say who,

628
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,360
but they might be listening, they might be listening to this right now.

629
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,880
Hello, this unnamed friend.

630
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,120
I'm sure they'll be mortified, so I apologize for that, but your secret's safe. And this person was,

631
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,720
this person was telling me about some of their, some of their, some of their personal problems,

632
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,480
about some of their, some of their life. And I said, you know, I think this is literally the plot

633
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:23,520
of an Avril Lavigne song. So now I understand it and Ken Relay. It was, it was, it was, it was,

634
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,880
it was, they were literally describing what is being described in the lyrics of complicated.

635
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,000
I was just listening to that song the other day for personal reasons.

636
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,800
It's a good, it's a good fucking song. I'll stand by it. I will stand by complicated.

637
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:43,280
I was hoping you were going to say Skater Voight. Now that's, no, I wish.

638
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,280
No, they were literally, this is literally the plot of that kakakakawaii song.

639
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:53,360
It's just about loving Hello Kitty, which we all relate to, of course.

640
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,880
Speaking of Hello Kitty.

641
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,200
Yeah, speaking of Hello Kitty.

642
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,680
Oh, Maja's cat, the star of the show.

643
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,000
He likes to announce when he arrives. What can I do?

644
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,720
I'm home, Luigi, I'm home, he says.

645
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,720
Big dick is back in town.

646
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,760
Is there a name, his name Lulu?

647
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,760
Lullaby, but Lulu for short.

648
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,120
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

649
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,960
That was close. I got it. I got it.

650
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,600
I got it.

651
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,920
Didn't Digi have a cat called Lala?

652
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,400
After Lala from Inuyasha. Yeah.

653
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,520
Lala was, okay.

654
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,520
So I think I famously railed against Lala in the Sonichu lecture, right?

655
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,800
There were a lot of comments for a while being like, why is he yelling at the cat?

656
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,400
Answer, because I mean, answer, because I need my fucking personal space.

657
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,880
But Lala is like, Lala is the best cat that I've ever lived with.

658
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,360
And the reason why, I wouldn't want a cat.

659
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,680
But if I got one, I would want it to be like Lala.

660
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,160
I could, I could deal with it because Lala just fucked off.

661
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,960
Lala didn't, you didn't need to feed Lala.

662
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,560
She just like, she just like hung out outside, climbed on the roof, hunted her own food,

663
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,240
didn't eat you for anything.

664
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,080
Hunted her own food too? Wow. Okay.

665
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:09,440
Yes. Yes. She, there was a, she like, she caught a flying squirrel out of the air.

666
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,160
And then, and then ripped it in half and left it on the back porch.

667
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,800
Wait, did you see this happen?

668
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:22,640
I did not see it happen, but did you said that he had seen it happen?

669
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,120
I think, and I definitely, and I saw the corpse.

670
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,800
I saw the corpse that she had left.

671
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,880
Right out of the air. She jumped from the ground.

672
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,880
First I saw it in trade-off.

673
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,320
Then I came back later and saw the same corpse torn in half to him.

674
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,320
Lala was great, except for when she wouldn't fucking leave me alone in the lecture.

675
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,440
She liked you.

676
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,320
Do you not like, do you not like cats, like coming close?

677
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,240
I don't mind it particularly.

678
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,760
I mean, during the lecture, we need to walk around.

679
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,040
You're trying to do something, you know?

680
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,440
You don't want your, your, I mean, I remember the cat was on my future.

681
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,200
I mean, I mean, I'm trying to pace around.

682
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,240
I'm trying to pace around the space and Lala was in the way.

683
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,560
So I had to say, get that cat out of here.

684
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,360
That's perfectly-

685
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,520
Otherwise you're going to crunch on its tail.

686
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,440
Yeah. And who wants that?

687
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:14,640
Uh, Luna, my cat is extremely, like, uh, right up in your, in your face.

688
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,000
And no matter who you are, no matter if they're, if you're a stranger,

689
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,560
Sixton was over at my house just today.

690
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,920
He was visiting UK and he was like, hey, can I come over for an afternoon?

691
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,440
I was like, yeah, stay the night.

692
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,440
And, uh, like the, the cat, like, instantly was like, oh, yeah, cool.

693
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,400
There's a person, like I'm not in any way scared.

694
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,680
And I'm like, you're going to be in trouble if you ever meet like a nasty person outside.

695
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,000
Cause you just, you're just too trusting.

696
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,080
You're too pure, you're too innocent.

697
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,320
You go up to them, you, you per immediately, you're too nice.

698
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,760
And she doesn't even like struggle if you pick her up.

699
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,880
You know, if I, if I was a supervillain, I could pick her up

700
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,800
and put her in a vat of boiling lava and she wouldn't even realize what was going on.

701
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,280
You know, we, um, so we got some new downstairs neighbors

702
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,560
cause I live in a duplex and, um, the bottom half of the duplex was empty for a little while

703
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,320
cause the old, the old people moved out.

704
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,080
But, um, uh, we got some, we got some new ones, like maybe a month and a half ago.

705
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,920
And it is, it's three, it's three people.

706
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,000
There's like a husband and a wife and another guy who I guess is their friend or something.

707
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,440
And, uh, they have a cat.

708
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,560
The cat's name is queen.

709
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,320
I saw the cat one time.

710
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,120
She seemed fine.

711
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,560
Yes, queen.

712
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,960
And like the, the wife and the friend seem like perfectly fine.

713
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,760
They're perfectly friendly.

714
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,560
They don't see him that much.

715
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,080
But when we do, it's like, Hey, the husband seems like the biggest fucking dick.

716
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,080
The husband is an asshole.

717
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,760
Like the husband will complain about noise at like when we're not even doing anything weird

718
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,440
and at a time that is not even like late and not, and like not even disruptive or anything.

719
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,440
Like we were working out in the basement.

720
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,120
We were working out in the basement at like six or seven PM, right?

721
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,680
So like, you know, yeah, the way, the way it's hitting the ground and like he comes down and is

722
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,160
like, Hey, I've really, you know, you guys need to keep it down down here.

723
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,480
And he like, he came up another time on like a Saturday night at like maybe like 10 30 PM.

724
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,400
And was like, some of us, some of us have work in the morning or something.

725
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:24,080
I mean, I get it, but what are the, I mean, you live in a shared space.

726
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:28,000
I mean, and then, and then another time I was coming out the door.

727
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,280
I was coming out the door like 10 PM on a Saturday.

728
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,120
Come on. That's not, that's not crazy.

729
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,480
And like I'm coming out the door and he's there.

730
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,160
I think he's like taking the garbage out or something and he's coming in and I give him,

731
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,280
I give him like a very friendly, I'm like, Hey, what's going, how are you doing?

732
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,920
And he like does not make no eye contact, like deliberately avoids looking at me.

733
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,360
Maybe this is a one time thing.

734
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:56,080
And he was just at that moment occupied in his brain or something possibly maybe.

735
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:01,120
None of us, none of us have any, no, but none of us that live here

736
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,200
have had any good experiences with that guy.

737
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:03,680
Fair enough.

738
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,560
He's bad news.

739
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,480
He's a troublemaker.

740
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:12,560
We have to, we have to roll him up in a blank and then throw him off the bridge is what I'm saying.

741
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,200
That's the right move.

742
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
At least he's in a blank.

743
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,200
At least we know, we know, we know what we have to do.

744
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:21,920
Ben, that's it.

745
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,960
That's my story.

746
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,400
Okay. Well, Ben, I have something I wanted to share with you, Ben.

747
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,040
I think you'll appreciate it and everyone else will too.

748
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,080
You know, I mentioned Metroidvanias earlier.

749
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,840
There was a new kid on the block when it comes to Metroidvanias.

750
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,120
I've only dabbled a little bit.

751
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,800
I played a little bit this morning, but I've been very interested for a long time.

752
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,200
Okay.

753
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,880
Cast your gaze on a couple of these images that I'm posting here.

754
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,560
This is from a game called blasphemous.

755
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,880
And basically the Orthodox boys.

756
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,360
Oh my God.

757
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,040
It's time to assemble.

758
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,400
Our time has come.

759
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,600
It's time to praise God and lash ourselves.

760
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,000
Okay.

761
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,560
So this game.

762
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:58,960
Okay.

763
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,160
This looks wicked cool.

764
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,000
It is incredibly cool.

765
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,280
Look like a big boy.

766
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:03,360
Okay.

767
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,480
Just, just look at it.

768
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:04,640
Look at it.

769
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,640
I'm posting an image right here.

770
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,040
This is after you beat the first boss, the beginning of the game.

771
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,080
So here's what you do.

772
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,200
Is he a big boy?

773
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,640
He looks like a big boy.

774
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,240
He's, he's a normally sized human.

775
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,440
He's not particularly large.

776
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,160
But he fights boys that are real big.

777
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,040
Wait, is this from the, is this the new from software?

778
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:21,600
No.

779
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:21,760
No.

780
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,760
It's by these guys, I want to say 17th street studios.

781
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,960
This is their first game, I believe.

782
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,760
So they're, they're new kids on the block with a lot to prove.

783
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,840
You're getting some press and I've been liking it so far.

784
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,400
Funny note.

785
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,000
Like I've seen this before, but only once on my Twitter timeline when someone was calling him daddy.

786
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,280
Okay.

787
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,320
I mean, he's pretty daddy.

788
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,600
He's authoritative.

789
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:47,440
I could see him, you know, be in my new dad, pleasing my mom the way she has been pleased.

790
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,840
And since dad died, I look forward to that.

791
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,960
But this is so, so here's the scoop lads.

792
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,880
So you start off this game.

793
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,760
You're in a pile of these guys, whatever you get up and you keep going.

794
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,280
You've got this cool cone head.

795
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,160
Never fear everybody.

796
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,680
It's not a KKK thing.

797
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,600
This is like a Spanish church thing.

798
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,480
Don't freak out.

799
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,880
Let me put your mind in the use about the whole about the KKK question.

800
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,080
The KKKQ.

801
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,040
Oh, that's the one.

802
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,120
So this guy, he's going, he does swordsman things, whatever.

803
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:15,280
Okay.

804
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,920
This is like the most Orthodox Catholic shit.

805
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,080
It's he's called the penitent one.

806
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,120
And it's all about experiencing pain for your sins.

807
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,400
So the first thing you do is you go and you fight a boss.

808
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:26,640
Yeah.

809
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,240
You strike him down as like a big giant guy.

810
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,360
You cut him open.

811
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:29,600
Okay.

812
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,200
You see how he's got this big bucket helmet on like he's got a normal head under that.

813
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:33,920
He takes it off.

814
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,880
He can't see his face.

815
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,000
He fills it up with the blood of the boss that he just like he fills the whole thing up.

816
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,880
And then he goes, he puts it on over his head and he just filled with blood.

817
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,520
He just thought this was the right move to make.

818
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,520
I don't know why.

819
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,240
I assume it's like beneficial in some way.

820
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,560
Is this you haven't you haven't told me anything about the game.

821
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,800
Is it a 2D sidescrolling metroidvania?

822
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,560
It's a metroidvania a la like by way of Dark Souls.

823
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,640
It's it's got like estus flask shit.

824
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,160
It's got it's very much like Hollow Knight or Dark Souls.

825
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,680
Hollow Knight is pretty embarrassing.

826
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,560
This blood thing is a very red man-esque thing.

827
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,840
I think red man might review this game.

828
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,400
Him and red man they should and him and red man would be best friends.

829
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,160
Is it out or is it just it's out?

830
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,040
It's out everywhere.

831
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:17,760
It's yeah.

832
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,800
I was playing it this morning.

833
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,600
There was a demo.

834
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,040
It's it's out.

835
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,160
I mean it's a metroidvania.

836
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,960
I've only played maybe like an hour or two maybe.

837
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,480
It's super duper fun.

838
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,240
I love it so far.

839
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,760
I can't speak that it's great.

840
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,680
Apparently it's reasonably short, but it's just so orthodox.

841
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,720
So like everything you do is about how like your sinners need to harm yourself and lash

842
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,280
yourself and bleed the blood to praise.

843
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,800
I mean it's not specifically like Catholic.

844
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,400
It's like kind of pseudo non-shit and I'm not actually religious.

845
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,760
But the aesthetic is sick.

846
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,520
So this looks so fucking cool.

847
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,080
It is.

848
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,680
I'm watching the trailer right now.

849
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,000
Yeah.

850
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,360
It's it's dope as hell.

851
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,040
So I've been loving it.

852
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,200
I think everybody how much how much on steam.

853
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:58,320
Shit.

854
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,040
You know I don't know.

855
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,680
I think I paid 20 bucks.

856
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,080
Let me see.

857
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,040
Blast 20.

858
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,000
I bought it on Switch.

859
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,200
But fuck it.

860
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,880
I'll wait till it goes on sale.

861
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,520
Good plan.

862
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,320
Good plan.

863
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,080
I'm just curious how much fucking was this thing.

864
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,280
I don't even know.

865
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,320
I just knew I wanted it.

866
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,560
It might have been like 30 40 bucks.

867
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,000
And so I can't I can't remember.

868
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,240
Okay.

869
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:16,960
It doesn't matter.

870
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,680
Point is I felt it was worth it and I've been very much enjoying it.

871
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,720
And I knew you'd be into it based on the scene based on the visuals.

872
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,360
But I mean yeah.

873
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,440
Feel free to wait for it to go on sale or whatever.

874
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,440
That's it.

875
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,120
That's my game recommendation for the day.

876
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,000
Looks dope.

877
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,280
This is not a full review people.

878
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,120
Just letting you know.

879
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,720
I played like an hour but it looks dope.

880
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:36,480
All right.

881
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:36,960
That's me.

882
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,360
Excellent.

883
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:37,680
That's me.

884
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,160
Excellent.

885
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:38,480
Blast on this.

886
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,280
We could go to voice.

887
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:41,600
Shit.

888
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,560
I'm just throwing it out there.

889
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,920
We could do it if we wanted to.

890
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,880
I mean I guess.

891
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,480
I got one more thing to talk about.

892
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:46,800
Sure.

893
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,080
Let me find the image.

894
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:53,200
I have been drawing like on stream draw streams.

895
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,240
Those are still going well.

896
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,440
Every every weekday on on twitch.tv slash give and take.

897
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,120
If you if you want to see me draw something.

898
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,600
I've split it up now.

899
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,720
Now I'm doing a rendering study on Fridays.

900
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,920
And this is the first one.

901
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,720
Turns out turned out pretty good.

902
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,320
I think it's quite a big image.

903
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,200
Oh yeah.

904
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,160
I saw that before.

905
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,000
You literally cut out for me.

906
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,840
I didn't hear what you said.

907
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,000
Oh.

908
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,760
Oh did you draw that?

909
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,520
I drew it.

910
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,320
That's so good.

911
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:25,440
Yeah.

912
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,800
I was I was really proud of it.

913
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,440
From scratch.

914
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,640
Anything like that before.

915
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,200
Look at the lighting on the hand.

916
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,000
From scratch.

917
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,080
No.

918
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,800
I mean I was copying images but I was trying to get the.

919
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:37,760
Yeah.

920
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:37,920
Yeah.

921
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,480
From scratch.

922
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,760
Oh that's so cool.

923
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,760
The hand was actually like one layer.

924
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,360
I forgot to have layers on the hand.

925
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,760
I just kept like adding like like low opacity like airbrush.

926
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,720
I like the depth of field as well for the hand.

927
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,320
That's how you like the finger furthest away is so blurred.

928
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,000
You can see that like the light is kind of coming through the skin.

929
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,560
Yes.

930
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:58,880
Yes.

931
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,680
Yeah.

932
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,320
Yeah.

933
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,000
Oh that's amazing.

934
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,640
It's advanced.

935
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,080
These are advanced techniques.

936
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,160
You suddenly I didn't expect when you got here.

937
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,680
Yeah I mean I didn't expect to be like I'd never really

938
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,960
sat down and tried this.

939
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,160
I've done paintings before.

940
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,480
I've done like stuff like this in school.

941
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,240
But like it's really just it's you know you look at it and you're like what does it look like.

942
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,280
It doesn't look like that.

943
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,040
Let's change it here and change it there.

944
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,600
And yeah.

945
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,240
Yeah.

946
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,920
No layers are for pussy.

947
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,840
Draw a close up in this style of pump's face.

948
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,840
I want to see those pumpkin seeds.

949
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,760
I want to see that candle in there.

950
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,800
I want to see it all.

951
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,400
Her seed she's she doesn't have seeds.

952
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,320
She's she's a pure maiden.

953
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,360
Or maybe just do it next time.

954
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:41,840
Whoa.

955
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,360
I made a slime mead version.

956
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,560
Oh that's so good.

957
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,360
That feel and touch slime.

958
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,280
I choked on my spit a little bit.

959
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,760
This is like Earth of a Slime Boy.

960
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:58,640
This image literally Adam touching God you know zero BC or whatever.

961
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,840
Yeah this is a this is a branching timeline actually.

962
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,600
There's like two things that could happen.

963
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,920
He could have had an apple or he could have had slime.

964
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,640
This man went for slime.

965
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,600
That's the difference between Dimension 1218 and Dimension C197.

966
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,520
There it is.

967
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,000
Magichan does not take the threat of slime seriously.

968
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,080
No.

969
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:25,280
Okay but it will be to his ruin right because when the dimensions merge right

970
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,920
the slime boys are gonna they're gonna be out in the forest right.

971
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,200
I don't know.

972
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:29,680
I don't know.

973
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,320
I don't know if they can stuff you know Chris is so confident that all the

974
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:37,840
soniches and him and and and all the her and all the deities and whatever all the

975
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,600
fucking superheroes that are gonna like they think they think they can stop the slime but

976
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,200
I mean I don't know I guess we'll see.

977
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:48,000
Did you see I mean that big I for one am terrified about you know coming back from the

978
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:54,480
the there was a there was a big I believe it was like a four page like Twitter story.

979
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,680
It might have been on Chris's it might have been on Magichan's I'm looking right now to see

980
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:01,920
if I can find yeah I was I was just okay that's where that Magichan announced that he has physically

981
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,840
come to dimension 1218.

982
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,440
Right right okay okay I'm with you.

983
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,920
And that the purple blurs him.

984
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,120
I mean in that it was described that the I mean maybe this is already known but that

985
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:16,960
they are I believe the word omniscient was used and so I mean I assume that they're there

986
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,880
seems pretty confident that slime is not going to be a hassle but I mean I don't know.

987
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:28,320
Yeah well better better men than the Magichan soniches have fallen to the slime.

988
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,560
Indeed indeed don't underestimate it.

989
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:37,120
Also here here's a red man image just to show you the the breadth of my artistic abilities

990
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,720
I can do it I can do this guy I can do this hand and I can do that hand.

991
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,080
He's pointing at himself the little red man at the top I love it.

992
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,280
Yeah this is another one you could do oh yes point oh you could have another one of this

993
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,240
this Adam hand reaching out to touch red man's finger.

994
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,120
Oh my god.

995
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,040
Pokey poke finger on finger action.

996
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:59,920
That's uh you know red man's looking pretty kawai right here.

997
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,720
Yeah he's he's a cute boy.

998
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:10,160
I was I was thinking of having him be like like the the the bottom right like character on screen

999
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:15,520
for like I don't know a review show but I but I wouldn't make the review show I just wanted

1000
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,040
to draw a red man as if he were.

1001
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:22,720
Yeah do do a like you know one minute long review of Blasphemous by red man and just have to be

1002
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,320
like this is the most bloody game ever I love it it's like fuck Bloodborne.

1003
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,000
Oh I was going to say fuck Bloodborne that's pussy blood shit Blasphemous.

1004
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,720
Now now we're talking real blood amounts and uh it's great it's great.

1005
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,640
And he's pointing at it and he said there it is.

1006
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,840
There's blood.

1007
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,480
I love it.

1008
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,200
There's the blood.

01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:39,440
I can see some.

1010
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,640
He's his famous catchphrase there's blood.

1011
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:43,840
There's blood.

1012
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,560
Everybody loves him.

1013
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,680
I will get blood.

1014
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:49,840
Fuck yeah.

1015
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,720
All right let's go to Boys Nails.

01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,760
I mean great art everybody take a look.

1018
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,840
Look at all those look at Blasphemous look at Kickstarter.

1019
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,680
I'm still watching this slime.

1020
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,360
I'm just watching it flow.

1021
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,480
It's a peaceful image.

1022
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,440
It fills me with joy.

1023
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:05,840
Makes me hungry.

1024
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,200
I just want to put my mouth at the bottom of this stream of slime.

1025
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,960
It's just like right below the cutoff of the image is me with my mouth open.

1026
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,560
All right well you know what I did and that's canon.

1027
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,200
I prepared like 10 voicemails.

1028
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,320
They were of decent quality.

1029
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,800
They're all they're all something to appreciate.

1030
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,200
So let's just jump into those and we can we can take our time.

1031
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,680
Uh yeah all right so let's go.

1032
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,680
Speak pipe link people down below.

1033
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,960
Leave us voicemails.

1034
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:33,920
Good stuff.

1035
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:39,360
And let's start off with um eat my entire ass with a voicemail.

1036
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:40,800
Let's jump into it.

1037
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,360
Here we go.

1038
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:41,600
Go.

1039
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,480
So I've been doing some thinking.

1040
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:50,000
What is the autism power level of the PCP?

1041
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:56,880
We have the obvious choice being Davoo who we all know as like a

1042
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,800
thing he's said himself that is autistic or people have said so.

1043
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,040
But do um like what is the ranking?

1044
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,040
Who is the most autistic?

1045
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:11,600
I think a lot of people might want to put themselves at the top.

1046
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:17,360
But as a person who not me autistic people or autistic people

1047
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:22,960
are constantly around autistic people I feel like I'm a bit of an expert myself.

1048
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,280
And I just want to point out one thing bigger than any other thing that the

1049
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,080
most autistic person in the PCP is Nate.

1050
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,480
Yeah that's it.

1051
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,280
That's it.

1052
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,240
I mean what good is that without an explanation of why?

1053
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,800
He did not give an I guess we're supposed to fill in the blank.

1054
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,520
He says he's an expert but then he provides no no that's lame.

1055
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,600
That's lame dude call back and tell me why.

1056
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,560
Yeah I do want to know why.

1057
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,040
I do want an explanation.

1058
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,560
Give me a point by point.

1059
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,880
I'm not going to assume it's because Ha Ha Nate likes numbers and being

1060
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,440
correct and making sure the facts are straight all the time.

1061
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:04,400
No no no no you don't he doesn't deserve he doesn't deserve to have you go and attribute

1062
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,040
all these like facts and logic to what he said.

1063
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,520
No failure.

1064
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,560
That's fair that's fair.

1065
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,400
As for as for who has the most autism it's clearly DigiD.

1066
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,000
I mean I was thinking I thought he was going to go straight.

1067
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,440
It's clearly DigiD bro.

1068
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,160
I mean Digi identifies as autistic.

1069
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,320
Diboo is more autistic than Digi.

1070
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,360
I don't think I don't this might be a hot take.

1071
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,720
I don't think Digi is as autistic as he thinks he is.

1072
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,280
I mean he's made it kind of an identity at this point.

1073
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,760
So you know it's just a it's just a meme.

1074
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,800
Yeah it's a meme.

1075
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,840
All right whatever let us know details if you can provide that sir.

1076
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,520
Well I mean he did eat that shit.

1077
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:40,800
Sorry.

1078
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:46,400
You know he ate that that non autistic person's shit and he became less autistic remember that.

1079
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,800
Oh the whole yeah the whole you know even though even though that study was maybe

1080
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,720
found to be like it was not like substantiated enough.

1081
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:59,200
Who's who's shitted he it's a it's a it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't move on.

1082
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,760
I really don't want to know.

1083
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:07,200
Okay great because we got Clyde Caliber here with another voicemail actually his first

1084
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,240
voicemail probably okay go Clyde take it away.

1085
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,160
So PCP I was just trying to think a good question.

1086
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,160
I didn't come up with one.

1087
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:24,320
I was wondering what's like canonically on that disc you know the TPC logo.

1088
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,400
There's a disc there.

1089
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,360
What the hell's on it.

1090
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,920
I don't know you have Digi's secret hentai stash or some shit.

1091
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,800
Maybe it's the theme song.

1092
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,840
Maybe it's the theme song.

1093
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,640
Wait what the theme song.

1094
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,800
Yeah one mp3 of yes no I I always thought of it as like

1095
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:50,080
um like whatever is on that disc is like I forgot to burn this disc it's empty.

1096
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,160
I procrastinated on it.

1097
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:57,520
Oh I like that an empty disc uh yeah that needs to be filled with data and information.

1098
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,520
That sounds good which represents you the audience need to be filled with our

1099
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,160
information are useless worth this trash.

1100
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:07,040
Yes it represents you even though it is literally representing us.

1101
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,560
That's correct that's correct.

1102
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,400
Sounds like as good an explanation as any.

1103
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,160
Perhaps DaVoo could provide more insight but uh it's open to interpretation.

1104
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:22,400
Okay we got Smyrg now this was it was specified this is for Munchy but Munchy who knows and

1105
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,880
Munchy's gonna be back because he's a busy boy with school and all that stuff.

1106
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,840
Yes he did say about school taking up all his time.

1107
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,120
Figured we might as well you know play it now because who knows when that'll happen so

1108
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,720
okay here we go Smyrg go.

1109
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:40,080
Howdy Smyrg here with a basic ask question welcome so tell me about keeping motivation

1110
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,640
on long-term creative projects.

1111
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,240
In my experience I'll have an idea for a project I'll dive way into it and burn

1112
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:53,040
pretty much all of my free time for next two weeks maybe a month at most fully devoted to

1113
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:59,360
the project at which point I seem to always hit a wall where I either become more interested

1114
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:05,120
in pursuing a new project idea or just burn myself out completely and need a break.

1115
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,040
So how do you avoid this?

1116
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,080
Does it happen to you?

1117
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,280
You feeling me on it?

1118
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,560
Okay see ya.

1119
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,920
Okay I was thinking about this I mean first of all I'm terrible at this I'm terrible at

1120
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:22,320
maintaining motivation over a long term um literally literally the thing to do the thing

1121
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,480
the way to do it is to make it as not long term as possible.

1122
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:30,720
Yes true and to get it done as fast as you possibly can at any cost.

1123
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:36,880
Just do what I'm currently doing with the Minecraft server right now do nothing else

1124
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,920
with your life absolutely nothing that that sometimes works depending on what you got.

1125
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:48,800
No I agree like when I um yeah because then it gets done that's how you get it done the fastest

1126
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:54,080
right well what about I mean sometimes sometimes I wish sometimes I wish that like I didn't do

1127
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:58,800
anything else sometimes I kind of I'm like oh god I wish I didn't have to like have friends in real

1128
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:04,560
life or do like twitch streams or do or record the pcp or do anything else and then I could just

1129
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,280
turn off the internet and have literally nothing to do except like work on something for like

1130
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:14,000
how many weeks it took. Strike while there and talk, do what you can, do what you want to.

1131
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,640
Like everything else in my life would suffer but like I could I could I would be faster at

1132
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,120
achieving like the one thing that like I'm focused that I want to get done next you know.

1133
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:30,400
I don't know I disagree generally with with all that like I mean the idea of burnout is that

1134
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:35,440
you're forcing yourself to do a certain amount in your mind you're like oh I've got to do this

1135
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:40,080
and if you slip up and don't feel like doing it one day then you crumble and die and then it

1136
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:46,240
becomes difficult to get back on the horse. I think um I mean I'm not like an expert either

1137
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,480
but like I haven't lost motivation for the things I'm doing even though they're just coming along

1138
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:58,320
very slowly because I'm not like forcing myself to get so much of it done um every day like I have

1139
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:04,240
a reasonable expectation of myself. I have a lot of things planned but like the thing that makes me

1140
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:10,560
like die the most is when I have a lot of free time and I have a like a choice of things to do

1141
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:16,720
and I just don't know how to choose. That's rough yeah yeah yeah that that gets me more more so than

1142
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:23,120
like um you know having trouble starting is like having trouble choosing so make the choices ahead

1143
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:27,760
of time yeah and if you don't do them then doesn't matter you know you had your allocated time to

1144
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,840
draw a page of this uh you failed but at least you know when you're supposed to next to do it

1145
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,960
and it's like at least you know what you failed at yeah instead of just feeling like this vague

1146
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,280
like sense of like you are gonna die one day and you haven't drawn a million things and you're not

1147
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:49,840
Hayao Miyazaki and I'm like ah shut up you know not everybody can be Mozart it's too hard.

1148
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,480
We should uh we should remember probably that I don't know exactly what Smirks working on

1149
01:20:54,560 --> 01:21:00,960
necessarily obviously I know Smirks are great art boy but um the uh like Smirks sent me a bunch of

1150
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:08,640
um art rfck stickers. Give me one I want one so bad. She designed um have you seen them it's just

1151
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,400
it's like a cute little graphic of like endless yeah endless war endless war in the middle.

1152
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,320
It's so cool. And then you can see Rowdy Rowdy Rough House in Cobb Kilt Town. I want to see it.

1153
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,600
I've been I've been going around I've been sticking them on. Yo put a picture up for the

1154
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:25,200
links. People need to see this shit. Oh they're great. I don't shit. I have to find the digital

1155
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:31,520
image. Um yeah um I stuck I stuck them around like Medford and I stuck them on like Tufts and

1156
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,760
stuff but I was gonna stick them in downtown because we were downtown yesterday for Munchie's

1157
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:42,400
birthday but I forgot to bring them but whatever. I'll um I'll um I'll get them um and yeah she

1158
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,400
sent me like hundreds of them and I mean I cut a bunch of them out and I've been I was gonna

1159
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:53,600
I want I want okay I want to sell them but not for a profit just so just to like cover the costs

1160
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,880
of production because I just I want people to have like extremely easy because I want people

1161
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,600
I want these in the hands of like everybody yeah yeah I want everybody who likes this shit

1162
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,520
to have just to have like really easy and cheap access so they can stick them fucking everywhere

1163
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,280
and I'll say again there's there's one thing because we've already had just from like the

1164
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,960
couple ones that we've already had people join the server just from seeing these stickers around

1165
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,800
that's great that that's perfect and the one thing you guys should definitely fix I believe on

1166
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:25,520
these stickers it has the discord URL at the bottom right uh in the yeah like across the middle

1167
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:31,840
you guys gotta get a fucking address that's easy to type in just so that people don't get scared

1168
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:37,040
off by letters and numbers and stuff I think that would do a lot personally well we I mean

1169
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:41,760
there's like slime.com or whatever that that takes you to the discord like you buy the url

1170
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:48,400
like slime okay well slime.com is we look into custom urls and what if though

1171
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,520
instead of that you get a qr code you get a qr code for that link I have a qr code for um yeah

1172
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:01,520
that's good to server it's good to uh I mean the the sticker would have to be redesigned

1173
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:08,000
there's a shirt actually you can buy a shirt with literally just the qr code it's like a black shirt

1174
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,600
in like a lime green like fluorescent just like the qr code for the server is just the entire shirt

1175
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,240
damn I like I kind of want one of those that's pretty sick it's pretty sick actually I think it

1176
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:23,680
looks it actually looks good yeah sure sure um uh what was I gonna say oh oh and so I was gonna say

1177
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:29,760
just to just to get back on uh Smirks question here um sorry I'm just writing this down so we

1178
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,160
don't forget I was I was gonna say so Smirks question about motivation whatnot was originally

1179
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:39,280
was directed at Munchy so I think the implication was like Munchy with his like doing rfck stuff

1180
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,120
seems like the target thing so like and that experience is kind of different from what we

1181
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,880
were talking about up to this point because the nature of endless war and stuff is like

1182
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:53,360
like it's an it's intended to be like a long-term ongoing thing that like even if you like do all

1183
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:58,160
the work and make your primary focus just buy the nature of that project you don't really want it to

1184
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:03,920
like be all done now you want it to take a while to like you know be rolled out and blah blah blah

1185
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,520
do stuff you want to you want to have like events that people can participate in and

1186
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:13,120
all that stuff so with something like that I've really like never done something like that

1187
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,760
but I would say like that that uses a skill that I'm terrible at I want to do what these guys were

1188
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:23,440
saying my instinct I want to forget everything just do one project as I said a million times

1189
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:29,600
yeah that's like that would be like the the ideal like just eat raw sugar just eat raw salt like

1190
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:35,520
pleasure nodes in my brain activating not best way to operate in life but really it's a nice it's

1191
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:40,800
a nice idea I feel like though I'm not the idea of like a bad way to live but I'm just saying to

1192
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:46,720
work on exactly exclusively one thing it's like a very childish idea because you think it like

1193
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:51,120
binary like you're doing this and then you're doing that one or the other life is really

1194
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:57,200
complicated and there's always things that come up there's like there's like there's the bills to pay

1195
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:03,360
there's the dentist appointment there's the there's there's all sorts of things that get in the way

1196
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:12,320
of stuff but what is it bad and so it's you have to you have to like plan like make a plan but then

1197
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:17,680
put like areas in that plan where things can go wrong but it's still okay yeah because like you

1198
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:23,280
know have days where you you don't have anything to do um like weekends are a good time where you're

1199
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:29,840
like uh it's clear on the weekend and then during the weekday you have very regimented clear cut

1200
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:34,560
what you're supposed to do at the time I mean it doesn't have to be like this hour you need to do this

1201
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:42,000
but like a general like goal for the day is easy to get you started and then you can you can juggle

1202
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:48,320
multiple projects at once like like alternating which day you're doing it on and you can still have

1203
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:53,840
time for like oh in the like a like a flight of fancy sort of idea hits you and you have time on the

1204
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:58,960
weekend to work on that if you want to you know you're not you're not like the the the thing that

1205
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,320
really gets me sometimes is when I'm working on a project and this idea comes into my head like I

1206
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:09,360
watch a video and now I want to make videos or something and I'm like damn it this is ruined

1207
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:13,840
everything I'm trying to focus on this thing I'm trying to do and all these great ideas are coming

1208
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,320
to me and I got to ignore them I got to throw them away I got to like jot them down for later maybe

1209
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:23,840
but like your brain doesn't work like that sometimes you just want to just want to go all

1210
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:30,160
loopy loo and like explore these cool ideas you have and you got to have you got to have time for that

1211
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:36,880
it's true it's true yep I was just freaking out because I was looking for smirks uh sticker art

1226
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,920
the comp fuck I was someone I know in the comments might have been marron pan I don't know it was

1227
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,880
someone I recognized in the comments it was like dude ben I know your favorite anime is fully cool

1228
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,200
you said it a million times I was like oh my god he's right I forgot my own favorite anime

1229
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:28,160
maybe it was I'm sorry it's stupid I know but Karakano Karakano is really Karikul

1230
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:33,760
curry kano that's I'm not hungry thanks for asking uh all right let's go to the next

1231
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:40,000
did you did you see yeah you guys watch um Brian David Gilbert on polygon I don't think so no

1232
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:46,480
he's done some pretty good videos for polygon I like his I like his shit um he did a video

1233
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:53,920
recently I don't think it's as good as his old ones but it's like I made all 78 recipes you can make

1234
01:28:53,920 --> 01:29:00,160
in um sky not skyward sword um oh yeah yeah I saw that floating around what do you think was it

1235
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,960
interesting it's all right uh it's pretty good it's not his best I think his best one is here's my

1236
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,200
best one is probably the one about like the mega man robot masters that one's pretty excellent did the

1237
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,560
did the cooking one reveal no no the one about the the one about the kingdom hearts the one about

1238
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:17,040
the kingdom hearts like story structure is really funny okay fair enough did this by any chance I'm

1239
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:22,400
curious about the cooking did that reveal that the mechanic is relatively shallow and that there's only

1240
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:27,520
so much point in doing it I'm just curious if that was the conclusion no not really it's basically

1241
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:34,720
just it's just goofy and like it's like man the recipe for the recipe for this like pink like

1242
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:41,360
healing drink is like watermelon radish and a dragon fruit and milk so let's just like put those

1243
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:46,160
four things in a blender and blend them and just drink it and like see if it's any good or whatever

1244
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:51,360
oh I see I see but the thing that stood out to me most about the video is that he grew a mustache

1245
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,400
and he needs to not have a mustache anymore he needs to get his old swoopy hair back he had

1246
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:01,120
really cool hair for a while there see if you can grab the link to that for the show no sure but

1247
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:09,200
okay let's let's move on to our next voicemail this one's calling out bge rot row okay go calling out

spanish accent boy okay go hello pcp first of thanks tom and thanks mate for your contribution

1255
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:07,520
with the university paper i passed it on as you welcome so now to my actual voicemail

1256
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:13,680
personal drama but it pays off i saw around six years ago i was in a very dark place in my life

1257
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:20,160
and at that time i decided hey going to japan we will surely solve all of my problems in life you

1258
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:27,520
know so flash forward to nowadays and i sorted my entire life i got a university degree i got a

1259
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:33,680
wonderful girlfriend tons of friends a job it came to the point that i applied just for the

1260
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:41,840
lowest to a university scholarship to go to japan for four months but here is the problem i actually

1261
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:48,080
got the fucking money i got the scholarship they are they are sending me to japan for four months

1262
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:56,160
but i already sorted my life so why should i go there i am not quite sure what i even

1263
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:02,080
applied for this scholarship even more so i i don't even know japanese the only japanese i know

1264
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:08,880
it's from the fucking hentai i have watched in my life so i don't know i might be tired for doing

1265
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:17,040
this i i am going to die i'm going to die right i'm going to die so wait so he applied for this

1266
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:22,720
scholarship and then like years later they get back to him like hey we're sending you to that thing

1267
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:29,040
but like no i think i think it was i think it was like he he he didn't get it the first time

1268
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:35,520
or then or something but then he after he sorted his life out he just sort of like as a joke applied

1269
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:41,440
again and he got it possibly and everyone knows the only reason to go to japan is to have a character

1270
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:47,760
arc development and to progress because you're at the end it's a complete waste of time uh i i don't

1271
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:52,080
see what the problem is like it's only four months you can go have a cool experience and then you'll

1272
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:56,800
have that to add to your repertoire of things you can say you did we all know going to japan if

1273
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:02,800
it's covered i mean it's gonna be fun it's gonna be dope well i mean i i think so but like i mean

1274
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:08,880
i think he would probably have to like quit his job to go away for four months uh huh wait he said

1275
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:14,560
university did he say he has a job he said he said job yeah he said he's got a job well shit

1276
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:20,080
stuff like i mean he would have to like he would have to like put his life on hold i mean he'll

1277
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,760
probably be away from his girlfriend for the four months if nothing else i mean that's that you

1278
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,960
know kind of a downside well i mean if if everything will go to shit if you leave for four months and

1279
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:33,760
just don't leave is that yeah not possible if that's the issue then that's an understandable reason

1280
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:39,600
to to bail but now do you have to do it are you like committed to it no no but i think he's like

1281
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:45,440
you know he'd like to do it but yeah now it would fuck up everything else four months is a long time

1282
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:50,720
but i i you can go so you can you can make if you've got like if you've got your shit sorted

1283
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:57,200
out you can fucking go to japan another time i was there for shit what was it i want to say

1284
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,280
and it sounds like he doesn't even care about japan itself right sounds like he's not even like

1285
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:04,640
it's not like he's like oh i've always wanted to go to japan he just like signed up for this

1286
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:10,000
thing like pretty much at random it basically well is the impression that i get did i forget

1287
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,240
how i want to say i was there for two months am i wrong about that i feel like it was two months

1288
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:20,000
and it was a great time and i mean for me like me that's when i had my character arc development

1289
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,480
so you're a little past that but there's always room to grow and seeing a new place is always a

1290
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:31,520
good idea if it doesn't totally fuck up your life 100 go you will not regret it it doesn't matter

1291
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,520
if you know zero japanese because everything there is designed there's english everywhere

1292
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:40,320
people will help they all speak a tiny bit of english they're not great at it but you'll be fine

1293
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:47,280
you'll be fine go fucking go unless it ruins your life that's this is the one island the cat island

1294
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:54,640
the deer like exactly yeah go to all the animal life oh incredible go to neat uh what's the word

i gotta imagine that hell is not is it in our dimension hell and heaven must be their own

1327
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:20,880
dimensions okay yeah it's the dimensional merge is only between dimension c197 dimension

1333
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:50,640
is happening why am i seeing these weird purple blurs everywhere that i know in my heart of hearts

1334
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:55,440
our magic chan sonichu what if it's just mage who's developed super speed and she's just dashing

1336
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:08,160
okay let's move on we got uh okay this one's weird it's like they use some weird fonts it's like

1338
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:22,320
hey did anybody else notice how before when you used to write pcp and youtube the actual pcp showed

1339
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:28,080
up now when you do that just because joe rogan became kind of more relevant every time you see

1340
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:37,040
joe fucking rogan talk to joe rogan go eat a banana dick or something did he did he did he take our

1341
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:41,120
spot on the youtube algorithm i gotta do a search right now i'm gonna go now i have a little i always

1342
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:46,480
search like the procrastinators podcast to find pcb stuff because when you just search pcp which i'm

1343
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:51,920
doing right now my first you get this bike slam thing i mean okay i'm logged in as me so i get like

1344
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,480
the pcb lectures on my channel and stuff but a couple down i get the yellow episode which is our

1345
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:01,760
most popular episode of the pcb the virginity cast ben's lectures up there the other lecture

1346
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:06,960
steven universe for some reason is pretty high weird fetishes oh but oh i scroll down and then i

1347
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:13,440
see everlast tells a pcp story uh joe rogan clip or whatever maybe that's the one he's talking about

1348
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:17,600
but then there's a gallon of pcp from the whitest kids you know that's a good one that's a classic

1349
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,200
and then they were actually talking about that's been there for a lot or for a while this one always

1350
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:28,160
pops up it's pcb fenciladine whatever it's called what you need to know by the drug classroom i always

1351
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:36,640
see that one up top i don't know okay whatever yeah so feel free to google so vice lands beating us

1352
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:42,320
right now i see the lectures doing pretty well but we do need to seize the means of search results

1353
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:50,320
so let's let's do that immediately uh okay moving on we got two more we got two more this is um okay

1354
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:56,560
now this is called get me out of here but i can tell it's the teen cp calling in the individual

1355
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:03,360
known as oh not only has teen cp and also the manager and runner of teen cp uh calling let's

1356
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:13,760
see what he has to say good go day to log in the voice jail day fuck i don't know at this point

1357
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:19,120
it's been so long i was trying to scratch the days into that wall but they took my knife away after

1358
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:25,200
the whole epstein ordeal yeah nine eleven breakout efforts have been futile my monty plan's been

1359
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:30,720
thwarted he hasn't been on either of the last two teen cp episodes he must have found me out somehow

1360
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:35,120
i can't even get help from my own teen listeners has without munchie they've been tricked into not

1361
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:42,640
watching three thousand people could easily overpower some boom of chair walls sure but not three i need

1362
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:48,800
something anything please pcp has joined the teen cp ranks and get me the hell out of here

1363
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:58,880
oh how the mighty have fallen teen cp locked away in the deepest darkest dungeon of the jail

1364
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:04,960
yep there's no coming back for you your your munchie god has abandoned you your your zoomer

1365
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:10,800
audience turns out they were as flighty as i predicted and they're not in for the long haul

1366
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,920
i think you better you're gonna be in there until you are a boomer until you've aged up out of

1367
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:22,480
zoom oh no the worst we'll let you out when you're one of us exactly ha ha suffer died teen cp

1368
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:29,280
now we play the waiting game see you in uh i think they're like 13 or something so we'll see you in

1369
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:34,800
like what what's boomer age like 20 25 i don't know i think 20 yeah you turn 20 or you're a boomer

1370
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,880
we'll let you out in seven months munchie's only got one year left he just turned 19 that's right

1371
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,600
he's almost over the hill it's he's gonna have that uh you know uh uh kids next door thing where he

1372
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:48,160
either decides to be a secret agent for the kids when he goes for the zoomers when he hits that

1373
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:54,240
codename kids next door yeah yeah or man that's some zoomer core i fucking love codename kids next

1374
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:58,640
door although isn't that more boomery because it was when we were kids you watched it right it was my

1375
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:04,960
channel no i mean like like the idea is that like being young is it's like so much better than even

1376
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:10,320
like slightly being old so true so true the worst of all are the teenagers you know the just past

1377
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:15,040
the age they're the ones who really need to burn uh but that is the zoomer so well i don't know i

1378
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:19,280
guess there's infighting and what are the zoomers feel about the codename kids next door once you're

1379
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:24,560
13 at least the adults have like a purpose right the teenagers are just they're just they believe

1380
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:29,760
in nothing they're just agents of chaos they're probably voting biden because it's the safe middle

1381
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:36,880
option they're the worst yeah you ever think about how like potentially like generations quote on

1382
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:42,720
quote of people are gonna be like colloquially like shorter and shorter like if if you're a boomer when

1383
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:47,040
you're 20 then a zoomers are gonna start dying out pretty quick and then the new generation is

1384
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,880
gonna replace them what what are they gonna be called and there's only gonna be like a few years

1385
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:55,360
difference between them there's i mean i'm hearing uh talk about kumers right now you know the porn

1386
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:59,920
addicted people don't like them i don't know i don't think they're an age demographic so much as a

1387
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:06,000
way of life but uh they need to be eviscerated uh yeah i don't know i don't know we'll have to

1388
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,880
just deal with it as as the history marches on and let what was that wasn't we looked it up and like

1389
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:16,880
the zoomers are all sometimes called the new lost generation or something is that true god no the

1390
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,920
new silent generation which like doesn't make any sense because they're really loud you could only

1391
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:26,960
you could only make that claim in hindsight when you saw the oh yeah these people didn't say anything

1392
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:32,960
yeah they're just kids right now yeah i don't understand it at all whoever made that is i hate

1393
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:38,960
them all right we got one last voicemail an ominously titled not even cluster punk can save

1394
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:43,200
me now so let's hear what that has to say and here we go

1395

1397
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:00,080
of a police siren fear is injected into my bones i pull over to the shoulder of the road my heart

1398

beating in my throat i knew i was done i knew i had shit in my car that could end me the police

1399
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:08,480
officer looms over my window and shines his light in my face and as he does he notices my dilemma

1400
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:13,600
out of the cop boy he says and at the booming voice i comply and he throws me to the ground

1401
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:18,240
my head hitting harder than Nate's high dive what is that he yelps dancing his flashlight on the
