1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's Ben Saint and it's Gibbontake.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You sound like you literally are recording while in bed, like on your side.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I wish, I feel, I'm a little, I don't know, this has been a week of like, totally, totally fucked up my sleep schedule.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I mean, the last two days, like I went to bed at like 5pm, and then I woke up at midnight, and then I worked until like 6am, and then I went to sleep again until like 4pm, and then I woke up, and it's been like that.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Weird and wacky.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's been weird and wacky, and I just took a 4 hour nap, and then I woke up, and it's 10, 20am.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It feels so bad. Like when that happens, sort of like the concept of days starts to blur, and you're like, what a, ugh.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Part of me enjoys feeling like there's no outside world, and I'm just in floating in space, and I just like, whenever I feel tired, is it light out? Is it dark out? I don't know.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Whenever I feel like it, I'll just go to bed for as long as my body feels like sleeping, and then I'll wake up and be awake for a while. What day is it? I don't know.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Part of me enjoys that feeling.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I feel uncomfortable when that happens. I like a structure that I can reliably be like, yes, today is this day, tomorrow will be tomorrow.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, physically I feel pretty bad right now. I'm also very, ugh, I'm sick and I'm sick and because I just had a, just right now, the reason why I'm like 10 minutes late is that I was, ugh.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:20,000
My roommates are like, who's going to take over the gas bill? Ben, do you want to be the one to take over the gas bill? No, I don't. I really don't want to do it.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But somebody's got to, and I'm going to get bullied into it. I have a bad feeling I'm going to get bullied.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Uh-oh.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I know, so, I mean, somebody's got to do it. Ugh, makes me sick. But, hey, speaking of being in space, I've been playing Outer Wilds.

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ah, pug, what do you think?

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It is pug. It's great. It's awesome. It's like if Spore was good.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If Spore, you know?

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, I can see that a little bit.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I mean, it doesn't have the creature creator, but it's got planetary exploration and all that.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is a bit spoilery, but I have managed to land on the quantum moon.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Nice.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I think I know, I've learned all three quantum lessons, so I think I know what I need to do when I go back there next time.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm not sure, but I'm not going to look it up. Admittedly, I did have to look up, I had to look up the solution to one of the quantum puzzles.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Uh, failed.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A little bit fail. A little bit fail. But I don't feel bad, because I never ever would have figured out that you have to use your probe scout to, like, observe the arch to keep it from moving.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That simply never occurred to me.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I believe, I believe in one of the temples. It teaches you that lesson.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, but I was just not getting it.

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You didn't get it? I thought, like, you had to, like, use your probe in that place.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, yes, and I didn't, and yes, and I could not think to do, I never thought to do it.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Lamau.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, I was, I was fucking around and I was like, Supernova is coming. I've spent my whole, I've spent this whole run fucking around in this temple.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And I, like, I can't catch this fucking arch, so I had to Google it and it was like, use your scouter.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Like, oh, fucking duh. But I never would have thought of it, because I never, I never used the scout.

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, the scout's very useful.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, I, I slept on the scout.

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Like, just for like, if you're in a cave, just shooting it on the walls, you can see what the hell's going on.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, I would basically never use it unless I got, like, a Ghost Matter warning, or I'm, I'm, I'm kicking myself because I never thought to shoot it into the dark bramble seeds.

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And so, like, now I have, first of all, I fucking, I hate the dark bramble. I hate the dark bramble so much.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm so glad. By the way, I think, I think, I think we should, like, like, this is a spoiler for outer worlds.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Put that before, because I want.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think I said that, didn't I?

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You did, but like, we didn't really make a big deal of it, and people probably weren't.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's important that you don't know anything about outer worlds, like mechanics before you play it.

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, a lot of it is, a lot of the joys in figuring it out. I haven't, that was like the one thing that I looked up was like, what do I do in this fucking temple?

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And I don't feel bad about it.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I remember there being, like, a log or a thing on the wall that says, like, an image of a quantum thing is the same as looking at it.

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And if you look away, it changes where it is.

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So I was like, yep, it definitely did hit, yep, it definitely gave me those hints and I just didn't get it.

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I just did not pick up on it. So that's, that's what happened there.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Talk about Dark Bramble, because I, it is the scariest worst place in the world.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Honestly, it's not as bad as I thought, like, what happens when you go into the Dark Bramble is basically the scariest thing I can imagine ever.

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's like literally the sort of thing that I'm scared to go to sleep because what if I have a nightmare about that?

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And yet, you know, the first time it happened, it wasn't that bad.

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I was just kind of like, whoa, okay.

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, you just sort of like resigned just, okay, I'm being eaten.

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, yeah, I saw the light, I saw it moving.

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was like, oh, it's moving. Oh, is it attached to something?

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And then the fish showed up and I'm like, oh boy, there it is.

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And only afterwards that I process, like, that was really scary, actually.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's just, it's the anticipation really, like when you actually see the fish, it's not like so bad.

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But like, when you're waiting for it, it's like, I'm going to cry.

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know how much of things you've learned.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So I'm trying not to like bring things up, but please keep telling me about your adventure.

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What did you, what did you find out first?

72
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You want me to talk about the Dark Bramble?

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, just talk about everything. Talk about anything.

74
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I've beaten the game, so I know what you could...

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think I'm like pretty far in.

76
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I definitely have more stuff that I haven't found in the Bramble.

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean, I found the guy playing his harmonica inside of the skeleton.

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I've found the escape pod and the graveyard.

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, and that's the really annoying thing is that I realized later that I did not think to throw a scouter into the little Bramble hole.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So I have to go back and I have to find the graveyard again and throw my scouter in.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah.

82
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Because I forgot, I didn't, at the time I had not realized you could do that.

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So I have to find that again.

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I found the big jellyfish frozen inside of the Bramble somewhere.

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So how did you find, what's his face, the harmonica?

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
How did I find him?

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

88
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I did use my scouter.

89
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The audio?

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, no, the scouter.

91
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I followed the signal.

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah.

93
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I followed the...

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I forget.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That was another thing.

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I have started using it more, but for a while I just never used the signal locator.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I was just winging it.

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I was just like, eh, I'll just blast off and just go wherever.

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's a great thing though.

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You fly around and merely observing how things work is knowledge that you gain that you can use later.

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah.

102
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
When I started using the, it's not called the oscilloscope, whatever.

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The one that gives you a little radar signal and it tells you which direction some signal is coming in.

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
When I started using that, that was how suddenly I figured out the quantum stones.

105
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I started finding the quantum stones and, oh wait, the other thing I had...

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Actually, no, I had to look up both things about the quantum stones.

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm so stupid, but I would never have figured it out.

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I would never, ever have figured out that you have to turn the lights off and the quantum stone changes location because you cease to observe it.

109
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I never would have figured that out.

110
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Did you get to the underground place that you learned that?

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes.

112
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes.

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But you didn't figure out to turn the light off?

114
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No.

115
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I found that cave and I was looking around in it and I was just like, okay.

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, I found that cave and I found the stone and then I just left.

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I was like, well, I found the stone and there was nothing there.

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Wasn't there writing to look?

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes, I found the writing and I read it and maybe somewhere in the writing it suggests like, oh yeah, I turned my lights off and the stone disappeared.

120
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But I just didn't get it.

121
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I just didn't think to turn my flashlight off because why would you ever turn your flashlight off?

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It is unintuitive, but like I've found that like paying close attention to the things you read is it does give you enough clues to figure out what to do next.

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah.

124
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Except for one part, but I don't know if you've got there yet.

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Do you want to give me a hint for what the part is and I'll tell you?

126
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's to do with the white hole transporters.

127
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, do you mean the tower?

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The towers?

129
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, the tower that falls through the black hole.

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh no, that's different.

131
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then no, I don't think I have seen what you're talking about.

132
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
White hole transporters?

133
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't even know what that is.

134
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

135
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's fine.

136
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I guess there's more to find then.

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There is more.

138
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So much.

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What have I found?

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I've seen the ash twin become completely naked and I figured out that it's some sort of hourglass that counts down to the supernova.

141
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What else is there?

142
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I think I've found most everything there is to find in the dark bramble.

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I did all the quantum stuff and I think I know everything I need to know about the quantum moon.

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I just haven't done it yet.

145
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I know the shrine on the quantum moon needs to be on the north pole.

146
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know how to get it there, but I think I have an idea.

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I found the guy on the Adlerock.

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've delved into all the old ruins, all the escape.

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I found the Sunless City, but I didn't get to fully explore it because the sand rose too fast.

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's a tricky one to get down quickly.

151
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You sort of have to remember based on landmarks where you're supposed to land your ship to get there as fast as possible.

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, that one's a little...

153
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Shit on the Ember Twin is a little annoying because once the sand's too high, it's like, well, nothing else to do.

154
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Did you get crushed by the rising sand?

155
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh, several times, several times, yeah.

156
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It makes a little squishy sound at the very end.

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, they're like...

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Poor gross, a little gross.

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, I actually find the Giant's Deep is almost as scary as the Bramble.

160
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Is there something about the Giant's Deep?

161
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
When I fall in the water, I'm scared to look down.

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, yeah, I was like that the first time.

163
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I crash landed on it and I'm like, oh my god, it's water.

164
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh my god, if I go underneath, is it going to be like Subnautica?

165
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Are the big demons going to come and grab me?

166
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I held my breath and I forced myself to look down and it seems like it's just jellyfish, so it seems like it's fine,

167
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
but it's still like, when I'm in the water, I'm just like...

168
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah.

169
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah.

170
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I first landed on Giant's Deep.

171
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It was big, it was green, I just flew there.

172
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I fell there by accident the first time and I'm like, oh shit, what the fuck?

173
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I can't even jump because there's double gravity.

174
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Double gravity is such a big planet, but I landed on one of the islands

175
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and I was just sort of looking around being like, okay, I don't know really what I'm doing,

176
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
just finding things, and then I just sort of, I was in space.

177
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh yes, the like, I haven't quite figured out what's going on with that.

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Is it like a tornado passes by and like, inside the eye of the tornado, there's no water and no atmosphere?

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Is that what that is?

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's quite funny.

181
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't know whether to just explain it to you.

182
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Up to you.

183
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I mean, if you think it's like a big spoiler that I...

184
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's not a big spoiler, it's just sort of like something that when you notice it, you're like, what?

185
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No, you can tell me because like, I've noticed it and I've been curious about it, but like...

186
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Okay.

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sure there's something going on.

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I just, I haven't...

189
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So...

190
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, just tell me, just tell me.

191
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah.

192
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The islands on Giant's Deep move around on the surface and the tornadoes also move around.

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah.

194
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And when an island connects to a tornado, the tornado...

195
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Would it throw it into space?

196
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It throws it into space.

197
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh my god.

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And then you're floating for half a second and then the gravity of Giant's Deep brings it back down.

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And the first time I happened, I had no idea what was happening.

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I thought I was going to die.

201
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It was the scariest thing that ever happened to me because I had no idea why I was in space and why there was no gravity.

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I looked around, I'm like, what?

203
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm going to...

204
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
My ship's down there.

205
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm going to die.

206
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And then I fell back down.

207
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah.

208
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah.

209
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay.

210
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And it's funny because like if you leave your ship on an island, sometimes you can see like your ship's like location.

211
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If the island that it's on gets blasted up, you can just see like, oh, it's like six kilometers away now.

212
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh, and it's falling.

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That is...

214
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

215
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was talking to...

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't remember any of the astronauts' names, but I was talking to the astronaut on that planet.

217
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I think that's Gabbro on that one.

218
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That sounds right.

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah, I was talking to Gabbro and it had happened before.

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So like I knew that sometimes I just ended up in space and I didn't understand why.

221
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But I was talking to Gabbro and I hear like a rushing sound start and I'm like, oh shit, it's coming.

222
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And then it happens and it's like, and suddenly I'm in space and Gabbro just like floats off of his hammock.

223
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah.

224
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And he's just floats and then I'm like, I can't talk to him anymore.

225
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He's too far away, but I don't want to like jump because I'll like, I'll end up in space.

226
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah.

227
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And a couple seconds later, it like crashes down and he fell back into the hammock and I'm like, okay, we can proceed as well.

228
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And he doesn't even remark upon it.

230
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, he's just like, he's very used to it.

231
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
All the astronauts are so...

232
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I know this is kind of the point, but they're all just like so comfortable in these like fucking unnerving and like scary situations.

233
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
They're all just hanging out, playing harmonica.

234
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
All of these planets and places are like extremely beautiful and like the sound design is really immersive,

235
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
especially with all the like, you know, when you put your helmet on, you can hear yourself breathing when you're in space.

236
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can only hear yourself breathing and stuff like that.

237
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And it makes it extremely scary when you're going into the unknown and you don't know what's happening.

238
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And then there's the familiar like, oh, you can roast a marshmallow around a little campfire every so often.

239
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's really nice.

240
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Haven't roasted a marshmallow since like the very first time I booted the game up.

241
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I've only did that once.

242
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I gotta say I was pretty disappointed the first time I like jumped in my ship and like chased down that blue thing.

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You know what I mean?

244
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That the rocket, the rocket blows up and it throws that little blue thing.

245
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh, yes.

246
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I found it and I'm like, yes, I found it.

247
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, like the whole game, every time you start, you see this rocket explode and this blue thing fires out and I'm like, well, I gotta catch it.

248
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And it's quite hard to find it because you can't like, you can't autopilot lock onto it.

249
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So I really had to finesse it, but I finally got it.

250
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And then I'm just like, oh, it doesn't do anything.

251
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know what it is.

252
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's interesting because I've always seen that and I always thought like it's probably going way too fast and I can't click on it.

253
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I can't like track it.

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, it is going fast.

255
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So I didn't even try.

256
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I didn't even try to find them.

257
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, sometimes I noticed that sometimes it shoots out with a trajectory that brings it closer to shit.

258
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What's the home planet called?

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Timberhearth?

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Timberhearth, yeah.

261
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, sometimes it fires out and it like kind of passes near Timberhearth and it looks bigger.

262
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And I'm like, no, it's a thing in space.

263
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Like you can, I think I could catch it theoretically and yeah, you can, but it just doesn't really do anything.

264
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's very easy.

265
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's very easy to overshoot it.

266
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh man, to me at this moment, the ultimate boss of the game is landing on the fucking sun station.

267
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I tried like seven or eight times to land on the sun station and it's hard.

268
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That, yeah.

269
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'd never tried it that way.

270
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm sure it can be done.

271
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm sure it can as well.

272
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It is just, it's a little toasty over there.

273
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a little toasty and like you can't get that close to the sun without it pulling you in.

274
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So like in theory, you need to one shot it and I think it would work out fine if you like,

275
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:05,000
if you sort of got near ish to the sun and sort of started accelerating towards it and you kind of like move to the side and you sort of built up like

276
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
side angular momentum.

277
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So you were sort of orbiting the sun at kind of the same rate that the station was.

278
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I think that would make it easier.

279
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's just, it's very hard to do that because the way that the controls work,

280
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
to match the speed of the sun, it kind of automatically kills your angular momentum.

281
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes, it's to match the speed of the sun orbiting around itself.

282
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So you just sort of step and start being pulled towards it.

283
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah, you can.

284
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You have to do it totally manually if you want to do that.

285
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, you have to do it totally manually.

286
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And I try to do it and it's either I like lose my angular momentum and I just fall into the sun or I like go too far in sort of trying to build up angular momentum.

287
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And I end up sort of like shooting past the sun and sort of like a comet like, you know, my orbit goes way wide to one side and then I have to like get close again.

288
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So I have not managed to land on the goddamn sun station.

289
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sure I will have to go there at some point, but it's really hard.

290
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, I think you can go everywhere.

291
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I think I don't think there's anywhere that's like impossible to get to.

292
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, some places are difficult to get to if you wait too long.

293
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah, because the, I mean, on Ember Twin, you mean on Ember Twin, I think there's one or trying to say there's a few things.

294
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay, okay.

295
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I still have no idea what's going on, unlike the inside of Ash Twin.

296
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I thought that the supernova was coming from Ash Twin.

297
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Like I thought that like when the ash all drains off, whatever was down at the bottom of Ash Twin is what is like exploding.

298
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But no, it's the it's the sun going supernova.

299
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And when the ash all drains off, I can see it's funny.

300
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
In the minds on Timber Hearth, you can read notes about how they're mining the ore to, you know, build the shell around whatever is on Ash Twin.

301
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah.

302
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And it's made of the same like starry looking rock.

303
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And it's like, oh yeah, they really did it.

304
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So yeah, it drains off and it's just like some kind of rock shell around whatever it is.

305
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And like, I don't know. I don't know what's going on with that.

306
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And there must be a way to get inside, but I don't know what it is.

307
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah, been on the quantum moon.

308
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I think what I have to do is I have to go back to the quantum moon and I have to turn the lights off and let that move the station around or something.

309
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Gotta do something with that.

310
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Assume that will bring me to the eye of the universe, whatever that is.

311
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So that's that's probably next on next on my to-do list.

312
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What have you seen about Brittle Hollow?

313
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, Brittle Hollow.

314
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, well, I've been to the Hanging City.

315
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Actually, that was one of the last things that I found the last time I played was, yeah, I had to wait until the tower fell through the black hole and then find it out in space near the white hole.

316
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And that happens right at the end.

317
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Once it goes through, you have like a minute to go and find the tower and learn the last quantum lesson or whatever.

318
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I know there's the Hanging City.

319
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I've been there a little bit.

320
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I think I have more to explore there.

321
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I've jumped through some of the rings that like teleport you through the tractor beams.

322
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Other than that, I found the guy.

323
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I found the astronaut on Brittle Hollow.

324
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think I haven't really explored Brittle Hollow very thoroughly, to be honest.

325
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I think I need to get there like early and find some stuff there before it falls through the hole.

326
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's interesting that I've noticed the meteors from the little moon.

327
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah, the Hollow Lantern.

328
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
They destroy things kind of randomly.

329
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So like sometimes a bridge that's useful to get to the Hanging City will fall immediately and you have to find the long way around.

330
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But other times it will fall much later.

331
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, I know that pieces of Brittle Hollow just kind of fall into the black hole.

332
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I did notice that the lantern kind of throws meteors down onto it.

333
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I thought there might be some connection like the meteors break pieces off, but I wasn't sure.

334
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,000
If you shoot your probe onto a piece of land, it'll tell you how close it is to falling.

335
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah, the structural integrity or something.

336
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I did do that with the tower and I saw that structural integrity was getting lower and lower as it got closer to falling.

337
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's annoying.

338
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's annoying that pieces just fall.

339
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh, it was on Ember Twin that I went and I found the, I think it's called the Gravity Cannon, the thing that shoots the probe out.

340
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Gravity Cannon?

341
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah, it's like a big mesh tube looking structure.

342
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh, right, like a launch pad thing.

343
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah, like I went down there just to see what it was about and I was like, okay, it does a little probe thing and it shoots the probe thing out.

344
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Okay, gotcha.

345
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And then right behind it, there's like a sign that's like Sunless City this way, but there's just like a cactus in the way.

346
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And it's like, I cannot, it's an impassable obstacle.

347
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Unfortunately, the Sunless City is blocked by a cactus, so.

348
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Gotta go the long way around.

349
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Gotta go the long way around.

350
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Oh well.

351
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think what else I've discovered.

352
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh, I mean, I found the dark bramble seed on Timber Hearth.

353
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It took me many times visiting it before I had, you know what, I think it was while I was reading how do I solve the frickin' quantum puzzle.

354
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I think something in there jogged me to try shooting the probe into the dark bramble seed and then I'm like, oh, okay, gotcha, gotcha.

355
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So now I have to go back and I have to try that again in the, what are the aliens called?

356
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Like the old?

357
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The Nomai.

358
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The Nomai grave.

359
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I have to go back and I have to try it at the dark bramble seed at the Nomai grave.

360
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Because I know there's like a bunch of different seeds that have the same.

361
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Well that seed on Timber Hearth has the harmonica sounds coming out of it.

362
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Because I guess it connects to a place near where, what's his name is playing, the harmonica.

363
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And there's some other sound coming out of the seed that the Nomai grave is around.

364
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And I guess it's because it's near their ship, like it connects to a seed that landed near their ship.

365
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So I have to investigate that.

366
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Oh, I went to, like the first thing I did, I think like the very first thing I did was I landed on the interloper.

367
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, the comet?

368
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah, because I saw the comet was going by and I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, there's a comet?

369
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Like that's weird.

370
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
All these planets look boring.

371
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You can check out this comet.

372
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I should like maybe go back and investigate it again because yeah, that was the first thing I landed on.

373
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And I found, oh, I found the ship like frozen on the far side of it.

374
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And I don't really remember, I remember there was cryptic messages.

375
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I don't really remember what they said.

376
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Later, I think it's on the quantum moon?

377
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
No, in one of the gravity cannons, either there's one on Timber Hearth and one on Brittle Hollow.

378
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
In one of them, you can like recall that probe from the interloper.

379
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yes, and then you can go inside.

380
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yes, and I did that.

381
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So I found it on the interloper and then later I used the gravity cannon and I summoned it.

382
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And I don't know, I don't think I found anything else on the interloper, but maybe I should check it out again.

383
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
What a game.

384
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm glad you like it.

385
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I like it a lot.

386
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, it's really cool.

387
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
How'd you rate the space travel?

388
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Space travel is, it can be a little annoying, but when it's annoying, it's usually like my own fault.

389
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Like it's my fault that I decided to spend a long time trying and failing to land on the sun station.

390
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's my fault that I spend a long time trying to catch up to that stupid little blue thing.

391
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Game didn't make me do that, so I can't hold it against the game.

392
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But oh my God, I think like there was one time I crashed into something.

393
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I think it might have been like pieces around the white hole.

394
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And it disabled my autopilot and it disabled some of my thrusters.

395
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So like I was no longer able to like fly straight.

396
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And that sucks so bad.

397
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Have you ever tried to like get out of your ship in the middle of space and like repair it and then get back in?

398
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yes, I think that is what I ended up doing that time.

399
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's very annoying.

400
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Sometimes I'll like get out and then I'll have to like be like, shit, I can't find where I'm supposed to repair.

401
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And then I have to go inside, sit down at the cockpit, look at the like ship diagram to see like where is the damage.

402
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Then like, okay, I'm gonna go back outside.

403
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You know what I haven't tried to do? I have not tried to leave the ship in like an inhospitable environment without my suit on.

404
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I assume I would die.

405
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I haven't tried to do it.

406
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I mean you'd die if you can't breathe, if there's no oxygen.

407
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:49,000
If I like went out in space and I didn't put my suit on and I opened the hatch, would I like die instantly? Would I get sucked out?

408
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You wouldn't get sucked out. I think you would. I've seen it happen.

409
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Actually, I don't, I think I must have done it once because I was getting frustrated with this thing like, oh, fucking.

410
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I think it was probably in between trying to get into the city quickly and I'm like, okay, go, go, go, go, go, land, land, land, land, get out.

411
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Oh, I didn't put my suit on. You just sort of walk around for a bit and you can hear him like struggling to breathe and then his eyes close.

412
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I assume it varies based on which planet you're on. Maybe some of them you die faster than others.

413
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Maybe. I wouldn't want to try it because it's so morbid.

414
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah, it's funny. So many of the planets have trees that give you oxygen.

415
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Most of them have at least some place where like trees have successfully grown and there's oxygen that you can breathe, which is surprising.

416
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But it's okay. I can suspend my disbelief about that.

417
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, it's just sort of like an easy respite sort of moment.

418
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah, because sometimes like you're traveling on a planet and you have to be away from your ship for a long time, there's no oxygen.

419
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So you will just run out unless there's a little place where you can rest and get some more.

420
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, when I was finding, I was following the Nomai like writing towards the Sunless City and there's the little like part where they're like, there's trees over here.

421
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Like you can go refill your air over here, but like be quick about it because like the sand is falling and it's like, yeah, it's true.

422
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm trying to think. I know that like the Nomai all really want, they want to find the eye of the universe.

423
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I don't know why. I don't know like what it's supposed to do, just that like they all, they seem to want it.

424
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, there's hints around in some things that it's just sort of like they're a very curious race.

425
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And they found this amazingly impossible thing. So like, we got to find this and sort of like I get it.

426
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
A parallel to you as the player being an explorer.

427
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, and I know, and I know, yeah, I know the Quantum Moon goes there. It's the sixth location.

428
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I made myself Sapa playing it for a little while because I wanted to work on my stupid video some more.

429
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So that's why I have unexplored territory.

430
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
No, it's a great game. I'm glad you recommended it to me. It's really awesome.

431
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Hell yeah.

432
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yeah.

433
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:55,000
When you finish it, I'd love to talk a little more in-depth about like things because I'm holding my breath and being like, ah, ah, I can't say anything.

434
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So I assume the end is when I reach the eye of the universe. I guess I'll know when I, you seem to know like there's a definitive end.

435
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So I assume I will also eventually know what the end is.

436
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
There's technically like three or four endings, but they're not like obvious as endings.

437
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
They're just sort of like, when you find the ending, it's very obvious that it's the end.

438
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah, okay.

439
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Now, I definitely haven't noticed that.

440
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah, the whole like, it's surprisingly, you know, it's nice that they give you a little, you know, a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

441
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,100
They give you autopilot options and they give you the like match speed options.

442
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,100
Without those, it would be so annoying.

443
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,700
The match speed is what I like using the autopilot I found doesn't know when to start slowing down properly.

444
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:22,000
If like the if the thing is like, if if I'm clicking on dark brown below something and it's like going away from me or if it's coming towards me, it'll be sort of the autopilot would like stop at the same time every time.

445
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,100
And so it wouldn't always work.

446
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,500
Yeah, just do manual.

447
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,000
I kind of like how it controls manually.

448
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's sort of an enjoyable experience.

449
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:39,700
And if everything's going all like tits up, I just press the A button until I'm like in lockstep with the thing going around the sun.

450
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,400
I like and get my bearings.

451
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,700
The match speed button is basically the like if you're on a planet, it's basically like the stop moving button.

452
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,500
Yeah, like if you're if I don't know if you're getting tossed around like a rag doll or something.

453
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:59,500
Match speed is like just slow down, make everything stop spinning.

454
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,800
Yeah, autopilot can fuck you over.

455
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:11,400
Like I did end up falling into the sun a couple of times because the autopilot because the sun just happened to be between me and whatever I was.

456
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,300
Yes, yes.

457
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,400
That's the sort of thing it does.

458
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,200
It's like a mile.

459
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,300
Oh, the thing you want to get to is straight through the suns as crow flies as the space crow.

460
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,400
It can it can it can it can just put you in the sun.

461
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,300
It can.

462
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,500
Yeah, it can sort of undercompensate for like the fact that like the thing is already coming at you.

463
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:44,800
If it can it sort of fails to account for like like like like the twins are orbiting each other.

464
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,100
So like you'll match one, but like the other one will still be kind of like spinning around.

465
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,800
It'll be spinning around like like bonk you on the head.

466
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,400
Yeah, yeah.

467
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,500
I use the autopilot if I'm like really far away from something.

468
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:04,800
Like I think I was out by like the white hole and I'm like, okay, well, I want to go to Brittle Hollow and like, okay, well, it's right there.

469
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,900
So I don't want to like fly there myself.

470
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,800
So I use the autopilot and I went and I took a pee.

471
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,400
I was mostly there by the time I came back.

472
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,700
Yes.

473
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,800
So sometimes it works.

474
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:32,200
Uh, yeah, but when you when you described it, I thought there was like a lot of like, okay, you really got to like align your trajectories and like not really the the game.

475
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:39,200
The game pretty much gives you the option to there's basically an align trajectories button, which just makes it pretty painless.

476
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,000
So it's a lot of fun though.

477
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:55,200
It is I I've I think without like all of the cool gravity stuff and the space flight, it would it would be a little more like run of the mill.

478
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:10,400
Yeah, something or other all of the all of the cool space, you know, the quantum stuff and the the gravity and the sort of the spherical planets that you can just walk along and you can just it feels weird that

479
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,900
the sun is so big and feels so close, but you actually fly there and it's a lot further away, even though it's not as far away as it really should be.

480
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,600
Yeah.

481
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:24,700
But it's like it's it's it's like you can just sit on the on a planet and just watch stuff happening.

482
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,600
And it's like, wow.

483
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:32,300
Yeah, you just watch you can just watch the Adler rock like go between you and the sun.

484
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,500
And it's like, oh, yeah, the shadow on you as it flies past.

485
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,900
Yeah, you can you can win like.

486
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,700
When like, yeah, you can see like it goes from day to night because like the planet occludes the sun.

487
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,800
It's like, oh, yeah.

488
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:47,800
Hmm.

489
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,500
Celestial phenomena.

490
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,400
There they go.

491
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,900
So cool.

492
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,600
Made me I don't know.

493
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:06,200
I saw a an article on I think it was on Twitter about how like I guess they proved.

494
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,100
Oh, they proved some quantum shit recently.

495
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,100
They proved what is it that like the universe is not quote unquote locally real.

496
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,400
Now that sounds interesting.

497
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,300
What does that mean?

498
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:27,500
It I I was very frustrated because the article explaining it only let me read the first bit and then it was pay walled.

499
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:33,000
So I didn't get I didn't get to read the full explanation near as I can tell it.

500
00:39:34,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I think they like they prove they experimentally confirmed Bell's theorem and it's something about quantum entanglement and like basically like the the fact that like a wave form is not collapsed until it is observed and something something quantum entanglement like there were predictions made based on that and they have like experimentally verified like yes, the predictions were accurate.

501
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,400
Entanglement is real.

502
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,700
The wave form fucking weird.

503
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,400
Yeah.

504
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:15,600
It's like like I obviously have not looked into quantum physics any with any like real depth.

505
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:31,400
Just the the the you know the sentence something doesn't really exist in any like like measure like unless it's observed isn't really exist or yeah you can't it doesn't act the way it would unless you're looking at it.

506
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,400
Well, what?

507
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:43,400
Yeah, my mind but I mean but I mean it's only it's only at like it's only at quantum scales that that is like ever really true though.

508
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:51,400
It's just so funny like it seems like magic that if you if there's an eyeball on it it's doing something different as soon as you look away.

509
00:40:51,400 --> 00:41:03,200
Well, it's you know it sounds really spooky and like it would be spooky if it were if it were like acting that way at like macroscopic scales like on like everyday objects that we experience but like.

510
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:19,000
The fact that it only the fact that like quantum phenomena is only happening at like you know angstrom scale things of that size 10 to the negative 10 meters meters wide it's like.

511
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:31,400
What's what's even going on with that shit anyway you know like stuff stuff that size is like so far out of our experience that like oh it acts weird like oh it acts spooky like well.

512
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:40,400
What else is new I don't know it's it's all it's already like fucking fucking bizarre.

513
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:49,800
You know sure you know it's just it's just I don't know what observing how that acts on something to make it.

514
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:59,800
Yeah different yeah there's um I was always a little confused about that like what like what counts as observing.

515
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:09,200
Like you take a picture of it or you get video like some sort of interference that you can measure in some way.

516
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,200
Like oh like waveforms you can see this or that.

517
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:23,200
I think I tried to I think I tried to ask a professor or to this about this in college and I never really got.

518
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,600
I mean I'm not sure if I never got a satisfactory explanation or maybe I just never understood the explanation properly but like.

519
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:41,600
It's it's it's a yeah like like like okay does it's not it's not about like human understanding right it's not the fact that like a human understands.

520
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:48,600
The state of a of a of a of a pot particle that like collapses its waveform.

521
00:42:49,600 --> 00:43:07,000
I think it's about like its interactions with other things like if it if it passes through like a wire loop and it creates an electric current by doing so like that is the sort of event that like collapses its waveform and like confirms what state it was in.

522
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:13,000
I think I think it's like it's only after the fact do you know what it was doing.

523
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:30,400
Something yeah well it was well it was not doing it was not it was neither doing that nor not doing it before it was in a superposition of doing it and not doing it until it happens and then an observable effect occurs you know it it creates the current.

524
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,400
And then it's like okay.

525
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:43,800
But you know it just sort of it makes me feel like it's on some level existence is like as a personality and it just decides certain yeah it.

526
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,800
I don't know if I don't know because to me I guess what I always wondered was like hang on.

527
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,800
If it's just about like if like if a particle can have an interaction with like other particles.

528
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:04,200
Or it can have an interaction with its environment and it's that interaction that like causes it to collapse its waveform.

529
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:16,200
Then like surely it's interacting with with its environment all the time right like every particle with mass is having a gravitational effect.

530
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:30,600
Or any particle with charge is having an electromagnetic effect and they're like shouldn't ever isn't every particle constantly interacting with every other particle by like these.

531
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:44,600
These forces so like why why isn't everything's waveform collapsing all the time because like to charge particles are constantly you know affecting one another's trajectories.

532
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,000
So I never I never quite got it.

533
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah commenter commenter commenters please explain the quantum quantum entanglement to me is it like this was a question I never I never quite understood how this worked.

534
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:06,000
Is it like they don't exist in the same way in time that we experience like time linearly.

535
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,000
Do you know about them.

536
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh fuck.

537
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,000
Shit what are they called.

538
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,000
Hang on.

539
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:21,000
Like it's very obviously different from Schrodinger's cat like always the cat alive or dead.

540
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,000
Well the cat is alive or dead.

541
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:29,000
It's just that we don't know the quantum is like it was neither or is neither until you look at it.

542
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,000
It could be both.

543
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,000
Damn it fuck what are the I'm okay the double slit experiment.

544
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,000
Yeah the double slit experiment is the experiment.

545
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,400
They shoot electrons through and they can they observe it being in two places at once.

546
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,400
Well it was photons.

547
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,400
It was photons first and then was it was it the bell.

548
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:12,400
Basically yeah you shoot the photons through the double slit experiment and they give a pattern the result of photons going through the double slit gives a wave pattern that but that was expected because we knew that wave the photons and light had a wave formation.

549
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,400
The spooky thing was then they tried it with electrons and they found the same wave form and it's like well what the fuck why is that happening.

550
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,400
And the reason why is because the electrons are also waves but they're waves of probability.

551
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,400
And it's it's it's not it's not like like the light the light has a wave pattern of amplitudes that was constructively and destructively interfering with itself.

552
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:54,800
The electrons had the same thing but it's not about their amplitude and like their intensity or whatever it's about their the probability of where they are which was like the what what the fuck is that.

553
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,400
I just don't get it.

554
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:08,400
I mean it's it's it's elementary it's simple it's it's literally just this it's literally just that a particle does not have a location.

555
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:23,400
What it has instead is a wave in space and that wave represents where it is likely to be and when you measure its location it will be somewhere and that wave defines where it is likely to be.

556
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,800
But it's but it but until it's measured it exists across the entire wave.

557
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:40,200
So it's like it's like a big old cloud of electron but when you take a picture of it it's just a tiny dot on one part of the image.

558
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:50,200
Yes yes yes yes it becomes the dot after you take the picture but before that it was smeared it was smeared across space in a probability distribution.

559
00:47:51,200 --> 00:48:05,600
See what that implies to me is that like it is not like traveling through time the same way like it like it's at any one amount of time or whatever it's in all places.

560
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,200
Why is it why is a measure and a measurement is just a single number.

561
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:21,600
It's like it's not it's not all places it is it's in a superposition of all places you fool completely different.

562
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:39,600
Well hey whatever at least I didn't need to look up the quantum stuff in outer while the Davison it was the Davison experiment I think is what they called when they fire the electrons at the double slit and no young's was young's experiment that was like.

563
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,600
They observed oh the same sort of wave phenomena as a photon but with electrons.

564
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,600
Shit I was gonna say something I was oh you ever seen.

565
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:05,600
You ever seen okay you know about you know Adams they draw them with like oh it looks like a solar system there's the nucleus at the middle and then there's the orbiting electrons around but you know that's not really what they look like.

566
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah that's the illustration for the explanation.

567
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:32,000
But the the the electron is just sort of like like a big C cloud of charge and it's and like the reason why you know you look at those those you look at those freaking like graphs and they have all these like weird crazy like lumpy shapes you know what I mean.

568
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:44,400
Hang on hang on I think they're called valence clouds I think I saw a YouTube video trying to explain why orbital electrons do that.

569
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:55,200
They have I mean something like this like fucking my internet is being weird again there yeah yeah yeah.

570
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:13,400
Yes I think I did see like a YouTube video trying to like express these things in like 3D modeling to make it more understandable I don't remember who did that and I can't think it made sense to me but well I've seen these before.

571
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:25,600
Okay you ever all right you know how if you hold a rope at two ends and you shake it you can get it to like do you know what I'm talking about if I say like a harmonic.

572
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:36,600
Like well you know what you're well you know about music you know about like how a how a string and you know about how it can vibrate a different harmonics right like it can vibrate.

573
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,600
Is that different from frequencies.

574
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,800
It's related.

575
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:52,800
Like I know that on a single guitar string there are like different sounds that make up a single note.

576
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,800
Yes like I think harmonics.

577
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:07,800
Yes well you can you can have well you can you can shake the same string you can shake it at different frequencies but only at a limited number of frequencies and that represents like the different.

578
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,800
It's the same note at different octaves.

579
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:21,800
Look at look at look at this image behold behold this image you know what I'm looking yes you can shake a string.

580
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:32,600
And you can you can you can shake the string and you can shake it so that it like the wave in the string is like fat in one spot or two spots or three spots.

581
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,800
Why not for.

582
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:42,000
Well you could do for to but the point is you can't you can't have a fraction right you can't have you can't have two and a half you can't have one and a half.

583
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,000
It has to be like a whole number has to end at the same spot.

584
00:51:46,800 --> 00:52:02,000
Yes yes yes yes that it yeah okay well all right so like that's that's true of like waves on a string it's also true of like electron position probability waves.

585
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:24,200
So this is this this image right here this is like the theoretically most simplistic model for what's for solving the Schrodinger equation is imagine you had an electron that could only exist in one dimension like in a straight line and you put it in a box with infinite potential energy on both sides.

586
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:32,400
And it could only travel like in one direction up and down in the straight line inside of this box and it can't go outside these these walls.

587
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:53,400
And if you put an elective theoretically if you put an electron in that situation it has to bounce between these walls and it bounces in in these harmonics like it has like depending on how much energy you give it it has these same wave patterns it has like one one wave or two or two wave or three wave and it has to have a whole number.

588
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:02,400
Just like waves on a string and that wave is like its position it's the superposition of its of where it might be if you measure its position.

589
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:16,400
And it and it the reason why the electron cloud around these hydrogen wave functions these atomic orbitals the reason why an atom looks all weird and lumpy like these hydrogen waves is because.

590
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:24,600
I mean if you take that box and you just make it a sphere you make it a spherical well.

591
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:45,600
It just when you when you solve for those wave shapes and you put it in a spherical well as in the case of an electron orbiting around a an atom that it is electromagnetically attracted to just when you solve for the wave shapes they look like this they look like these weird like.

592
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Curvy lumpy lines and that's why atoms are all weird and lumpy looking that's why they have weird clouds around them.

593
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:07,600
I I so you see it I mean I mean just imagine this okay you you you pluck a string and it and it shakes and it has waves in it right.

594
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:15,600
Well now take that string and instead of being a straight line curve it around so it's a loop.

595
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,600
And then a ring yes and then imagine imagine like twanging it so it's vibrating.

596
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,600
And now the and now the waves are like going around the loop in a circular pattern.

597
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:43,600
And then now imagine you okay well instead of just a one dimensional string around a circle make it three dimensional make it a spherical membrane and then you like twang it and it vibrates right and now the waves are in 3D but they still have to like.

598
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:50,600
They have to follow you know the shape of the membrane and I mean that's basically what's going on with electrons orbiting.

599
00:54:51,600 --> 00:55:04,600
Yes basically I mean more or less yeah I mean well then I'm stuck on like imagining twanging a spherical objects that waves like where does it start and end.

600
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,600
Well did you ever in gym class did you ever play with like that big like parachute.

601
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:32,600
Yeah I mean you can imagine I mean it's hard to it would be difficult to like solve the wave function but you can imagine like a three dimensional or a two dimensional membrane like kind of wiggling and vibrating right in sort of the same way as a string does.

602
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:42,600
Like if I take a ruler and I held it at both ends and you know like a plastic ruler and I can bend it down and up that's like a wave form.

603
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,600
Right you I'm trying to imagine it because I can't I can't do it in 3D.

604
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:58,600
I mean I mean yeah you can't it's hard to like really get like a clear image of like exactly what it looks like because it you know wave form goes up and down.

605
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:06,600
And there are two like on this diagram here with the ends there are two ends to it but on a sphere where do the ends go.

606
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:15,600
Well I mean what's what's the beginning and the end of the wave does it all just shrink and grow like it just vibrates up and like the entire thing gets smaller and bigger.

607
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:21,600
I think it probably looks something like I mean you know when you're blowing bubbles right.

608
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:27,600
You ever make like a big bubble and like you form the bubble and it's kind of like wiggling.

609
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,600
Sure yeah yeah I mean I think it would probably look like that.

610
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,600
Okay the surface of the bubble is just kind of wiggling.

611
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
Is this what it was like being taught by Ben St.

612
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,600
I guess.

613
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:51,600
I guess so probably that's why I got fired.

614
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,600
Mr. St. I'm fucking I hate science I don't get it.

615
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:08,600
Just just imagine just picture the wiggling bubble just just think just picture the form the bubble in your mind now make the surface wiggle now solve Schrodinger's equation.

616
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Everybody get out your bubble blowing equipment.

617
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:22,600
That would have been a cool thing if a science teacher came out it's like all right here's an atom he blows a bubble and everyone was like oh look at that.

618
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:32,600
I mean I mean I never had it explained to me that way I'm just I'm just trying to think like how I think about it and I mean that seems like a.

619
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:45,600
When I that makes sense to me to explain it that way I mean it's the reality is more complicated because in addition because what do you say.

620
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:56,600
The electron does not actually exist in a two dimensional spherical membrane it can also move in and out so it's actually like a three dimensional cloud shape right.

621
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:08,600
But I mean you imagine going from a one dimensional string to a two dimensional spherical membrane and it's like OK that's one step and then if you wanted to make it even more complicated then you would.

622
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:20,600
Excess not exacerbate not elaborate extrapolate you know extrapolate than one more dimension into a three dimensional spherical well.

623
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,600
Three dimensional I thought the bubble is three dimensional.

624
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,600
Yeah I mean it is because it's in.

625
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,600
OK OK but that's curved yeah but imagine if.

626
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
When I say three dimensional like.

627
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:45,600
OK but but if you're imagining the bubble the bubble then it's only a 2D or it's a flat plane even though it's curved.

628
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:56,600
But I mean the the the atom the electron is not limited to just traveling along you know a spherical surface it can also go in and out.

629
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,600
You ever see.

630
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,600
You ever see like a like a.

631
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,600
Like a picture of space and then there and it's like a grid and you put like.

632
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,600
An object.

633
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,600
Yeah and it forms like a like a pit like it falls into a hole.

634
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
You know what I mean yeah.

635
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
Like a black hole.

636
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
Gravity.

637
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
Yeah curves space time around itself.

638
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,600
Yeah well I mean that's just that's like a two dimensional representation.

639
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,600
But like actually the gravity is not in 2D it's in 3D.

640
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,600
Like the curve is more complicated than just the flat plane.

641
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:37,600
So it's like that it's like there's there's we're representing it in 2D.

642
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,600
But actually there's a third dimension.

643
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,600
But it's just it's just hard it's like too hard to visualize.

644
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,600
Nods.

645
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,600
Nods to self.

646
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,600
Nods.

647
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
Nods to self.

648
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,600
Outer wilds.

649
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,600
Outer wilds baby.

650
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,600
So what I'm saying so what I'm saying is that if you stand on top of an electron and you turn your flashlight off.

651
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,600
When you turn it back on you'll be somewhere else.

652
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,600
You'll be on the other side of the atom.

653
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,600
True.

654
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,600
Yeah I.

655
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,600
I think I think I've made a lot of product.

656
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,600
I think I played it for about a week.

657
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,600
I've been playing it on and off for about a week and change.

658
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,600
And I haven't played it in a few days because I've been crunching on my stupid video.

659
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:34,600
But as soon as the video is done I'll probably jump back into that and finish up.

660
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
Some more stuff.

661
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
Can't wait.

662
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
Yeah.

663
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,600
I should have had the video done by now.

664
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,600
But it's becoming it's becoming more and more torturous to work on it.

665
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,600
I hate it more and more every time.

666
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,600
So I'm dealing with that.

667
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,600
You know what's the worst part about it is the audio levels.

668
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,600
Because I was talking into the microphone.

669
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,600
So there is times when I'm not talking as directly into the microphone and I.

670
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:14,600
I've been going through the clips and I try to adjust the audio a bit here and there to like make the quiet parts louder and the loud parts quieter and just try and.

671
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,600
Keep it as even as I can.

672
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,600
And there's parts where it gets really finicky and like I have to make adjustments like every few seconds.

673
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,600
Parts weren't that like compressing the audio.

674
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
Compressing helped.

675
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,600
Compressing helped but it didn't like.

676
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:43,600
There's still I mean imagine me standing in front of a whiteboard and I'm talking at the camera and I'm speaking into the microphone.

677
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,600
And then I turn around to look at the board and now I'm not speaking into the mic anymore.

678
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,600
And now it's like quiet and muted.

679
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,600
And then I turn back around and I start speaking to the mic again and then back and I look away and then back and I look towards it.

680
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:04,600
And there's parts where like I'm doing that for a while and every time that happens like I try to like OK I'm going to try and boost the.

681
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,600
Boost the quiet part boost the quiet part and I'll have to cut it up into pieces.

682
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,600
I don't know maybe there's a more efficient way to do it.

683
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,600
But I'm like I did compress and normalize the audio and it did help and it made it more listenable.

684
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,600
But there's still parts that like benefit from a little manual boosting here and there.

685
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,600
It's just tedious.

686
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,600
Yeah.

687
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,600
I think.

688
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,600
You know when you're doing a long video.

689
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,600
Like that.

690
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,600
Yeah.

691
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,600
I mean this is just me.

692
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,600
But I would just I would do as little touching up as I could.

693
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,600
If my if I'm literally unintelligible then I should I would go in.

694
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,600
Maybe like add text if it's like the mic just cut out or just really just can't hear me.

695
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:01,600
But like going through like a multi hour thing micromanaging the levels.

696
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Yeah.

697
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,600
That's a lot.

698
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:11,600
There's there's debt there's definitely diminishing returns and I'm trying I'm trying not to get too hung up on it because like no matter.

699
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,600
Yeah.

700
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,600
No matter how long I spend on it it'll it'll never be perfect.

701
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:22,600
But at the same time like when I hear a part that like oh I'm like noticeably choir at this quieter at this part.

702
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,600
I'm like I don't want I don't want that.

703
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,600
Yeah.

704
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,600
I've been I've been I don't know I've been sinking time into doing that.

705
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,600
Also there's.

706
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:43,600
Damn there's like there's there's parts where I'm like OK I want to show something on screen.

707
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:56,600
But like again there's diminishing returns there's like if I wanted to I could I could be putting up like images on screen like all the time I could be like constantly showing something and taking it off.

708
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,600
And I've read I think yesterday I was like.

709
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:10,600
I gotta stop like I gotta I gotta not I don't need I don't need to show some every time I mentioned something it's OK to just show it one time.

710
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,600
And then just leave it.

711
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:21,600
I was thinking about like putting up screenshots of the of the of well I don't want to say what I almost I almost spoiled it.

712
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:29,600
But I was thinking about putting up screenshots of some particular thing and lots and lots of examples of this particular thing.

713
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,600
And I know I can't I can't let myself do it.

714
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:39,600
It would be if I if I if I did that I would have to do more.

715
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,600
So I gotta I gotta call it at some point.

716
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,600
I gotta call it like no that's enough.

717
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:59,600
I have yeah I have I passed the six hour mark of like edited completed stuff yesterday.

718
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,600
Yeah I have six hours that are basically done.

719
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:09,600
Like I'll need to like give it a final listen through and like see if I have anything that's like fucked up and needs tweaking.

720
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:16,600
But theoretically six hours of it are done and there are like a little less than two hours left to go.

721
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:23,600
I had to add a bit big three or four minute like explanation of something.

722
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,600
So I keep adding little bits of explanation that are making it a little bit longer and a little bit longer.

723
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,600
It's not looking like it's going to hit eight hours.

724
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,600
I would be over I would be happy if it hit eight hours but I don't think it will.

725
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,600
I feel terrible.

726
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,600
I mean six hours of edited content.

727
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,600
Yeah it's a lot of work.

728
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,600
You're getting through it.

729
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,600
It's taken me more than a month now.

730
01:05:54,600 --> 01:06:01,600
I didn't I didn't anticipate spending more than a month just on the editing but I have and you know what it's OK.

731
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
It's fine.

732
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,600
You know what without.

733
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,600
I don't I don't want to say it.

734
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,600
I don't want to say it because it'll spoil it.

735
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,600
I guess I'll just say I realized the thing that the lecture is about.

736
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:28,600
There's not too long before I think it will have a little bit of a resurgence.

737
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:37,600
I have there's there's reason to believe that like in the not too distant future this thing is going to see coverage mainstream media coverage.

738
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,600
And I think about that and I'm like wouldn't it be amazing if the video did well.

739
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:55,600
And then there's like a big like media sort of surge around it and that and it's positioned at that time to get like a ton more views based on that and like I could see that happening.

740
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,600
And that is like I got I got to keep going.

741
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,600
I got I got to push through.

742
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,600
I got to have the video out the sooner I have the video out the more likely that is to happen.

743
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:12,600
And I want to have the video out then the longer you will have to never work on it.

744
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,600
That's true.

745
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,600
That's true.

746
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:24,600
There's two good reasons one the sooner it's out the sooner it can start accumulating views and the more views it will have by the day.

747
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:33,600
The time that it stands to maybe gain a little bit of mainstream media reflected limelight so to speak.

748
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:39,600
So like getting it out sooner is is strategically optimal for that reason.

749
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,600
Also I just want it to be done.

750
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
I want the nightmare to end.

751
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,600
So you know there's two excellent reasons.

752
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,600
Two excellent reasons.

753
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,600
I've definitely slowed down.

754
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:58,600
I've definitely been struggling to like continue to force myself to look at it just on an emotional level.

755
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,600
It's becoming harder and harder to keep going.

756
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,600
I'm trying to fight through it.

757
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:12,600
I get my week was yeah my week was not very productive at all.

758
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:20,600
I had a bit of a at a bit of a depression moment and I sort of didn't do anything.

759
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:36,600
But more recently like last few days I think it's it's the difficulty of like giving myself praise for the things that I do well.

760
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,600
I saw you tweet something about like praising yourself through gritted teeth.

761
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:50,600
Yeah like like when I do something well it's it's never like oh good it's like about time you did that you took too long.

762
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,600
Like that's my first thought.

763
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,600
And when I do something bad it's like oh that's expected because you suck.

764
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,600
It's just sort of like negative one way or the other.

765
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,600
If you do down if you don't sort of thing.

766
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:09,600
I've mentioned it before but I had that I had that thermodynamics professor who was like a Buddhist and he told us like when you solve a physics problem you know take the time.

767
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,600
Feel good about it.

768
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,600
Let yourself feel good about it.

769
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,600
Yeah it's it's it's a very important thing.

770
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,600
I've been trying to like give myself praise for like the small things that I managed to do.

771
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,600
And it's really hard.

772
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,600
So I hope you do that.

773
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,600
I hope you feel good about what you are accomplishing.

774
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:40,600
I you know the fact that it has been more and more of a struggle has made it been like the slower progress goes.

775
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:49,600
The more like I can look back and be like I accomplished more a week ago than last week than I did this week.

776
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,600
You know.

777
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:59,600
It looks worse and worse in comparison the slower it goes so it's becoming harder and harder to feel good about it because like the first week I'm like oh yeah.

778
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,600
I did it like three hours of it.

779
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:08,600
That's like almost half done and then two weeks later I'm like oh it took me like almost three weeks to get another three hours.

780
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,600
You know.

781
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:29,600
I do know but I also know that it's it's probably not helping things to to to increase like the negative feelings you have towards yourself and it the longer it goes.

782
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,600
Yeah I am.

783
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:43,600
I'm a little concerned actually that like part of the reason it has gone slower and slower is maybe I've what if I've become more and more like stringent about like.

784
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,600
What audio blips I need to correct and like how much.

785
01:10:48,600 --> 01:11:03,600
Visual info I need to add and therefore I will get slower and slower as I'm doing it and then I will be like OK done now to go back and give it a final listen and then I'll realize oh the the early part.

786
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:10,600
I didn't do as much work on as the later part and now the early part feels sloppy and I need to.

787
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,600
Correct some more.

788
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:19,600
To just to make it that go I think you gotta let that go just because of the extreme length of the video that's always going to happen.

789
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:28,600
Yeah it's like like an artist drawing a comic the early pages are going to look worse than the most recent ones that's.

790
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,600
Are they going to go back and redo everything every time they increase increase in skill.

791
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,600
Yeah.

792
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,600
Or learn a different way of doing things.

793
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,600
No I think I think that's probably true.

794
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:46,600
It's OK if it's not completely like buttery smooth consistent all the way through.

795
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:59,600
There have there have definitely been points recently where I've needed to add like kind of a lot of like additional info but I think there's a reason for that.

796
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:07,600
I think I think it's I think it's justifiable based on the material that I'm talking about that's not like.

797
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:16,600
My standards change that's like OK no this this part requires further elaboration in a way that previous parts did not so like I'm OK with that.

798
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,600
Yeah.

799
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,600
Working.

800
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,600
Working working just working.

801
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,600
Just working.

802
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,600
Maybe this week I know I sound like a broken record but maybe this week it'll be done.

803
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,600
I say that every week.

804
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,600
Is it is a catchphrase.

805
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,600
My old catchphrase was end of the month.

806
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:50,600
That was when I was talking about what I used to do like endless war coding stuff I would always say oh yeah this feature will be done by the end of the month.

807
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,600
That was a bit of a meme.

808
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,600
That was a bit of a meme.

809
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,600
I have no idea when things I used to have that with like.

810
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:10,600
I mean it's just making a deadline and being like I could probably do that and then realizing you can't and then feeling bad about.

811
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,600
And it's a yeah sucks.

812
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,600
I don't have much to say on it really well.

813
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,600
It's just hard to know exactly like what is what is the perfect deadline.

814
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:29,600
Is it a good or a bad thing to expect yourself to get something done by a certain point or not.

815
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,600
Is it is it motivational or is it purely destructive.

816
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,600
I think if you have no deadlines at all you'll never you'll never get anything done.

817
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:50,600
I think it's probably OK to have it's probably better to have deadlines and fail to meet them because most of the time at least in pursuing that deadline even if you fail to meet it.

818
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,600
Usually you'll at least have done something that the deadline will have made something happen.

819
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,600
If not then I mean that's bad.

820
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:25,600
Yeah I mean for me the thing with the giving myself praise is like it's sort of like a way to get out of like because if if I let myself feel bad for long enough it will come down to like well you're certain years old and you could have been so much more if you had only started when you were 12.

821
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:42,600
And it's sort of like well I can't do anything about that you know sort of like the deadline the feeling of deadline the feeling of having missed the deadline and be feeling bad about it can sort of fully encompass you and make you paralyzed.

822
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:55,600
I'm like giving yourself praise for like having done something is like a good I don't know like a bit of a boost to continue making progress.

823
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:07,600
Sure yeah I hope that I get better at stuff and I know that you know things I've made already are good.

824
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:20,600
But I was just last this this last week just like really critical and then what I just stopped what were you being critical of if you don't mind me asking.

825
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:44,600
I think it was partly work related like oh I'm so slow some some sort of thing reminded me of feelings of like super inadequacy of being you know I'm too old to be only just now getting stuff done super inadequacy.

826
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,600
Damn that's so that's so much better than my inadequacy.

827
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,600
Yeah give me five seconds to grab a sparkling water.

828
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,600
Okay I'm back.

829
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,600
I forgot exactly.

830
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:07,600
To you were saying feelings of oh I'm too old to not be.

831
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,600
Yeah yeah like it's something like I've had feelings like that before us like I'm too old.

832
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:24,600
And I've missed my chance to be good at anything and I was making good progress last week and something tip me I can't really even remember what my mind was doing.

833
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:33,600
But I just sort of fell into like a depression spiral was like yeah you know what fuck it everything sucks.

834
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:43,600
And I don't know I think what was most frustrating this time was that I felt like I had the tools necessary to get out of it and I couldn't do it.

835
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
It was difficult.

836
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,600
It was like I mean you know what you should be doing in order to not like be falling into that.

837
01:16:52,600 --> 01:17:15,600
Yeah cuz like yeah cuz like I have the therapist down I talked to them you know about once a week and like I had felt better since then and then I was like you know what I think I am capable I think I am capable of getting myself out of these these these moods with tools and like mantras and like helpful little things to remember.

838
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:21,600
And then it just it collapsed and I just couldn't do it and I'm like what I thought I knew what I was doing.

839
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:26,600
I thought I had it I thought I was smart now but it was it was not the case.

840
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:43,600
Well I mean that's just it's always like what does that make me think of like everybody you can even even if you're really good at something.

841
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:52,600
You can still like sometimes like forget to apply the fundamentals and then you'll fuck up right and everybody happens to everybody.

842
01:17:53,600 --> 01:18:11,600
Yeah I mean I was feeling bad back then right now I'm a little better I'm like yeah I get what my problem was it will happen again it's just sort of like trying to deal with the outcome better.

843
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,600
It's like they say like it certain things just never get better but you get better at dealing with them.

844
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:26,600
So I'm just sort of hoping that that it's true that I can I can get I can get away from depression faster and faster.

845
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:36,600
Yeah each time but yeah I don't really have like those are some more personal things in there I don't really want to get into.

846
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:43,600
Okay that was part of it but yeah it turns out I didn't do anything last week work wise.

847
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:49,600
I did like one drawing and I put it on my not safe work Twitter and I was like oh that was good.

848
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:59,600
I did it I did something you're talking about that you're talking about this past week since the last podcast this past week yeah yeah.

849
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,600
I mean yeah you win some you lose some I guess.

850
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:23,600
I'm trying to think I'm trying to think that I do anything besides fuss over my stupid video avoided avoided my roommates tried to try to avoid becoming responsible for the gas bill.

851
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:30,600
Oh you know what we could talk about what's that to get away from the depression stuff.

852
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,600
I generated imagery let's have a topic let's have a topic about this.

853
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:49,600
Yeah I'll say it I don't like how some people talk about it I think there I've seen some bad arguments against it.

854
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:56,600
And I'm not a fan of it or anything but I've definitely seen some arguments against it that I think are dumb.

855
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Like what like one of mine.

856
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:07,600
You will you retweeted one that I that I kind of I didn't like disagree with it.

857
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,600
It was it was that Sean tweet Sean said something about.

858
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,600
Oh yeah I thought that was good.

859
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,600
I didn't like it.

860
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:26,600
I didn't like it because it felt like the argument is that like oh AI makes it too easy and things should be hard and things that are hard are good.

861
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:33,600
And it felt like it felt like Calvin's dad saying like like struggling builds character.

862
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:52,600
It wasn't that it was that there are benefits to doing the work like that the the act of making art is fulfilling in and of itself it doesn't like the end product is hyper focused on for the AI quote unquote artist.

863
01:20:52,600 --> 01:21:02,600
They don't care about like the creativity and the fun of creating art they just like when a thing is you know made.

864
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:13,600
I mean sure and they're missing out is this what I got from that is that the to do AI art is to miss out on most of what makes art fun and good.

865
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:21,600
I it's I don't even disagree but couldn't you say the same thing about shoveling the walk.

866
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,600
Wouldn't Calvin's dad say the same thing about shoveling the walk though.

867
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,600
Shoveling the walk like the sidewalk.

868
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,600
Well you know that's that's the thing in in in Calvin and Hobbes.

869
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,600
Yeah.

870
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,600
The dad always didn't know I shovel the walk.

871
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,600
Don't remember that turn of phrase.

872
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,600
No well I don't think it's like a it's a building character argument.

873
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,600
Well I think it's just like it's a shame.

874
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,600
It's not it's not the main reason I dislike AI art.

875
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,600
I dislike AI art because the people who do it are shit.

876
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:02,600
Yeah I don't like it's the bigger deal is that like the AI is made to basically just like.

877
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:11,600
Thieve data from existing or like you know that guy I for that that artist just died like this past week and like immediately.

878
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:17,600
Yes we're AI generating stuff that like was like mimicking his his work.

879
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:23,600
They train an AI by feeding it images from a certain artist.

880
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:28,600
Yeah so they can then create in the style of the artist more or less.

881
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,600
I mean sometimes it doesn't work but for some artists it really does.

882
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:38,600
You can steal an artist's entire style and put it into an AI thing.

883
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,600
Yeah and then type their name and then generate things that look just like what they could draw.

884
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:57,600
I mean I think it I think it's like OK as long as like everybody's clear on like that's what we're doing.

885
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
Like like as long as it's like.

886
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,600
Yeah I feel like since the technology exists and it can only get better from here.

887
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:11,600
It's not like we can stop it existing.

888
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:18,600
Yeah but like it's the the the people behind doing shitty things are the the thing that make me upset.

889
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,600
Yeah it's the it's people profiteering off of off of it.

890
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:29,600
It's people that didn't people that didn't actually create anything like someone who just like took that AI.

891
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:37,600
And maybe they did a little bit of work you know training it on these images or whatever I'm sure that took some effort but then it's like oh yeah now I.

892
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:47,600
Own this like infinite machine for generating plagiarism of this of infinitely recombining and recombining the work of this artist that just died.

893
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,600
And like whatever I guess if someone wants to do that it's OK.

894
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,600
It's it's what it's like if someone were profiteering off of it that I'd be like that's gross that's horrible stop it.

895
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:06,600
Yeah it's like I've said on previous weeks it's just the fact that you need money to live and the fact that this can take potential money.

896
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:22,600
Away from artists is like that that part of it is why it's more horrible than just sort of like cheap like this guy is not the real artist but he makes some some AI generated things but the fact that.

897
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:31,600
It really can be like a thing that makes people lose money because they can't get commissioned.

898
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:41,600
I mean it's still hypothetical I haven't actually heard of a situation where that has happened but it's hard to to like pinpoint like an exact amount of lost money.

899
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:57,600
You can just see it happening like people would if they can if the AI is good and the the artist they steal from is usually expensive they can make whatever they want.

900
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,600
I don't know whether people would pay anyway.

901
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,600
I feel like people would still pay artists just to support them.

902
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,600
You can but it's like if there's an art there's a hypothetical like it will just happen less and that's gross.

903
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:19,600
I don't know I mean you can you can post like you can pick and choose like AI generated images that like oh this looks good.

904
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:26,600
Like this this looks kind of like something this someone made or this looks is like a nice image but like.

905
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:38,600
You can't at least where the technology is now you can't like generate that at will you know what I mean like you can't make you can't make the image you want.

906
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:47,600
You can make an image that looks good and looks like something that someone might want but getting like the exact thing you want is like.

907
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:55,600
Hard to impossible unless you're like unless what you want is like I just want something that looks like so and so drew it.

908
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,600
And that's it.

909
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:24,600
That's the yeah I think that's the most annoying part is the the the prevalence and the sort of common accepted notion among AI artists that to get the best results you really should put somebody somebody's name in there like buy this this artist or buy that artist alongside all of your descriptive things because I've I've I've dabbled just for fun to see what it could do.

910
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:36,600
And if you don't put an artist in it is a nightmare most of the time because it's drawing from like the entire Internet Google images like photographs like it needs to narrow itself down.

911
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:53,600
And so it's sort of like that's the way to do the the ones that look good is to like just steal from a good artist so that it's not like pulling from every possible thing that a word could be referring to.

912
01:26:54,600 --> 01:27:10,600
What do you think about when people say like oh well real like like artists copy other artists like like artists artists can like oh yeah I drew this in the style of so and so right like is that is that.

913
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:22,600
Is that is that is that theft in the same way that like oh I trained this AI on on the art of so and so and it drew it generated an image in the style of him.

914
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:42,600
I think like legally would only become theft if you portray yourself as being the artist that you're copying and then it would be like a like a litigation thing if you if an AI artist trains an AI to make something that looks like an artist work.

915
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,600
It's it's not illegal.

916
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:58,600
I don't know but it's a new technology and it's sort of weird I feel like I feel like the technology is just combining elements of isn't isn't isn't that basically just sort of like taking his that person's work.

917
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:13,600
I don't know I feel like the AI is like directly combining stuff that someone else made into a new thing whereas like if a human being is like interpreting someone's art and trying to recreate it there's like more of a.

918
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,600
You mean recreate it or like use the same style.

919
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,600
I mean like try and try and draw something like create a recreate a style recreate someone's style.

920
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:30,600
Like this is my this is I'm drawing a new drawing but it's in the style of so and so it's my take on their style.

921
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,600
That's the thing that people do.

922
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:46,600
I think the difference I would say is that the AI does not need nearly as much time to create an image than it does for a person to draw generally speaking.

923
01:28:46,600 --> 01:29:01,600
So like it's like they're equivalent in a lot of ways but I just don't like the I don't know.

924
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,600
Like if the machine can do it better than the real person.

925
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:11,600
Yeah like faster and more efficiently they can overtake that person.

926
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,600
I don't know if an artist could like overtake another artist by copying their style.

927
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:31,600
I guess it's I think I think it's just when it's like a one off thing like oh I did thing in style but if you do like many many many images in another person's style they might feel like you're copying their style and like cramp in their style.

928
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,600
You should maybe stop but that's sort of like a disagreement thing.

929
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,600
It's not really a I don't know.

930
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,600
I don't know how I feel about that usually.

931
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,600
I generally think it's better for anyone to like find their own style.

932
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:53,600
Yeah not because it's it's not because like for any legal reason it's just sort of like it's lame.

933
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,600
I think it's lame to be copying somebody.

934
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:14,600
I mean I think that it's probably it's a thing that already happens that like an artist with a popular style a like small like cottage industry might crop up of people like sort of doing art in their style.

935
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,600
Like oh it looks like this.

936
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:19,600
Oh this is like something that so and so would draw.

937
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,600
I don't know.

938
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,600
I think I think that's already a thing.

939
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:30,600
I just here's kind of bugs me.

940
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,600
I don't know.

941
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:40,600
I think that there's a little vein of like effort is good in and of itself.

942
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:46,600
I think there's a little bit of like labor fetishization going on when people say like oh the AI makes it too easy.

943
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,600
I think that I don't really care too much about that.

944
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,600
I think that if an artist.

945
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:57,600
I think that if let's let's take considerations of like art theft and plagiarism out of it.

946
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:12,600
Let's say that that was not a concern if if an artist if someone you could call them an artist or not could take the AI and generate exactly the image that they had in their head just by pressing a button.

947
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,600
I think that that was good.

948
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,600
I would be like it's OK.

949
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,600
It's fine that you didn't have to do any work to make it.

950
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,600
Sure.

951
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:21,600
Yeah.

952
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,600
Like it's an interesting tool.

953
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:40,600
It's definitely useful for spitballing ideas for concept art or like coming up with like I wonder how it would look if I did this sort of a thing and then you make some images and you're like yeah this gives me an idea and then you go and make it yourself.

954
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:44,600
Or even if you don't if you're not an artist you just want to make some cool things.

955
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,600
I think the tool is fine.

956
01:31:47,600 --> 01:32:02,600
I think it has potential to be misused and I think a lot of people are like have no scruples whatsoever and will misuse it as as much as they possibly can for as much gain as they possibly can without consideration for anything.

957
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,600
And they will just go ahead and do that because there's no laws against it.

958
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,600
There's no like restrictions.

959
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,600
Yeah.

960
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:18,600
So they're just going ham and it sucks because I because I know those people are those those people suck.

961
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:28,600
I mean I'm pretty much fine with anything that anyone wants to do with it up until it becomes like IP theft.

962
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,600
And then it's at that point it's I'm not exactly sure where that line is.

963
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,600
Yeah.

964
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,600
But there's definitely there's cases that are definitely over it.

965
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,600
And those are bad.

966
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:48,600
And I don't know exactly how you would like define where that starts exactly.

967
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,600
But it's definitely bad.

968
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:57,600
You know the worst thing about it is that I tried to make a big booby risk image and you just couldn't do it.

969
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,600
I typed in big boobies huge breasts doesn't work.

970
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:05,600
All those prompts that have those like Victorian era.

971
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,600
Shit.

972
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,600
Like they have those prompts.

973
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,600
Yeah.

974
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:17,600
And it's like filled with like a very embarrassing but very funny like a lot of like booby booba beautiful.

975
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:24,600
Oil painting looking oil painting Renaissance highly realistic anime like they're just a bunch of words.

976
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:29,600
And I tried doing that because like I'm not going to like pretend I'm an artist for doing it.

977
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,600
What if I can make a really good risk image.

978
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,600
Can it be done.

979
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,600
I wanted to see and I couldn't.

980
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,600
I guess I needed to steal from more specific artists.

981
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,600
I didn't put any artists in.

982
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,600
Look at look at this one.

983
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:47,600
Jess posted this in my discord and it's really funny.

984
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:53,600
It's loading.

985
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:58,600
I looked at this and I didn't realize a spork pointed out that.

986
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:04,600
Okay what it did here is it confused the boobs for legs.

987
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:05,600
Oh it did.

988
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,600
Yeah.

989
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,600
If you get rid of the shirt it looks normal.

990
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:12,600
It looks it kind of looks like legs if you yeah if you crop it out.

991
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,600
And that's actually really interesting.

992
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:19,600
That's actually like a really interesting trick that the AI played on itself there.

993
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:28,600
It is like it's very funny when it's like almost good and then it's like freaky.

994
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:34,600
Wait I want to whenever they have like hands there's always like three fingers or seven fingers.

995
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,600
Look at look at this that Maryweather posted.

996
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,600
This is horrible.

997
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,600
This one's actually really upsetting.

998
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,600
I don't.

999
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,600
Is it is it doing the same thing?

1000
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,600
Is it think the boobs are legs?

1001
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,600
I don't think so.

1002
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:58,600
No I think it just sort of there's like a crease and I thought there was a belly button.

1003
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,600
Yeah.

1004
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,600
But then why would they make boobs after that?

1005
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,600
I don't.

1006
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,600
I don't know.

1007
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,600
It's the funniest thing to me is the enemy face looks exactly like things I've seen before.

1008
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,600
The face looks totally normal.

1009
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,600
Nothing wrong with the face.

1010
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,600
And like the legs look totally normal.

1011
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,600
The face looks completely normal.

1012
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:24,600
The shoulder is a little weird and it's just the torso just has an extra set of boobs in it.

1013
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,600
It's like two rib cages.

1014
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,600
That's freaky.

1015
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:36,600
Yeah that one's actually kind of kind of unsettling.

1016
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,600
See like the tool is fun.

1017
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:46,600
The tool I mean when everyone was going nuts over like the dolly too.

1018
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:49,600
It's like yeah you can make a weird freaky thing.

1019
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,600
Yeah.

1020
01:35:50,600 --> 01:36:01,600
It's just this current trend of like certain people trying to sound and be considered more like.

1021
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:07,600
What's the word like official like it's that they're more.

1022
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,600
Yeah.

1023
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:18,600
That one that one guy said that it's like AI art is real art because like I had to spend an hour and a half typing prompts into the machine before it made me this picture.

1024
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,600
Like great.

1025
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,600
It's just sort of an embarrassing like mindset.

1026
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,600
It reminds me a lot of NFT artists.

1027
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,600
It reminds me a lot of crypto bros.

1028
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:28,600
They're just sort of.

1029
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,600
Yeah.

1030
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,600
They fetishize.

1031
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:36,600
Them being very smart and good.

1032
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:40,600
They only want to do it through the most easiest possible means.

1033
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:41,600
Yeah.

1034
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,600
I mean.

1035
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,600
Yeah.

1036
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,600
That stuff is really frustrating.

1037
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,600
It's not that like doing things in a difficult way.

1038
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:52,600
It makes it more valid.

1039
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:59,600
It's just that it's annoying that I am reminded of these sorts of people.

1040
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:07,600
If something is easier, there exists the temptation for some people to be like, OK, well, now I can take this.

1041
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,600
I can take this shortcut.

1042
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,600
I can do this thing and it makes me.

1043
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,600
I mean.

1044
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:26,600
If if if if something like this if an AI generator like makes it really easy to make art, like I think that's OK.

1045
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:32,600
But I mean, it does mean that, you know, it is a less skilled job.

1046
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:41,600
Like it's true that like if if you can just type a bunch of prompts into a generator and it will generate an image that looks great.

1047
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,600
And it's exactly what you want.

1048
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,600
Like I don't think it's wrong to do that.

1049
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:54,600
But it's true that like, you know, that that Sean Tweet, he said, like, yeah, the artist will, you know, he will gain skill by doing the work.

1050
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,600
He gains skill at the task.

1051
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:07,600
If you don't need to be skilled to do the task because the AI will do it for you, like, well, maybe you just don't need to be that skilled to do it anymore.

1052
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:17,600
But like that's OK, because that just means that technology has made work easier and that's good actually when that happens.

1053
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:23,600
It's good if technology makes stuff more accessible and makes it easier to do things.

1054
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,600
We should like that.

1055
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,600
You do you do miss out.

1056
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,600
You don't get as skilled.

1057
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,600
You don't develop as much skill at this thing.

1058
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,600
And I mean, that might be negative in its own way.

1059
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:46,600
There might be cases where, boy, I really wish that like I was more skilled as a draftsman so I could just I could create the image that I have in my head.

1060
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:52,600
Because AI is it's not possible with AI for whatever reason.

1061
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,600
It's it's it's not a.

1062
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:00,600
I think but it's it's not it's not an evil in and of itself that like.

1063
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,600
You can do something that like something becomes possible without.

1064
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,600
As much work or skill required.

1065
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,600
I agree.

1066
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:15,600
OK, I agree that the tool existing is not a net negative society.

1067
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,600
With that strong tweet, I very much focus more on like the.

1068
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:27,600
The like the enjoyment of like the fulfilling nature of creating art by hand.

1069
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:32,600
Yeah, like I or with with like more with more purpose, I suppose.

1070
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:38,600
I feel like I would get like with my limited experience working with AI stuff.

1071
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:44,600
I feel more than anything like frustrated at the computer for not understanding what I'm trying to say.

1072
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,600
And like, OK, let me do it.

1073
01:39:46,600 --> 01:40:00,600
And then I would draw a little sketch and it wouldn't be as like beautiful and as like detailed and perfectly rendered as a lot of these images that the from artists they're stealing from that these things can generate.

1074
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,600
But it is more like true to what I'm looking for.

1075
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,600
I feel like it's.

1076
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,600
Yeah.

1077
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,600
The path of least resistance for me like mentally is to do it myself.

1078
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,600
But that's yeah, maybe just because I'm used to that.

1079
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:19,600
Well, that's I mean, that's what is when you're looking at AI stuff.

1080
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:29,600
You can see lots of images that are specific that like look good, but those aren't if you're setting out with a very particular image in mind.

1081
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,600
I think it's like.

1082
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:36,600
I don't know if any AI can do that like ever.

1083
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,600
Yeah.

1084
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:47,600
I mean, maybe in the future right now it is good for like like spitball and concepts like you want to think of like.

1085
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:52,600
Instead of going to Google search and typing in that sorts of things that you need like inspiration for.

1086
01:40:52,600 --> 01:41:01,600
You can generate an image from Google images with those like key words and you can get some like mishmash things and be like, ah, yes.

1087
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:07,600
Like that that's the sort of thing I'm looking for or like no, that's too much like this.

1088
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,600
But I'd like this one part of it.

1089
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:12,600
Like it's good for for coming up with ideas.

1090
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:13,600
Is it right now?

1091
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,600
I don't get it.

1092
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:23,600
Well, because like if you're finding what I mean is like telling the AI to generate the image, surely you already have kind of you already know like the sort of thing you're looking for.

1093
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:29,600
But you don't know what the AI will come up with because the keywords are always going to be more vague.

1094
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:30,600
Like that.

1095
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:31,600
That's what I mean.

1096
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:39,600
When you have a very specific idea in mind, going to AI and typing prompts in will not get you the image you want perfectly.

1097
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:47,600
It'll be like sort of weird and sort of wrong and sort of like you got to fuck around with the prompts a lot and it'll never be exactly what you're looking for.

1098
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,600
It'll be sort of maybe in the ballpark.

1099
01:41:50,600 --> 01:42:04,600
But that's that's the benefit of the thing is that if you don't exactly know what you want, but you have some sort of general themes, you can throw those at the AI and they can give you a ballpark estimate of what it might look like.

1100
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:17,600
And you'd be like, yes or no, like you can you can skip the the lengthy process of looking up a bunch of images and seeing if anything grabs your fancy.

1101
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,600
That's what I think is the benefit of it.

1102
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,600
It's not to create a specific image.

1103
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,600
It's to like throw shit at the wall and see if anything's good.

1104
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:38,600
I think it's good for like, I mean, like for something that doesn't require a lot of specificity like a background like like man like manga backgrounds.

1105
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:53,600
I think I think it's like, that's the the most obvious use that comes to my mind, like sort of a lot of time it sort of doesn't matter, like exactly what they look like but like maybe you just need something to and it's like

1106
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,600
there's there's there's there's there's artistic applications.

1107
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:02,600
There's there's times when specificity is important and there's times when it's not and in times when specificity is not important.

1108
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:10,600
I feel like AI is probably good and you might as well just fucking generate any old thing.

1109
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:14,600
There's times where that's could be appropriate.

1110
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:20,600
It's so stressful.

1111
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:22,600
Well, just thinking about it.

1112
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,600
Yeah.

1113
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,600
Time marches on.

1114
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:41,600
It's almost sort of unsettling to think that like it's like a new thing that like might really like change the landscape of anything.

1115
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,600
I don't like it.

1116
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,600
I don't like landscape changes.

1117
01:43:46,600 --> 01:44:00,600
Like I can hypothesize about like how industries might change how art art as a skill will be like, I don't know more difficult to get into or get money from like I don't know.

1118
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:07,600
I feel like it's not quite good enough to like you couldn't animate an entire show with AI.

1119
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,600
No.

1120
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:17,600
A lot of skill like you some illustration work you can do but it is still like mostly stealing is the reason why I can do that.

1121
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:18,600
Yeah.

1122
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:25,600
And and you can trace them to the artist that they're stealing from quite easily which is not good.

1123
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:39,600
I feel like at the end of the day, you know, art is still about, you know, an artist expressing a vision that they have.

1124
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:43,600
And like an AI can never have a vision.

1125
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:48,600
It can only borrow and assemble from other stuff.

1126
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,600
So like there will never be.

1127
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,600
I don't I don't.

1128
01:44:53,600 --> 01:45:00,600
I'm I don't like I'm sure that AI will become more and more able to perform more and more tasks.

1129
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:10,600
But there will never be a world where like AI just makes all the art because there will always be.

1130
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:17,600
People need to come up with the ideas right AI can't have ideas.

1131
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,600
Not yet.

1132
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,600
I'm trying to do I think it will.

1133
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:23,600
I don't know if I don't know.

1134
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:28,600
I don't know if it will ever be able to have ideas in the way that like a human does.

1135
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:36,600
I mean, I don't know enough about the technology of neural networks to, you know, to say with any confidence whether or not it can't do that in the future.

1136
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,600
I know it can't right now.

1137
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:51,600
It's very much like it's still gathering data from people like general like AIs of many types rely heavily on on human input.

1138
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,600
There's to like learn things.

1139
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,600
We're not even we're not even like close.

1140
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:03,600
We're not even anywhere in the ballpark of like an AI that like thinks like a human does.

1141
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:14,600
And I don't know if it's it's it's like an open question whether such a thing is even like possible.

1142
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,600
I think it could be possible just because I can't disprove it yet.

1143
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,600
I mean, sure.

1144
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,600
Meet me either.

1145
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:32,600
But like we're not there's like there's no there's there's no even like theoretical framework for like how such a thing would come to be.

1146
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,600
So it's not it's not at all.

1147
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:47,600
What I'm saying is it's not at all clear that like it's a foregone conclusion that eventually AI will become human like in its capability for generating thoughts and stuff.

1148
01:46:47,600 --> 01:47:00,600
You know, I guess you'd have to come down to like a human being learns by observing and the five, six senses or whatever they get data from the moment they're born.

1149
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,600
And they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

1150
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,600
But like over years and years they figure stuff out.

1151
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,600
But it's not just that because they have instincts as well.

1152
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:17,600
So like a pre program set of like things like when they're hungry, they cry, they don't know why they do that.

1153
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:27,600
But like, um, like, I don't think in any short time frame, something could be approached.

1154
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:47,600
But like, I think hypothetically, if an AI is like left to to grow and learn through many, many generations to the extent that it's like mimicking the human civilization from like when we crawled out of the sea.

1155
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:53,600
Like that because I've seen I've seen some they're not like about AI and I says, well, they are, I guess.

1156
01:47:53,600 --> 01:48:10,600
But like, um, like learning algorithms where they have like a funny stick with legs and the goal is to make a goal to get to make a walk and over thousands and thousands and thousands of generations.

1157
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:23,600
The ones that get furthest are passed on and the genes that don't do that are deleted and slowly it evolves to become good at walking, even though no instructions were given on how to do that.

1158
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:35,600
So like, hypothetically, that system applies to learning algorithms might make it more able to come up with unique thoughts.

1159
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:43,600
I just don't know what time frame or how like how difficult that would be to actually do.

1160
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:53,600
I mean, that's you're talking about performing a very specific limited task of like move from A to B.

1161
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,600
Yeah, that's the thing. It's like there is no.

1162
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:03,600
We'd have to come up with its own instincts. We'd have to program its DNA and the goals it has.

1163
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:10,600
Like for humans, the goal is like survive, procreate, because that's how we got here.

1164
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:12,600
And that's just sort of what we want to do.

1165
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:18,600
And all of the other things are related to surviving so that we can procreate.

1166
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:24,600
We feel good when we are full and we like to drink water. It feels nice.

1167
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:30,600
We have emotions because they help us decide what to do.

1168
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,600
No other reason.

1169
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:35,600
Well, I mean, I don't know.

1170
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,600
No, that's it. Yeah, yeah.

1171
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:40,600
I think generally that's where it comes from, right?

1172
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:43,600
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, sure.

1173
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,600
Sure, sure.

1174
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,600
Honestly, I hate this stuff.

1175
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,600
I hate thinking about it.

1176
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:02,600
But oh well.

1177
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:05,600
Robots are going to shoot you in the brain.

1178
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,600
Well, somebody has to.

1179
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:13,600
They're going to come up to you and say, I'm the Terminator or something.

1180
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:18,600
Live with me if you want to come.

1181
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,600
That's okay. Wait a minute.

1182
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:23,600
Okay.

1183
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,600
I stole that from someone.

1184
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,600
I was going to say you must have stolen it.

1185
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:26,600
Don't think I'm smart.

1186
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:29,600
I don't have it somewhere, but like it did catch me off guard.

1187
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:32,600
So, I mean, good job.

1188
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:35,600
Do you want to go to voicemails?

1189
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:40,600
Yes, I think I've said all my things.

1190
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:44,600
You said before we started, you said you had nothing to talk about.

1191
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:47,600
And I said, I don't have anything to talk about either.

1192
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:51,600
But maybe we can just do a short episode.

1193
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:54,600
And I guess we've done kind of a normal episode.

1194
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:57,600
So, good for us.

1195
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,600
We always find something.

1196
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:03,600
It was fun to talk about Outer Wilds.

1197
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:06,600
I wish...

1198
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,600
I would keep talking about it.

1199
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:10,600
I just don't know what else to say about it.

1200
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,600
You've got new things to explore.

1201
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,600
That's the joy of it.

1202
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,600
It's like thinking about what to do next.

1203
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,600
You look at your little computer on your ship.

1204
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,600
What have I not understood?

1205
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,600
Well, I have a little bit...

1206
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,600
I'm a little bit dreading.

1207
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:30,600
I thought I was done with the Dark Bramble until I realized I got to go back

1208
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:34,600
and I got to throw my fucking Scouter into that seed near the...

1209
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,600
What are they called?

1210
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:38,600
Bramble Seeds?

1211
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:40,600
No, no, the Aliens.

1212
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,600
The Nomai Grave.

1213
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,600
I got to throw my...

1214
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:47,600
I just got to go back, got to deal with it one more time

1215
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:50,600
and throw my goddamn Scouter into the goddamn Nomai Grave.

1216
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,600
Actually, I think I have to do that with...

1217
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,600
not Gabbro, whatever the astronaut...

1218
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,600
A Feltspar?

1219
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,600
Yeah, I got to do that.

1220
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,600
There's a seed near Feltspar too.

1221
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,600
I got to do it with him too.

1222
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:05,600
Just got to throw my freaking Scouter into some stuff

1223
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:08,600
and, you know, just got to do that.

1224
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,600
The third guy, I can't remember what his name is,

1225
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,600
but I keep thinking it's Cheems.

1226
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,600
Cheems?

1227
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,600
There's another astronaut.

1228
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,600
The small one?

1229
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,600
There's like a fat one?

1230
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:27,600
There's like a big one in Brittle Hollow.

1231
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:29,600
Yeah, that's who I think Cheems is.

1232
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:31,600
I can't remember his real name.

1233
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:33,600
I know they're all named...

1234
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,600
Oh, Chert. Chert.

1235
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,600
I know they're all named after stones.

1236
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:41,600
Stones that I know from Dwarf Fortress.

1237
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,600
Gabbro.

1238
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:44,600
I didn't know that.

1239
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:47,600
Yeah, Gabbro, Chert, Feltspar.

1240
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,600
I'm trying to think with it.

1241
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:52,600
I know about Gabbro.

1242
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,600
I mean, Dwarf Fortress, I'm always...

1243
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,600
I'm always mine in Gabbro.

1244
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:59,600
I'm always striking Gabbro.

1245
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,600
You know what I'm saying?

1246
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,600
Yes, rocks.

1247
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:09,600
Do you want to...

1248
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,600
Okay.

1249
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:12,600
Thespeakpipe.com slash PCB voicemail.

1250
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:15,600
It looks like the newest one we've got is called...

1251
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:18,600
The oldest new one is called Store Run.

1252
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:19,600
Are you ready?

1253
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,600
Yes.

1254
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,600
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1255
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,600
What's up, guys? I'm headed to the store.

1256
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:25,600
Do you need anything?

1257
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:28,600
Yeah, give me a pack of cigarettes.

1258
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:31,600
Give me a pack of smokes, please.

1259
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:34,600
Get me a...

1260
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:37,600
A little chocolate bar.

1261
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:39,600
I don't know what they have where you are.

1262
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:40,600
Do they have a crunchy?

1263
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,600
Give me a crunchy bar.

1264
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:46,600
No, I want to...

1265
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:49,600
I haven't...

1266
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,600
Last night, I was really like...

1267
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:55,600
I want to order some food from a restaurant.

1268
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:58,600
I want to order some...

1269
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:01,600
What do you call it?

1270
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,600
What's the...

1271
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,600
Middle Eastern food?

1272
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:07,600
Kebabs?

1273
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:10,600
Yeah, I want to order some kebab.

1274
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:12,600
But it was too late.

1275
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,600
It was like past midnight.

1276
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:16,600
So it was like maybe in the morning.

1277
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:17,600
I mean, it's good that I didn't,

1278
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:21,600
because I would pay like $45 for the fucking wrap.

1279
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:23,600
And that's bad.

1280
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,600
So give me a kebab, please.

1281
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:29,600
If you're going by something like that.

1282
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:32,600
Next one is called Mike Ermentrout.

1283
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:35,600
Three, two, one, go.

1284
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,600
Welcome.

1285
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:41,600
Would you take away Walter?

1286
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,600
I'm not necessarily right now, Walter.

1287
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:46,600
What?

1288
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:48,600
It's a...

1289
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:52,600
Put his phone up next to a meme of Mike Ermentrout

1290
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,600
not actually speaking about

1291
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:58,600
fucking Walter White or something.

1292
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,600
Fucking Walter White, huh?

1293
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:02,600
I heard it before.

1294
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,600
Fantastic.

1295
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,600
Spectacular.

1296
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,600
Uh...

1297
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:13,600
I don't know what else to say about it.

1298
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:15,600
Next one is called...

1299
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:17,600
Well, it's an Imgur link called

1300
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:20,600
NFT Hypothetical Screenshots.

1301
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:21,600
Okay, I'm going to listen to it.

1302
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,600
Three, two, one, go.

1303
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:24,600
Real quick, Ben doubted the story

1304
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:25,600
about an artist being approached

1305
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:26,600
to make an NFT,

1306
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:27,600
so here's the screenshots of it.

1307
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:30,600
They created about $36,000.

1308
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:32,600
What?

1309
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,600
I doubted the story of an artist

1310
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,600
being approached to create an NFT.

1311
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,600
No, I didn't.

1312
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:39,600
Do you know what he's talking about?

1313
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,600
I don't remember.

1314
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,600
Maybe you were saying it probably

1315
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:44,600
doesn't happen that much.

1316
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:46,600
You misinterpreted it as you denying

1317
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:50,600
that some specific thing didn't happen.

1318
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:51,600
See, some people have noticed

1319
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,600
I sold one of my posts in NFT.

1320
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:56,600
Someone emailed me offering to...

1321
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:57,600
This is dumb.

1322
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,600
I feel like, obviously,

1323
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:02,600
I didn't mean that it never happens.

1324
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:04,600
I feel insulted that this...

1325
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,600
Do you think that I meant that it had

1326
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,600
never happened to anyone ever?

1327
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:11,600
Of course it happened to one person.

1328
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:13,600
Of course that happened.

1329
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:14,600
Maybe we were talking about this.

1330
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:16,600
I vaguely remember.

1331
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:17,600
I donated 10 times the highest

1332
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,600
credible estimate to the carbon cost

1333
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:22,600
of climate change-related charities.

1334
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,600
I don't care.

1335
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,600
I don't care if it happened once.

1336
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:26,600
It's irrelevant.

1337
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,600
Whatever.

1338
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:29,600
Yeah, whatever.

1339
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:30,600
Stupid.

1340
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:31,600
Stupid.

1341
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:34,600
Next one is called...

1342
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:36,600
Well, it's a Vinnie, I think.

1343
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:39,600
3, 2, 1, go.

1344
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,600
Cat face.

1345
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,600
Cat face.

1346
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:43,600
Okay.

1347
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,600
Cat face.

1348
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:47,600
Alright, I'm drooling.

1349
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:49,600
Trixie is a golden witch.

1350
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:51,600
There she is.

1351
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,600
The lace in your dress

1352
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:55,600
tangles my neck.

1353
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:57,600
That's what you say.

1354
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:58,600
I say that all the time.

1355
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:00,600
I'm always saying this.

1356
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,600
In case you wanted to look at that one picture

1357
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:05,600
of Trixie a little longer, yeah.

1358
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:08,600
My stand, Uwupati and platformer M.K.

1359
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:13,600
Ray woman having a soda pop together.

1360
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,600
Yep.

1361
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:17,600
There's me.

1362
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:20,600
Okay, me and Uwupati doing poses

1363
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:22,600
from Baki the Grappler.

1364
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,600
Cool.

1365
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:26,600
NFTs become currency?

1366
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:27,600
No.

1367
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:29,600
I would say that.

1368
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,600
Then crying like that Chopper meme

1369
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:33,600
going around right now.

1370
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:36,600
And then a Virgin Chad meme, you're the best kid.

1371
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,600
Virgin Saint doesn't know how to dress

1372
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:40,600
like a cool goth, spends hours

1373
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:44,600
stalking his ex Trixie the Golden Witch.

1374
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:47,600
Has to move out of Slumlord's apartment

1375
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:49,600
to chicken to kill his landlord

1376
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:52,600
and become the new landlord is

1377
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:54,600
being hunted for his treachery

1378
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:56,600
against the Kawasaki clan.

1379
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:57,600
Yeah.

1380
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:00,600
Nice unicorn power shirt.

1381
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:02,600
Twice your height.

1382
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,600
You're so huge.

1383
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:08,600
Virgin Chad mean they're like the same height.

1384
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:09,600
Is cute.

1385
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:10,600
Is like so cute.

1386
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:12,600
Like, oh my God.

1387
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,600
Has made so much character development

1388
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,600
and helps her friends and viewers with it.

1389
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,600
Shut up.

1390
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,600
Shut the fuck up.

1391
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,600
Dude, I've made so much character development.

1392
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,600
People are proud of her and her accomplishments.

1393
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,600
Oh, that's so, no, that's great.

1394
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,600
Oh, that's so good.

1395
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:28,600
I'm so glad.

1396
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:30,600
Inspires me who is writing this.

1397
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,600
I hate, I hate you Vinny.

1398
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:35,600
I fucking hate you so much.

1399
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:37,600
Has overcome.

1400
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:39,600
Stop saying the same thing over and over and over again.

1401
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:42,600
How many times can you say had character development?

1402
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:44,600
Fuck off.

1403
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:46,600
Doesn't like the bottom one doesn't

1404
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:48,600
outshine her co-hosts for their sake.

1405
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:51,600
What the fuck does that mean?

1406
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:54,600
Shut up.

1407
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:57,600
Makes hilarious funnies that brighten your day.

1408
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:00,600
No, she doesn't.

1409
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,600
She sucks actually.

1410
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,600
So true.

1411
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:03,600
So true.

1412
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,600
Thank you Vinny.

1413
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:05,600
False.

1414
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:06,600
False.

1415
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:07,600
Here's a.

1416
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:08,600
Prove it.

1417
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:09,600
You can't.

1418
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:11,600
I like this drawing of me as well.

1419
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:14,600
That's fine.

1420
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:17,600
It's okay.

1421
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:22,600
Next one is called cheesy owned epic style.

1422
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:23,600
Three, two, one, go.

1423
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:24,600
Wait, wait.

1424
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:25,600
There's one more image on this.

1425
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:26,600
Oh, was there?

1426
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:27,600
Yeah.

1427
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:28,600
Is it?

1428
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:29,600
Oh.

1429
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:30,600
Is another Trixie thing.

1430
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:31,600
Oh, yes.

1431
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,600
Trixie, the golden witch.

1432
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,600
Her outfit is one of her boyfriend's shirts.

1433
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:37,600
Trixie tape.

1434
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:38,600
Carpenter.

1435
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,600
Yeah.

1436
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:41,600
Yeah, like a potato sack.

1437
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:44,600
Trixie taping her office computer chair

1438
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:47,600
to her witch broom for the comfort,

1439
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:48,600
for comfort when flying.

1440
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:51,600
That's kind of funny.

1441
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:53,600
Stand whichever wand.

1442
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:57,600
Her manifested which one to communicate her feelings.

1443
01:59:57,600 --> 02:00:00,600
The offense and defense varies depending on Trixie's understanding

1444
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:03,600
or awareness of the situation she is in.

1445
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:04,600
Hmm.

1446
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:05,600
Same.

1447
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:06,600
Same.

1448
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:10,600
The ones variability is its greatest strength when utilized properly,

1449
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:15,600
but really has to be worked up to be shown.

1450
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:16,600
Shown.

1451
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:20,600
I don't know what that last bit means.

1452
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:21,600
This.

1453
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:22,600
This is my superpower.

1454
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:26,600
My superpower does things when I understand what's happening,

1455
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:31,600
but it does not do anything when I don't know what's going on.

1456
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:32,600
So true.

1457
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:33,600
So true.

1458
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:36,600
So true.

1459
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:37,600
Shit.

1460
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:38,600
Where was I?

1461
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:39,600
Cheesy.

1462
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,600
Cheesy owned epic style.

1463
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,600
Okay.

1464
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,600
Three, two, one, go.

1465
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,600
Cheesy man, Fredo.

1466
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,600
I'm like cheesy.

1467
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:51,600
Man's gay though.

1468
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:52,600
Yeah.

1469
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:53,600
True.

1470
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:57,600
I don't want to keep saying true, but these keep being true.

1471
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,600
These ones.

1472
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:00,600
Man's gay though.

1473
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:01,600
Do you get it?

1474
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:03,600
Man's gay though.

1475
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:04,600
Do you get it?

1476
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:05,600
No.

1477
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:07,600
Oh, let me explain it to you.

1478
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:11,600
See, it sounds like it's saying the man is gay though.

1479
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:12,600
No, it doesn't sound like that.

1480
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,600
It sounds like cheesy man Fredo.

1481
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,600
That's the joke.

1482
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:20,600
Yeah, but also he's gay though.

1483
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:22,600
Like pizza dough?

1484
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:23,600
No.

1485
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:32,600
Like what's like African American vernacular English like dough instead of though.

1486
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:34,600
Oh, like currency.

1487
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:35,600
No.

1488
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,600
No.

1489
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:40,600
Like just the way you would say the word.

1490
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:42,600
I can't.

1491
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:44,600
Listen, picture it like it's a bubble.

1492
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:46,600
Let's get two dimensional membrane.

1493
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:47,600
Yeah.

1494
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,600
Make it vibrate in your mind though.

1495
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:49,600
Rotate it.

1496
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:50,600
Rotate.

1497
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:51,600
Gay bubbles.

1498
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:52,600
Rotate it in your mind.

1499
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:53,600
Rotate the key.

1500
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:58,600
The concept of the bubble of gayness.

1501
02:01:58,600 --> 02:01:59,600
Gayness.

1502
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:02,600
And then pop it because God doesn't like it.

1503
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:07,600
Pop and lock it.

1504
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:11,600
Next one is called no SIM card, no service.

1505
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,600
True.

1506
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:13,600
Yes.

1507
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:14,600
True.

1508
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:19,600
Next one is called what do you think of the Mario movie trailer?

1509
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:21,600
I looked at it.

1510
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:22,600
Looked all right.

1511
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:26,600
It looked, it looks, you know, like a 3D animated film.

1512
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:27,600
Yeah.

1513
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:33,600
You know what was odd to me was like people when they heard Illumination Studios was working on it.

1514
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:37,600
They were like, oh no, because they made minions.

1515
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:43,600
Those are like, the minions movies are not like bad movies.

1516
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:45,600
They're just sort of for children.

1517
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:48,600
I mean, I've never seen one, so I don't even know.

1518
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:50,600
I've caught one once.

1519
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:53,600
I assume that they've made other things beside the minion movies.

1520
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:57,600
So it wasn't like I thought like, oh, it's going to be just like the minions.

1521
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:06,600
They did Despicable Me and then a minions like Despicable Me 1 and 2 and then a minions like standalone thing.

1522
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:10,600
And like a prequel and like, I don't know, but like.

1523
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:15,600
So you're actually like just proving that you're actually kind of making me think, oh, maybe that is all they've done.

1524
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:16,600
Well, it might be.

1525
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:26,600
I don't know, but like, like they're well animated, goofy, silly family movies that children love and mom's love for some reason.

1526
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:31,600
I just so it's just sort of like people.

1527
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:33,600
I don't think people really understood.

1528
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:37,600
I heard people saying that they thought like the goombas would be like the minions.

1529
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:43,600
Yeah, like I'm sure they I'm sure they don't write just one sort of thing.

1530
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:51,600
Like the studio being used means that it's going to look like the animation is going to be like similar in quality.

1531
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:55,600
The writing is different because they're working with Nintendo to write it.

1532
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:58,600
So like, why would they think it would be the same thing?

1533
02:03:58,600 --> 02:03:59,600
I don't know.

1534
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:00,600
Yeah, that seems a little silly.

1535
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:01,600
No, I didn't.

1536
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:02,600
I didn't think that.

1537
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:05,600
Chris Pratt's voice is pretty boring.

1538
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:08,600
Yeah, a little bit lame.

1539
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:14,600
I think I think it's OK for him not to have an Italian accent like I'm fine with that.

1540
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:19,600
Because I mean, he's always been a plumber from Brooklyn.

1541
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:21,600
He doesn't sound like he's from Brooklyn.

1542
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:24,600
He has a he has a slight Brooklyn accent.

1543
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:25,600
Yeah, it's not it's not much.

1544
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:26,600
It's it's pretty underwhelming.

1545
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:32,600
The fucking Hotel Mario CD I Mario voice is better.

1546
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:34,600
Yeah.

1547
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:36,600
Yeah, I mean, I agree.

1548
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:39,600
But I'm just saying like no Italian.

1549
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:43,600
I think some people think Mario needs to have an Italian accent.

1550
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:49,600
I think it's OK if he doesn't have an Italian accent, but I still think Chris Pratt's voice is boring.

1551
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:50,600
Sure.

1552
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:55,600
I mean, yeah, it's always a thing with animated movies where.

1553
02:04:55,600 --> 02:05:04,600
The budget goes big and they get like famous people who are not known for voice acting to do like to bring star power.

1554
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:11,600
Yeah, because voice actors don't have star power, even though they're better at their job generally.

1555
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,600
Yeah.

1556
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:14,600
But what are you going to do?

1557
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:16,600
Change the whole fucking industry?

1558
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:20,600
Yeah, it's stupid.

1559
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:23,600
Next one's called Happy Birthday, Ben.

1560
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,600
Thanks.

1561
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:27,600
Next one after that's called ASMR with Ben St.

1562
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:29,600
Three, two, one, go.

1563
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:45,600
Breathe in and out.

1564
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:49,600
I don't get it.

1565
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:52,600
Do is it saying that I sound like this?

1566
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:56,600
No, that was like a recording of you when you were asleep.

1567
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:59,600
Oh, that's how you breathe.

1568
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:00,600
Wow.

1569
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:02,600
That's terrible.

1570
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:05,600
I should stop breathing.

1571
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,600
Next one is called.

1572
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,600
Wait, did I download that one?

1573
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:10,600
Yes.

1574
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:12,600
Next one is called a win is a win.

1575
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:14,600
Three, two, one, go.

1576
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:16,600
What's up, baby?

1577
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:18,600
Baby voice.

1578
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:24,600
I called you guys back in August to say that I was going to be 22 soon.

1579
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:32,600
And that was bummed out because I listened to the Nate's Virginia Republican story back when I was like 16.

1580
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:38,600
And I still had not had sex, but in this time I have in fact had sex.

1581
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:41,600
And it wasn't good, but it was sex.

1582
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:42,600
That's crazy.

1583
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:44,600
Hey, congratulations.

1584
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:46,600
Progress Nate is forever.

1585
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,600
Yeah.

1586
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,600
Progress Nate is forever.

1587
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:52,600
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1588
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:54,600
Congrats on the bad sex.

1589
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:58,600
That rules.

1590
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:00,600
That rules.

1591
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:02,600
Character development.

1592
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:03,600
Character development.

1593
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:05,600
We're all developing over here.

1594
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:07,600
I'm amused.

1595
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:09,600
Hey, I'm glad you gave me the update.

1596
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,600
Thank you for the update.

1597
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:13,600
Yeah.

1598
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:16,600
A win is a win.

1599
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:18,600
Yes, it's true.

1600
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:20,600
Next one is called love you guys.

1601
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:22,600
Three, two, one, go.

1602
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:23,600
Okay.

1603
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:25,600
Maybe it is in fact say it wasn't good.

1604
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:26,600
No.

1605
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:28,600
It was just kind of awkward because it was.

1606
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:29,600
It was the first time.

1607
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:30,600
Yeah.

1608
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:32,600
And it was gay sex.

1609
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:35,600
Oh, well, that's that's never good.

1610
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:36,600
But a win is a win.

1611
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:37,600
That's no good.

1612
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:39,600
No, I think as a win.

1613
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,600
You can't have can't have gay sex.

1614
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:42,600
That's evil.

1615
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:43,600
No.

1616
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:44,600
It's evil.

1617
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:46,600
No, you must die.

1618
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,600
No, you're evil.

1619
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:50,600
No, God says you are bad.

1620
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:54,600
What the fuck does God know about the progress Nate's podcast?

1621
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:55,600
God.

1622
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:56,600
Okay.

1623
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:58,600
This is the least godly place.

1624
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:03,600
God is like an AI so advanced that he could draw any.

1625
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:06,600
And he could draw boobs that are any size.

1626
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:07,600
I was there.

1627
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:09,600
Are there boobs?

1628
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:10,600
Is God.

1629
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,600
Wait, because there.

1630
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:22,600
Can you imagine that God boobs so big that even God cannot draw them?

1631
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:28,600
Is it like that God has boobs so big that even God cannot draw them or is it that God can do anything?

1632
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:29,600
No.

1633
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:33,600
And there's no such thing as a big that God can't try it.

1634
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:36,600
I'm talking.

1635
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:38,600
No, I'm thinking of other.

1636
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:41,600
You zoom out on the universe and it's just a big booby shape.

1637
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:43,600
No, they're so big that they can.

1638
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,600
Where's the nipple of the universe?

1639
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:48,600
That's what the Nomai are really looking for.

1640
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:54,600
Well, I'm glad they died instead of finding it.

1641
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:56,600
The next one is called I'm a hungry.

1642
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:57,600
What should I eat today?

1643
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,600
You should eat some kebab.

1644
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:00,600
Kebab.

1645
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:01,600
I say it kebab.

1646
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:03,600
I'm not sure if that's like a stupid way to say it.

1647
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:09,600
It always sounded stupid because it's kebab, but it's like an American thing to say kebab.

1648
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:12,600
Yeah, I think Americans say kebab.

1649
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:15,600
But even though it's not spelled that way.

1650
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:17,600
But anyway, that's what I'm hungry for.

1651
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:19,600
So this guy should be hungry for it.

1652
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,600
Yeah.

1653
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:21,600
Eat dirt.

1654
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,600
Eat gruel.

1655
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:24,600
Sure.

1656
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:26,600
He gruel gruel is good.

1657
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:27,600
It is.

1658
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:29,600
It's like porridge kind of oatmeal.

1659
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:33,600
This is sort of like a gruel in a sense.

1660
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:34,600
Next one is called funny man.

1661
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:35,600
Where are you?

1662
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,600
Yeah.

1663
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:37,600
Kyle and funny man.

1664
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:38,600
Right?

1665
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:39,600
That's what it was, right?

1666
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:40,600
Kyle.

1667
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:41,600
Kyle and the funny man.

1668
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:42,600
The saga.

1669
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:43,600
They ended, right?

1670
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:45,600
They had their grand finale.

1671
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:49,600
I don't remember what happened.

1672
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:51,600
I remember there was a grand finale.

1673
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:55,600
I couldn't tell you the details of it.

1674
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:57,600
Those were the days though.

1675
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:04,600
You know, that does make me nostalgic for Kyle and funny man.

1676
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:05,600
Where is he?

1677
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:08,600
He's off being funny somewhere, you know?

1678
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:14,600
Just as we all knew he would one day.

1679
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:16,600
And Kyle was just being Kyle.

1680
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,600
Kyle's just not Kyle died, unfortunately.

1681
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:23,600
Kyle got pancreatic cancer and he didn't make it.

1682
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:24,600
Sorry.

1683
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:28,600
He was good material for the funny man's like stand up routine.

1684
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:30,600
He's working on it.

1685
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:32,600
He's building his repertoire.

1686
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:34,600
He's making his tight five.

1687
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:39,600
Next one is called today is Tuesday, three, two, one, go.

1688
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:40,600
Oh.

1689
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:41,600
It's me again.

1690
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:42,600
Shit.

1691
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:43,600
Oh, how are you?

1692
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:44,600
I see how you are.

1693
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:46,600
You are on the way.

1694
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:48,600
I like how you are.

1695
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:51,600
You are intelligent.

1696
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:52,600
Can you understand?

1697
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:53,600
No.

1698
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:54,600
Why?

1699
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:55,600
Jesus.

1700
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:56,600
Why?

1701
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:59,600
Jesus fucking Christ.

1702
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:01,600
Thank you.

1703
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:02,600
Shit.

1704
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:05,600
That should not have gotten a laugh out of me.

1705
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,600
That sucks.

1706
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:13,600
That just makes me think of today is Friday in California.

1707
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:14,600
You know that?

1708
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:16,600
I don't.

1709
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:22,600
There's a gimmick account on Twitter that posts it every Friday and it's like some Japanese

1710
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:25,600
movie and it's like a guy.

1711
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:27,600
He's like he's on an operating table.

1712
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:30,600
I think he's like a corpse, but he like sits up and he's alive.

1713
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:35,600
And he says today is Friday in California.

1714
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:38,600
And the like a cop goes like, huh?

1715
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,600
And the corpse like shoots him with a gun.

1716
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:41,600
And that's the clip.

1717
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:43,600
And I don't know the context.

1718
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:48,600
It's like a cool like 80s one liner, but very strange one.

1719
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:49,600
Yeah.

1720
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:50,600
Yeah.

1721
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:51,600
That's not on purpose.

1722
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:56,600
Next one is called and three, two, one, go.

1723
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:59,600
Oh my God.

1724
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:00,600
No.

1725
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:01,600
No.

1726
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:02,600
That's enough.

1727
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:03,600
Enough, enough, enough.

1728
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:06,600
Couldn't get a single word out.

1729
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:08,600
Appreciate the thought.

1730
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,600
Next one is called L for Ben St.

1731
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:17,600
Three, two, one, go.

1732
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,600
All right.

1733
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:20,600
Thanks for the voicemails.

1734
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,600
Thanks for the voicemails.

1735
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:24,600
Next one is called uplifting true facts.

1736
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:26,600
Three, two, one, go.

1737
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:29,600
Yo, Dick Masterson got swatted.

1738
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:30,600
That's pretty good.

1739
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:33,600
Wait, really?

1740
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:34,600
Swatted for what?

1741
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:39,600
Like was it legitimate or like swatted as in like he was streaming and then they said.

1742
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:44,600
I think when you get swatted, that's not, that's bad.

1743
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:49,600
I mean, I know when a SWAT team comes around is bad, but like the act of swatting someone

1744
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:53,600
streaming live who has done nothing just to harass them.

1745
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:55,600
That is what I imagine this means.

1746
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:58,600
I mean, that's pretty bad.

1747
02:12:58,600 --> 02:12:59,600
That's pretty bad.

1748
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:03,600
I don't know, even though I don't like Dick Masterson, I don't know if I can, I don't

1749
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:05,600
know if I can condone such a thing.

1750
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:10,600
However, if a SWAT team had a reason to go there and they found something that would

1751
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:14,600
be very juicy, but I suspect that's not what this is.

1752
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:18,600
Yeah, I wouldn't, I don't know.

1753
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:23,600
I'm going to assume that it was just some guy randomly swatted him and like, I've got

1754
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:25,600
a, I've got a tut tut.

1755
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:30,600
I've got a tut tut that that's, that's rough.

1756
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:35,600
But oh well, bad things happen all the time and I'm not going to worry about it.

1757
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:43,600
Uh, next one is called PCP fans costumes for Halloween, like how Homestar does.

1758
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:45,600
I don't know what that is referencing.

1759
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:47,600
I know Homestar Runner.

1760
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:48,600
I just haven't seen it.

1761
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:55,600
Every, I mean, every Halloween they have like a, you know, all the characters have a costume.

1762
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:57,600
Like every show?

1763
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:03,600
Uh, no, there'll usually be like, there'll be a Halloween special and everyone, you know,

1764
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:05,600
everyone's got a costume that year.

1765
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:10,600
Or there'll be like a special menu or something and you can like, yeah, like hover your mouse

1766
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:14,600
over everyone and see like, oh, what are they dressed up as this year?

1767
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:16,600
Oh, it's like a website.

1768
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:19,600
I thought it was a like video show.

1769
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:21,600
Well, it's both.

1770
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:25,600
It's a website with video cartoons.

1771
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,600
What?

1772
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,600
That's crazy.

1773
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:29,600
Are you just not, are you not familiar?

1774
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:31,600
I'm not familiar at all.

1775
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:34,600
I just know that it was a thing.

1776
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:35,600
Uh, yeah.

1777
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,600
Well, it was flash based.

1778
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:43,600
So there were like interactive things as well as cartoons.

1779
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:53,600
I think that why would, why would fans costumes like fans aren't typically featured in a thing?

1780
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:57,600
I think he means, do you mean like, we are we going to do costumes?

1781
02:14:57,600 --> 02:14:58,600
I don't want to do.

1782
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:00,600
I hate it.

1783
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:02,600
I'm going to get a costume.

1784
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:03,600
I know.

1785
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:06,600
When I said last time, I was going to get a costume.

1786
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,600
I didn't really know what I wanted.

1787
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:08,600
I thought you were lying.

1788
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:09,600
I thought you were lying to me.

1789
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:11,600
But damn, you're telling me you were serious?

1790
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:12,600
Damn.

1791
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:13,600
I'm serious.

1792
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:17,600
I'm going to get a costume and it's going to be normal goth girl.

1793
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:21,600
And it's going to be, uh, that's what I'm going to be.

1794
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:23,600
Not even a Halloween thing really.

1795
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:24,600
Yeah.

1796
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:26,600
That's, that's not really much of a costume.

1797
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:27,600
That's just.

1798
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:28,600
Yes.

1799
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:29,600
That's, that's the, that's the joke.

1800
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:30,600
It was not a joke.

1801
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:35,600
It's the serious secret tactic where I say I'm going to get a Halloween costume and

1802
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:38,600
then I just become a goth and wear it every day.

1803
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:39,600
Hmm.

1804
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:41,600
That's a good trick.

1805
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:42,600
It's a good life hack.

1806
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:47,600
I need to go, I need to go clothes shopping for goth, for goth girl shit.

1807
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:48,600
Yeah.

1808
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:50,600
Uh, next one is called PCP.

1809
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:54,600
No, it's called specifically PCP related ones.

1810
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:55,600
Oh.

1811
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:56,600
To costumes.

1812
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:01,600
Oh, are you asking like, if you're asking for like PCP related costume ideas?

1813
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:03,600
I mean, God, I don't know.

1814
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:04,600
Like fuckers.

1815
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:05,600
The samurai.

1816
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:08,600
Dress up as Kyle and funny man.

1817
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:10,600
You should go as Kyle and funny man for Halloween.

1818
02:16:10,600 --> 02:16:12,600
Everyone will know exactly what you're talking about.

1819
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:13,600
Yeah.

1820
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:18,600
Or, or you could be the PCP mascot guy who's just got his mouth open and he's like.

1821
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:19,600
Yeah.

1822
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:20,600
From a manga.

1823
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:24,600
You could be a Riddle My Ass Batman.

1824
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:27,600
Or just the Riddler.

1825
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:28,600
It's just the same.

1826
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:32,600
Looks the same as the Riddler, but you'll know that you're not the real Riddler.

1827
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:34,600
You're the PCP version.

1828
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:37,600
That's a good costume.

1829
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:39,600
Next, next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder.

1830
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:41,600
Play Delta Bruin chapter two.

1831
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:42,600
Okay.

1832
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,600
Then Ben's Weekly Reminder.

1833
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:44,600
Catch it to one piece.

1834
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:45,600
Okay.

1835
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:48,600
Then there's some YouTube links that you know what, I'm not even going to check them.

1836
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:49,600
I'm not even going to check them.

1837
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:50,600
We never check them.

1838
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:53,600
If there's no information involved, then there's no reason to click.

1839
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:55,600
Then there is happy birthday Ben.

1840
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:56,600
Okay.

1841
02:16:56,600 --> 02:16:58,600
Then there's I miss the old PCP.

1842
02:16:58,600 --> 02:16:59,600
Wait a minute.

1843
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:00,600
There's one second of audio.

1844
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:02,600
Three, two, one, go.

1845
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:03,600
Okay.

1846
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:04,600
They cuffed.

1847
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:05,600
It's just a cough.

1848
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:11,600
If you miss the old PCP, you can go listen to it over on the procrastinators.com.

1849
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:13,600
No, you can't.

1850
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:15,600
Or on the YouTube.

1851
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:16,600
No, you can't.

1852
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,600
You're banned.

1853
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:18,600
Oh.

1854
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:22,600
Well, you could go listen to, you could become a patron and listen to the old bonus episodes.

1855
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:24,600
That's true.

1856
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:26,600
Years and years and years and years of those.

1857
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:28,600
It was like 60.

1858
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:29,600
It's almost 60.

1859
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:34,600
There will be 60 bonus episodes one day soon, I think.

1860
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:41,600
Next one is called NB Parents, Maddie, Mappa, Dama, Nori, Nibi, Nody.

1861
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:42,600
What the fuck are you talking about?

1862
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:44,600
I have no idea what he's talking about.

1863
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:50,600
I guess these are words you could call your non-binary parents and like, sure.

1864
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:51,600
Oh.

1865
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:56,600
I could make up any fucking combination of syllables that I want and say, why don't we call non-binary parents?

1866
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:59,600
Why don't we call them, why don't we call them Dimbuses?

1867
02:17:59,600 --> 02:18:00,600
Oh, I see.

1868
02:18:00,600 --> 02:18:01,600
Oh, yeah.

1869
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,600
Oh, yeah.

1870
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:03,600
I have two binary, non-binary parents.

1871
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:05,600
There's Dimbus and there's Migmog.

1872
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:06,600
Sure.

1873
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:07,600
No, no, no.

1874
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:11,600
They're combining like things like Maddie's mom and daddy.

1875
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:13,600
Mappa is like Mampa.

1876
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:15,600
Mappa, Dama.

1877
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:17,600
What does Nibi mean?

1878
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:20,600
Nori, Nibi and Nody.

1879
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:25,600
Is that supposed to be like a gender neutral, like no, like a negation?

1880
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:30,600
I think you could teach a baby to say Nibi or Nori.

1881
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:33,600
I guess.

1882
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:36,600
Problem solved.

1883
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:37,600
Sure.

1884
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:42,600
You could just call them whatever you want and that's true.

1885
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:46,600
Next one is called Sweetness in Mains.

1886
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:49,600
Loud equals funny at gibmail.com.

1887
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:52,600
This is going to be shit, isn't it?

1888
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:54,600
Three, two, one, go.

1889
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:55,600
Ain't it all just food?

1890
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:57,600
The courses are arbitrary.

1891
02:18:57,600 --> 02:18:59,600
You can eat three bowls of ice cream at 2 p.m.

1892
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:01,600
You can eat a steak at 7 a.m.

1893
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:03,600
You can eat wings and fries whenever you want.

1894
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:07,600
I just can't bring myself to think X isn't suitable for this course.

1895
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:09,600
I just like the food sensations in my bard.

1896
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:12,600
I don't want arbitrary dish tyranny ruining any of that.

1897
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:13,600
You're a dictator gib.

1898
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:14,600
Totalitarian.

1899
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:16,600
You're killing me.

1900
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:18,600
What is he talking about?

1901
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:27,600
He was talking about how I can't handle a sweet flavor in a main course or a starter

1902
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:29,600
as opposed to the dessert.

1903
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:35,600
Because I always bookend, not bookend, but I end a meal if I have a dessert.

1904
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:37,600
It's a sweet thing.

1905
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:41,600
And so it just feels wrong to have sweetness before the dessert.

1906
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:42,600
And that's just a me thing.

1907
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:44,600
I wasn't dictating what you should do.

1908
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:47,600
I just feel like if I'm having a thing,

1909
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:51,600
I want it to be non-sweet unless it's dessert.

1910
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:57,600
I mean, there's not there's not very many sweet foods that I would eat as like a main course.

1911
02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:03,600
I think the thing I brought up was like certain curries have dates in them.

1912
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:07,600
They're sort of sweetened and savory at the same time.

1913
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:09,600
But I just don't like it.

1914
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,600
Don't do it to me.

1915
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:12,600
You can do it.

1916
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:13,600
You can do it.

1917
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:15,600
But that's you.

1918
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:19,600
I mean, I think I'm not.

1919
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:22,600
I think I wouldn't care.

1920
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:24,600
Yeah, I think I need a sweet entree.

1921
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:26,600
I'll eat a peanut butter and fluff sandwich.

1922
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:27,600
Yeah.

1923
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:28,600
Yeah.

1924
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:29,600
I don't give a shit.

1925
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:30,600
It's just a me thing.

1926
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:32,600
It's not prescriptive.

1927
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:33,600
All right.

1928
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:34,600
Gotcha.

1929
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:35,600
No.

1930
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:36,600
I got no.

1931
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:39,600
I got no scruples about anything.

1932
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:41,600
Next one.

1933
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,600
I think this is the last one.

1934
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:46,600
It's called Herder Carbon Offsets Are Scam.

1935
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:48,600
Three, two, one, go.

1936
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:52,600
What do you mean carbon offsets are a scam?

1937
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:57,600
Like, yeah, there are some shit ones like pay this login company not to cut down the forest that they were never going to cut down.

1938
02:20:57,600 --> 02:20:59,600
But there's a whole spectrum of them.

1939
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:04,600
There are better ones that replace equipment and infrastructure in poor countries so that their people can go through their activities generating less carbon.

1940
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:08,600
And yeah, from some senior companies, these estimates can be off by 300 or 400%.

1941
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:15,600
But some companies do better testing to make sure that the offsetting methods they provide are accurately measured so that they don't fuck over their customers.

1942
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:20,600
And if you don't trust anyone, there's still the ultra reliable method of direct carbon capture.

1943
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:23,600
This is way overpriced compared to every other method of dealing with climate change.

1944
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:26,600
But it's also way easier to measure, making it more reliable.

1945
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:27,600
And guess what?

1946
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:33,600
The ass I was talking about who offset his NFT this way bought credits for 10 times more carbon than the relevant transactions emitted.

1947
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:37,600
And within that mix, he bought some from a company that does direct carbon capture.

1948
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:40,600
Carbon offsets can be fucked up, but good companies exist.

1949
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:48,600
And if you overpay 10 times, as some people such as the YouTube channel jet lag do, then you can truthfully and reliably offset your carbon offset.

1950
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:54,600
I guess I would agree that there are good carbon offsets.

1951
02:21:54,600 --> 02:22:04,600
But like, I think the use of carbon offsets to excuse NFTs is not good enough.

1952
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:08,600
I would rather you don't do any of that and you only do the carbon offsets.

1953
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:11,600
You don't buy the NFT at all.

1954
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:12,600
Leave that alone.

1955
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:13,600
It's just bad.

1956
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:27,600
I mean, yeah, so carbon offsets are something that a company can do to reduce carbon emissions, right?

1957
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:31,600
Reduce carbon emissions or like he was saying, like take carbon out of the atmosphere.

1958
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:33,600
There's there's things you can do.

1959
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:35,600
There's things that are possible to do.

1960
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:43,600
But like, well, in the case of NFTs, I don't like, yeah, they're bad for the environment.

1961
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:46,600
That's not like specifically why I think they're bad.

1962
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:48,600
They're bad for all kinds of reasons.

1963
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:57,600
So I don't know the fact that they can be carbon offset doesn't really help my opinion of them.

1964
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:04,600
I'm not sure if that was this guy's goal was to be pro NFT on the basis of carbon neutrality.

1965
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:11,600
I mean, I think you thought we were just completely uninformed about the fact that carbon offsetting can work.

1966
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:12,600
Yeah.

1967
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:15,600
Well, I just I'm sure I'm sure it can work.

1968
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:16,600
I'm sure it can work.

1969
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:32,600
But like what does my reservation my reservation of like citing carbon offsets with regards to stupid things like NFTs is that it feels like an excuse.

1970
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:42,600
It feels like it could be very easily manipulated and like like used to like, I don't know, bolster the credibility of things that suck.

1971
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:48,600
This yeah, like this guy says like it can be fucked up and it can be like dishonest and it can be ineffective.

1972
02:23:48,600 --> 02:24:02,600
So yeah, probably is a lot of the time with something with something with something scammy like like NFT companies, I think are probably even more prone to that.

1973
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:25,600
Like if there if there was, I don't know, a very strict like pipeline of like that you could easily look at to see to prove that they are saying that they are actually offsetting the right amount of carbon and that they're not fucking around and that the companies are all above board and stuff.

1974
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:27,600
That would be one thing.

1975
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:39,600
I still wouldn't like NFTs anymore if they did that if they if they can offset if they can offset the carbon from, let's say, an NFT.

1976
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:42,600
Why don't they offset even more carbon?

1977
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:47,600
Why don't they just keep why don't they just keep offsetting carbon?

1978
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:54,600
Why do they why would must they stop when I think why must they stop at net zero?

1979
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:57,600
Why can't we go into the negatives?

1980
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:04,600
The I think they just don't want to spend more money offsetting the carbon than they have to.

1981
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:13,600
Can we just I mean this is kind of a separate thing but like hmm I mean if we can just do that, can we like subsidize like more of that?

1982
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:17,600
Can we like pay more tax money to like offset even more carbon emissions?

1983
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:18,600
Can we just do that?

1984
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:19,600
Is that a thing?

1985
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:31,600
I mean we could just do that but the government doesn't want to because it's expensive and not as popular as it needs to be for that to be like a it should be more popular.

1986
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:32,600
It sounds good.

1987
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:35,600
There's enough people who don't like saving the planet.

1988
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:42,600
It sounds like it's something that would probably be worth some money.

1989
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:55,600
It's sort of like COVID like if the if the situation is dire enough the government can get a lot more done than it usually does.

1990
02:25:55,600 --> 02:26:11,600
If it actually wants to like it can it can fund the creation of a vaccine much faster than the bureaucracy normally would allow it and the funding that would take a lot longer to get you know given to the people who need it to do the work.

1991
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:14,600
If the situation is fucked up enough.

1992
02:26:14,600 --> 02:26:19,600
I feel like with climate emergency the situation is clearly it's fucked up.

1993
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:27,600
I feel but it's like it's not immediate enough for the people to actually do as much as they really should be.

1994
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:29,600
Yeah, yeah.

1995
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:31,600
Well, that's okay.

1996
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:33,600
We just it's we just got to get it really bad.

1997
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:35,600
We just got to bring we got a brinks minute.

1998
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:37,600
We got to acceleration it.

1999
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:43,600
We should just get it as bad as possible as fast as possible so we can get to the point where we were someone will do something.

2000
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:44,600
That's all.

2001
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:51,600
Yes, let's burn down every tree and become the Lorax.

2002
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:55,600
Exactly.

2003
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:58,600
Well, that was the last that was the last voicemail.

2004
02:26:58,600 --> 02:27:01,600
Thank God I've had enough.

2005
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,600
Let's go back to outer wilds.

2006
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:04,600
That was more fun.

2007
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:06,600
Yeah, but I've said everything.

2008
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:09,600
Yeah, it's it's it's a little tricky.

2009
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:14,600
I don't want to accidentally give you the solution to something.

2010
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:16,600
Yeah, that's fair.

2011
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:18,600
Well, I don't know.

2012
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:21,600
I feel like I'm getting getting somewhere with it.

2013
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:26,600
So I might have finished it by the end of this week.

2014
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:29,600
Perhaps maybe I could see it happening.

2015
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:31,600
We'll see.

2016
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:33,600
I gotta pee.

2017
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:34,600
I gotta pee really bad.

2018
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:37,600
The episode's almost over.

2019
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,600
So we should probably just end the episode so I can go do that.

2020
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:41,600
Okay.

2021
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:42,600
Okay.

2022
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:43,600
Well, patreon.com.

2023
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:53,600
So step procrastinators if you want to listen to a bazillion bonus episodes from all the way back years and years ago and also today.

2024
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:57,600
The time capsule from many different times.

2025
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:00,600
You might say.

2026
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:04,600
Pete speak up dot com slash PCB voicemail.

2027
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:16,600
If you want to send us something that we will maybe listen to if it doesn't take our boxes for things that need to be skipped and ignored.

2028
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:19,600
We're very, we're very picky.

2029
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:21,600
We're very, very picky.

2030
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:30,600
We're very, very scrupulous about what we will allow into our content.

2031
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:32,600
And I guess that's it.

2032
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:34,600
Anything else?

2033
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:35,600
No.

2034
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:36,600
I'm hungry.

2035
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:41,600
I want a kebab but I've had enough.

2036
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:46,600
I ate like a lot last night and I've used up all my calories for the day.

2037
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:50,600
Well, now what am I going to do?

2038
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:53,600
You're going to eat more calories, Ben saying.

2039
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:55,600
I should just get a fucking kebab.

2040
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:56,600
Fuck it.

2041
02:28:56,600 --> 02:28:58,600
Yeah, if you're hungry, you should eat.

2042
02:28:58,600 --> 02:28:59,600
That's normal.

2043
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:01,600
I just want one.

2044
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:04,600
I just haven't had real food in a while.

2045
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:06,600
I mean, now I want one.

2046
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:08,600
Yeah, that's what I want.

2047
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:10,600
Order something from Mr. Shawarma.

2048
02:29:10,600 --> 02:29:12,600
I'll probably do that later.

2049
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:13,600
All right.

2050
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:15,600
That's the episode for the week.

2051
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:19,600
Tune in next time for more Outer Wilds Talk probably.

2052
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:22,600
And nothing else.

2053
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:23,600
Yeah.

2054
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:24,600
Yeah.

2055
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:28,600
I will try to get Clarissa Gunspoke done quick.

2056
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:29,600
Based.

2057
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:30,600
I want to get it made.

2058
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:31,600
I want to make it a day.

2059
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:32,600
I'm going to do it.

2060
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:33,600
Based.

2061
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:35,600
I'll try to get my video done.

2062
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:36,600
Maybe my video will be done this week.

2063
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:37,600
Maybe.

2064
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:38,600
It could happen.

2065
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:39,600
It's getting there.

2066
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:42,600
Only two more hours to go.

2067
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:43,600
All right.

2068
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:44,600
Bye.

2069
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:45,600
Bye.

2070
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,600
Bye.

2071
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:47,600
Bye.
