00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,800
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:41,280
guy ever and here is Hippocrit. And Munchy is here. Semperfied Delos to all our armed forces.

3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,080
And just so everybody knows, this is the PCP. It's a show where a bunch of YouTube and other

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,600
place content creators, we just get together and we talk about stuff. There's your introduction

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:11,240
if you don't know what this is, that's what it is. Our topic today is The Military. What

6
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:24,720
an enigma. What can you even say about the military? Nothing. I've got the Urban Dictionary

7
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,720
open. Some of the definitions are lame. So I just went to the one that is like a bunch

8
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,920
of definitions. So here's like the third entry and there's like five of them on here. So

9
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,880
here we go. Military. A government department, it's got like that parentheses S, charged

10
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:49,240
with defense of national borders, two members of the military department forces in parentheses

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:56,240
for some reason, an armed government department employed to ensure security and home and abroad.

12
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,000
That's clearly a typo. Nobody gives a fuck about Urban Dictionary, I guess. An armed force

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,720
used to subdue or oppress groups which oppose governmental policy at home or abroad, and

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,840
a designation which bestows virtual sainthood in some cultures. Oh, I get it. That's like

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,160
the joke one. Okay, cool. So that's it. That's the military, the armed forces of nations.

16
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,880
I love war. I just want to say that. As a little boy you're told war is bad and you

17
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,600
don't want World War III. I guess I don't want World War III. But then you read about

18
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,920
all the fiction, all the stories, all the real life stories, all the cool things, all

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:45,280
the toys. Military war stuff is the coolest thing ever. War is a great time to rise through

20
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,960
the social ranks. You know this Alexander Hamilton, the play Hamilton, the musical that came out

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,600
not too long ago, that everyone tries to be like, oh, Hamilton's such a wonderful guy

22
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,920
and this is a perfect boy. But yeah, he pretty much wanted war so that tons of people would

23
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,320
die. War is not good so that he could rise through the ranks and grow. That was his

24
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,480
opportunity to do so. So he was kind of hoping for that shit nonetheless.

25
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,400
And Nate, you actually went to go see Hamilton, but then the entire cast wouldn't start the

26
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,800
show and they just berate you. And you're accomplice for not not respecting minority

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,080
rights and how you need to use your extreme executive power effectively.

28
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
That's right.

29
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,280
Like what the fuck?

30
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,480
I didn't appreciate that. That was very rude, but I will work on forgiving them in time.

31
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,520
As I strip away all their civil rights.

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,600
I want to clarify. Conflict is terrible. Conflict is like, oh, there's a group of people and

33
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,480
they're being bombed by this nasty guy and then there's other bombs going off and there's

34
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,080
drone strikes. That's boring. That's cowardly. It's terrible.

35
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,800
There's civilian deaths. Don't like civilian deaths. I do like battles with armies. Like

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,440
if we were to go to war with a country, let's just say, fuck you, we're going to war. Send

37
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,240
everyone, the robots, the nukes, the whole gang, the whole gang's here.

38
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,440
I love the idea and the romance of battles and war. But if we're talking about the military,

39
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,560
it's pretty fucked up.

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,440
That attitude is what started World War I. Everyone was real interested in like, man,

41
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,600
we've got all these militaries. We haven't used our weapons in a while. We've got all

42
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,280
these new ones like this mustard gas bombs and shit. Let's just have a big war. Then

43
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,480
they did and that was World War I and it was a little bit of that.

44
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
A little bit.

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
A little bit.

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
That's pretty much what started it.

47
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,520
We got to decide first of all, instead of just meandering around the idea of armies

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,280
and war and the military, what are we going to discuss about the military? Are we talking

49
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,440
about like in general or like current or American vs. UK military?

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,000
We can talk about like historical stuff, but I think more interest, you know, more like

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,280
relevant would be like modern military and like its place in the world and what we think

52
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,520
about and what it's doing, all that good stuff. Semper Fidel is to all our armed forces.

53
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Exactly. But I have something far more important, military fashion. The Prussian slash early

54
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,400
empire had the best military fashion, Google search, Franco-Pussian war uniforms for some

55
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,080
fresh shit. You World War I Britain has some good shit too, but fucking debate me. All

56
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,960
fucking pickle helms, that shit were fucking sick. They were great.

57
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:35,120
I've always had a pension for SS officer uniforms. You know, I'm quite fond of them. I think

58
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,040
they're very attractive looking. The Nazis had impeccable fashion. There's no denying

59
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,120
it, at least for their officers, for their officers.

60
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,120
Barais have never been like cool until the military decided that they were the thing.

61
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,400
I agree. You think of a barais, you think of like a French guy with onions around his

62
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,240
neck and going home, I'm gay, a whole home. They're very afraid of vampires in France.

63
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,920
Yeah. Well, no, it's onions. It's werewolves with onions. Werewolves hate onions, right.

64
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,400
Vampires are like werewolves with onions. And mummies hate parsley. Just wave some parsley

65
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,840
in a mummy's face and you got that boy spooked. I'm pretty sure that's how that works.

66
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,440
Barais, like the British officers types, they're like, I'm in charge and I have a red

67
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,640
beret and I'm cool. And I'm like, yeah, you are. I believe you. You do need to have that

68
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,840
said. Yeah, I agree.

69
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,000
What about, okay, that's true and all, but what do we think about, you know, like, so

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,960
times have moved on and like if there were to be like a World War three, it would be

71
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,320
a big deal because the last like big old war, of course, is World War two. And that ended

72
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,960
with the advent of nuclear weapons. So like that's on the table now. And that's a big

73
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,640
deal. And I don't know how much we want to talk about like war, specifically versus

74
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,160
I think, I think if there is going to be a World War three, nobody is going to admit

75
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,840
that it is happening and that it's being called World War three because nobody wants

76
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,400
to live in a world where World War three is happening because so much time has passed

77
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,080
since the, you know, what it was called at the time of the Great War.

78
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,480
It would be really bad PR to have World War three.

79
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,920
It's not about PR, but I'm just thinking like general people, they're always like, oh,

80
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,960
World War three is just around the corner. It may already be happening.

81
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,440
Well, like the Cold War is kind of like the World War three, just in the sense that like

82
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,720
most of the world was divided up between like two sides. And I mean, at least America and

83
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,560
Russia or the USSR and like all its subsidiaries and shit. And then like, but of course, like

84
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,680
the whole, the whole thing there was like, we couldn't afford to escalate that to a bigger

85
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,320
war because if we did, and that's maybe why nuclear weapons are kind of good because they

86
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,280
force you to find other things or else everyone's dead, even though that threats on the table.

87
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,160
You know, if you don't find a way to, to avoid that outside of like, I mean, now that, you

88
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,440
know, nukes are on the table, like you're going to get a nuclear war and that's not so good.

89
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,320
It's not so spicy.

90
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,520
The next time a nuke is used, I think will be

91
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,280
to be a big deal. It's gonna be a big deal. And probably people will say, okay, now it's

92
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,440
happening like now World War three, because like you can't, you can't back down from like,

93
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,800
well, now we're going to try a certain this out peacefully because we knew you know what

94
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,760
the most likely thing for that is. I think that the most likely thing I think that probably

95
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,680
will happen at some point, but it's going to be like some sort of dirty nuclear bomb that

96
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,600
like a terrorist organization gets their hands on somehow, because like more and more countries

97
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,280
are getting their hands on nukes and shit. It's just, you know, the technology is known.

98
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,200
It's out there for like 60 years now. So I think that's going to happen. It's not going

99
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,040
to like destroy a country or anything. It's going to be very bad. And it's going to radiate

100
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,080
like a population somewhere. And it's going to be fucked up. London, I think it's almost

101
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,760
inevitable. Yeah, Olympics, baby. Here we go, drop the bomb.

102
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:02,880
Fun fact. Did you know that during the Korean War, a U.S. general wanted to just use a nuke

103
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,560
on China, not like on their capital, but just like to like stop their advance, like just

104
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,080
a tactical nuke just wait, wait, do you mean China or Vietnam or Korea? I mean, in the

105
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,160
Korean War, China helped North Korea. I was right. So they wanted to nuke China to stop

106
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,840
the North Korean advancement or something. Yes. Yeah. Okay. All right. I'm fine. Yeah.

107
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Okay. I mean, you know, there's certainly a tactical advantage to using a fucking nuke,

108
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,120
but just think about how like how fast we would all be dead if that were to transpire.

109
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,320
Exactly. Exactly. So I think it's I think the moment that a single nuke is used, we are all

110
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,760
dead. And you might as well just say your yeah, it's it's it's it's kind of that's the nature

111
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,040
of deterrence. It's kind of it's so big a threat that it's kind of hard to wrap your head around

112
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,680
being scared about it. Like at any moment, a country could decide, you know what, we're

113
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,200
going to suddenly start using these. Fuck you. Boom. North Korea, dude, North fucking Korea.

114
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Yeah. And it's like, oh, well, they have nukes and they could nuke us and we could be dead within

115
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,680
a day or two. And if we're not dead, the whole rest of our country will be in nuclear quarantine

116
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,400
and would be enough. All of infrastructure will fall apart and would be in the slums and it'll

117
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,280
be terrible. And you're like, you're thinking about how bad it could possibly be. And you're not

118
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,560
shying away from it, but it's just it's just too big to be like scary in a way that you can

119
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,320
understand. You can't feel that fear until it's like actually happening to you.

120
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
The people that are the most interesting to me in there are the South Korean people because like

121
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,720
right across that fucking Waller River, whatever it is, there is North Korea has nukes could easily

122
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,520
drop them on South Korea if they wanted to. And that's the big thing with why, okay, so North Korea

123
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,920
is possibly the most dangerous nation like in the world right now because they're so fucking crazy

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,760
and they worship, you know, like this one dude who runs the whole ship and can do whatever the

125
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,960
fuck he wants because he's like a god or something to the people. So like because of that, if we go

126
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,600
in and try to like take that guy out as a lot of people want to because he's just a toxic element

127
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,920
on the world stage, like the most likely thing that would happen is that we can't like instantly

128
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,720
take out all their defenses and they just dump everything they got on South Korea. They're holding

129
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,280
like at least all of Seoul like the capital which is right across the border. They're holding all the

130
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,600
population of Seoul is held captive to prevent like any action against North Korea period.

131
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,640
And like there's just and those people like I was listening to an NPR story I think about like

132
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,760
interviewing what South Koreans think of North Korea. Like they're hoping to get like a resolution

133
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,360
at some point. They want diplomatic talks. In fact, I think they just elected a president

134
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,560
who ran on a platform of like reform, reforming relations with North Korea. I mean who knows

135
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,120
that has any chance of working. I'm certainly no expert in the politics. But like they want that

136
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,520
to happen but like they are just like yeah like it's too big to think about for them. The fact

137
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,920
that every single day they could be wiped off the face of the earth at the whim of King John Moon.

138
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,200
Yeah, sure. This isn't the world politics, PCP. This is the military. It's related but yeah you're

139
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,160
right. I kind of wish it was. Let's talk about PCP. This is the fashion. This is fashion piece.

140
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,240
Yeah, yeah. Fashion Seoul. I guess. I guess. Dude. Dude. We're not in a fashion so cluster punk dude.

141
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,000
What is? Military fashion is so fucking cluster punk. What are you talking about? It's not cluster

142
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,760
punk at all. It's the most streamlined like disciplined organized possible fucking thing.

143
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,840
It could be. That's what we have to all achieve too. When the dark carnival starts. The jugglers

144
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,680
assemble their armed forces. Now that will be a cluster punk military. No, no. People will be too

145
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,440
scared to call it world war three so they'll just call it the dark carnival. They will be too horrified

146
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,120
to call it world war three. So yeah, we're in the midst of a dark carnival ladies and gentlemen.

147
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:02,160
All it would take is for Donald Trump to say I am now a juggler. I'm down with the clown.

148
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,280
And American brothers and sisters. And like everything will come true that was in Homestuck

149
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,560
just like we all thought. Just like we all knew. It will all come true. Guy Fieri will be there,

150
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,520
you know. Trump says I'm Dan and Clown ladies and gentlemen. He says as a nuke explodes behind him.

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,680
Like he puts on the shades like cool like walking away from explosions.

152
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,080
As he nukes his, cause he fucking nukes the White House, his own fucking house. He's just like

153
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:37,040
fuck this shit man. This is the carnival baby. And it gets replaced with a black and white house.

154
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,360
What a fucking North Korea just explodes itself. That point in life.

155
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Well, you know, that sounds pretty cool. Unfortunately, like, you know, to the rest

156
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,920
of the world, excuse me, like the North Korean people are also like brainwashed people being

157
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,280
held hostage. You know, who knows, I don't know what they, if they actually like believe this

158
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,640
shit. I mean, I'm sure to some level they do cause the propaganda has been so intense.

159
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,880
I got an angle. I got an angle for this. For about the military. Your favorite historical army

160
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,520
thing. Like from age of empires or civilization. Fucking whatever you know. What is your favorite?

161
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,000
I like, I don't know. You go first, give, let me think while you say something.

162
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,480
Well, I played age of empires too a lot and, uh, fucking love that game. Learned so much more

163
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,280
about history from that game than I ever did in my books. That's what video games are. Video games

164
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,760
are teaching makers. They're like books only good. They're like books, but you don't have to open them.

165
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,160
You have to click on them though. Double click. But you have to install Linux and then boot your,

166
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,960
you know, Windows andulator. You have to fucking draw your own game. And then you have to draw every

167
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,800
frame. Yeah, exactly. Every frame literally a gimp painting is the way it's said.

168
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,200
Every frame of PNG.

169
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,160
But, uh, fucking, I loved, uh, in that the English longbowmen, mostly because I'm English and that's

170
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,440
like, oh yeah, I want to be an archer now. I want to be a longbowman. But because also that if you

171
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,120
get like 50 of them, uh, they can just completely decimate like anybody because they've got the

172
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,440
longest range. And it's so cool to see all those arrows flying. God, I love, I love arrows, dude.

173
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,840
Um, um, you would also nice. I fucking love knights and castles. Okay, but

174
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,240
Knights are you would love Sif five because they have longbowmen. England has longbowmen

175
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,480
a longbowman in that game, and he's fucking overpowered because he can see so fucking far.

176
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,000
He can see like millions of miles at a time. He is he's

177
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Fucking literal, literally elves were based on Longbowmen. I'm making that up, but it makes sense to me.

178
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I mean, J.R.R. Tolkien was English, so pretend you were wrong.

179
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Proven confirmed.

180
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But did you know, here's a stupid gay fact. Did you know that it was required by law that every male has to learn to be an archer in England?

181
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And that was a law that was never stopped. It's still in effect. It's just nobody fucking gives a shit.

182
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's pretty sick.

183
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's awesome.

184
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There's these weird old laws in America that you have to carry a gun on your way to church on Sunday in New England.

185
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Because there were Indian raids going on, so they wanted all the men to be armed and shit.

186
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But still, in some towns, you are by law ordered to carry a gun with you to church wherever the fuck you go.

187
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't see why that's a law. You just do that normally.

188
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah, I hear you, dude. Jesus wants to see us pack any heat.

189
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I still killed the Native Americans on my way to church still. No one stopped me yet.

190
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You didn't get the memo.

191
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You know, okay, my favorite military, I think, I mean, I'm quite fond of the Nazis.

192
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm quite fond of the Nazis as well.

193
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You know it, bro.

194
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
They were pretty cool, but I'm definitely going to give it up to the Persian slave hordes.

195
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The Persian slave hordes are totally dope and they're full of magic.

196
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm basically basing this just on 300, but they're fucking sick, bro.

197
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And they hurl themselves endlessly and they just die in agony and pain.

198
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
They don't want to be there, but they're forced to be there by their god king.

199
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's the army for me. That's what I want to know.

200
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Any army that uses elephants is so good.

201
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So cool. So what elephants are the coolest?

202
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Big guy with a big nose swinging out around.

203
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You could pick up a club. You could whack him with a club.

204
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Like, yeah, that's exactly what I want to see on the battlefield.

205
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The most powerful nose in the Middle East.

206
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
All right, Munch, what do you like?

207
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, I don't know about that. Israel's got a powerful mouth.

208
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah, that's true. I could really sniff out a deal if you know what I'm saying.

209
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There's a lot. There's quite a bit, so I'm just going to rattle off some.

210
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
My all-time favorite war of all time is World War I.

211
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
My favorite period of time is the 1800s through 1900s.

212
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Everything before is gay, besides the ones that aren't,

213
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and then also everything afterwards is gay, except it's not. It's even better.

214
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So yeah, World War I, I like Venezuela.

215
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I like the South American Wars of Independence. All of them pretty cool.

216
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I like pretty much anything in Europe.

217
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Anything there is good, besides when it involves anything in East Europe,

218
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
because each Europe is gay.

219
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And everything in the ages is gay.

220
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

221
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So which military force is your favorite, though?

222
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh, wait. Oh, that. Oh, shit.

223
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know. They're all pretty bad. I hate them.

224
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm like, okay, really?

225
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What about the fucking World Warriors from Scotland?

226
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh, my God.

227
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, my God. The Dragon Queen.

228
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, wait, fucking the Romans. The Romans, they're the coolest.

229
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
They made a fucking turtle's things with their fucking shields.

230
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
They made turtles on the battlefield.

231
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Wait, you mean the, fuck, the phalanx?

232
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Because that was a Greek thing first, wasn't it?

233
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No, no, the Roman, well, maybe it was, but the Romans developed...

234
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It was in 300, bro.

235
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah, okay.

236
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Whatever.

237
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But the Romans, they invented, like, mass producing by means of, like,

238
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
making the equipment exactly the same by using molds and stuff

239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and making everything to order exactly the same

240
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
so that their shields could very easily lock together

241
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to make, like, big old, like, you couldn't fucking get them.

242
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They're just impenetrable.

243
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's the coolest.

244
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's true. That's the phalanx, right?

245
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't know whether it's called a phalanx,

246
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
but if you type in Roman turtle thing, you'll find some shit.

247
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Also, asterix and obelisk is my dad.

248
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I just want that to be known.

249
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay, what was that one?

250
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's my favorite thing.

251
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Hippo, red pillion whales.

252
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's just England, right?

253
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Alright, whales is the little bump on the left side of the UK, England.

254
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Great, like, yeah.

255
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I know that at one point, I think it may have been a country with a king,

256
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
but I'm not actually sure that it ever was

257
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and I'm not sure that it ever was not part of England,

258
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
but they just speak a different language and they have a flag

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and we're like, fine, just have it.

260
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It rains all the time over there.

261
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
We don't care.

262
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I know that, I mean, Scotland has referendums on independence sometimes

263
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
that I think, yeah, that didn't pass last time.

264
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Does whales ever have, like, referendums for independence?

265
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Is that a thing they do?

266
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, well, that's the thing, because I've heard once,

267
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and I don't know whether it's true, but it was probably true,

268
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
because it was on television,

269
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
that whales is not technically its own nation,

270
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
but it's treated, it has a border and you need your passport

271
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and it's basically a nation,

272
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
but they don't really care about seceding

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
because they have no real infrastructure,

274
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
like their biggest exports are like Tom Jones

275
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and stuff like that.

276
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What is Tom Jones?

277
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What's your pussycat?

278
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

279
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, I see.

280
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That guy, oh my god, I'm clipping.

281
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
He's from Wales? Is that like an American?

282
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
No, no, there's a lot of Welsh singers

283
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that are very, very good at singing.

284
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
For some reason, I think it might be the language.

285
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They're just good at singers.

286
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
They're good at singers. They make good singers

287
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and that's what they export. That's my point.

288
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm clipping the mic and I've got to change the mic.

289
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Well, let's, okay, let's talk about,

290
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
let's completely shift gears back to military stuff,

291
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and let's talk about the current American military

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and what we think about, because that's the thing

293
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
that we have the most, oh wait, I forgot, you're from England,

294
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
but nonetheless, you can talk about the British military

295
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
to care too, but like, I mean,

296
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
some of the guys that we were hoping to have on here

297
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
actually grew up near fucking military bases

298
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and know a lot of people in the military.

299
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh, did you? I didn't know that you were,

300
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
they're that near one. Okay, what do you think?

301
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What do you think of our fine men and women in uniform?

302
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Here is my opinion of people in the military.

303
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Every single day, there is a helicopter

304
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
or a plane that runs over my head very fucking fast

305
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and he always scares me because he just thinks

306
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
this is the day. This is the day where I get 9-11.

307
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's about to happen, but now it's finally transpired

308
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and I am about to become the 9-11.

309
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But it never happens and I'm getting increasingly upset.

310
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Like, if you're gonna do that to me,

311
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
why not just fucking pull the trigger, you know?

312
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You're upset that they're just delaying the inevitable.

313
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Right, right. And soon those will be drones instead.

314
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh no, 9-11 drones.

315
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah.

316
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That will truly be 7-11.

317
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I live next to like a huge military base

318
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and there's like a town that's developed around the military base

319
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and all of them are just rich assholes.

320
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And so, I don't know, they're pretty gay.

321
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Actually, no, I went to a bowling alley one day on the base

322
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
with a military friend and I like bowling.

323
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So there, you know what, they're good.

324
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I've changed my opinion. They're actually really nice people.

325
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
On the basis of they like bowling too.

326
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah.

327
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I don't really know a lot of people in the military

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
but I have found everybody to be very, they're very professional,

329
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
they're very polite.

330
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
These guys seem like they know what's going on with the shit around them.

331
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So, I don't know, I like them.

332
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I guess I just, this isn't even really a criticism of the military

333
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
but I don't like people with guns near me at all.

334
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I don't like when people could kill me if they want to

335
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
because I don't know these people

336
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and I don't know if they're actually sane or crazy.

337
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It always spooks me when I see like, when I'm in like the airport

338
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
or just like a, I don't know, like in Penn Station

339
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
a couple times I've seen like people with guns walk around

340
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and like military people.

341
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah, it's a little spooky, it's a little spooky.

342
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I just don't trust anyone in the world

343
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
including like the military or the politicians

344
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
or my friends or family.

345
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I don't trust anyone. I'm on my own. I'm on my own.

346
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And when there's people with guns, yeah, they scare me a little bit.

347
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
They scare me a little bit, including cops.

348
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I don't think you hate freedom of speech.

349
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I mean the Second Amendment.

350
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Whatever, you hate guns?

351
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh my fucking god.

352
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Thank you for condensing my argument to the important part here.

353
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Jesus Christ.

354
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You know, I don't know how true this is

355
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
but I've always felt like, maybe it's just my own propaganda

356
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
on my side of the pond.

357
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But the general feeling I get is that the American military is big

358
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
but it's not like tightly constructed.

359
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Like they have bunches of soldiers and bunches of stuff

360
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
but there's a larger percentage of them that are just not that well-trained

361
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and they fuck up and do bad stuff and kill one guy.

362
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Now hang on, hang on a second there.

363
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't know if that's at all true.

364
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Huh?

365
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because like, I mean, how many military people do you and I really know?

366
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I have no idea what's the process of military training

367
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
but I feel the need to feel better than you guys

368
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
because my military is smaller.

369
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, you would get to Paris and I see.

370
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah, yeah, it's smaller because obviously there's less people

371
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
but because of the smallness and the fact that we're an island

372
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
we have like a big old naval thing, we've always had that

373
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and we've got a good air force

374
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and we're like more tightly woven.

375
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We're like a scare force.

376
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Hey, I'm scared now.

377
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Like, you know, put together very, very carefully and properly and trained

378
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and like you gotta do it right otherwise you're gonna get slapped.

379
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Do your bootlace.

380
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What softener?

381
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You can't drink the tea while you fly the plane.

382
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I know nothing about fucking military, why am I here?

383
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, here's why.

384
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I want to join the military

385
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and I want to drive a tank

386
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
and I want to shoot a head.

387
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Consider this your official signing into the military.

388
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm leaving the PCP, I'm joining the military.

389
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That's what I'm gonna do.

390
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
They do bigger podcasts there.

391
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
They get more money per podcast.

392
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
They do podcasts while doing drone strikes.

393
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That's what they're about.

394
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's an upgrade in a big way.

395
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Those podcasts are way better because they have like live feeds

396
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
of the people they're bombing.

397
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's so cool.

398
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's part of the drone.

399
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's very engaging.

400
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's basically like soldiers react to carnage

401
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
that they're causing.

402
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Let me say this.

403
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I want to do that.

404
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You should.

405
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I think about, I have a lot of respect for military people

406
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
because I think that a lot of them do all their shit for the right reasons

407
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and that they, I mean I'm too cowardly to want to do this shit

408
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
but they really are willing to put their lives on the line

409
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and risk it for stuff.

410
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I guess I didn't really say about the people who joined the military.

411
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I think it's generally a silly idea

412
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but I see why people do it.

413
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's like part, you want to be like a hero.

414
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You want to be protecting people.

415
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You do it for a good reason, hopefully.

416
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You don't just want to shoot people.

417
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You want to protect your country.

418
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You feel proud and all that and this stuff.

419
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But I feel like it's generally, it's pretty silly

420
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
because the government may have like a stupid idea

421
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
that they want to send you to the wrong place and kill the wrong people.

422
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You have to trust your government really

423
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
or whoever's commanding you if you're in the military.

424
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's just like, I don't know.

425
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I wouldn't join the military because I don't trust

426
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
really any government to put me in the place

427
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
that's going to do the best for the world at large.

428
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I would care about my country more just in general

429
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
because that's where all my friends and family are

430
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and where I am, I don't know.

431
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's a very big thing.

432
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I say that not joining the military is like pirating video games.

433
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's like that.

434
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Because you are reaping the benefit of like

435
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
labor that other people are doing, people in the military.

436
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I mean obviously the degree is different.

437
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You are profiting from like other people's work.

438
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And yes of course we all pay taxes and shit

439
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and if you're in the military you get paid

440
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and good things come to you if you do so.

441
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But you're taking an extreme risk doing that kind of shit.

442
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You're putting yourself at the very least in harm's way

443
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
even if it's not extreme risk.

444
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You could have like a desk job or whatever.

445
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But you're part of this machine that's doing defense.

446
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And you know what, I mean that's kind of silly.

447
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I thought somebody would yell at me and I would concede

448
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
that it's not actually like pirating video games.

449
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I was going to totally agree with you as a joke

450
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
because it sounds so funny.

451
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Like a one-to-one correlation is exactly the same.

452
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That's good.

453
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But like, okay, I got a lot of respect for these people.

454
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I always think about that scene.

455
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I watch this movie all the fucking time.

456
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
A few good men with Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson.

457
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And that part at the end, like the most famous scene of the day,

458
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
you can't handle the truth where Jack Nixon's like,

459
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
son we have a country that has walls

460
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and those walls need men to stand on them

461
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and defend the nation for people who want to destroy it.

462
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Who's going to do it, Lieutenant Weinberg?

463
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You? You?

464
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I forget the names of the other characters.

465
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But yeah, like the point is like that guy gets it.

466
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That guy realizes that like there, no matter what,

467
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
there's always going to be forces

468
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
that like want to take things that other people have.

469
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And I'm not saying, like in their case,

470
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
they're talking about like Cuba.

471
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And at the time like Cuba and America were very much not,

472
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
not liking each other so much.

473
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You know, things are different now,

474
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
but there's always going to be something like that.

475
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And I just really appreciate the people who do do that shit.

476
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah.

477
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And like I've got a personal memory of this.

478
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Like when I was a kid, I worked at Papa Gino's,

479
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
this pizza shop in Massachusetts.

480
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Nothing beats it.

481
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And like there was this, yeah, it's the best.

482
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's my favorite.

483
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And there was this guy who worked there for a little while.

484
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And he was a veteran,

485
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
but he was only a couple years older than me.

486
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I was like 17 or something.

487
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
He was like 21, 22, like really young,

488
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
but he was an Iraqi fucking veteran already

489
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and had like come back.

490
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And like he told me the story one time

491
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
about how like, yeah, you know,

492
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
one time me and my buddies were like raiding this house

493
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and you know, there was a fucking,

494
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
there was a perp there or whatever the word was.

495
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Like there was a fucking guy there trying to kill me.

496
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And so like I, you know, I,

497
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
something happened.

498
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I like fell back.

499
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I pop off a few rounds and I see this guy looking down to me

500
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and I'm like, yeah, right.

501
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm about to die for my country.

502
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You know, I'm doing what I can.

503
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm trying to just trying to, you know, be a good person.

504
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And, but he didn't dial, he didn't get shot.

505
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
He survived that particular situation.

506
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But now here he was just like barely scraping minimum wage

507
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
in this fucking pizza shop, despite being like that level

508
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
of willing to put himself in danger for like my sake

509
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and everybody else.

510
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And like the world just didn't give a shit about this guy.

511
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And like, I get it, you know, capitalism,

512
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
you are the value that you can give to the world.

513
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But like, God damn, I just felt like the world

514
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
wasn't respecting this guy enough and other people like him.

515
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That's why I said it was silly because of the way veterans

516
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
are treated.

517
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Not, not because I don't respect them because like,

518
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
they're like the jobs they do, they do very well

519
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and they have to do very well.

520
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Otherwise they're dead.

521
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So it's like, it's very respectful and it's very like,

522
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
you know, that's why I said I like war.

523
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Like it's very romantic.

524
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's very cool.

525
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Young boys all over the world.

526
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
They just, they just dream of being a tough soldier

527
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and defending their country and stuff.

528
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
When Gibb hears about a bunch of young boys in one place,

529
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
he knows that's the place he wants to be.

530
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, school.

531
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
School, kindergarten, yes.

532
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But like, yeah, it's like, they're just,

533
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
they come home and then they're fucked.

534
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Like if they had, especially if they got a leg blown off

535
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
or whatever, they get a nice award, you know,

536
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
like a little dinner for you.

537
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Fucking, it's just, it's just a really bad thing

538
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
to have to go through and then you're not even

539
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
in a position of power.

540
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You're just, you're just a grunt.

541
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You're just a throwaway object of a human being

542
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
to the government that you signed up to serve.

543
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And it's just, that's why I think it's silly.

544
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Like it's just, that's why we need robots to take over

545
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
the jobs of the military.

546
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Not because, not because of like, you know,

547
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
well actually yes, because it's better.

548
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Because, because robots, they can't feel

549
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and they don't deserve rights.

550
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And fuck them, I hate robots.

551
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
True, true.

552
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We just need Mecca and then we can just fight

553
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
with our Mecca and not have foot soldiers.

554
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Anything we can do to lower the total number

555
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
of people who die in war would be a good thing, I think.

556
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Drones, dude, Obama tech.

557
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
That's true, only drones kill 90% not the targets, you know,

558
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
they just kill like other people.

559
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Obama invented Obamacare and also Obama tech.

560
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Obama's scare.

561
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Obama's scare, there we go.

562
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What is it with you, it's scary today.

563
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I don't know, this is the Halloween episode.

564
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I don't know.

565
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
That's what these drones are called.

566
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
He invented drones, he invented Obamacare.

567
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
That's what it's called.

568
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yes, that's right.

569
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Okay, okay, okay, I have to interject here.

570
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Just catch up just like a few sentences before I continue

571
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
what we were actually talking about.

572
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Back up, I realized that my favorite military force

573
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
was actually the British.

574
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And I like the ship of the lines,

575
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I like how they go around and they fucking destroy people

576
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and minorities, and I liked how they subgrade people.

577
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And I wish that it lasted longer.

578
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh, good things, all good things.

579
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Pretty good.

580
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What time period?

581
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah, what time period, like when they were the big empire.

582
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Oh, time period, like late, like second half 1800s

583
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
until they got fucking their ass kicked.

584
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
After the Yanks broke away?

585
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like around the time when India was in full swing.

586
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Oh, right, okay, sure, sure.

587
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I really love the whole red coat sort of uniform.

588
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yeah.

589
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The funny hat.

590
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah, man.

591
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You know, George Washington wanted to be a red coat

592
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
his whole life and he never fucking made it.

593
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Instead, he just became president to the United States.

594
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Gay.

595
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah, that's the national anthem.

596
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah, it's a sick power metal album.

597
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It was from George at least.

598
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I like England, France, and Germany.

599
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I like all the western Europeans besides Spain.

600
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
If you follow me on Twitter, you know my notorious eight for Spain.

601
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
If you listen to this in Spain, I fucking hate you.

602
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Get fucked moved to Portugal or France.

603
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm gonna blacklist all of you.

604
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
All of you are blacklisted from listening to this.

605
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Hey, weren't you calling for Portugal to be absorbed by France

606
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
just so that the peninsula would look better?

607
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Yeah, I did that before I was red-pilled on Spain.

608
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Before I was fucking red-pilled on.

609
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yeah, Portugal should absorb Spain.

610
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah, the opposite.

611
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Anyway, so I like all that culture.

612
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Anyway, back to what we were fucking saying.

613
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Right.

614
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Why would I, like on military, like joining the military

615
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and like, you know, people with vets and stuff.

616
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Sure.

617
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Why would I fight for beliefs and reasons I don't believe

618
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
or I think fully understand because the government's always like doing like

619
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
weird puppet shit and they're never gonna actually tell me

620
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
what I'm actually fighting for.

621
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't have like a national identity or anything whatsoever.

622
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And even if I did, I'd better things do than like die for a cause

623
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
that I don't have a stake in.

624
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And like I respect, you know, veterans for doing this stuff.

625
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But I do not, I do not feel like I am American.

626
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And I know that's like not, I think that's like a problem probably.

627
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But I don't feel like I'm an American.

628
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You're fucking globalist?

629
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Is that what you're telling me right now, Munchie?

630
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I am literally a globalist.

631
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Close Photoshop and end yourself right now.

632
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I am literally Photoshop.

633
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah.

634
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah.

635
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I like...

636
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I understand the sentiment though.

637
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That's kind of like a millennial sentiment to feel more like a,

638
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
like maybe a human or a world citizen as opposed to a national identity.

639
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's basically the internet, you know.

640
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah, that's right.

641
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You're able for the first time to really talk to people from other countries, you know.

642
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's usually just the English speaking countries.

643
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But sometimes there's, you know, other people from Europe who speak English

644
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
like Danes and stuff.

645
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
They say, hello, I'm from Daneland.

646
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I say fuck off.

647
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's me.

648
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You say fuck off.

649
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah, but like it used to be like that, like earlier, when it's like your nationality

650
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
in a YouTube comment section would mean something and people would laugh at you.

651
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I mean, I guess they'd still do if you're on a video about like nations.

652
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Sure.

653
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But it matters so much less now because people have friends across countries so often.

654
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So normal.

655
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Where the military is concerned there, it kind of reminds me of Metal Gear Solid 4.

656
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's been like a bunch of years since Metal Gear Solid 2 happened and like the world has

657
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
changed such that like national identity has been like completely removed from like

658
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
militaries.

659
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Militaries are now just like these hired groups that just, you know, they go wherever and

660
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
they just kill anyone and like ideology or like national borders no longer have anything

661
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
to do with like the wars that are fighting.

662
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's just like economics and, and I don't know, just petty squabbles or something.

663
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I don't know.

664
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I feel like the best way to solve most major conflicts is for like a, an actual good Google

665
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
translate to translate everything from every country so that everybody could talk to everybody.

666
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
There is some issues though, like cultural, like the fact that I'm just, I'm not gonna

667
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
say anime, but like-

668
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
AI that would figure out, like know the language and then know the thing and then maybe-

669
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But, but I'm just saying some people, like just as one example, there's some, you know,

670
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
like Islamic people who want the whole world to live under Sharia law and that doesn't translate

671
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
very, like even if you understand what they want, that's not like helpful for when they,

672
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you know, want to conquer your country.

673
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah, what I mean, what I mean is like you have like, you know, let's say video games,

674
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
like video games shipped to all sorts of countries.

675
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If you have people from those games talking to each other from different countries and

676
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
they're just kids-

677
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Will that solve all our problems?

678
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah, video games will save the world.

679
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
What I mean is like, you make friends as kids when you're naive and you don't know about

680
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
like world political stuff and Sharia law and like, oh well, I didn't know that, you know,

681
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
if you're like, if you're in the Middle East and you're a kid and you're online and you

682
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
hit, you know, your friends with all these American people and then your dad says, Americans

683
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
are fucking horrible and they suck.

684
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Like some of those kids are going to be like, well, wait, I like these guys.

685
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
They're fun.

686
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
They're cool.

687
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't, I don't know.

688
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And then it's sort of, it's sort of makes the next generation a bit less prone to hating

689
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
people instantly.

690
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I think that's definitely happening right now to some degree.

691
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Definitely.

692
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's just, you know, the technology hasn't fully penetrated.

693
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
There's not enough Dota going on in like, I don't know, Iran right now.

694
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
We need to up our Dota levels a little bit so we can make this happen.

695
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Dude, dude, okay.

696
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
E-sports will save the world.

697
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
E-sports will save us all.

698
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yes.

699
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Okay.

700
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Okay.

701
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Okay.

702
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Okay.

703
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Okay.

704
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Japan.

705
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Oh my God.

706
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Seoul.

707
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Fucking Iran, bro.

708
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Iran.

709
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Dude.

710
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Top E-sports exporter.

711
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Exports, all of the E-sports, every single one is from Iran now in the future coming up

712
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
2020.

713
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Are you, I was looking into this.

714
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I had no idea.

715
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,560
I'm going to sound like a fucking idiot to people who like know politics well, but you

716
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,360
guys know that Iran like wasn't even like a very conservative place, you know, respectively

717
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,080
until like the current administration took over like 40 years ago and like the 70s or

718
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
something.

719
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,040
Like women didn't have to like wear veils and shit all the time, but now they do because

720
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,840
like there's like just the people in charge now change the country that way, which gives

721
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,520
me hope that it'll change, you know, to be more liberal in the future as well.

722
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
Yeah.

723
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
That'd be good.

724
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
That'd be good.

725
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,200
I don't know anything about the Middle East other than that there's oil and also people.

726
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,200
I know a lot about medieval Middle East, but not about a current shit.

727
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
By the way, hippo.

728
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Well, that's fine.

729
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,920
I just want to know if you also believe this because it could seem like I agree with you.

730
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,880
Do you also agree that like 90% of positive change in the world currently could just come

731
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,040
from us just like just waiting for people to die?

732
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Just like waiting for that.

733
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,320
I've had that thought like it's I've had that thought, but I feel like the amount of time

734
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,920
it would need because like people are still being indoctrinated to the old world values

735
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,240
by you know, family members and stuff.

736
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,960
It's not like people are all, you know, growing up being better or different or not.

737
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,720
But very much less so, I think, than previous incarnations of the world.

738
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,720
Less so, yeah.

739
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,440
Munchie, where that's concerned, it is always necessary that older generations die for certain

740
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,160
ideas to catch on.

741
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,180
For example, like the like our parents are probably less comfortable with like the amount

742
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,840
of time we spend interfacing with computers and like this kind of stuff.

743
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,760
So like to them, it's like a little weird and especially like two or three generations

744
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,760
before them.

745
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,520
They find it very strange that all this interpersonal communications going on and you know, maybe

746
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,600
it's bad for humans in some way, but like it's just the way that that culture is going.

747
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,240
It's inevitable.

748
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,440
So like that transformation is happening and like we're the generation that's comfortable

749
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,440
with that.

750
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,920
However, as technology evolves, as we're getting older, we're getting into our 20s, 30s, 40s,

751
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
50s, etc.

752
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,920
Like things like like VR that like plug us into virtual worlds, like it is a distinct

753
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,080
possibility that guys like us will all, we're all already too old to like really understand

754
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,360
that shit from birth and like we will be the old conjures who are like, oh, I don't understand

755
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
this.

756
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Like this is weird.

757
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,080
And so already like things are being developed that we are not prepared for and that we will

758
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,080
need to die in order for like the society as a whole to absorb it and like process it

759
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,160
and be able to, you know, use it as effectively as it can be.

760
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,000
So that's absolutely a pot like not every human is not able to just change everything

761
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,520
about what they believe.

762
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,840
Sometimes you just got to die for the culture to evolve.

763
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,920
That's just a technology, though.

764
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,480
Is there an example you can think of like an ideology like that?

765
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
Absolutely.

766
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Religion is, I mean, is a huge one.

767
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,960
Yeah, that's exactly what I was about to say, Nate.

768
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,160
Most millennials aren't fucking religious.

769
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,160
None of my friends know even who a God is.

770
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,160
Yeah.

771
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,920
They haven't ever even seen one.

772
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,080
When I see a millennial talking about God, I execute that millennial because they're

773
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
corrupting.

774
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,600
You know, this is just what I do every day.

775
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,760
I take those motherfuckers out windmill style, you know, bro?

776
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,120
Swing my arm around very fast.

777
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
That's windmill style.

778
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
Very fast.

779
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Very fucking fast.

780
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Yeah.

781
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,600
You don't even know, dude.

782
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Yeah.

783
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:13,200
Also, just like everyone in the government is soon, like they're all like 100 years old,

784
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,200
just like in a couple years they'll be dead and we'll be able to be free.

785
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
Our government is like the oldest it's ever been.

786
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,840
I mean, people live longer, but like the people in office, like, like, I was just listening

787
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
to this the other day.

788
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,760
I believe it's like Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and like whoever else, like these are like

789
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,760
the leaders or like the Democrats and like the Senate and the House or something.

790
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:37,240
They are all like over 70 and that's like, that's really, really fucking old.

791
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,280
That's still like 10, 20 years.

792
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
Like I feel like...

793
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,680
That's like the danger that they'll just stay there for another 10 years.

794
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,560
Like these people are not going to understand new ideas.

795
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,560
But the thing is...

796
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,400
There's a reason why young people push out old people, you know?

797
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,960
I know, but like I feel like the old people will try to cultivate younger people to take

798
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,560
their place and that's been going on forever and it will continue to go on.

799
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,760
I'm not saying things can't change.

800
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,040
I'm saying it's not just going to be as simple as, oh, once they're dead, there's no one

801
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,040
who wants to take their place who is also evil.

802
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,160
You're right about that, but like a generation doesn't last that long at its longest.

803
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,360
You know, maybe like 20 years.

804
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,040
So like it's true.

805
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,200
People like Nancy Pelosi, let's say that they groom, you know, to be like the new leader

806
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,480
of the Democrats and the Senate, someone like her, yeah, a pizza gate.

807
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,000
They bring in people that are like her, but just because they're younger and the culture

808
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,800
itself is changing, it's inevitable that little change is creeping just as this process goes

809
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
along.

810
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,800
And some of them are major.

811
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,840
Like the whole gay marriage question flipped over the course of like one year from like

812
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,160
outlawed to completely legal in everywhere in the United States.

813
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,200
Like it's like, I mean, that, you know, was building up for a long time, but sometimes

814
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,400
things like that can happen that quickly.

815
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,720
And it's just, you know, really the people can force their representatives to do what

816
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,600
they want when they just like make their voice heard about what they really fucking want people

817
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
to do.

818
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
Okay.

819
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
But we're totally off topic here.

820
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,800
And I did want to bring up one issue directly about the military that we haven't talked about.

821
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,040
So I for one was doing a lot of praising of like the men and women in the uniform.

822
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,560
But I did want to bring this up because I feel like a lot of people talk about this

823
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,960
when they're talking about the military, especially on the left.

824
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,280
So like, okay, so the military's job basically is to kill people who are doing bad things.

825
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,160
So let's talk about people who joined the military so that they have an excuse to kill

826
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
people.

827
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,920
Say with like the police force or, you know, like I'm actually bringing up as like, do

828
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,440
you think it's maybe good that we have that as an outlet for people who just really want

829
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,520
to fucking kill people?

830
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,200
And like we have two choices.

831
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,840
We can like institutionalize them and keep them away from society in some way, or we

832
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,200
can put them to work killing the people we don't want around.

833
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,560
And I'm not saying wars are justified, just like, you know, we shouldn't just kill people

834
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,560
who are bad.

835
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,080
But if we can find like, I'm just going to say, if you're an ISIS, you should die.

836
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:01,200
So I'm totally cool with you people all being sacrificial land to make our murderer population

837
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
happier.

838
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
That's what I'm saying.

839
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,560
Find like the general difference between UK and US armies that I've seen from various

840
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,760
documentaries and various, I don't know, it may be propaganda, I may be talking out

841
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,600
of my butthole, but stop getting trying to give me to join the British military give

842
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
guide.

843
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,600
Damn it.

844
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,560
It's it's just there's this feeling of like, if they want to kill people, why not put

845
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,400
them in, you know, with a gun?

846
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,960
Which I don't I don't like as an idea because you shouldn't enjoy killing.

847
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,400
And if you do, you're more you're more likely to, you know, you're more likely to be fucked

848
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:43,760
up in the head and make a bad decision and get someone else killed or like, you know,

849
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,880
the military has to be a tightly run ship.

850
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,280
You need to be, you know, all properly coordinated and communicating and doing your job as you're

851
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,960
told because if you don't, you know, whoever makes the plan, if that plan doesn't go right

852
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,240
because some, you know, asshole on the field is just decided, no, wait, I can get him.

853
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,240
I can get him.

854
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,240
Yeah.

855
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,240
Should and guns.

856
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,240
Yeah.

857
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:11,320
And then the whole operation is fucked and, you know, it leads to other deaths or casualties

858
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,920
or or losing ground or losing position.

859
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,360
It's like, I feel like people who are fucked up in the head enough to want to kill a lot

860
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,240
of people should just become hunters and shoot deer or something.

861
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
Yeah.

862
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,720
It's not really a place because in the military, I obviously discipline is the most important

863
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
discipline.

864
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,720
Yeah.

865
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,680
That's the word I couldn't think of the fucking whole time.

866
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,480
Discipline, I feel is the most important.

867
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,240
You can't you can't go you can't go to war and be like a like a guy with a club.

868
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,240
You got a gun.

869
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,240
You got to aim right.

870
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,240
Well, let me, you know, I just think some people in their nature have a killer instinct

871
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,400
and I guess like, and that's a good, like me, you know, I just kill, I kill millennials.

872
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,400
That's my thing.

873
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
I'm the millennium killer.

874
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
That's, that's me.

875
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,600
I am the Zodiac killer also.

876
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,760
I don't even know what I'm saying that like it's good that there's a place for people

877
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,280
to go if they want to kill people.

878
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,280
I don't know.

879
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,760
I guess that's what I'm saying.

880
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,760
It's better than not having that.

881
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,200
I just, I don't think everyone with a killer instinct is an evil person necessarily.

882
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,800
There are good ways you can channel that.

883
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,000
I guess that's my point.

884
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I don't, I don't even know.

885
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah.

886
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Well, that's the thing.

887
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,160
I don't think a good way to cause like you can give them like therapy that can make outlets

888
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,160
for them.

889
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,600
Maybe if they really like hitting things, they could be like a guy who, a junk guy.

890
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:37,080
He smashes junk, junk into cubes with his bare fists or maybe, maybe you could pick

891
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,920
up drumming and just go wham, wham, wham.

892
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,040
And he could be a better person through, you know, something other than getting a gun and

893
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,440
killing a human being.

894
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,240
Like I said, hunting, like, like that is a thing that people can do.

895
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,400
It's killing, but it's like regulated and shit.

896
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,640
Yeah.

897
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,640
I guess I hear what you're saying.

898
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,240
I guess I'm really just like approaching the idea of like, I feel like if we had a bunch

899
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,840
of hardcore lefties on the show, what they would bring up is like that they don't like

900
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,960
the military.

901
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,800
I hear this from people like Jimmy Dorr, they freak out about like people are in, people

902
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,600
are cops or in the military because they want to hurt and kill people and they like that

903
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,920
feeling of control that it gives them.

904
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,920
I don't know.

905
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,120
Like you think that's a serious thing?

906
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,920
You think that's like a big deal?

907
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,640
I think it's, I think it's, it's, it's a kind of an unavoidable problem because you're giving

908
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:32,480
people power and there's obviously going to be people that want to abuse it.

909
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,920
And you know, it's not much you can do about it, except like having stricter training and

910
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:46,320
making sure people who are prone to abusing power get weeded out early on or banned or

911
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
stuff.

912
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,520
I don't know.

913
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,840
I feel like if you give a police officer a gun way too early before you know whether

914
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,400
he's going to shoot some guy or if the same thing with the military, if you give a guy

915
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,640
a gun before you know that he's not going to just shoot some random kid because he's

916
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,840
brown, like I'm not, I'm not going to get into a race thing, but like, you know, some

917
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:16,040
guys just like killing and I think you should, you should do it properly.

918
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,320
Yeah.

919
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,960
I don't want to be, I don't, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a gay, I'm not gay guys, I'm not

920
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,960
lefty.

921
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,960
Oh, no, I'm gay.

922
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,960
Oh, it doesn't matter.

923
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,960
It's fine.

924
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,960
No, I hear what you're saying.

925
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,680
Oh, hey, let's, let's just, it's, it's the thing I feel like, like, I don't, I don't

926
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,680
want to be.

927
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,680
You don't like, yeah, I think I understand what you're feeling.

928
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,560
I don't want to be a world peace faggot because I know it can't happen.

929
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,120
People like war, people like fighting.

930
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:46,520
I like, you know, the fact that war is cool is, is the reason it's going to continue.

931
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,160
You don't have been thinking about recently.

932
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,920
I've just been thinking about how I tend to spend a lot of the time in the theoretical

933
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,320
realm when I'm talking about my weird utilitarianism and shit.

934
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:01,280
I think I'm going to try to incorporate more of like present day realities into the things

935
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,280
that I'm thinking about.

936
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,280
I'm just going to try.

937
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,720
I don't know if it's going to work out, but that, that's kind of why I wanted to talk

938
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,280
mostly about like the, the military right now because like, I guess ideally a military

939
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,800
would be like Starfleet and like those people are like full-time employees shut up, shut

940
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,800
up, shut up.

941
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,320
I'm just, I'm, I'm just saying, I'm just saying.

942
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,840
You said immediately going back to Star Trek.

943
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,840
Well, just to make a goddamn point about what I'm not going to talk about as much.

944
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,840
Oh fuck this.

945
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
All right, let's.

946
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,840
No, I get it.

947
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,840
I get it.

948
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,840
Okay.

949
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,840
Yeah, you understand.

950
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,640
Like what I like about them is like their military like has another job that they do

951
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,440
the full like all the time they are explorers, but then like when there's a conflict, you

952
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,440
know, that's when like they're called in to, you know, defend and shit.

953
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,440
Okay.

954
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Let's talk about one more.

955
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
Let's talk about one more question.

956
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,440
Wait, what are you saying?

957
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,440
Hold on, hold on.

958
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,440
I just realized.

959
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,440
The military should be a Star Trek.

960
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,440
It should be all like Star Wars, Battlefront 2.

961
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,440
No.

962
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Every single like, like they're just a bunch of stormtroopers on each side and then once

963
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,440
they get enough points, the one who can turn into Darth Vader and then lose the push.

964
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,440
Yeah.

965
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,440
Yeah.

966
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,440
Dude, it's so true.

967
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,440
That is what it is currently.

968
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,440
Now, right now, after I said that, Obama was like, oh my God, we should get this guy on

969
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,440
the phone.

970
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,440
You're a soldier.

971
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,940
You kill like 15 people.

972
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,440
You turn into Barack Obama.

973
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,440
Yes.

974
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
That's right.

975
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,440
You can do the whole smash.

976
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,440
You should get Jedi floors.

977
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,440
You go down.

978
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:29,600
You use your fucking Nobel Peace Prize, Nobel Phantasm and just decimate everyone with

979
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,600
love gay beams.

980
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,600
All right.

981
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Yeah.

982
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,600
That's what happens.

983
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,600
Okay.

984
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Let's talk about one more question about this issue.

985
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,600
Okay.

986
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,600
What do you got?

987
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,600
Here we go.

988
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,600
Topical alert.

989
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
Oh no.

990
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,960
We got the trans community ban from serving in the military.

991
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,480
Trump did it.

992
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,480
What do you think?

993
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,480
Verdict.

994
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:56,840
Well, from what I hear, the whole thing, from what I hear that the issue was that people,

995
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:04,880
trans people, they go into the military, some of them do, to get the free surgery to change

996
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,880
gender.

997
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,320
Otherwise it would cost a lot.

998
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,960
And I think that's the reason, but obviously people are taking it as like, Trump hates trans

999
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,960
people and he just for no reason decides to ban them from the military and they are

1000
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,960
their soldiers too.

1001
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,640
People may have constantly taken the worst possible reading of anything Trump does as

1002
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,720
like what it must mean, but yeah.

1003
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:32,680
So I guess if those things about people abusing the system are correct, then I feel like it's

1004
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,720
probably like drastic to ban all trans people, I guess, if you're, if you have trans surgery.

1005
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,960
Like if you're already post-op and you just want to serve, it's like, yeah.

1006
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:48,600
Or you could ban like the usage of military funding for your surgery and stuff and it

1007
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,480
could be very specific surgeries that you could have, like getting a new arm if you

1008
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,840
lost it, like stuff like that, banning them, I don't know.

1009
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,840
It's obviously, you know, a thing that's getting people riled up, but I don't see too much

1010
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,440
of a problem with it, except for the fact that people are fucking pissed.

1011
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,960
You know what's interesting about it to me?

1012
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,560
I think it might actually be a distraction tactic because it's so random that Trump might

1013
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,280
have just done it to make people forget all the other shit that's going on, like the Russian

1014
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,720
investigation and shit.

1015
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,200
He actually just did it because he thinks it would like make people talk about that

1016
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,080
a lot and like he's willing to, you know, just whatever, take whatever heat comes from

1017
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,320
that to just distract people from the other shit.

1018
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,320
I don't know.

1019
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,320
I don't know.

1020
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:39,200
I'm not too, you know, Trump politic, literate, knowledgeable.

1021
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,920
It's inevitable that comes up a little bit when we talk about this shit.

1022
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,840
I think basically we're all going to agree, like banning them across the board, like what

1023
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
is that?

1024
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,320
Doesn't really seem like the right policy.

1025
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,680
Like there's probably some awesome trans people who really want to be fucking warriors.

1026
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,040
Chief Monk, this is Shovel Knight from Famous Video Shovel Knight.

1027
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,040
Oh no.

1028
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,560
My favorite military was Ruin.

1029
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,800
Oh, fuck.

1030
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,600
But like, yeah, the thing about the Trump thing is like it was a tweet that he sent

1031
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,480
out that said that Trump was not allowed in the military.

1032
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,920
Dude, the generals were like, whoa, whoa, you didn't talk to us about this first, dude.

1033
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,920
You just tweeted it.

1034
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,920
No, no, no, no, no.

1035
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,920
Not that, not that.

1036
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,000
But like the idea is that he tweeted it, but his actual policy like in writing might

1037
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,560
be different and might be actually less extreme than what he said, which is maybe the case

1038
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
a lot of the time.

1039
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Nobody cares to look it up.

1040
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,080
If that's true, though, he should just shut his fucking fat face and just like deliver

1041
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:42,840
it properly the first time and avoid the shit, unless the whole point of it is to distract

1042
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,040
and enrage people.

1043
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,920
Like maybe that's actually what he's, I don't fucking know.

1044
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,440
Anyway, I don't even want to talk about Trump.

1045
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,440
He's a fucking bummer.

1046
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,560
Well, I have an actual other military topic, like side to side.

1047
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
Oh lord, okay.

1048
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,560
It's just like the idea.

1049
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,440
Jesus Christ.

1050
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,720
How dare you bring that into this sacred podcast?

1051
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
Okay, God.

1052
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,720
It's the idea of the spending of the budget.

1053
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
Oh yeah, okay.

1054
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Military budgets, I think we can all agree are fucking ridiculous because of the facts.

1055
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,880
They eat up such a massive amount of the budget.

1056
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,880
It's ridiculous.

1057
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,640
It's really just because of the way budgets work.

1058
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,400
One year they say, okay, well, we need some more fighter jets, so we've developed this

1059
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
new fighter jet.

1060
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,480
We're going to build 100 of them and it's going to cost this many billion and we build

1061
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,600
them and then the next year, well, in order to have that amount of funding for this year,

1062
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:41,280
we need to spend that many billion again, otherwise we won't get it the next year and

1063
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,880
we need that funding because we're used to it now and we don't want to not have it.

1064
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:52,000
So they just make more shit that's never going to get used because they don't need

1065
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,520
that many extra jets.

1066
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,800
There's so much waste.

1067
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,800
So much fucking waste.

1068
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,800
Yeah.

1069
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,800
I'm looking at it.

1070
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,680
I just hate the way I hate the way budgets work.

1071
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,840
Why do they work like that?

1072
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:05,000
Every single thing that's wrong is because budgets work on that basis that if you don't

1073
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,840
spend it, you don't get as much next time.

1074
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,840
Oh, I like this.

1075
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,520
You're talking about all the right things now.

1076
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
Yeah.

1077
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
Yes.

1078
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
These are these are solvable problems.

1079
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,440
Theoretically, that's what I want to talk about.

1080
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:20,280
I'm I put up a pie chart of American discretionary spending for the entire government in 2015.

1081
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,480
$1.11 trillion, so $1.11 trillion.

1082
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:32,560
The military budget, 54% of all spending was the military $598.5 billion.

1083
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,120
That's too much money.

1084
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,720
That's too it's it's I mean, it's more than half.

1085
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,720
It's more than half.

1086
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,080
Fucking food and agriculture is 1% of the budget, transportation, 2%.

1087
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,240
Social security, unemployment and labor is 3%.

1088
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,680
And people are screaming about how social security is like killing the American budget.

1089
00:57:51,680 --> 00:58:00,680
Meanwhile, fucking military, 54% of the entire fucking budget science, all science, 3%.

1090
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,520
3% of the fucking budget.

1091
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,520
What is this?

1092
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,520
What is this bullshit?

1093
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,520
All right.

1094
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,020
You know, this is not good.

1095
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,020
This is not good.

1096
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,520
Guys, we got to fix this shit.

1097
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,040
I got to look up the UK budget things for that because I don't I've never really looked

1098
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,040
it up.

1099
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,920
It's probably less than America's because we're crazy.

1100
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,920
We're crazy.

1101
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,520
Well, like a percentage wise, it probably it might it might be around the same.

1102
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,520
I mean, America.

1103
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,520
Okay.

1104
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,160
To be fair, America has unique responsibilities because like we are strategically placed with

1105
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:31,960
our military like throughout the world in a like stabilizing fashion like that that

1106
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,960
is true.

1107
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,080
So like it makes sense that we would put more into it.

1108
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:40,720
But like Jesus Christ, $598 billion.

1109
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:46,400
And like, you know how much it would take to like make like state college free?

1110
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,340
It'd be like it's like a couple billion or something and like everyone could go to college

1111
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,340
for free.

1112
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,720
That's like not even 1% of the budget.

1113
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,040
Oh, it's fucking nuts.

1114
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,800
And like they argue endlessly that there's no way to take money away from this.

1115
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,560
You could just look at this and you know that's not true.

1116
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,440
You know it's not true.

1117
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,440
I want to know your opinion.

1118
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:17,200
Do you what is your opinion on the U.S. being like an intervention, like just fucking like

1119
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,400
like going around the globe and just kind of like intervening and shit?

1120
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
What do you think about that?

1121
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,240
Well, I don't like that we're being a bunch of fucking globalists probably using Photoshop

1122
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,920
to make all our goddamn logos and shit.

1123
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,440
So I'm not I'm not a big fan of that American flag made in Adobe.

1124
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,440
Thank you.

1125
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,440
Disgusting.

1126
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,440
Fuck yourself.

1127
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,280
Wait, I think that was your name.

1128
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,640
I can't say that I like it, but like I get it.

1129
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:48,440
Like America's got its shit together when it comes to just like, I don't know, like

1130
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,440
building its economy.

1131
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,720
I mean, this is getting less true over time as we go, but like for a while there, like

1132
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:57,240
after World War II, America just had its shit together better than anyone else in the world

1133
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,240
by far.

1134
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,240
Yeah.

1135
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,240
It was great.

1136
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,240
It was really, really good at the time.

1137
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,240
So, you know, those those legacies continue, but like things like us jumping out of the

1138
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,480
fucking climate, the Paris climate agreement are like kind of fucking with our position

1139
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,480
there.

1140
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,480
Trump get your shit together.

1141
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,480
Okay.

1142
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,280
In terms of like being interventionist, like the the the super lefty position is to say

1143
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,760
like, no, just like leave everybody alone, dude.

1144
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:25,040
Like what are you doing going into these countries and like, I don't like the fucking, I don't

1145
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,680
know anything about like world events really, but like there was some genocides that like

1146
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,520
didn't we invade Libya or something under Hillary Clinton?

1147
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,960
And like, why did we do that?

1148
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,960
I don't know.

1149
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,760
Under under President Hillary Clinton.

1150
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,760
Yeah.

1151
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,760
Yeah.

1152
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,440
During her day back in like 2008 or whatever, or I don't know, like 2007 or something.

1153
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
Yeah.

1154
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,440
Like, okay.

1155
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,440
That's that's not good.

1156
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,440
No, that was under fucking Bush or whatever.

1157
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,920
Sometime recently we invaded Libya or something like lots of people died.

1158
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,000
I don't know why we did it.

1159
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,560
I have no fucking awareness of these things.

1160
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,560
Okay.

1161
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,560
But like Iraq, right?

1162
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,560
Okay.

1163
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,560
Iraq's like the obvious one.

1164
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:02,320
For literally no good reason in terms of like what we said we were doing it for, like there

1165
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,200
was all this cover about like it's got something to do with weapons of mass destruction or

1166
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,880
like Osama bin Laden's there.

1167
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,960
Like it was, it was like two years after 9 11 and ultimately it was completely unrelated

1168
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,680
and we were like fed all this bullshit and like, okay, I just recently looked into this

1169
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,680
shit.

1170
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:24,080
Fucking Dick Cheney, vice president under under fucking the, you know, George Bush W.

1171
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,440
He was like, okay, this is going to again be super obvious to anyone who knows anything,

1172
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,440
but I'm a baby boy.

1173
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,880
I just learned that he worked for, I believe it was like he was like the CEO of Halliburton

1174
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,840
or like a really high ranking guy at Halliburton, which is a defense contractor that was given

1175
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,800
contracts to go fucking fight in the Iraq war.

1176
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:46,480
Like, like, this is like the most obvious thing I've ever heard now that I'm aware

1177
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,640
of the facts.

1178
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,680
Like they just started a war so they could make money and then like take the oil and

1179
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,680
shit.

1180
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,480
They just obviously benefited the people who made the decision to engage so obviously,

1181
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,080
I don't know how the fuck they got away with it or people didn't make this clear to me

1182
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,080
sooner.

1183
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,200
I blame everyone else for me not knowing this fact.

1184
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,760
Um, uh, I, yeah, I might be, I don't know if 100% was Halliburton, but it was like something

1185
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,760
like that.

1186
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,120
Like that's fucked up, dude.

1187
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,320
Like what the, okay, whatever, I'm not going to go into it anymore.

1188
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,320
But that's not good.

1189
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,320
Okay.

1190
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,320
Things like that are not good.

1191
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:22,040
The only time America should do any kind of interventions thing is like, if we're like

1192
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,720
asked to give help to like a country that's, I don't know, like fighting against like an

1193
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:29,560
internal terrorist organization or something like, okay, obviously that's like a thing

1194
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,560
that makes sense.

1195
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,160
If there's a civil war going on somewhere, like, like in fucking, uh, Syria right now,

1196
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,640
like it's a mess and it's not clear which side is like better.

1197
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:45,000
But like, I could see why we should like do something about that situation.

1198
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
We shouldn't.

1199
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Okay.

1200
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,880
Like I don't think it's America's responsibility to be world police or like manage the whole

1201
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,080
fucking world.

1202
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,000
But like, I mean, at the very least to be cynical about it, we could at least like protect

1203
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,040
our investment in the world and like try to make sure the world around us doesn't fucking

1204
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:04,560
fall apart and we can still continue to like do trade and, you know, be a healthy member

1205
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:08,480
of the world economy and make sure that the people we trade with aren't like, first of

1206
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,320
all, like are able to like actually have materials that we can trade with and get get us things

1207
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:17,120
that we want and you know, utilize their population to make goods and services that we need.

1208
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,480
But then also like we can, and then we can worry about like the humanitarian thing, like

1209
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,720
okay, maybe we'll maybe let's trade with North Korea.

1210
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,720
You know, maybe we shouldn't.

1211
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,480
That guy like literally has gulags where he enslaves political opponents who like do

1212
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,040
nothing against him.

1213
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,640
Like that's not good.

1214
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,640
Let's not do that.

1215
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,680
We should try to do something about that guy.

1216
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,680
Not as much as the fact that he's got nukes all this other shit.

1217
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,680
I don't know.

1218
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,680
You hear him saying like, if it's, if it's in our best interest, I mean, and it doesn't

1219
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,680
hurt anyone.

1220
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,680
I mean, yeah, sure, go for it.

1221
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:48,120
If there's a civil war that you could help end in a productive way, then that sounds

1222
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:53,560
good as long as it doesn't like, you know, cripple America because America is good.

1223
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,560
America is valuable.

1224
01:03:54,560 --> 01:04:00,520
We shouldn't let this place just like crumble so that we can like help people who are not

1225
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:06,680
as well off as America because America is one of the, America is like Apple or like Elon

1226
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:11,480
Musk or one of these like tech giants that like because we're doing well, the whole

1227
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,600
world is doing well or better.

1228
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,960
And we can provide things to the entire world that improve life for everyone.

1229
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,000
You know, fucking smartphones, just technology in general.

1230
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,680
You know, there's things that we did bad as well, but, but rap music, exactly Afro American

1231
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,960
culture that we is our number one export.

1232
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,960
Got all of that.

1233
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,200
The only thing export in fact, yeah, it's great.

1234
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,360
That's just, yeah, like, I mean, that's why that's the thing with like countries like

1235
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:43,200
Sweden that are literally cucking themselves out of their country just to like, they're

1236
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,080
so sorry that they're white.

1237
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,980
They're so sorry that they're fucking white and they just want to, they just want to give

1238
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:52,560
up and hand their fucking country to like anyone who'll take it.

1239
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,640
And right now that's a lot of middle eastern people and like, they're just making their

1240
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,480
country shitty.

1241
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,480
They're making it worse.

1242
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,240
There's like rape gangs and I don't know, I don't know the full facts.

1243
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,240
Okay.

1244
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,240
I admit fully.

1245
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,320
I don't know all the full facts, but like Sweden is like a number one place that

1246
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,360
wants to cuck itself because it's, it's so liberal.

1247
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,440
It feels bad about even doing well at all when there's people out there who are suffering

1248
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,320
and they don't understand the way that like economics work, whereas like it's not like

1249
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,680
if you're doing well, you're taking things from other people.

1250
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,480
You're just, you're, you're making yourself better off and that, and then if you trade

1251
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,560
with other people in a consensual way, you can help them too.

1252
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:33,520
That's like the basis of economic growth, just in general and commerce.

1253
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,480
They should just try selling IKEA furniture to the police.

1254
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,480
Exactly.

1255
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,640
That'll frustrate them.

1256
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,720
You shouldn't, you shouldn't undermine, just to finish my point, you shouldn't undermine

1257
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,520
your own ability to be productive or helpful.

1258
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,720
And you know, maybe I'm exaggerating what that's like in Sweden, but you know, they've

1259
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,720
got other issues.

1260
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,840
Like they're, they're, they're a big welfare state that I hear, I don't know this for

1261
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,840
sure.

1262
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,840
I hear is crumbling there.

1263
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,120
Um, like they're just taking out too much fun.

1264
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,120
They can't afford it.

1265
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,120
They're too socialist.

1266
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,320
I don't know if that's true or not, but that's what I've been hearing and I'd be interested

1267
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,360
to look into it more and hear what people have to say about it.

1268
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,760
You can't take on everyone's burden all the time.

1269
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,960
You got to look out for yourself.

1270
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,360
Every man has a responsibility, every person has a responsibility to take care of their

1271
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
own shit.

1272
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,360
I agree.

1273
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,800
And then once you've got that just in order, then you can worry about helping other people.

1274
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,720
And America, you know, has had its shit together for a while.

1275
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,560
You know, maybe it's getting a little shaky or whatever, but it'd be nice to help people

1276
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,600
if we can do that without fucking ourselves.

1277
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,680
It's just like in Minecraft, when, when you're building, when you're building, you know,

1278
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:35,360
you go out into a server and you're like, well, these guys need help, but I need to

1279
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,360
build my house first.

1280
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,520
So I'm safe for the night.

1281
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,840
So I'll do that first.

1282
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,720
I'll, I'll, I'll worry about my shit and then I'll go help when I know that I have

1283
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
a safe place.

1284
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,720
Now I understand.

1285
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,720
Now it makes sense.

1286
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:54,800
I, I think I'm not totally, you know, uh, solidified in this, but I, I'm, I'm, I'm thinking

1287
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,800
I'm toying with that.

1288
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:00,360
Maybe we should, like, you know, I don't really like the intervention.

1289
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:06,760
And I think that maybe sometimes it's better for the world if we just let them toil and

1290
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,920
like not police and just let, you know, uh, the world change and like let people die and

1291
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,520
like let, you know, because that is like, we always go to war.

1292
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,520
Yeah.

1293
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
What?

1294
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,520
Oh, okay.

1295
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:25,000
I'm just saying like that is exactly what Star Trek, this big Libcuck show, that is what

1296
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,080
the prime directive is all about and they grapple with this issue all the time.

1297
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,600
And it's about how like all the time when like the fucking, uh, you know, whatever the

1298
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,360
westerners came to America, uh, and they fucking took it over, like they just fucked

1299
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,360
those people over.

1300
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:44,760
Like you can't just integrate yourself into a society that you are, or like the conquistadors

1301
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,760
in South America.

1302
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,760
Yeah.

1303
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,760
They fucked that place up.

1304
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,800
Uh, like you cannot just invade a place and expect them to like immediately accept

1305
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,000
like the things you bring them.

1306
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,240
You have to let people develop independently.

1307
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,600
And if you, if you can get involved with them in like a small way, cause you know, we're

1308
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,600
all on earth.

1309
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,000
It's not like in Star Trek where you can just avoid a planet entirely.

1310
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,520
You know, then you can, you know, slowly work to bring people, you know, into the fold where

1311
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,520
you are.

1312
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:12,600
But like, like even Star Trek, a big Libcuck show acknowledged like, yes, we absolutely

1313
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:18,240
have to let some people die in order for this society to grow itself and us to not completely

1314
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,240
fuck it up.

1315
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,240
Yeah.

1316
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:25,960
I really think the main thing that's, that's making like America and other western countries

1317
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:33,840
great again in political stuff all over the world is that one, it's PR like he was showing

1318
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:38,560
like, oh yes, we're such a great nation that will help other people because we're so powerful

1319
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,360
and you shouldn't fuck with us cause we have the power to spend on, on helping other countries

1320
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,000
fight their wars or whatever.

1321
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Uh huh.

1322
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,560
Um, you know, there's that, there's the show of like, we're the best where you can do all

1323
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,440
this cool shit.

1324
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:58,000
But there's also like the idea that if you don't intervene in certain places, they may

1325
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,560
be taken over by people who you really don't want to be in power.

1326
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:08,000
Like let's just, you know, the general idea is like, oh, well, if we don't help the right

1327
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,360
side of win this war that's going on over here, there may be another North Korea emerging

1328
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,240
in the future and we don't want that.

1329
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,360
We don't even want the possibility of that.

1330
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,800
We want to make sure whoever wins the war is on our side and they like us.

1331
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,800
Yeah.

1332
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,800
Yeah, that's true.

1333
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,840
In, in the, in the beginning, in the beginning of North and South Korea, South Korea was

1334
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,840
eating shit.

1335
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,440
North Korea was doing pretty fine and not, you know, great.

1336
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,440
Okay.

1337
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:39,200
Uh, but like it, so, so that's how they got the head start and now they're fucking insane.

1338
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,480
I mean, you know, they're always insane.

1339
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,480
They're always calm.

1340
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,480
But be a good one.

1341
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,960
I mean, they were doing fine for themselves economically speaking somewhat at least.

1342
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,640
Is it just because they had such ties with China?

1343
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,640
Yeah, yeah.

1344
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,640
They were just relying on that.

1345
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,640
You're right.

1346
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,640
Okay.

1347
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:55,040
Uh, and, and so that's why I find like, like having just another North Korea seems pretty

1348
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,840
far-fetched me because, okay, just take the obvious example, Middle East, some fucking,

1349
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,760
you know, Syria, I guess, Syria just becomes a fucking super al-Qaeda.

1350
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,120
They're, they're, the export is now 9-11 since their primary export.

1351
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,120
Okay, right.

1352
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:15,640
Uh, I don't, that, that government just will not last like, like, they just will not last

1353
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:20,640
that long because it's built upon, you know, crazy shit that has no, like it has no grace

1354
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,560
period of like being a good quote unquote country.

1355
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,520
It just starts out shit and it will be continued to be shit, probably be, you know, probably

1356
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,760
be on the map for like, you know, 10 years or something, but it will eventually crumble.

1357
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,440
And I'm always thinking about things in like, like decades span.

1358
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,960
You know, you're absolutely right about that.

1359
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,800
It's just like, like North Korea really wasn't that big a deal at first after the Korean

1360
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,600
War and it was just that like, you know, we just left it alone.

1361
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,600
Like we knew they were doing crazy shit over there, but we just left them alone because

1362
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,440
like, you know, the China's got their fucking back.

1363
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,440
What are we going to do?

1364
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,520
They got that shit covered.

1365
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,760
So like it's just over time, they just got crazier and crazier and like we, we still didn't

1366
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,760
address the problem.

1367
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,380
And now we're at a point where they're like really close to having like the ability to

1368
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,920
launch nukes against like the western coast of the fucking United States and they can

1369
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,080
already do it to South Korea if they fucking want to.

1370
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,080
Um, let alone Japan.

1371
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,080
Jesus.

1372
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,080
Yeah.

1373
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,080
Japan too is within their range, I think.

1374
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,880
So like that's, that's not good.

1375
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,880
It's not fucking good.

1376
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,880
Yeah.

1377
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:21,040
Um, also like, yeah, like the whole rise of, of, you know, Nazi Germany, like they started

1378
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:25,040
taking over a few places, but because they just had a huge war, everyone was like, ah,

1379
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,720
we shouldn't really get involved.

1380
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:32,040
Hitler was on the cover of Time Magazine or Hitler was man of the year twice, as I recall,

1381
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,120
once because he was the best guy ever and they loved him and second because he was the

1382
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,520
worst guy ever and he didn't like him anymore.

1383
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,520
And they loved him as well.

1384
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,520
Yeah.

1385
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,760
They thought it was he, they really liked his SS uniforms.

1386
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,760
They're really.

1387
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,520
Before, you know, we end.

1388
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,040
We're going to questions after this, so no worry, but yeah, yeah, go on.

1389
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:54,520
We got, I looked up the, the, the whole British budget spending on stuff.

1390
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,520
Oh good, good.

1391
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,520
Remarkably different.

1392
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,000
Uh, the, the total spending is like £762 billion.

1393
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Mm-hmm.

1394
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,680
Uh, defense budget is only £44 billion.

1395
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,680
Wow, okay.

1396
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,680
So like, um, educate.

1397
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,600
So like, we're like more than ten times more.

1398
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,600
Yeah.

1399
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,600
Education is like double.

1400
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,440
But we're ten times more than fucking pussy.

1401
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,440
You little bitch.

1402
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,440
You don't even invest in fucking, see that's, yeah, okay, sorry, go on.

1403
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,440
Yeah, even fucking keep Hong Kong, what the fuck asshole.

1404
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,440
Yeah, I know dude, embarrassing.

1405
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:30,560
The healthcare is like £138 billion, so I can see why people are like, you know, fuck

1406
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,560
that shit.

1407
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,560
Yeah.

1408
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:38,160
Cause it's, it's generally okay, but it's, it's pretty fucking expensive and it doesn't

1409
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,280
work very well for a lot of people.

1410
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,760
Like I understand, like a lot of liberals just like, they look at this graph and they

1411
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,600
think to themselves like, Jesus Christ, like my life is fucked right now.

1412
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,440
Like imagine if I had had like a free college education instead of like having to, you know,

1413
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,000
do whatever I had to do and not have the student debt.

1414
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Like wouldn't that be great?

1415
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And they're just looking at this budget.

1416
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,080
They're like looking at all these billions of dollars just being thrown away and they're

1417
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,960
like, I just want me a piece of that.

1418
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,560
I want me a fucking piece of that so I can like square my life away.

1419
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,880
You know, and maybe it's, maybe it's a reasonable request.

1420
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,000
Like if I just hadn't had to take out these student loans, I wouldn't have gone under

1421
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,920
financially, blah, blah, blah.

1422
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,040
But you know, the only thing is I don't really have a lot of sympathy for people who feel

1423
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,520
that, unless they really are in a bad way.

1424
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,120
And I know I was totally privileged in my life, but I just like, just take responsibility

1425
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,120
for your shit.

1426
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,880
Take responsibility for your own life, you got to find your way out.

1427
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,800
This is the situation you're in everybody.

1428
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,240
So just don't cry about it.

1429
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:37,880
Don't bitch and moan and feel free to campaign for what you think are like fair laws.

1430
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,120
If you want to make college free for everybody, like, hey, go for it, campaign all you want,

1431
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,120
no problem.

1432
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,840
But like accept the reality of the life that you have and make the best of it, however

1433
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,840
you can.

1434
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,160
Be financially solving people.

1435
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,880
Live in a tiny ass apartment like me so that you can pay off your student loans faster

1436
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,800
and then you'll be financially free.

1437
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,800
That's what I'm doing.

1438
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,800
That's what everybody should do.

1439
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,080
You know, just, just get your shit together.

1440
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,080
That's what I'm saying.

1441
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:04,960
Just from my privileged position of a guy who had really, you know, I don't know, middle

1442
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,960
income parents.

1443
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:10,520
I did just fine, grew up in a great place, had no major problems whatsoever.

1444
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,520
That's me.

1445
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,760
That's me saying all these things about how you need to get your fucking shit together,

1446
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,960
you lazy sex shit.

1447
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,960
That's me.

1448
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,920
Pull yourself up by your bootstraps and then you set your boot on fire.

1449
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:27,080
Speaking of that, welfare is like 113 billion for last year, by the way, this is all last

1450
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,080
year, 2016.

1451
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,080
How much is ours?

1452
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,080
I don't know.

1453
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,080
I closed it.

1454
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,080
Let me pull it up again.

1455
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,080
Yeah, go on.

1456
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,080
113.

1457
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,960
There's only three things on this.

1458
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,760
There's pensions, there's healthcare and there's welfare and those are all over 100

1459
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,760
billion.

1460
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,080
And defense is like, it looks so small, it's like 44 billion.

1461
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,520
It's like a libertarian government, like I can barely even see the suspense building.

1462
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,880
I don't see, okay, there's no welfare, but it must be under social security, unemployment

1463
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:53,880
and labor.

1464
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:58,880
That's a total of 3% 29.1 billion and this is in 2015.

1465
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,880
There you go.

1466
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:02,880
What was it for?

1467
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,560
It was like 170 some million for you guys?

1468
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,760
113 billion.

1469
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,600
That is a lot more than we spent.

1470
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,880
So, 10 pounds, not dollars, so that's a lot more.

1471
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,880
Yeah, it's a lot more and proportionally it's a lot more, yeah, just a lot more.

1472
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,880
What do you know?

1473
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,800
It's fucking more different than I would have expected.

1474
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,340
Our fucking military is just so, needs so much, such a fucking money thing, takes up

1475
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,820
so much fucking money, okay, whatever.

1476
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:28,820
Well, let's move on.

1477
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:29,820
Okay, guys, we all set.

1478
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:30,820
Rolling for con crimes.

1479
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:31,820
Yeah.

1480
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:37,320
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

1481
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,720
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1482
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,720
Wait.

1483
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:45,120
I love the Ottomans' old big old hats.

1484
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,280
Oh, they get their fucking sword.

1485
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,280
Shwing!

1486
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,240
And then they got their big old fucking hat.

1487
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:55,280
And then they go that's what they say

1488
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:01,080
Oh, and then they fucking kill those goddamn fucking

1489
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,940
Austrians give give you need to see I just got a picture this hat

1490
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,440
I'm trying to

1491
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:11,640
I've got the picture at this fucking hat dude. You have to see this. No, you do have to see this

1492
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,640
I know what they look at this

1493
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,160
Yeah

1494
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:23,820
I've ever seen that's not even a joke. It's ridiculous. Well, you know why they're so big why?

1495
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,320
It's because that's where they keep their wives

1496
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,440
That's how Islam you also that oh

1497
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:39,480
By the way, also an actual thing fun fact back when World War one was like first starting

1498
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:45,560
Like the like fashion-related the France like put on their fucking sick-ass like colorful uniforms

1499
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:51,400
They're all like kind of hard-moving and also like colorful and then like they were just walking up to a fucking German

1500
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:56,680
Like like before and then Germans could just easily spot them like on the fucking horizon

1501
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:00,680
Just mow them down like one after another machine gun fire. So like they're uniform just made

1502
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,680
Massacred all of them just fucking

1503
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,280
obliterated

1504
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:12,880
Is it is a time is an age gone by where where war was was like

1505
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:18,320
Civilized and you're stood on one hill and with your flag and you saw the other guy and you went

1506
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:25,280
And then you walked slowly towards them and since muskets such you had to get real close before you could fire

1507
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,960
And then they just kept doing that and guns got better and then

1508
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:35,040
Now everyone's hiding in bushes. You know when that changed that mostly changed during the American Revolution, baby

1509
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,720
Thank You Native Americans for teaching us that shit. Oh, don't

1510
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,280
What do you mean? No insane

1511
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,720
That's when they they had to fucking fight with guerrilla tactics. That was like considered dishonorable at the time

1512
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:49,760
So, you know like they didn't like it, but that's how we fucking what I well, okay?

1513
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,760
I guess I didn't I didn't like that

1514
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:58,000
They invented God damn it. We took we culturally appropriated it from the Native Americans

1515
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,480
I would say the first modern war was like, okay

1516
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,200
Either I would say like the seven years war. No, not this fucking seven years

1517
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:15,240
I'm gonna say it was Sonichu versus the four cent garbage American Civil War the American Civil War

1518
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:21,240
That shit's the first good one. Yeah, the first good one since a lot of people died also guns were big

1519
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,860
Awesome, I don't know anything about Vietnam war because all the video games about it have Vietnam

1520
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,480
Video are there a lot of video games about the Vietnam War? I mean there's a lot of comics and movies

1521
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:37,680
I don't know. There's like battlefields Vietnam kill kill Chinaman the game

1522
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:43,240
There's probably a couple in there. All right. That's it. All right, so we're done with military stuff

1523
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,200
Let's we we agreed 10 out of 10 good

1524
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,840
Semper fight Dallas to all our armed forces. That's right. Okay

1525
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,120
Here's some questions. All right, here's some questions, okay

1526
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:11,520
Here's here's our good buddy at Nat Blasphemous. This guy makes a bunch of art for us. He's a cool guy

1527
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:19,120
Would you give up content creation at least publicly if you could live wherever you wanted and have all needs provided all

1528
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,440
need you think about that

1529
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,040
I'm imagining like

1530
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:30,320
Like a really crystal clear like blue water beach log house with a pier

1531
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:36,320
And a straw hat roof. I like that, but also I

1532
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:42,200
Guess if all needs means this guy saying everything you want is all taken care of pretty much

1533
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:48,400
Yeah, well a fucking course who wouldn't give up no no see see that that's where you're wrong the answers

1534
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:55,040
No, of course. Yeah, because if you're not doing something you just shrivel up and don't my name exactly exactly right

1535
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:00,000
That's what I want to do. You have to get you have to give up content at least publicly

1536
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,060
Yeah, so like you could make it on your own if you wanted to I guess, but you just wouldn't release it

1537
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:10,320
It'd be like your own. I just release it under a pseudo name. Yeah, it like that'd be I think I would not take this well, okay

1538
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:18,000
I I would assume that the the gist of this question is like about if you would still like give up doing this kind of work

1539
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,600
Or whatever if like, you know, you can do that sort of or you know releasing it to the public like I I

1540
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,800
Mean no because there'd be no point to me doing the kind of work

1541
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,880
I do on YouTube if people couldn't see it because the whole point of it

1542
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,620
Yeah, people see it. I think I think what the general idea of the question is

1543
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:41,080
Yeah, do you have a creative outlet that doesn't involve people watching it on YouTube? I think you're right on the Internet

1544
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:46,160
I don't I would say I would say yes because I like sculpture

1545
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:51,460
I like the idea of building sculptures if I had like plenty of money and no reason to

1546
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:55,020
Worry about shit. I would just I would make Easter Island

1547
01:20:55,020 --> 01:21:01,300
I would buy an aisle I would be on an island and I would make sculptures and then when I'm dead people be like what the fuck happened here

1548
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:05,640
He he also he says like all creative content whatsoever though, right?

1549
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
He said content creation

1550
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:13,420
Yes, but he said he said he said he said publicly so like you could do it on your own if like

1551
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:16,380
I would

1552
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:23,640
Statues I would I would build cool fucking statues over an island until I'm dead and then then people will find them

1553
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:27,140
In my head the whole time

1554
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:32,520
That wouldn't be public. That would be like invasion of private property. Yeah, let's let's just say nobody can find it for whatever

1555
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:39,480
Okay, well, it's gay. No, I like making things and people to see yeah, I like

1556
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,740
me I

1557
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:47,900
Agree completely. Well, all my needs met includes a human being so like they're the you know company

1558
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,700
Like I wouldn't want to live on my own forever. That's just generally shit

1559
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:56,180
Okay, we're just talking about the content creation. You can just still be out and talk to people and whatnot

1560
01:21:56,180 --> 01:22:00,700
You know dumb question because it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't really make any sense. That's okay

1561
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:04,800
That's like everything except the one thing that you also like

1562
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,800
Like

1563
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,960
I'd like everything and and that to mean everything not everything minus

1564
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:18,000
Fuck you. I'm lost in the woods on this one. Okay. Let's go to another question here at read or Darrell asks

1565
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,240
What are your thoughts on the announcement for the American live-action TV show adaptations for one piece cowboy bebop and

1566
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,040
SAO is that TV show?

1567
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,560
Oh

1568
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,720
about

1569
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:36,680
Cowboy bebop may actually be good because it's already pretty westernish

1570
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:41,440
I mean, I could see that that making a neat transition one piece

1571
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,840
Garbage instantly. I know it will be. Mm-hmm. I

1572
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:51,440
Mean, I've seen cosplayers white people cannot look like those characters at all

1573
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,560
I don't think anyone can in real life. They're too cartoony. I just don't want to see that

1574
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:00,960
No, I've seen I've seen a pretty good. I've seen a pretty like a few pretty good-looking Japanese men being Sanji and

1575
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:07,840
Yes, that's they pull that off. But like imagine imagine like someone trying to be Frankie just to picture it like no

1576
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,760
No, it can't be done. It cannot be done

1577
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,520
Okay, go get what were you saying give I

1578
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,360
Was gonna say it's like the Super Mario Bros movie what Bowser's just a guy

1579
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:27,200
Well, that was cool because it was so fucking weird, but I mean at the time I was very confused

1580
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,600
But like that's what I'm imagining. You'll be like, oh, it's a guy

1581
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,000
But he's got like tattoos of stars on his hands

1582
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,080
I don't even it's legit like TV shows of cowboy bebop SAO and one piece

1583
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,960
They're getting TV like I heard about the cowboy bebop movie like that was a thing a TV show. Is this real?

1584
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,800
Where's he getting this news? I don't know. I'm just going to assume that it's correct

1585
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,120
I did I did hear the one I did hear the one piece one. Yeah, that's the one I did here

1586
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:54,960
I'm gonna enroll in a high school. I hope you want to join the football team with me

1587
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,680
I would love nothing more than that

1588
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,200
Jesus Christ

1589
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,720
The only thing they'll make this good if we've got mum key D

1590
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:11,720
Luffy on the team. Let's bring him in. I like the idea that it's not just a high school setting

1591
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,800
But it's a high school setting where it's just like he is. He's just into football. Yeah

1592
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,600
Oh kind of like those

1593
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:25,080
Character that it's about remember one cuz remember that one like the sometimes Oda will do like a little side thing where he tells like a

1594
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,680
Like a three-page story about like all universe straw hats

1595
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:33,360
Remember the one where Luffy was like a super studious student and all he wanted was to like get into like the number one school in the country

1596
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:39,180
And he was like that was his like pirate king thing like be the best student and get into this school like that's you know

1597
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,680
You don't remember that one. I

1598
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,380
Don't that's where shanks is like their teacher and you just told him to be degenerates and like not worry about it

1599
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:51,360
Are you talking about like the little pages of like question answer things?

1600
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,680
No, they weren't the SBS like so Oda's done a couple of these like

1601
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:59,920
Stories where it's just like all the care all the straw hats are like different characters in like a different world like there's one where

1602
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,880
They're all literal family members and like, you know Zoro's the dad

1603
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,240
I'll have to link you. Yeah, they're great. They're really really good

1604
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,280
Me Luffy. I'm not gonna. Oh, I bumped told you to some guy

1605
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:18,800
Fucking way. God. This is a fucking nerd. Oh my god. That was another member of my fucking anime crew

1606
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,720
We're gonna bond now in the kitchen. Oh

1607
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:30,080
What a nightmare right? Okay, let's move on. This is this topic is killing munchie

1608
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,120
I

1609
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,920
Okay, here we go

1610
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:40,360
Benjamin with at Benjamin Whistle asks what game have you played the most would you say it's your favorite?

1611
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,720
Undertaker

1612
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,200
I'm gonna Google search how many

1613
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:54,500
Okay, I'm just gonna say the game. I've played the most without a doubt is

1614
01:25:54,940 --> 01:26:04,060
Decidia Final Fantasy the first one for PSP. I played that game every night for hours for years every day

1615
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:10,780
And I it was the greatest. I am a real Final Fantasy fan guys. All right. I love Final Fantasy

1616
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:15,220
It's my favorite and this was everything I ever wanted finally made real

1617
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,700
Yeah

1618
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:25,420
Damn, I hate that guy. I'm gonna beat him up. It sounds like a bitch

1619
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:30,500
Yeah, that that game wouldn't isn't my favorite. No, but it is really really good and I loved it

1620
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:36,580
I was doing coming out from ps4 soon. Yeah, Ramza fucking Ramza. Okay, but I'm fine now

1621
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,380
Ramza one half

1622
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:44,740
Hey, I played by far the most of Team Fortress 2

1623
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:51,580
2,672 hours on record first played that in like

1624
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:59,700
2012 I think early 2012. Okay. It's one of my favorite games. I mean not my favorite

1625
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:05,500
But yeah, what like top five I would say I love team Fortress 2 too bad

1626
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:11,900
It's game horrible now, and I would never fucking play it ever except for the time. They're like legacy servers. No

1627
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:16,340
No, oh, it's just dead. It's just gone. Yeah, that sucks

1628
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:23,500
Gibb is yours is it RuneScape the one you've played the most. I'm just guessing here. Is it RuneScape?

1629
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,820
Um, I would say no because World of Warcraft

1630
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:33,140
I would when I was into World of Warcraft. It was like all right. I've just woken up time to turn on computer

1631
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:40,500
Warcraft I gotta play I gotta do it. Oh, I gotta get ready for school. I can I can get in 30 minutes of World of Warcraft

1632
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:46,500
You know that was me the good thing was that I it didn't affect me too much

1633
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:52,100
That's good like other aspects of my life. I was already a loser. Oh, it was all fine

1634
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,100
It was all it was all meant to be

1635
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,660
Probably one of the heights of my gaming career was one day

1636
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:03,620
I was playing Mario Luigi Bowser inside story and mine like I was I was just I just stayed up all night just playing it and

1637
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:08,020
And I like I wasn't even like at the final boss or any like it like you know story moment

1638
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:12,540
I was just like the fucking like just the third level just midway through my mom knocks on the door like hey

1639
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:17,780
It's it's time for school. You have to go I open the door and I'm fucking just like crying like mom

1640
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:21,140
I want to keep playing Mario. Oh

1641
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,140
No

1642
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:30,620
Please I got my knees. Please. Let me play Mario. Please and she's not healthy

1643
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:35,380
Christ what she do what you do sure I guess

1644
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:41,100
So you just got to stay home and play Mario this day. Yeah. Yeah, just that day and then like the next day

1645
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,540
I just didn't care. I just didn't care the next day. Yeah, all right

1646
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:49,740
I just cared so much about playing just like I didn't even like beat the game

1647
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:56,460
I just continued to play for like a couple hours and then I just shut it off like for just some reason

1648
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:00,460
I just wanted to play very badly. The way what those were fake tears

1649
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:06,700
I was legitimately crying for the like I just couldn't I couldn't play Mario for like six hours. What the fuck?

1650
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:11,740
Sometimes I like that before uh-huh go ahead give I

1651
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:17,700
Felt that though those feelings before it's like like I'm just really into something and I

1652
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:22,380
Deliberate it on whether it was okay to bring my my GBA to school

1653
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:28,020
Like if it was it really into playing fire emblem or something. I was like, uh, I've been playing it all night

1654
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,660
I want to play more

1655
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:32,860
Could I bring it to school? No, no, the bullies will take it

1656
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:37,700
I never I never had bullies that would take things but I I always felt like if I had my

1657
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:42,100
GBA I wouldn't be able to bring it out during class because the teacher would take it

1658
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:47,460
I wouldn't be able to bring it out during you know in between times because the people would say what are you a gamer?

1659
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:51,820
Kill me. Oh, no can't take that risk

1660
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:57,820
So I never brought it to school, but there was one time when I saw a guy he brought it to his to school

1661
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:01,580
I was like you motherfucker. You're so brave. How do you do that?

1662
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:07,060
He's the real veteran here not the name of these fucking, you know boys and blue

1663
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:13,100
Did you learn from that? Yeah, you're right. Did you learn for that? Did you bring it after that? No, no

1664
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:16,580
I brought my game boy to school like for years every day

1665
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:24,500
I was just so paranoid of like of of of turning on the game and sitting down and then having people come over and say

1666
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:28,060
Oh, what game you playing and then I would shrivel up and be like, I don't know

1667
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,300
That's what I would have said

1668
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:39,540
Okay, here's a here's a good question. I'm at rum raisin seven asks. Um, why is munchies so bad at Kirby?

1669
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,540
You know, that's a good question. It's a very good question

1670
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:57,100
That's what that is that's a fake thing. It's a fake fucking made-up fact

1671
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:01,060
Whether you can check with the government

1672
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:07,300
Go check out the the Kirby race. Everybody's is great. Um, okay, here we go

1673
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:14,820
Yeah, you that's true, you know, that's really it's funny that like it's just because you got more invested than me

1674
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:18,420
Yeah, because you got more invested you got rocked harder

1675
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:30,780
At Jip clip C asks why don't PCPs last for more than an hour now?

1676
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:36,660
Actually, I know the reason I just want them to be longer. Well, we're already an hour and what like 20 minutes

1677
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:42,620
Yeah, we're over an hour and a half now. So I don't know what fuck you dude. I think I think what it is is that

1678
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:45,220
Sometimes

1679
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:52,260
There's less people and if there's loads of people and it's a big topic. Yeah, everyone wants to get everything in but now

1680
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,540
When the topic sucks

1681
01:31:55,540 --> 01:32:02,020
Sometimes it does and none of us have like enough to say each even if we all get a turn so

1682
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,500
That's why

1683
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,060
Pretty robust. It was with three people. It was still over an hour

1684
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:14,380
There was gonna be way more people like and by way more I just mean like six or

1685
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:19,620
Two more but they just didn't show up. So we were like we were we gonna flowers

1686
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:22,940
I was at least I did had no idea working talking about this actually turned out pretty good

1687
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:28,260
Yeah, the reason though the reason though that everyone's like, oh fucking. Why are they short now?

1688
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:31,020
I've seen that multiple places because unlike the past two

1689
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:36,380
I think but both times have just been like we've been in the middle talking and it's been like alright done BCPS over now

1690
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:39,940
Bye, I don't I don't really think we need to go on that long

1691
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:44,820
I mean we make a good product and we wrap it up. I'm pretty happy with how long they've been going up to now

1692
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:48,540
Yeah, it's just both times

1693
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:54,420
I've met a bit. I've made a big stick about Nate closing the PCP and so they probably like oh much. He's fucking right

1694
01:32:54,540 --> 01:33:01,940
We do you're right? I don't know. I'm pretty ill like this one is longer than I expected to be and I'm perfectly happy with that as well

1695
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:08,380
Yeah, yeah, I'm having me. This is fine. Yeah, I'm sick of this shit. I'm pretty fucking fed up TBH

1696
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:15,500
Okay, let's let's let's see. I got the answer another question. Um, oh

1697
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:19,520
Okay, no this question fucking sucks

1698
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:25,140
Okay, maybe you guys can tell me what this means at sys gum 69 our old friend

1699
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:29,300
Can you talk about your head mates?

1700
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:35,660
What does that mean the fuck is that I don't like like the people live with me in my head? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, you know

1701
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:42,780
You know what head mates are? I don't think so the term dude. I have so much like a topa. I have so many head mates

1702
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:50,100
They're like topless, but inside of your physical brain. Is it like a split personality thing? Is that what it is?

1703
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:56,340
It's it's okay. So here's what you do you pretend that you're insane. That's the first right pretend

1704
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:02,460
That you're insane then when you when you're making your sick-ass fucking form posts that you just you know

1705
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:08,980
You love to make every single day you laugh so hard making these posts that you just drop your fucking pretzels out on the ground

1706
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:11,780
That those sick ass whores while you're making those

1707
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:15,440
Just like in it. Just like enter colon

1708
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:17,420
Barack Obama

1709
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:24,540
Darth Sidious, you know the Martian from Looney Tunes any of those guys colon. Yeah, just have him say something retarded

1710
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:28,720
Just say that okay, it'll make it better. That'll be your head mate

1711
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:32,500
Just pretend that those fictional characters are inside of your brain

1712
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:39,740
And then you say funny fucking quips that make everyone like you on your phone post guy online tumblr fucking

1713
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:46,160
Yeah, yeah, all those or chan.org slash co all those nice places

1714
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:49,460
Just get your fucking head mates to say some sick ass

1715
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:54,620
Nihilistic wicked sense of humor shit and everyone will love you. That's what head mates are

1716
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,980
Yeah, I I've done this a couple times

1717
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,540
Like like quite that intense but like

1718
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:08,420
You know every so often like I'm walking home from school and I'm like I

1719
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:12,740
Feel like talking about something, but there's no one there

1720
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:19,060
So I've just imagined what the possible counter arguments could be like a person doesn't agree with what I said

1721
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:27,260
So I just argue with him and just talk in my head. They don't have different voices. They're just like saying different things like

1722
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:35,220
Blah blah blah. I don't know about that and then you know, I just go go through the motions of this thinking about it

1723
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:42,060
It's usually just to think it's just a way to think through just to imagine that there's another person that I am being also

1724
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:49,940
Is that what it is or is it just I love I mean, I'm sure that's practically what it is or you know in a practical sense

1725
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:55,420
Yeah, that's what it is. What people say is this is the fictional characters live inside their brain and then they talk to them

1726
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:57,420
sometimes and and

1727
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:05,900
I don't have characters and and and then sometimes in and on a blood moon one of those fictional characters will take over their physical form

1728
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:14,300
Then like role play that character themselves these people are so special and impressive and amazing

1729
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:17,660
I I wish I was as cool as them. They're so cool

1730
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:23,300
Vampire Hunter D is now at the front. He's at the front now. I am him

1731
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:25,220
I

1732
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:31,940
Like the fact that vampire Hunter D has the has the feels the knees to explain that he is yes

1733
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:38,980
This incredibly quiet reserved character who changed my entire way acted by never saying a fucking word announces himself in the room

1734
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,980
I am

1735
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:46,080
Everyone it's me. I'm real. I'm here. Yes. That's very in

1736
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:51,040
That's the question the the question was

1737
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,820
Can you talk about your head mates was the

1738
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,320
Yeah, the rich personality of Darth Maul really takes up a large chunk of my head

1739
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,240
Yeah, he's got a lot to say let me tell you

1740
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,720
He's a fucking asshole

1741
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:18,680
He's a fucking red-pilled Trump supporter piece. No. No, I go with him all the time about shillery

1742
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:23,240
I should be fucking locked up and he just won't write fucking you won't take any of it

1743
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,840
He's a big John Oliver fan

1744
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:30,200
He always wants to switch the channel even when I'm trying to watch you know Sam hides world peace to get my red

1745
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,200
pillow might my swastika's in

1746
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:38,760
He's won't use won't fucking do it. I fucking hate you Darth Maul. I've got Odie from Garfield

1747
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:42,480
Yeah, Odie and Darth Maul do not get to well together at all. They're like

1748
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,760
They are exact Odie's the most migtail fucking

1749
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,880
Oh

1750
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:59,600
Cuz he's always making fun of Darth Maul's masculinity and it doesn't get pretty

1751
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:09,000
The munchie actually has a lot of characters in this fucking head of course of course and I just Napoleon Bonaparte

1752
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,400
Just had just hanging out. He's a military guy. I should have had him come to the front of consciousness for this debate

1753
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,320
That would have been helpful

1754
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,220
Unfortunately, all he does is play well in league and he doesn't have time to come to the front of my

1755
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,040
So, you know, it's it's a real shame

1756
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:28,120
Maybe yeah, we can one day we can do like a bonus episode. That's us with our head mates, you know

And we're still recording get the fuck out of here

1772
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:49,360
Hey everyone Ben St here just wanted to pop in and give you all little context and what you're about to hear so

1773
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,280
On the day of this PCP we had agreed that afterwards

1774
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:59,040
We would all get together and hang out in the chat in the discord have a little group call have a good time

1775
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:05,760
So I come in two hours after the PCP was meant to start and I see that

1776
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,080
Everyone's in the call and I think ah

1777
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:16,000
Surely the good times have already started surely my friends are just there waiting for me waiting for me to come and join

1778
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Them and have a real good time

1779
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,080
so I get in the call and

1780
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,720
Well

1781
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:27,360
Yeah, and the rest is history. So I just wanted to give you that give you that context

1782
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,400
So let's see how that plays out shall we?

1783
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,040
Yeah

1784
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,720
Okay, go on good what you say

01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,840
I have in my Yu-Gi-Oh headspace

1788
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:55,880
The entire cost of Beyblade mushed into one character

1789
01:40:56,720 --> 01:41:00,120

1790
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,280

Fucking

1794
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:21,840
I think you got a headmate that's a an old world war two fighter pilot piloted by an anthropomorphic baguette

1795
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:35,520
It's not even a fighter airplane not even like a royal like not even like a fighter ply just an airplane

1796
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,080
An airplane

1797
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,160
He doesn't like people flying inside him. He says you should fly on your own

1798
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:49,120
Your own ways you should be like the bird and take wing. I'm not go don't go inside me. Don't go inside me

1799
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,240
Uchiha Sasuke does not he's a real pigtail planes going their own way

1800
01:41:54,400 --> 01:42:00,400
You know, he doesn't need their these other guys. He's got his own life. He doesn't need you to make him a complete plane

1801
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,160
Okay, there's one last question that we have to address. Wait, wait. I got it. I just I just have the thought

1802
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:09,440
Yes, you know like like ghost pirate ships. What about ghost planes?

1803
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:13,760
Okay, Emily ever the aeroplane robo. Yeah, she's not there

1804
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:18,400
And then and then it's a plane going in a circle and it's like how the hell do you get in there?

1805
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,480
What you're in there? It's like oh spooky

1806
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,800
It's spooky. It's kind of like in um

1807
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,560
Scooby-Doo. For some reason it reminds me of breath of the wild only breath of the wild isn't flying

1808
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,000
Okay, if you combine a breath of the wild with the one before it in the sky

1809
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,720
No

1810
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:40,000
Yes, shadow the head that's what i'm trying to think of. Yes, what i'm trying to say is I like shadow the head

1812
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,480
He doesn't need to be quick

1813
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:02,160
I guess is why we shouldn't let the women fly because Amelia our air are fucking died

1816
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:17,920
Muhammad H asks oh now that canada allows sex with animals

1817
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,760

1825
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:07,280

01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:42,960

I really like how our the announcements of patreon stuff was interjected

1839
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:16,800
Occasionally by the undertaker. I think that should be a staple. It's appropriate of the patron plug is that the undertaker should be there

1840
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,960
