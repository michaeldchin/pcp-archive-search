The last month's episode was impromptu Q&A.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hottie Creek says, why would you do this?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, the answer to that is of course, I don't think it's funny and it's annoying.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't get the joke there for it's not funny there for Ben.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, you're gonna police humor the world now, Ben.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, Nate, what's your criteria for what makes a joke good?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you say it in a funny voice, that's all you need to do.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I can feel the pressure building to smoke weed and I don't want to.

00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello and welcome everyone once again to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I am your guy, old and boy, Nate Bestman.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What's going on everybody?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And we've got Tom Oliver here.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am now returned to the podcast with 10% less spying.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey, there you go.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Boo Spine.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My skeleton is officially banned from the skeleton war.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It can't participate anymore.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, you thought he was spineless before.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wait till you see that.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, you don't even know.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I suppose the spine jokes are just far too easy.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm super spineless too.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm about to go kill the cell juniors now.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's go with time.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We've got Ben St.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There he is.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What's up everybody?

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Welcome to the working class.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We got Nate Bestman here.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Feels good.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Feels right.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm below the poverty line.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We've got give and take.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There he is.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You may have heard some baps, some booms just because I'm getting shot at right now by a fireworks demon.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So sorry if that happens in the future as well.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Tell us more.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Damn it, Mulan.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is that it?

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All right, great.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And we've got Digi Bro.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm the real Ben St.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's all a ploy.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've been running for years.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's been one big troll on everybody that I am making happen.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm the real Ben St.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You are just an act I've been putting on.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can talk out of both sides of my mouth at the same time and do two different voices.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's how we're on the same podcast at the same time.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What about the times when you've been in the same room together?

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What happened?

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What's going on?

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm Shadow Clone Jiu Jitsu.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There's a little known new technology.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's known as GUI-G.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It was a GUI-G maneuver.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Haven't you ever been to Disney World and been on one of those rides where they project the ghost images onto things with planes of glass?

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or simply a hall of mirrors.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ben has simply been a mirror, like a warp body shape mirror.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
For Radcom 3, we warped out the double-wide rounding mirror.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I mean, think about it. Do you really think Keto works?

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It doesn't.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This whole transformation on Ben St. is probably just tweaked the algorithm a little bit.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was just a chain of curvature.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Exactly.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's all it was.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Quite a subsurf modifier.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's like when you're in front of one of those mirrors, when you just squat down and it completely changes your body shape.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's like that.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's why they say you got to do your squats.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Exactly.

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It all makes sense to me.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Got to adjust that focal point.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A lot of stuff's happened since we last talked.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, guys, have you seen, I'm going to post it right here.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Have you seen the new Pokemon leaks?

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Have you seen the new Pokemon leaks?

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I saw the blue one.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Whoa.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've seen some.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is good.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
These are beyond anything I ever expected.

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, no.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I like them.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We got debt.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
These are the best Pokemon leaks I've seen in a week.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And that's annoying.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Boy.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's like when a quadruped turns into a biped, but it just keeps going and he turns his flips back on.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So he's got his belly up.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And then the other one is platute and taplu patuta.

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
When a Pokemon of the last type is like really different and annoying and sexual.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Just becomes a guy.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's why it's hard hitting Pokemon commentary.

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
When Ken Sugumori runs out of ideas, just make it a furry.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Just make it a furry.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Just do it.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I did happen to see what seemed to be fairly legit looking leaks of the final evolution of the main guys.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Were those?

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I only saw what I believe to be the sobble.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Same here.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That was the only one I saw.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Was it like a tall, thin looking motherfucker?

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, okay.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I trust nothing until I see officials.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But these are official.

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
These six images here.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Everyone was saying in like the immediate wake of the reveal of the starters that sobble would grow up to be a spy.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And indeed this one I saw looks like a spy and it looks like the official artwork.

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why was that a speculation?

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What is about...

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't know where that came from.

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I mean I heard people's...

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's because he went invisible, right?

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, but there had to be more to it than that.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, no, no.

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Spy from TF2 goes invisible.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Same thing.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're overestimating the creativity of the internet, Ben.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I mean, sobble is just sob and wobble.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I remember seeing people be like, okay, yeah, it goes invisible.

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It has like a cloaking mode and the idea was like it starts out like shy and it becomes like secretive but also like confident, right?

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Like it becomes like a...

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sure, sure.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't know.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But it's still.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's true.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I like it.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I think it looks like it is true and it's cool.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I do like it, but like there had to be...

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because I saw that speculated on a lot in lots of different places.

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There had to be more info that people had because that was everywhere.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That was all over the place.

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That was the word on the street.

145
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It seems like there's a thing they're trying to do now of like having an evolutionary line have like an evolution in personality.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Like with the owl guy, the grass owl, where he starts off as like a pompous like a...

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Nerd fucking...

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, he's like a...

149
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He flips his hair and he's like, I'm better than you.

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's not the owl.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The owl is like a sphere.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's like, oh, watch me, the owl.

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Your owl starts as like a dweeb and then he becomes kind of like a fancy boy.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, the second form is like a prince guy.

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You know, he literally like does the hair flip.

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Sure, sure.

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The anime thing.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, I think a Google house code from Log Horizon.

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean a little bit.

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But then when he gets to his final form, he's like a total badass.

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He's like, oh yeah, fucking...

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I have truly lived up to my noble lineage by actually becoming cool.

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Which is why he should have been in Smash Bros.

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We need a grass type starter Pokemon to be a fucking to complete the set.

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
God damn it.

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What, two fire boys?

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Charizard and Infern?

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And to Plupa Tuta.

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If only Charizard was also fire fighting type.

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If only.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He does fight in battle, so I guess he is.

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Everyone.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Every Pokemon of fighting type.

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Retroactively, every Pokemon who's ever been in Smash now gains a third fighting type on top of whatever it was.

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Seems fine.

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Note to the editor as we wrap up this Pokemon discussion.

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Do not put Pokemon in the title of this episode.

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Correct.

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No need for that business, no need for that.

180
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I literally only brought it up because of my funny drawings that I made.

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Those are good.

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What?

183
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You drew those?

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I thought that was the least.

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh shit, I gave it away.

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What the fuck?

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They look so convincing.

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Do you like the bullish on the man?

189
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, that was really what sold it.

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I was like, that has to be legit.

191
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You see, in my head cannon is that actually the body of Plateaut becomes the bulge and then the rest grows out from the bulge.

192
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That really recontextualizes the whole design.

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's unfortunate.

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And it just grows a new, completely separate head.

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I get it.

196
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, I mean I just heard...

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The fucking monkey, drum guy, that's fine, whatever, who cares?

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't know.

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I got to look at the fucking, I want to see...

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, here you go, here's what I got.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's in the gross disgusting whatever.

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is what I found.

203
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You got the water guy, you got the grass guy, I assume these are real.

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I know I saw the fucking fire one around.

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was just like a soccer, it's like a tall bunny, I don't know.

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Everyone said Grookey was going to be a drummer.

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Naturally, naturally.

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's...

210
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I think that's one of those drum guys.

211
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think that's cool in concept, I don't like this design.

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm not a big fan.

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I like it, the drum guy.

214
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The drum is a bit strange though, it's like a log that both has Tom Tom's on the top

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and is a bass drum as well, kind of.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What else am I looking at here?

217
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What are these other fucking things?

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Those are like meows, evolution or something?

219
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay, that one on the bottom left definitely does not look like a Pokemon and I do not believe it.

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
These could be fake, I don't know, I have no proof, you know.

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Those meows are...

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
They don't make any sense, what would this be?

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Like baby form meows?

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Like a different type of cat maybe?

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They could be split evolution or something.

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, I mean that would make sense I guess.

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Is that a farfetched with just a really big leak?

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh my god, it is!

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What the fuck is that?

230
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah, that's definitely...

231
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's got to be baby form.

232
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, there is a real thing of the galolan farfetched.

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I have seen it.

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Galarian.

235
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So that's what they meant by leaks, I get it now.

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh shit, but the evolution of farfetched is I think totally sick.

237
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm gonna say that this is probably just Galarian meows and an alternative evolution,

238
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
because they already gave Zigzagoon an alternative Galarian only evolution.

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Which is sick, oh shit.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, yeah, Zigzagoon evolves into Galarian, Zigzagoon evolves to Galarian.

241
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I mean if that's what this is, I like this meows and it's weird evolution.

242
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I like it, but I don't know why so many meows.

243
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, fuck meows.

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Meows already has a doubled special.

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why would meows evolve into something that isn't a Persian?

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't fucking know, because it's a generic cat.

247
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll defend that because nobody likes Persian.

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not upset by it, I'm just wondering what the reasoning behind it will be.

249
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Polytoad is like the most, why would you have a triple evolution that is a tadpole,

250
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
that never stops being a tadpole, but I still find polytoad a very weird creature.

251
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He's clearly meant to represent the wasp of youth and how you want to cling on to it, you know?

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes, he's a man trying to...

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You're saying that polyrath is an incel.

254
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm saying using a water stone, you're forcing him to grow up

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and he's desperate to cling on to his childhood by not fully forming the role of an adult.

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Funny that a water stone adds a fighting type and not the alternative.

257
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's because he's fighting against social conditioning.

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
As opposed to a king's rock where polywhirl or whatever accepts the heavy crown that is the patriarchal burden.

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And he takes over and...

260
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Does polytoad evolve with a king's rock?

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Wait, I think of a slow king. Shit, it evolves with something else.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Polytoad might take it too, I don't know.

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay, whatever, someone fact check me on that.

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Alright, enough Pokemon talk.

265
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
People...

266
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Raiding is poison.

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, did you guys hear Toby Fox is making a song?

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But I'll tell you what's not Raiding's poison.

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's talk about climate change.

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's good stuff.

271
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's bad.

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Big fan.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
End it.

274
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's change the climate away from that by just saying that it's cool that Toby Fox is making an age song for Pokemon.

275
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Toby Fox is making new climate?

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Who cares? That's boring.

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's not your fault that that news is boring.

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's the news's fault.

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Guys, we have to plant 20 million icebergs by the end of the year.

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh yeah, that's true.

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What if we all went out and planted a little ice cube from our freezer?

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Dude, yeah, just turn the fridge on.

283
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Just turn the fridge on, put it in the water.

284
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It'll make infinite ice.

286
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We're just going to do what they didn't do to trauma.

287
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Just keep dumping ice cubes into the Arctic and it'll all be fine.

288
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It worked in that one scene in Summer Wars when they had to keep that big computer cooler.

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's true.

290
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If it's good enough for Summer Wars, it's good enough for us.

291
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I agree.

292
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I agree.

293
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I insisted upon watching that movie while it was still summer to feel the good summer vibes.

294
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And it was the right decision.

295
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It was a great choice.

296
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There you go.

297
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You guys, too late.

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Now it's full time.

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You guys see that there?

300
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You guys see that there?

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Did you actually have something you were going to say?

302
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I've got quite a few things.

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I do.

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, Has been Hotel.

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You guys see Has been Hotel?

306
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I did watch Has been Hotel.

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yep.

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What do you think?

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was okay.

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I think.

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Pretty okay.

312
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What I think is that me and Nate made an entire hour long discussion video about it that

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you can watch on our new channel, Cantant!

314
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Epic.

315
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's right.

316
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Link to below.

317
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Do that.

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It was pretty good.

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Would you want to spoil what you thought of?

320
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Wait, how long is the podcast?

321
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's like an hour long.

322
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
How the fuck do you talk about Has been Hotel for an hour?

323
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, there's two of us.

324
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Think about who is doing the podcast.

325
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Think about who is doing the podcast.

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's why.

327
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's true.

328
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Their job is literally to be long-winded about things and make money off bad revenue for

329
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
it.

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's true.

331
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let me talk to you guys.

332
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh yeah, go on, go on.

333
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You know, my favorite PCP discussions are always to shop talk.

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So let me get into it a little bit.

335
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Because I have discovered that, I mean, we've all probably heard before that like YouTube

336
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
promotes you more based on watch time rather than view count.

337
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Not to mention you can stick more ad breaks in, which I'm a big fan of.

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

339
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't do ad breaks because I have a Patreon and I feel like it's a conflict of interest

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
in a way.

341
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I disagree, but okay.

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I put ads at the end of the videos and the start, right?

343
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Which, by the way, if your video is over 10 minutes long, make sure you put an end roll

344
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
ad because it will, you're just making more money and nobody cares.

345
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Make complaints about the end roll ads because they usually stop paying attention if that

346
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
actually gets to the point where it plays.

347
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Or they're watching it in a playlist and it's just two ads in a row, whatever.

348
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But it definitely seems as though not only does YouTube reward you for longer videos

349
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
or for play through to multiple videos, but it increases the actual amount you make from

350
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
the ads.

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you look at the CPM of videos with better viewer retention, it seems like it's much

352
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
higher, CPM being the amount of money you make per 1,000 views.

353
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And so I figured all this out because I was sending Nate all the money for the Shield

354
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Hero videos that we did and they had all made.

355
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
At long last, he's done it, everybody.

356
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He has done it.

357
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So you let him off the hook.

358
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Look what I found on Twitter.

359
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, yeah.

360
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There's the fire boy.

361
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Okay.

362
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We'll put that with the other guy.

363
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I still don't think, I'm not convinced these are real.

364
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't really like it.

365
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't even want to get into my opinions in a serious way until we know the real designs.

366
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We could just be criticizing some fans, shitty interpretation.

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's a fair point.

368
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
True.

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We should get the confirmation.

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But these, I like the blue one and I like the other two.

371
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's my hot take, everybody.

372
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
In any case, so as I was sending this stuff to Nate, I realized that all these videos

373
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that were super long had made more money than you would expect based on the view counts.

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And so it's like, if you can get people to watch super long videos, then you'll make

375
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
way more money than if you just get them to watch like shorter ones.

376
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Everybody seems to think it's like, oh, 10 to 15 minutes.

377
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's like the ideal sweet spot.

378
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I think that on some level it is, but if you can get people to watch a super long

379
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
video, that is the real sweet spot.

380
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I feel like times have changed.

381
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I feel like now the longer stuff is doing better.

382
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't know.

383
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It seems like that's what's Google's rewarding in the algorithm.

384
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's what they want.

385
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh yeah.

386
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They want people to just stay on the site for as long as possible.

387
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's true.

388
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If I were to put out like a five hour analysis video.

389
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Because if we're at home watching YouTube, we can't be out unionizing.

390
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Very true.

391
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Speaking of, did you hear about what Google is trying to do to like fuck over the internet?

392
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
A little bit.

393
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What, again?

394
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What an unheard of thing.

395
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They're like, they're changing the way Google works and how Chrome works to hide URLs.

396
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So the only way you know how to get to websites is finding them through Google to push more traffic.

397
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I was thinking, I need to stop using Chrome is what I thought when I read that.

398
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
People didn't tell me to switch back to Firefox for a while.

399
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I did switch back to Firefox like a year and a half ago and fucking Google is increasingly

400
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
making their shit not work on Firefox.

401
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Like everything works much worse than it does on Chrome.

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This is why you need to use Brave because Brave is a Chromium fork.

403
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So everything that works on Chrome works on Brave.

404
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Hey, there you go.

405
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But it has a built-in ad block and doesn't track you.

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But it looks so bad.

407
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No dude, they updated the UI.

408
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It looks exactly like Chrome.

409
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Okay, well then I'll get it.

410
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hey, there you go.

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Get it immediately then.

412
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Brave.

413
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm literally downloading it right now.

414
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Do it.

415
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah, me too.

416
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I've been using Brave for over a year now, fucking rocks.

417
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And it's also on Android.

418
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You can use it on Android as well.

419
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It has a built-in ad blocker for Android as well.

420
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There you go.

421
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Fantastic.

422
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
How much of my crypto are they mining while I use Brave?

423
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Actually, do you have a crypto built-in?

424
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Did he was getting to a point?

425
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What were you going to say?

426
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He certainly was.

427
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I got interrupted so many times and now I'm downloading Brave.

428
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You were saying that things from Chrome?

429
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I was going to say that Google's apps continually don't work on Firefox.

430
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No, before that I was talking about how I think the way,

431
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and I could be completely wrong about this,

432
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
but I'm imagining how the YouTube logic might work.

433
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And it might be that if you were to post six 10-minute videos,

434
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
then YouTube would recognize the viewership of those

435
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
the same way they would recognize one view of an hour-long video,

436
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
because it's the same amount of time.

437
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So it might be that 10-minute videos are more likely to get a huge amount of views

438
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
because not as many people are going to sit down for a super long video,

439
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
but if you do make, because I get pushed a lot

440
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
of these super fucking long analysis videos.

441
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So there's like five hours of dissecting Oblivion

442
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
or that long-ass Pokemon Ruby analysis,

443
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and these things get really good views,

444
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
because it's such a defining, like a monumental video.

445
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
People are like, oh my god, five hours about fucking Oblivion?

446
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's got to be the most in-depth video of all time.

447
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Then they go watch it, and they're like,

448
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
they'll sit through the whole thing because they want it to have something long in the background.

449
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Just so you could say you did.

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I think that's the way of the lay of the land right now,

451
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
is to make longer, more in-depth videos,

452
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
but I think that can-tent allows me and Nate

453
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
an opportunity to make really long videos

454
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
that are entertaining all the way through,

455
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and I think it's a perfect for SEO optimization going forward.

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Especially I had like a brain blast moment when I realized

457
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
that in order for you to get monetized on YouTube,

458
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
you have to have 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in the last year

459
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
in order for you to even enter the approval process.

460
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And I've had several channels that I had to,

461
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
if you only make, let's say, a 10-minute video every two weeks, let's say,

462
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
then even if you got like 5,000 views on that,

463
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
it's going to take a while before you make 4,000 watch hours.

464
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Well, we put out this hour-long Arrow Manga Sensei video,

465
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and it immediately occurred to me,

466
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
we only need to get 4,000 people to watch this all the way through

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
to get approved for monetization.

468
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And guaranteed that's going to happen,

469
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
aside from the fact that this is a brand new channel,

470
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
unless I promote the fact that it's here,

471
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
people aren't going to come here.

472
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But all it would take is like one hour-long video

473
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
for us to get just 4,000 views on, and we are approved.

474
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This is clearly what YouTube wants.

475
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This must be what they're hoping for,

476
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
is that you make the longest videos fucking possible.

477
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Sure.

478
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It certainly seems to be.

479
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I mean, I guess the question becomes like how,

480
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
what they wait more,

481
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
unique impressions or aggregate watch time,

482
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
it seems like they're leaning more towards aggregate watch time at this point.

483
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah, time on a website or something.

484
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I think because they want people to get addicted to YouTube,

485
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
the kind of people who are watching that long-form content

486
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
are the people who are replacing TV,

487
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
who don't watch anything else like me,

488
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
who literally only watch YouTube.

489
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
They're going whale hunting, they want those whales,

490
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
they just watch YouTube all day and do nothing else.

491
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Can I just make a quick little detour and critique can-tent?

492
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Sure.

493
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I've been saying it wrong this whole time,

494
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I thought it was content as in a play on the word,

495
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
play on the word con as in a ruler or king,

496
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and that's what you guys were, you were kings.

497
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Whoa, a ruler or king?

498
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's what a con is, especially in Asian countries,

499
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
being the weebs that you both are.

500
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Asia.

501
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh, that's clever.

502
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I love Japan.

503
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's really funny you're mentioning this,

504
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
because May was like,

505
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I hope nobody's going to think that the name is racist

506
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
because it has con in it.

507
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And I was like, what are you talking about?

508
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
She was like, you know, like Genghis Khan,

509
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
because like a third of all Asia is like offspring of Genghis Khan,

510
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
which is what, and I was like,

511
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
no, we call those Mongoloids, not cons.

512
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I did, I mean, of course,

513
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
my association went immediately to,

514
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm sure was named after this concept,

515
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
con from Star Trek, the original series,

516
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and Star Trek II, the Wrath of the Con.

517
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That also entered my mind.

518
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I immediately went and downloaded that movie,

519
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
which I have now, and I'm trying to figure out

520
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
how and where I can use that as part of the branding.

521
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Just him yelling con, and then you yell ten.

522
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah, exactly.

523
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I already went and I found the clip,

524
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and I've got it prepared,

525
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
of him yelling con in beautiful 1080p HD.

526
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Eric, but I'm trying to think of another clip

527
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
of someone saying tent, that I can pair up with it.

528
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't think there's a lot of instances in media

529
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
of people screaming the word tent.

530
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They're already screaming.

531
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It could be like a one high intensity,

532
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
one low intensity, I can make it work,

533
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
but I just can't think of, my immediate thought

534
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
went to that one anime show about the girls

535
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
camping, and it's really cute.

536
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But they speak that fucking Gooke language.

537
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You just gotta get the dub!

538
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I think they dubbed that show.

539
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm not using a fucking dub, I hate fucking dub.

540
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We just gotta ask the people.

541
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What's the best example of tent?

542
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Get a guy saying tent.

543
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That's a good idea.

544
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh, I was gonna say get primitive technology,

545
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
because I never talks in this video.

546
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What about that guy who was trying to make it

547
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
all the way through Ireland or whatever,

548
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
does he camp in tents perhaps?

549
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Maybe that guy.

550
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He did not in that series camp in a tent.

551
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Well, maybe he did.

552
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He must have said tent at one point,

553
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
because he has a backpack with a bunch of shit.

554
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Maybe he can go watch some episodes of Naked and Afraid

555
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and see if they talk about tents at all.

556
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't know, something like that.

557
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's a meme coming soon.

558
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's a half-finished meme, we'll get back to you.

559
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You'll see the finished version one of these days.

560
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Anyway, that conversational branched off of Has been Hotel,

561
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
which I want to say that I think is alright.

562
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I think the worst part about it is the stuff

563
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
that was animated a really long time ago,

564
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
the music song, the song where she's dancing

565
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and singing about how she wants to make a hotel.

566
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That has been around for a few years.

567
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You can tell there's some spotty animation in it.

568
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It was done by a team, right?

569
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It wasn't just Vizzy, it was alone.

570
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
There are a bunch of people who didn't work on it.

571
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't know much about it, aside from that.

572
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Just like Endless War.

573
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
There's a lot like Endless War, but overall.

574
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Except not in any way similar at all, since one was a TV show.

575
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
No, it's basically the same thing.

576
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, I mean, Vizzy in fact said that.

577
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
In the narrative, it's like the exact same turf war

578
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
fucking everybody against everybody.

579
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's just Endless War, but mostly rowdies.

580
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Everyone's a rowdy.

581
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's true hell.

582
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
No killers in sight, I can't stand it.

583
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Although that one Alistair, whatever,

584
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that guy's definitely a killer.

585
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't remember anyone's names.

586
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Doesn't matter.

587
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Radiohead.

588
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The writing, it suffers a little bit from...

589
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The end of the end of review, the writing, it suffers.

590
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I just leave it there.

591
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I just leave it there.

592
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's all right, it's just...

593
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I feel like when it comes to a team,

594
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
it's mostly a team of animators wanting to make an animation project.

595
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Rather than any team of writers, there may have been one or two scripted editors.

596
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I mean, I don't know about you guys.

597
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I sure wasn't grabbed by the premise.

598
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
That's my review.

599
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It was serviceable.

600
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The premise is just a little confusing.

601
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's pretty cool.

602
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's just sort of like, what is the purge?

603
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Why should I care for shit about it if the demons can't die?

604
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Can they die or can they not die?

605
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Why a hotel?

606
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Whoever heard of a hotel that you rehabilitate people at...

607
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It was for the pun of passing through, which I thought was not worth...

608
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Wait, what?

609
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
She says a hotel is for people who are just passing through, you know?

610
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What's the pun there?

611
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Passing through from hell to heaven.

612
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That was the in-universe explanation.

613
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That's awful.

614
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's just sort of weird because you don't go from hell to anywhere else.

615
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It was like a limbo hotel.

616
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Like you need help to pass through to the afterlife.

617
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I guess it's becoming purgatory now or something.

618
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I mean, can we think of a pun like the words has been hotel, except for a rehabilitation clinic?

619
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Has been hotel is not a great pun either.

620
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Just call it the smite site.

621
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
When would you ever describe someone who is dead as a has been?

622
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Being a has been is something you are before you.

623
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, okay, here's the strangest thing.

624
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't know, did you guys notice, because it was right at the end,

625
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
the whole time she's calling it the happy hotel.

626
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And at the last two seconds of the episode, Alistair just changes the name magically to has been hotel with no explanation.

627
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He thinks everyone...

628
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
No, he says like all these has beens, all these people who are shit demons and they suck,

629
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
we'll put them in a hotel and I'll laugh at them as they struggle to try and be good.

630
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That seems like an even weaker excuse for that.

631
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I mean, I think that what the show is going to be trying to suggest is that like these people all had a chance when they were alive and they failed that chance.

632
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Like Alistair says at one point, you know, these people, they had their chance to prove themselves when they were alive.

633
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And now that they're dead, this is where they're stuck because of those decisions.

634
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
There's no way to rehabilitate them because they already had their chance.

635
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So like to suggest that they are has beens in his mind is like these are people who could have been something,

636
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
but now they're in hell and they will never be anything again.

637
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I assume so.

638
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I guess so.

639
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:33,000
The premise of like generally I feel like it came from has been hotel is like kind of like a nice sounding name of something.

640
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I think the name came before the logic for sure.

641
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And like the princess of hell is just like put in there is like that's an obvious protagonist sort of thing.

642
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So that they clearly, you know, you don't need to think too much about why they can do all these things or why they have this viewpoint.

643
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's just, you know, if anything, I think a lot of the like the messiness in this probably just comes from the fact that the creator had invented like so many of these characters and concepts so long ago.

644
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Because like, yes, you know, we know that the radio demon was like a character she made up in high school and like it reminds me the overall tone of this thing reminded me a lot of this book that I wrote in 2010 called Tales

645
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:19,000
from the end of the world, which is similarly just like Chaotic City full of gangsters and violence, whatever, with a bunch of characters who I'd made up.

646
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And even at the time that I wrote that book, I had spent like two years continually like reworking these characters, reworking the narrative, changing all these things.

647
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And in the end, it's like this weird, clumsy, uneven story because of the fact that it's trying to maintain as many of the elements that I loved from the original version into the final version, regardless of how the story has changed.

648
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So it's like the story is not built around what makes like the most sense with these characters are in this setting.

649
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's built around, you know, how can I justify these characters in this setting, you know, and I think on, I don't know.

650
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That's definitely true.

651
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't know that's exactly the case with this show, but it definitely seems like these characters, a lot of them probably existed before the idea of the has been hotel existed.

652
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:15,000
See, I feel like so much that it has potential to be a really good show, but like you'd need to change quite a lot of like the premise as it is now.

653
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Like the fact that it's in like quote unquote hell is like it could easily just be a place like having hell and that's pretty essential because they're trying to redeem demons.

654
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I know, but like it's not like a made up concept because there's so many different types of hell.

655
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Different religions, different ideas of what it is.

656
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So like what you're saying is you could take everything exactly as is and just not call it hell and nothing would change.

657
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well, you have to change a few things.

658
00:29:45,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's just sort of like the pilot doesn't do a very good job of setting up the universe because I think they use the term hell and they assume the audience will understand exactly what that means immediately, even though that's not like I'm a little confused.

659
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Because like, yeah, I'm confused as to whether people can die.

660
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I guess they can't.

661
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
They can't die.

662
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm not sure.

663
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Like is the normal application.

664
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They definitely die in the purge.

665
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Like in the normal world, is it just a normal human world?

666
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Well, okay, here's the thing.

667
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
People die becomes grotesque monsters based on the whole premise of the show.

668
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Or does that have nothing to do with anything?

669
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, the whole premise of the show is that they have to die because they have the purge to clear out the population.

670
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
If they didn't die, it would do nothing.

671
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Then what's the point of hell?

672
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Is the purge a specific event where people get like removed by like God or Lucifer and other than that, they all can't die?

673
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't know.

674
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't know.

675
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Hopefully, if more of the show came into existence, we would have these questions.

676
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
How many years does this take for more, though?

677
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
This feels like one of those.

678
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The second episode will just be a long series of justifications for why all these questions don't need asking.

679
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I mean, I feel like this is one of those situations where the pilot is like an episode that is not part of the actual series when it gets made.

680
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Like episode one will be done again.

681
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It'll be different, but the characters will still be there.

682
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I mean, is this fun enough to watch the characters goof around?

683
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And I don't know.

684
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't like love the characters, but I like Charlie.

685
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I don't know.

686
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Like Aleister.

687
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You know, I said in our show, our video that like, I feel like he is her like special snowflake OC.

688
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
She's had since high school and she's wanted to like find a vehicle for.

689
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
She's finally done it.

690
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
She's succeeded, but I'm worried he is going to like drive the plot like a hundred percent and is going to be way too like up in everybody's business.

691
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And it's just going to get tiresome and boring and it's not going to, I don't know.

692
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's the problem with like having a story from, you know, the first story you ever write is shit, but if you continue to build upon like a shitty foundation,

693
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you will have something that looks kind of good, but like deep down is just sort of flawed inherently and you need to scrap it all and start again.

694
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You don't want to do that because it's like a cherished character, cherished world building.

695
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It's your baby.

696
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You don't want to start again, but like you guys should check this out.

697
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Let me introduce you to this concept that Michelle introduced me to.

698
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Okay.

699
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Look at this.

700
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
This is the music video for High School Musical 2.

701
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The song bet on it.

702
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay.

703
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm going somewhere with this.

704
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
This is in the audio links.

705
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This is a famous meme song for being so ridiculous and over the top and sometimes give it a watch and enjoy it.

706
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Okay.

707
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So this has long been like a huge Tumblr meme or something.

708
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Everybody loves this, but it's like a huge part of like Michelle's childhood and like her whole generation.

709
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay.

710
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Gib can't see it because it's not available in his country.

711
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But no fear.

712
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
No worries.

713
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
This episode is brought to you by NordVPN.

714
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Gib, you can watch this video.

715
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
No problem.

716
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
No.

717
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Don't even talk about that.

718
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The Norse people kill the Vikings all of them.

719
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah.

720
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That's fair.

721
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Okay.

722
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But here's what I'm getting at.

723
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So like in the same way that like these like stories of our youth can be like oddly impressed upon us and oddly big memes.

724
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Look at Take a Gander at this video by Tricia Paytas.

725
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Famous YouTube personality like two or three weeks ago or whatever made a shot for shot remake of this exact music video on the exact same like golf course in like Nevada or something.

726
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Just due to it being like such a gigantic meme and she is like a huge YouTuber who just had the resources now to recreate like this meme.

727
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
She's playing the character dressed like him with the same hairstyle as Zach Efron or whatever.

728
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And it's just like there are these there are these I don't know cultural milestones that you just get so attached to.

729
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
This this movie is famous for like, I guess it's famous for being bad.

730
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
This is awful.

731
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
What you're showing me is awful.

732
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It is awful.

733
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It speaks to like everyone in the world like Michelle will just like she we watch these because they're so funny to her or whatever.

734
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But but the fact is why is it funny.

735
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's funny Ben because it the amount of effort that went into shot for shot recreating a professional Disney Channel music video just because she fucking felt like it on the exact same ground.

736
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Wow.

737
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
How dare she stand where he stood.

738
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
What's what's the joke.

739
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:20,000
There is no joke or is it like funny because I mean I'm pretty sure Trisha Paytas is like like a living meme like a famous living meme.

740
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
She is in fact absolutely living meme and the fact that she would do this.

741
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I mean just to stand back in awe of this but the point I'm getting I'm sure if I was a big Trisha Paytas fan I would absolutely be living for this bed on it remake.

742
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I would absolutely stand.

743
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You're completely missing the point Ben.

744
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't think I am actually.

745
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I really don't think that it doesn't seem that ridiculous.

746
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I mean this doesn't seem like an over like it's just they got to the location there where it was filmed and there's a person holding the camera.

747
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
OK you clearly lack all the context of this because I just totally will.

748
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I will.

749
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I mean this this is not like on the level of I mean this is a very simple looking video.

750
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I mean I mean to the end of it.

751
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You know what this is.

752
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You know what this is.

753
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
This is just John Tron renting a cart but bigger.

754
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
This is John Tron cart debate.

755
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Chapter two.

756
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Yeah I mean.

757
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Who cares.

758
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
What John Tron was doing was recreating like a giant meme with full like professional production value.

759
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Paying a whole bunch of money to do a thing that isn't funny.

760
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Like it's only funny if you know the meme.

761
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Like it's not impressive to me just to watch this video.

762
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You guys are here.

763
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You guys are.

764
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm not impressed by this video.

765
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
My point is.

766
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Wow.

767
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
She sure liked this video to recreate it.

768
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That's where you need to be to understand my point.

769
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't know why you're over at.

770
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm so impressed.

771
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What's your point.

772
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's why I was asking you earlier whether it was funny to laugh at this situation or funny because the meme is really funny.

773
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Whether this is funny or not has anything to do with the point Nate's trying to make.

774
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think.

775
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
No it doesn't.

776
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It was pointing out.

777
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What is the point.

778
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That this happened.

779
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
That's why it's confused.

780
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The point is isn't it really funny and weird and silly when people recreate things that they were way into when they were kids.

781
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
You got my answer.

782
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The answer is yes.

783
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Is it.

784
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Question mark.

785
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I think isn't it.

786
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
No.

787
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's just it's just it's not funny as in like this is entertaining.

788
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's just like it's strange about the human condition that we can attach something.

789
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Like that was really confusing because you weren't like selling it as that and you kept arguing with us on our terms which made it like we were on the right track but we were completely on the off the right track.

790
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I understand your point now.

791
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's funny that humanity has got to the point where people do this.

792
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Kind of.

793
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I mean I look at it as just like I look at it as just really retarded.

794
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Like it's the stupidest idea.

795
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And I fucking.

796
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That's correct.

797
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I mean nothing.

798
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Which was probably looking at this gives me nothing but seething resentment and anger that this person has this money and has chosen to use it for something so bad that I know.

799
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Is going to get fuckloads of views and recoup that cost and people will like it and it will just make me want everybody to die as usual.

800
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
All right.

801
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Like even with that context it just to me this this specific video does not elicit that at all.

802
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Like I don't I don't feel like it just makes me it just makes me roll my eyes at the waste of human energy.

803
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It doesn't even seem that budget is just walking around and singing which you can do I mean there's a high you know there's a nice nice camera was used you know a day on the set you know one of the funny things about this is that she is a big fat lady.

804
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:51,000
He was like a skinny fit boy like he puts so much more energy into it and she is like like walking when he's like running and it's it's funny that she's so much low at whatever I don't have to explain this fucking meme it just is silly take my word for it.

805
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I've looked at crunch the numbers and the verdict is strange and amusing.

806
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So has been hotels animation.

807
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't I don't know if I really liked it.

808
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
That's what I was trying to figure out was how you were connecting this back to has been hotels.

809
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's what I was waiting for.

810
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It isn't happening.

811
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'm bringing it back.

812
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The connection here is weird things that people liked when they were young and then they put a lot of effort.

813
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So you're saying we're going to get a shot the shot remake of has been hotel ten years from now.

814
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Why that is funny.

815
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Is it funny because my god that point is not a joke.

816
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I don't know why you guys put a point in my brain.

817
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I just I just want you.

818
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I just want you.

819
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I just want you to explain like I like this episode what you think about this.

820
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The fact that she has done this.

821
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You say that this is working for what reason like would you have rather she did something else like what is what is not at all my personally would have rather she did something.

822
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Who are you talking about.

823
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Trisha is my opinion.

824
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't care about Trisha.

825
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
My point is that people do people get really attached to things they liked when they were kids.

826
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
That's the point.

827
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Your point.

828
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Your point Nate is that your point is that.

829
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh god.

830
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I got to set up the analogy that that that radio demon is to Vivzi as bet on it is to Trisha paytas.

831
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes.

832
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That's correct.

833
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Okay.

834
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
That's right.

835
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The reason I'm so lost in that.

836
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
She made the radio demon.

837
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's not something she liked when she was a kid.

838
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Why does that matter?

839
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
What's the difference?

840
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Well there's a huge fucking difference.

841
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I think that is a pretty salient difference.

842
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I mean like if I invent a character.

843
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It's not something that I'm just going to like.

844
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's not just that I was attached to it because I was young like it represents a part of me.

845
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's like it's something that has to do with like fundamentally who I am.

846
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Stop.

847
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Stop.

848
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
So what you're saying is there is no similarity between one thing person made when they were

849
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
young and thing person liked.

850
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
My point is not to say they're exactly the same.

851
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'll say this is a thing you could both be right about.

852
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And there you go.

853
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
All right.

854
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm.

855
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah.

856
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm interested in the idea.

857
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But like this.

858
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's just that this comparison.

859
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm so sorry I wasted everyone's time.

860
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I mean it's broadly similar.

861
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
We're in a podcast pretzel right now.

862
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yeah.

863
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And Nate is like responding to like the things that we are.

864
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
We have moved past or like we like Nate's ahead of us.

865
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Or like this is we're talking past each other.

866
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
We're talking about pretzel.

867
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I don't think so.

868
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah.

869
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Nobody knows.

870
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I feel like I know what's going on here.

871
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I am confused.

872
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I want to make this first.

873
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't understand anything.

874
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I don't understand anything.

875
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Nothing is funny.

876
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
John Tron sucks.

877
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
God damn.

878
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
John Tron sucks.

879
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah.

880
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Sucks so much.

881
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Tell it.

882
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I agree.

883
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Tell it.

884
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
No.

885
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Tell it like it is.

886
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
He has a bit of money and he can buy it like a costume.

887
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm none of that.

888
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm living for this Gib.

889
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm living for this Gibbon take right now.

890
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Gibbon hot take.

891
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Gibbons take.

892
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
More hot Gibbon takes.

893
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
If you please.

894
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Make a side channel.

895
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I just want to repeat something I said.

896
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Because Gibbon was talking about his.

897
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
His reaction to you guys talking about John Tron on the last episode in the chat.

898
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And I said if any of us had the resources that John Tron had, we could make things that

899
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
were much better, much faster than we have.

900
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's why I'm not impressed at all with him.

901
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I mean, we had one percent of the budget.

902
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Absolutely the things.

903
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
We're like nine percent of the budget for Radcon.

904
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Would they be more popular?

905
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know.

906
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Well, yeah.

907
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Okay.

908
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
The popularity is a is a is a fickle thing.

909
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I can't guarantee.

910
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That I would make videos that would be more widely viewed.

911
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
No, no, no.

912
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
The key to like popularity is to be shit.

913
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
If you are shit, you get the views.

914
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That's all it is.

915
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Okay.

916
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Lowest common denominator.

917
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's as simple as that.

918
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
By that you mean lowest common denominator.

919
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Then I unironically agree.

920
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
That's not what he said.

921
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
He said shit.

922
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Well, I don't know.

923
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I hate everything popular except PewDiePie.

924
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
He's all right.

925
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
When I do find out a thing is popular.

926
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I do lower my opinion of it significantly.

927
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I feel that happen inside.

928
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Did you ever imagine back in 2012 that we would arrive in a future

929
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
where we thought PewDiePie was pretty good

930
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and John Tron was total dog shit?

931
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
No, no, no.

932
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I don't sign off on this notion that PewDiePie is pretty good.

933
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
What are you talking about?

934
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I mean, neither do I.

935
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I don't watch PewDiePie.

936
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah, exactly.

937
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
He's better than John Tron.

938
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Why is he better than John Tron?

939
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Because John Tron is miserably bad.

940
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I cannot watch a John Tron video.

941
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't even think he's miserably bad currently.

942
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I don't know.

943
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
No, no.

944
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You know what?

945
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He isn't better as a content creator than John Tron.

946
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
His content is fine.

947
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
The only reason I've cared about PewDiePie at all

948
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
is that his attitude towards things is usually on the money.

949
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
He's like, you know what?

950
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I like this guy.

951
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And that's all.

952
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I like the person.

953
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The content I could leave.

954
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Very much.

955
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I watched like one, I don't know, I watched like one video of his in the last year

956
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
and I found it mildly entertaining.

957
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I have literally never been entertained by PewDiePie once in my life.

958
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So there we go.

959
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's a totally different, like John's out here making his like crafted jokes.

960
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
PewDiePie is like literally just like vlogging and then the editors, you know,

961
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
they spice it up, which is, it's fine.

962
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I've enjoyed it many a time, but you know, totally different.

963
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I guess I just have more respect for what PewDiePie does than John Tron.

964
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
See, I have more respect for John Tron

965
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
because he's obviously putting more work into it.

966
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Boy.

967
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
No, he's not.

968
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
He's definitely not.

969
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
This motherfucker gets out like one video a month.

970
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
PewDiePie has a video out every day.

971
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Like, I can't imagine that John Tron is doing more overall work with PewDiePie.

972
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Okay, okay, Digi.

973
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Let me ask you a question.

974
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Now, I can under, I can understand respecting the hustle,

975
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
but is it worth it?

976
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Now, I can under, I can understand respecting the hustle,

977
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
but is it worth respecting someone who is literally nothing but hustle?

978
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Like they have no other value other than their hustle.

979
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Look, I, I don't think that's the case.

980
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Like, I mean, I know people who watch PewDiePie.

981
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I get what's entertaining about his videos.

982
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I don't really find them entertaining, but like I look at it and I think,

983
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
okay, I can appreciate why if you think this is funny,

984
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
you'd want to watch this every single day, you know, and he, he does,

985
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
he mixes things up a lot more, you know, like there's a lot of variety.

986
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I watched a bunch of grumps for a bit a couple years ago.

987
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I watched a lot of grumps.

988
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Is it a similar appeal to that?

989
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Uh, I don't know.

990
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I mean, I don't fucking watch PewDiePie.

991
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Like I'm just saying that like what John Tron does, like to me is completely worthless.

992
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's just like dumping all this money into a void because the jokes are not funny.

993
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And I understand that other people find it funny.

994
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

995
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You know, maybe it's just as good as PewDiePie to those people.

996
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I don't know.

997
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Like I look at these John Tron videos, even the recent ones that people did like,

998
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
like the stupid flex tape video.

999
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I thought that was fucking horse shit.

1000
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Like not funny at all.

1001
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I can't even crack a smile.

1002
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I just get mad.

1003
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Still haven't seen it.

1004
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Like I just, as I watch his videos, I just get madder and madder that I see these,

1005
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
these high budget things being done.

1006
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And granted, I do think he, he scaled back certain elements from like when it was really bad,

1007
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
when he was like on that weird alien looking set.

1008
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Like it's, it's not that unnatural anymore.

1009
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I agree.

1010
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I agree.

1011
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I haven't watched John Tron in fucking years and I don't know this newest controversy is

1012
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
about, but it just sounds to me that like, like the problem is that YouTube in general

1013
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
for like people like us who actually care about the platform and like how we got here

1014
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
in the first place is that it's supposed to be unprofessional, like kind of like dirty

1015
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
content, I guess, just like clearly different from mainstream.

1016
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And it feels like John Tron's production values and kind of conceptualization and execution

1017
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
of ideas now feels very studio-esque.

1018
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Seeing John Tron sort of limp along in his current state kind of just sort of creatively,

1019
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
sort of like just sort of aping his past self in a sort of ghoulish imitation.

1020
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I acknowledge the problem there.

1021
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I see the same fault that you do.

1022
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But for me to say that, for me to say that PewDiePie is better for me, I would have to

1023
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
acknowledge that anything PewDiePie does has any actual value and I don't know if I can

1024
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
make that leap.

1025
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Okay.

1026
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That's fair.

1027
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't know.

1028
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You know, I had made a whole video and a whole to-do about the fact that like what John

1029
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Tron's problem was was that he was focusing too much on production value.

1030
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
But more so than that, it's not the production value itself that's the problem.

1031
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's that the production value isn't funny and the way he uses it isn't funny.

1032
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And like when you watch old John Tron videos, the main thing is that-

1033
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
The one where he goes to fucking New England was so baffling.

1034
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Do you see this one where he like goes to New England?

1035
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
No.

1036
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Anyway, let me finish my point.

1037
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That's the joke is that he's in New England.

1038
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The thing that made his older videos funny-

1039
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That one's unbelievable.

1040
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
God damn it!

1041
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The thing that made his older videos funny was the facial expressions and the way he

1042
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
says things.

1043
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's the quick zooms.

1044
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The-

1045
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
The-

1046
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You know, the fucking wacky Jackie shit.

1047
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You just zoom in really fast on his face.

1048
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
He says something.

1049
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's funny and ridiculous.

1050
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And you know, there's some funny commentary on the things he's talking about.

1051
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
But like-

1052
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And he had a bird.

1053
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And it didn't-

1054
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It's not a matter of like, oh, he raised the production value.

1055
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Therefore, it's bad.

1056
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It's that he's not doing the jokes that he's good at.

1057
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
He's doing his high concept jokes that his delivery doesn't match.

1058
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
His setup doesn't match.

1059
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
To go back to the point I was kind of making-

1060
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It was all in the delivery.

1061
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I think the reason-

1062
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
From the beginning.

1063
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Is that like, you look at like, you know, a bottom of the barrel Hollywood comedy.

1064
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And there's no good jokes.

1065
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
There's no good writing.

1066
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And it falls back on that like Hollywood sheen production value to make you think this is

1067
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
a movie.

1068
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And I feel like Jon Tron is kind of doing a similar thing with like, I have this budget.

1069
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It looks like a real thing, but there's no substance to it anymore.

1070
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And it's because he was always obsessed with like, doing a real production, you know?

1071
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Like, it's that mindset that I think a lot of YouTubers have always been stuck in of

1072
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
like, I want to, you know, like this is just a stepping stone for me to do something bigger.

1073
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And it's like, to me, it's like, YouTube is the bigger thing.

1074
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's the new thing that is taking away from the old media.

1075
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
The old media is flawed because of the fact that they are-

1076
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
They're concerned about things other than making something good, something unique, something

1077
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
artistic, you know?

1078
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And like the best YouTube channels are ones that are just so unique and so in that, like

1079
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
my recent favorite, I showed this to Nate, is a guy called Steve 1989 MRE Info.

1080
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And all he does is review rations, like military rations from-

1081
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It's pretty sick.

1082
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
It's pretty sick.

1083
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Oh my God.

1084
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
From like all throughout history.

1085
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
That's amazing.

1086
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
He, I highly recommend this channel.

1087
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's super relaxing, got an ASMR quality to it.

1088
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And the guy is just, he has like textbook knowledge of every fucking MRE that's ever existed.

1089
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So he'll get like a-

1090
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
What is it?

1091
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
What is the MRE?

1092
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Military rations?

1093
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Military rations?

1094
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Okay, okay.

1095
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah, so-

1096
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Steve 1989 MRE Info, got it.

1097
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So like just yesterday, he put out this-

1098
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
First autocomplete.

1099
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
He just recently, the other day, put out an hour and 20 minute long video just about this

1100
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
like set he got of these World War II rations.

1101
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah, the 1945 C ration review preserve vintage 24 hour MRE testing marathon.

1102
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And you were the worst talk over person on this fucking podcast, bro.

1103
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I just think it's funny and it had to be said aloud for the viewer to get it.

1104
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
This man, if you want to watch him literally eat 75 year old food, this is the channel for you.

1105
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And it's not presented as like a stunt eating thing or anything like that.

1106
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
He like very carefully goes through every single step of like opening the ration,

1107
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
showing you all of its contents, explaining it, eating the food, reviewing it in depth.

1108
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And he's so excited about it.

1109
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Like this dude, particularly that hour and 20 minute video because it's like the last known existing

1110
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
like set of this particular type of ration.

1111
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And he bought like this huge box of them and he eats like six of them in the course of this video.

1112
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And like they're all just like crackers because World War II rations are not interesting.

1113
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
They're all just like six biscuits and like some jelly or something.

1114
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But like even the slightest variant between the different ones that he opens is enough to make him like,

1115
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
oh, this is so cool.

1116
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Like this is when they started varying them.

1117
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
You know, like this is the first era where they started adding jam into the fucking thing.

1118
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And he's like so fucking excited.

1119
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And there's a part where he goes to try to eat this jelly.

1120
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But he's looking at it and he's like, I'm not sure about this because when it's these old ones,

1121
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
he constantly has to inspect all of it to see if it's, you know, edible.

1122
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And so he's looking at the jelly.

1123
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
He's like, hmm, it looks like there might be.

1124
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And then he goes and he puts it on a plate and puts it under a microscope and looks under the microscope.

1125
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It shows footage of like, like there's moving, like, you know, micro stuff.

1126
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And so he empties out the jelly tin and there's like a little hole in the tin and he's like,

1127
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
oh, good thing I didn't fucking eat this because I'd be, you know, I'd be fucking with the shit later.

1128
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Six feet under.

1129
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
How much leave?

1130
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
What is fucking half?

1131
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
What's what's happening?

1132
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
What's happening?

1133
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Internet? Internet issues?

1134
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yes.

1135
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
How a Steve guy, how much of the appeal of the channel is that the shit he's eating is like some ancient shit

1136
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
reclaimed from an Egyptian tomb.

1137
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
He also makes videos where he'll just eat like new modern rations from all over the world.

1138
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Just any, like any ration, basically, if you send it to him, he'll do a review.

1139
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And they're all just like filmed on a light box, you know, like a basic setup you could make on your desk in 15 minutes.

1140
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
He's been doing the same setup in his room the whole time, even though this guy gets millions of views.

1141
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Like he is, he has over a million subs doing this.

1142
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Who is the audience?

1143
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Autism level four.

1144
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That's exactly literally what I've been saying since I discovered the channel is autism level four,

1145
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
but also any military nut because like he goes into a lot of historical shit.

1146
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I gotta read this one.

1147
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
This one is called 1957 rations, small detachment, five persons, five man, 24 hour ration pack,

1148
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
astoundingly unusual, 24 hour MRE and a cigarette review.

1149
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Oh yeah, dude, he refused a cigarette.

1150
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It is so good.

1151
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
The first time that I saw him open one that had cigarettes in it, I like the whole video.

1152
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It's like, please tell me he's going to smoke one.

1153
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Please tell him.

1154
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Sure enough, right there in his room, he smokes that cigarette, gives it a full detailed review,

1155
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
just like the food, geeking out over how good, like wow.

1156
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And he has all these like hilarious like catchphrases that he says as well.

1157
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But like let's get this all onto a tray.

1158
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Nice.

1159
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Or next time I'll bring you, I'll be back soon with something old or something new or old.

1160
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That's how he ends all his videos.

1161
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Anyways, I love this guy and but yeah, I think the audience for it because there seems to be a big community

1162
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
of people who who like review and trade these MREs around with each other like sell and trade them

1163
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
because he's always mentioning like, oh, I got to save that because there's a few people who might want this piece.

1164
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
The original hashtag post food boys.

1165
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Not quite.

1166
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
You know, the funny thing about it, I mean, MREs, they have like real food in them,

1167
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
especially the newer ones are like really advanced.

1168
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And like you could have a full meal because they come with like little fire starter cubes, you know,

1169
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
that you can use to like cook in bag and stuff like that.

1170
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
There's all kinds of interesting technology they've come up with to make so you could cook stuff in an MRE.

1171
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But they are like, I mean, if you were to buy a modern MRE because they sell them,

1172
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
you can just buy like literally what the military is eating.

1173
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And it's only like seven bucks for one package.

1174
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So it's, you know, a full meal for $7.

1175
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Obviously, the older ones probably sell for more.

1176
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
But like, you know, vintage like I've learned.

1177
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
1963 was a good year.

1178
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I know so much bullshit about MREs now after watching this.

1179
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I could probably like I've watched enough of this guy's videos in the last week that I could probably tell you

1180
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
like the distinctions of different eras of MREs.

1181
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm ready for the MRE PCP lecture.

1182
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah.

1183
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yo, did you show me a couple?

1184
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But you should check out this one.

1185
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I put this in the links down there.

1186
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It's this fucking front from 1899 to 1902.

1187
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
We're talking 120 years old.

1188
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
This one is a 2018 MRE.

1189
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
This is a modern one.

1190
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
2018 MRE pepperoni pizza.

1191
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It's a bag.

1192
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Oh dude.

1193
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That one.

1194
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
The pepperoni pizza one is one of the most views because apparently that was like something

1195
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
that the military had been trying to perfect for like decades.

1196
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Like they've been trying to get the perfect pepperoni pizza and they kept having to cancel

1197
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
the project and like change the technology.

1198
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And so like people were like.

1199
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
This is where my tax dollars go towards.

1200
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yeah.

1201
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
How can we get our soldiers bags of pepperoni?

1202
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Well, the thing about it is that like because all of it is about morale.

1203
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's all empty columns.

1204
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Fuck this shit.

1205
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
They're trying to make the ration something that you will be like excited to eat because

1206
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
this is all they eat when they're on deployment is these rations, you know.

1207
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So it's like they want to create some variety.

1208
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Excited is distracted.

1209
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I need them to be focused on killing.

1210
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
This is bullshit.

1211
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah.

1212
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But the pizza in particular, he's talking about like people are so jazzed that the pizza

1213
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
is finally there and he's like, you know, people are going to be fucking trading these.

1214
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
People are going to be obsessed with these pizza ones.

1215
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
But like when he reviews it, the pizza looks like shit.

1216
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Like there's no way I would eat it at all.

1217
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Like period.

1218
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I would not eat that pizza, but.

1219
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Oh, what the.

1220
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
We've crafted.

1221
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Okay.

1222
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
There's some weird.

1223
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
There's some weird shit on these crackers.

1224
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
There's like some weird yellow goop on those crackers.

1225
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Okay.

1226
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Well, let's let's let the audience tell them to the visuals.

1227
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I'm pretty excited about.

1228
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I'm pretty into this.

1229
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I like this.

1230
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
They're good.

1231
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
The 1899 one that Nate linked in particular is like the oldest and like grossest thing

1232
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
that he eats.

1233
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And like the whole video, he's going like, what am I doing?

1234
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Like why am I?

1235
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Why am I subjecting myself to this?

1236
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
But like he also, he's very particular that like he can't leave a plate clean because

1237
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
it's like this is all this is all historical artifacts, basically.

1238
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So it's like anything he doesn't eat, he has to save.

1239
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So if he doesn't, if he's like cooked it and can't save it, it's like, well, I have

1240
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
to eat it because like, you know, this is this is ancient history.

1241
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You know, he's just so excited throughout the video.

1242
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Like he's talking about how disgusting this is.

1243
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And he's wearing a clean plate club shirt as your music.

1244
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
That video, I think that I think all of us have like one thing that we've made that

1245
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
completely encapsulates us as a human being.

1246
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And that is that particular video for that guy of just like watching him try to struggle

1247
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,000
to eat this disgusting beef from 120 years ago in a boiled porridge.

1248
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Imagine being the cow that yielded that beef.

1249
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And this is where your journey ends.

1250
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
What a legend.

1251
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
This guy's jacked.

1252
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Holy shit.

1253
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
He's pretty ripped.

1254
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I think he probably was in the military.

1255
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Unlike all the other cows that have turned to shit a long time ago.

1256
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
This cow stayed in the forest.

1257
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Immortalized for all time.

1258
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It's true.

1259
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
In this YouTube video.

1260
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
He made it 120 years past his expiration date.

1261
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Literally past expiration date because it's food.

1262
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Nice.

1263
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah.

1264
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
That's the funny thing about it is even if he's eating something from like the 90s,

1265
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
you still have to think about like this is 25 year old food.

1266
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Even if it's a year old, it's kind of gross.

1267
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
But oftentimes the stuff is extremely well preserved.

1268
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
They built this stuff to last as long as possible and some parts of these things will

1269
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
last fucking, they'll be completely fresh like 50 years later.

1270
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It's crazy.

1271
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yeah.

1272
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Check it out everybody.

1273
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Well, speaking of whatever the fuck this whole thing was, I want to jump into a topic rant.

1274
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I have about nofap November.

1275
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Yeah.

1276
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Okay.

1277
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
The other one.

1278
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Fuck it.

1279
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Fuck it indeed.

1280
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
But like also the idea just doesn't make any sense.

1281
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And I know why it's so popular and it makes me annoyed.

1282
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So the ultimate premise, like underlying like aside from all the memes and the jokesters,

1283
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,500
the idea is that people are quote unquote addicted to pornography and they wacker it,

1284
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:15,000
they jacker it all day every day and it takes hours out of their life and they want to like

1285
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
curb that addiction by not fapping so much.

1286
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah.

1287
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yeah.

1288
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I mean it's a reasonable, understandable goal.

1289
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
There's also a lot of things that they say.

1290
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Like if you go to the nofap guys who like really swear by it, there's a lot of different

1291
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
things they claim it gives them.

1292
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I don't know if any benefits are worth becoming one of those guys.

1293
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I don't think, well the thing is I think that a lot of it is psychosomatic.

1294
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's like if you do something as difficult as not fapping for a month and then you feel

1295
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
good about yourself because you're accomplishing this goal and so you're like walking around

1296
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
with all this confidence and all this like yeah I did it and it's like that's where it's

1297
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
coming from.

1298
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I think it's probably the same thing with Keto.

1299
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Like people that do Keto and are really into Keto, like me, talk about how it gives you

1300
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
like mental clarity and stuff and like I don't feel like I've achieved some like super mental

1301
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
clarity or anything.

1302
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Yeah.

1303
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But I think some people probably talk about increase energy, increase mental acuity, increase

1304
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
such and such and improve this and they're like I'm just.

1305
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You know I think it might be that some people need to believe that that stuff will happen

1306
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
in order to convince themselves to do it.

1307
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's like it can't just be that I'm losing weight.

1308
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It has to be that like it somehow is making my whole life better you know.

1309
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Yeah.

1310
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yeah.

1311
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Their belief in the mental clarity grants them a small measure of it.

1312
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yeah.

1313
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So like it's, I get it right.

1314
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
It's fine.

1315
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:46,000
But the idea of doing it for a month, just one month of the year is not the way to curb

1316
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
the addiction if you actually have it.

1317
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
You need to do it all the time and the fact that it's like a month that you can, like

1318
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I mean people joke about doing dick destroy December or whatever they say.

1319
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Right.

1320
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Like as soon as no not November is over, they destroy their dick and fap every day.

1321
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Like completely.

1322
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
You will be no fap November and now it's no not November.

1323
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
When did it change?

1324
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Alliteration man.

1325
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You know I think it might have to do with like no fap particularly as a movement having

1326
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
some kind of weird associations in like political landscape.

1327
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You think so?

1328
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I think it's just that the term nut has come more into common parlance.

1329
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I mean it's also like no not November is you know yeah the better alliteration or.

1330
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's made it all the way to Capitol Hill now infesting our laws.

1331
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I mean I never heard nut as a verb before couple years ago.

1332
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't know.

1333
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It's kind of new to me anyway.

1334
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
But yeah I also know that like the proud boys were all like no fap or whatever.

1335
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
So maybe that has to do with it.

1336
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah that sounds about right.

1337
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But yeah like it's a silly like cutting off of an addiction like immediately and like

1338
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
holding yourself to it for a month straight is sort of like too intensive.

1339
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Like it's like an exercise.

1340
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You need to like wean yourself off of it slowly and then do it for a very long time.

1341
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I mean even if you cut cold turkey like it has to be like you said if it's really an

1342
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
addiction you have to stop.

1343
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You can't just play at stopping for a while.

1344
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
You have to stop like you can't just say oh I'm going to not smoke for a month and

1345
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
then go right back to smoking.

1346
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Yeah that's the thing.

1347
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I guess the idea is that hopefully you'll go a month without doing it and it'll teach

1348
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
you like something about the benefits of it.

1349
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
That doesn't happen.

1350
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
New perspective.

1351
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
You can see the people on Twitter literally just like like Jax played talking about how

1352
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
because people keep betting him money to do it so he does it each each year and then

1353
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
at the end he was like oh yeah you have the biggest come in the whole universe as soon

1354
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
as the month is over.

1355
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
It's like okay well then this means nothing to you other than an excuse to make a couple

1356
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
hundred dollars from some idiot who wanted to bet you couldn't do it.

1357
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
The only the best reason well Gibbs point about it only being a month is foolish but

1358
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,000
like the best reason I ever heard historically was just like it will like if you can't jack

1359
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
off you will then need to go find women you can have sex with which is an excellent motivating

1360
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
factor.

1361
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Maybe.

1362
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Yeah but do that do that all year.

1363
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Why November?

1364
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yeah I mean you're right.

1365
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Nobody's outside in November.

1366
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
The one month thing is the fools are in there.

1367
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I don't know.

1368
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
But like it's not just all that.

1369
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Oh god I'm getting shot at.

1370
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,160
It's not just that it's like because people could argue that it being an event gets people

1371
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,640
to start and that's good enough you know that's fine.

1372
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,440
It's just that the reason it's so popular and people talk about it every time November

1373
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,440
rolls around is because teenagers and young adults love talking about sex and laughing

1374
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,440
because it's really funny.

1375
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,440
Yeah that's true.

1376
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,440
Like to bring up November is the big joke of the day and everyone goes hee hee.

1377
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,600
Yeah I mean I think it's definitely people are like chomping at the bit to have a socially

1378
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,320
acceptable reason to talk about masturbation.

1379
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:01,760
Like speaking personally of somebody who talks about masturbation out of turn all the time

1380
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,760
for no reason.

1381
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,160
When it's not warranted or appreciated.

1382
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,160
Right.

1383
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,800
It's often looked down upon that I do that.

1384
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,600
So like I look at this and I'm like what the fuck.

1385
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,600
Oh so now it's okay.

1386
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,160
It's like your gay pride month basically.

1387
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,800
We literally spend all year pretending that we don't masturbate and then this month it's

1388
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,880
like everybody's making a big deal out of the fact that they've stopped doing it.

1389
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,800
It's like okay so that's like implicitly admitting that everyone masturbates all the time.

1390
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,520
So can we please just like accept that as a thing we're all doing.

1391
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,880
Can we talk about it more than just in November.

1392
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,160
Plus that it's just like all the people who do it like say you know it's like implicitly

1393
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,760
we were jacking off the whole time.

1394
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,000
But all the people who don't care about no fat November just take it as an excuse to

1395
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,760
be even more egregious with their sex talk all the time.

1396
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,400
Is there a big cultural smoke screen to be destroyed.

1397
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,760
Is there a big cultural smoke screen around the fact that we're all jacking off all the

1398
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,760
time.

1399
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,760
I mean among what communities.

1400
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,600
Among like I don't know old people.

1401
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,600
Yeah probably.

1402
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,880
In society a lot of sex is bad.

1403
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,880
What society says.

1404
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,400
I think a lot of people especially women don't want to.

1405
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,400
Maybe if you go to a fucking evangelical megachurch or whatever maybe you're a Mormon.

1406
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,040
No I think a lot of people like don't want to admit that they masturbate or they don't

1407
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,320
want to talk about it or don't want to signal it like they're afraid that it makes them

1408
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,320
weird.

1409
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,880
I literally don't know those people and I wouldn't want to.

1410
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,640
So like to me that's like such a foreign concept.

1411
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:26,640
I'm sure you're right I'm sure they're out there but I don't it's not that I don't

1412
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,680
believe they exist.

1413
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:32,240
I don't believe in them in the way that I don't believe and say the teachings of Islam.

1414
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,720
Well hey there's a great example here.

1415
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,240
There's a great example here which is just that so me and Michelle stayed with Digi

1416
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,160
for the last couple of days and we saw that glorious shining tweet from Digi that was

1417
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:48,040
just proud to be the first loser of hashtag no nut November while we were you know at

1418
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,680
the house and like me and Michelle gave each other a look.

1419
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,680
Are you still there when I do that.

1420
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,240
Yeah yeah we were fucking there when you did that.

1421
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,840
That was our last day there.

1422
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,680
So we were just like OK we are now aware that like just a few short feet from us Digi was

1423
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,880
going to town you know whacking off and as God intended but you know you don't like to

1424
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,240
think about that particularly much.

1425
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:16,080
So I go up to the water cool and said hey Steve I had a really good nut the other day.

1426
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:22,880
You know if we can if as a society we can have like Brazil or Macadamia we have we have

1427
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,600
those like breast milk pumping stations like airports where am I like jacking off boost.

1428
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,440
What I think is the funniest part about that analogy is that neither of you even thought

1429
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,960
for a moment that I was just telling a joke.

1430
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,520
You were absolutely sure.

1431
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:44,240
Well we know you so we felt confident with them on this one if I were a funny joke but

1432
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,720
it's a real life joke.

1433
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,720
It is.

1434
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,440
You know how I know that it wasn't just a joke because I know that to you it would be

1435
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,440
so much funnier if it were true.

1436
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,440
Yeah.

1437
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,440
Yeah.

1438
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,520
Well the funny thing about it is that I didn't tweet that until like 12 25 because I just

1439
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,000
hadn't realized it was no not November.

1440
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,200
And so when I got to the computer and saw that I was like oh I'm pretty sure I was nutting

1441
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,200
at midnight.

1442
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:13,960
So like yeah there were a few people who responded to me like oh you weren't first this person

1443
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,960
cracked.

1444
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,440
Oh shut up everybody who says that I nutted right before I tweeted like am I literally

1445
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,960
like busting out and then immediately break out my phone.

1446
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,040
No at the fucking neither of you got one hand on the dick and the other hand over the send

1447
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:32,960
ready to send like the only reason I was masturbating was so I could make that tweet.

1448
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:39,400
I'm sure for somebody maybe they were thinking about that so I guess now I understand I understand

1449
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:44,080
the appeal of not fapping or nutting or whatever we're calling it whatever the kids are calling

1450
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,080
it these days.

1451
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,080
Whackering.

1452
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,080
Yeah.

1453
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,080
Buggery.

1454
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:54,280
Fuck the no nut November I'm all about the Coomer meme.

1455
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,280
You are a big Coomer.

1456
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,080
I've never identified with any meme character more than the Coomer.

1457
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:05,120
I get the appeal because it's like it takes time out of your day it's a big it's dumb

1458
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,640
it doesn't accomplish anything it's a waste of time that could use them productively.

1459
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,040
The thing about that is that for the like since I've been working on slime and punishment

1460
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:18,400
I have been fapping like way less because I just want to fucking filled with purpose

1461
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,920
yes because I'm because I'm filled with purpose all the time and I just don't I'm like I'm

1462
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,520
like no that's not what I want to do right now.

1463
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:32,840
I mean who is out there like going like oh man I really want to get something done but

1464
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:38,040
I'm going to go fap instead like you fap because you you don't have anything to do yeah I definitely

1465
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:42,720
procrastinate sometimes you know but I am definitely procrastinated we need title

1466
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:49,360
drop by being like no I'll jerk off for a while it needs to change it needs to change

1467
01:07:49,360 --> 01:08:00,600
from no fap no not November to find purpose November what a better world what if we imagine

1468
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:05,960
if we had a whole month just dedicated to like helping people find purpose well obviously

1469
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:12,440
because that's better because that's hopefully the end goal that not fapping doing keto you

1470
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:17,920
know other other godly godly practices I don't know I mean I suppose should be find purpose

1471
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:28,440
February I would no no it's funnier when there's no alliteration at all the problem with find

1472
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:33,800
purpose February is that you have to try to find that purpose before the 14th or else

1473
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:39,480
you're going to feel lonely all month oh we need a shirt shirt on the on the procrastinator

1474
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:56,800
shirt store first loser of find purpose the ramifications of that are staggering I actually

1475
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:03,640
want that can we get that on the store on this episode drops please yeah we need a volunteer

1476
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,360
to go make the shirt but Ben I think you're the man for the job you you you make the art

1477
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:15,320
we'll slap it on there okay sure okay I can do I can make that happen you know we really

1478
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,280
got to capitalize when there's a big laugh there's a big joke that's when the wallets

1479
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:24,800
loosen and everyone thinks themselves who I could participate when we all get the big

1480
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,200
laugh we're literally laughing all the way to the bank because we all recognize the money

1481
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:33,920
making opportunity yeah that's the reason we're actually laughing that's why I'm really

1482
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:42,000
laughing yeah I'm rubbing my hands the dollar signs appear in our eyes yeah speaking of

1483
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
what a high note speaking of classic cartoons I did something a little strange I did something

1484
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:54,080
that I found very speaking of classic cartoons yes when were we talking about when the dollar

1485
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,160
signs appear in your eyes that's a cartoon thing okay maybe maybe that was a little bit

1486
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,880
of a stretch but that's what I was thinking but but it reminded me of cartoons and I was

1487
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:06,960
like I found myself doing this and I was like this is so not Ben core this is so human core

1488
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:14,000
right now but I'm but I'm reveling in a little bit I watched a bunch of Mickey Mouse cartoons

1489
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,940
that were really good I don't know I saw one I saw a Mickey Mouse cartoon from the official

1490
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:27,760
Mickey Mouse YouTube channel in my recommendations and I was like huh that's like a more modern

1491
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:34,840
kind of modernish yeah and I clicked it I was like let's see what this is about and I watched it

how fun here here here's a link you you fools you doubt you doubt me you dare to doubt me

1500
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:33,720
I've I've seen this series I'm assuming you're talking it's basically like the hotel of Mickey

1501
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:41,160
Mouse I clicked one just looks like a cuphead ripoff I clicked one and I noticed that they all

1502
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:46,120
had like they all had like a like a regional kind of like everyone took place in like a distinct

1503
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,440
region of the world and that they were really going for like a strong local flavor kind of thing

1504
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:57,520
and the ones that were set in like you know I like that looking places a lot of them were like

1505
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:06,120
silent you know those sometimes they were in other languages and like subtitled and I just noticed

1506
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:12,520
this video has like a fairly large down I mean not that big and I was like oh my god Mickey Mouse

1507
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:20,640
is a real cartoon character features and animations in the modern day shots yeah I mean I'm

1508
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,000
just saying there's a sizable ish kind of down vote portion is there something people don't like

1509
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:33,960
about this is it cuz it's Mickey or is it too edgy but to it's so fucking edgy edgy yeah maybe

1510
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:39,600
they thought it was a hard and they were waiting for the shoot a drop and it never did yeah that's

1511
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:46,360
probably it I just cut to a random moment where it's like Mickey and Donald and goofy standing

1512
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:51,280
against this like white picket fence and it looks exactly like a shot from Billy and Mandy and

1513
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:56,880
it's freaking me out look at this fucking look at this look at this incredible look at this

1514
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:03,320
incredible fucking watercolor background alright right right yeah looks pretty good yeah good

1515
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:09,560
looking show I'm not gonna watch it cuz fuck Disney I mean I have 100% agree and yet I watched

1516
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:17,880
like three hours of these I forgive you maybe not three hours they're very tightly made like

1517
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:23,520
this they're not like four kids they're not like new Disney these are made by people who presumably

1518
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:30,280
made by people who actually give a shit about the you know the whole animation thing yeah yeah

1519
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:35,640
like you look at this and compared to what what Nate linked and like the aesthetic is just so

1520
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:41,200
superior it's so much well compared to Disney Junior fucking Winnie the Pooh ass looking at that's

1521
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:45,800
like that's like the default style for these characters as they're drawn for the most part

1522
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:51,400
and rendered in like Disney's promotional material oh yeah they all look like I'm more of a Sean the

1523
01:13:51,400 --> 01:14:02,400
Sheep man myself a claymation all day she went downhill Bahasa Bahasa Indonesia you know here's

1524
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:07,600
something I'm interested in cuz I'm thinking about how I just said like fuck Disney I'm not

1525
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:13,720
gonna watch this right and I'm wondering how do you guys feel about the idea of like sacrificing

1526
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:20,920
your ability to watch something potentially good or even made with heart by good people because

1527
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:27,360
you do you truly think the funding behind it is evil I mean this is super relevant because

1528
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:32,640
BlizzCon just happened okay yeah the whole big thing when something like that comes up it's

1529
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:39,120
really my my first thought is well if I don't like the company and I don't want to give them

1530
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:44,960
money I will pirate it if I want to see it or play it good here here's okay I think that I think

1531
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,200
that I if there was something I really wanted and the only way I could get it was to buy it from

1532
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:57,680
an evil corporation like probably I would do it I don't think I have the I don't think I have

1533
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:03,760
the willpower to be like to resist something that I genuinely crave and desire so the way to do

1534
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:09,080
that a pound of an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure so what you got to do is preventative

1535
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:13,560
you got to purge yourself of material desires in the first place so that you never find yourself

1536
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,160
in that situation well it's consistent my thought process behind this because I was like thinking

1537
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,800
about this in relation to Blizzard and stuff the last couple days because like I've always kind of

1538
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,560
liked playing Diablo and the new Diablo is coming out and like you know what's on the trailer it

1539
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,560
looked pretty cool it looks pretty cool right and and I'm wrestling with it because like fuck

1540
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,480
fuck Activision Blizzard like they're just you know the whole blitz channel there's in general

1541
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,080
Activision's like business practices for years now has been fucking terrible like body

1542
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:43,840
prodigy as a nightmare so like the the first like gut reactions like oh fuck them I'm not gonna buy

1543
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,800
their shit and like the react like people kind of like instantly forgetting the boycotts they were

1544
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,880
talking about just like last week dude like I saw people forget about this it was talked about that

1545
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:58,400
like Dick Masterson pointed out that you know all these people were like oh yeah boycott Blizzard

1546
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:05,120
and like the Blizzard stock went down by like two points for one day immediately recovered and it

1547
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:10,880
made no difference right like but they're completely justified you know in in the eyes of the public

1548
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,040
of course and that's the whole problem right because like let's say let's say everyone there's a huge

1549
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:23,840
boycott right and and Overwatch 2 does fucking abysmal uh the the results of that are Activision

1550
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,240
and Blizzard are fine they have a ton of money but the team who worked on that game is now their

1551
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:33,840
jobs are at risk well this is this is a this is about the Hong Kong thing right yeah I mean it's

1552
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,920
that's part of it that's the most recent example but Activision has been terrible I would I would

1553
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:44,160
imagine that like their biggest market is China so like even if there's a backlash I was watching

1554
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:49,520
a video and the actually right now the US market is still bigger but the problem is like okay China's

1555
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,480
growing much faster so in a few years yeah but but here's the thing here's the thing most people

1556
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,520
outside of of like Hong Kong are not like this is a political issue and most people are not going

1557
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:04,560
to be motivated to make like a change in their life because they they don't agree with what a company

1558
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,440
said about this foreign policy issue I mean that doesn't surprise me at all it's gonna have a

1559
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:14,160
fractional impact on outside of Chinese government and it's and like ever and everyone in China is

1560
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:18,800
going to be on board with them shitting on Hong Kong well that the question I have is how much of

1561
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:25,040
that Chinese audience is outside Hong Kong like Hong Kong is the main place that that has American

1562
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:31,280
cultural import like they Hong Kong is the city like Hong Kong is the only part of China that is in

1563
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:41,680
any way similar to America like China is technologically advanced they have like games and

1564
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,760
stuff there you know and that's the whole thing like a lot of things Activision and Blizzard

1565
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,160
have been doing they've been like censoring their their games and stuff to appease the Chinese market

1566
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:54,080
which happened before the whole Blitzcrank thing I really hope I'm not talking out of my ass here

1567
01:17:54,080 --> 01:18:00,480
but I think that Hong Kong is not under the same Chinese government that it is like you know like

1568
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,880
suppressing that is like suppressing a lot of like foreign the issue is that China is

1569
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,920
Hong Kong has always had like a certain sovereignty and China is trying to take it away

1570
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:17,360
they're trying to bring Hong Kong under the same rules as everybody else which would which would

1571
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:23,280
really suck it would fucking suck for the people in Hong Kong and it would also suck for everyone

1572
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,920
else because again like I mean if you have any like Chinese movies you really love probably Hong

1573
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:34,080
Kong cinema you know like it's the most culturally relevant part of China like that's because again

1574
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:41,680
they have that population market wise it it is insignificant compared to all of mainland China

1575
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,000
I don't know how true that is because I don't know how much access just one but that's that's the

1576
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,400
whole thing the reason why all these companies are are bending the knee to the Chinese government

1577
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,600
is that because even though China's market right now isn't huge it's growing the western market

1578
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,240
saturated so the next like billion dollar things are all going to happen in China so by

1579
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:04,880
planting the seeds early they can gain control of that emerging I mean the market's got to be big

1580
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,680
because you hear all the time that like western movies are made with the Chinese audience right

1581
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:15,600
now because right there's this I just wonder how much of that of that Chinese audience is just

1582
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,840
Hong Kong there's seven million by the way Hong Kong you know yeah but how many people there's

1583
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:25,120
got to be hundreds of millions in China there's like billions and billions in China over a billion

1584
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,280
yeah yeah though I mean who knows how many are the actual consumers okay but but question on this

1585
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:34,240
point um on the specifics of the story so the thing that people are mad about right is that they

1586
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:40,160
banned like a winner from after he won what I don't know hearthstone I don't know and uh he

1587
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:46,160
wore a said free Hong Kong or something something that alluded to free Hong Kong supporting Hong Kong

1588
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:52,320
against China okay I'm with you now now if they banned him because that was a political thing they

1589
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:58,240
don't agree with okay that's bad obviously well well what if they just they don't they did it because

1590
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:04,400
they did it because it's it's anti-China and China is a big market like the thing the thing that for

1591
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:09,200
them to for them to platform an anti-China message hurts their market are we sure they didn't just

1592
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:13,520
do it because they have a policy of no political yes Nate because that would be fucking stupid

1593
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:20,800
what they had is like a flimsy is a flimsy uh policy which was like no hate speech uh but it was

1594
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:27,440
very vague uh as to what like don't don't say bad things and it was the actual the actual policy

1595
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,600
was saying like you can't bring up controversial messaging in a tournament it can only talk about

1596
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,480
the game however yeah I'm sure that's their excuse but if he'd said like fuck north korea nobody

1597
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,800
would have banned him for anything right because like I mean active blizzard themselves used their

1598
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,320
game for political messaging all the time but that's besides the point the thing is like that was

1599
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:49,440
the read they released the whole big article on their blog talking about this um to the American

1600
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,640
like western market about why they made this decision to ban blitzhung I had nothing to do with

1601
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:57,440
china but they released a separate statement for chinese social media where they said we're deeply

1602
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:06,160
offended and will always protect the chinese regime yikes if that's if that's as described that is

1603
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,520
pretty revealing I mean that's that's what's been going on I mean it's not just blizzard there's been

1604
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:16,000
all kinds of companies right the nba it's all about the market it's all about the market yeah of

1605
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,480
course corporations are gonna companies are that sell shit are gonna side with china over hong kong

1606
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,760
because there's more customers there yeah but it's just it's really unfortunate that and my question

1607
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:33,840
is I guess is this a failure of self control or of morals in the west like because wait what they're

1608
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:39,440
still a bigger market for these American companies the same thing not exact self control and morals

1609
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:43,600
no they can be completely different like um what I'm saying I thought you were gonna say is this a

1610
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,960
failure of individual self control or is this a failure of systemic capitalist hegemony well

1611
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,320
that's not what I'm saying so okay forget about that okay is this a problem of morals or self control

1612
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:01,760
because the okay let's say that I am morally opposed to blizzard's decision to to kato to china

1613
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:09,040
however because I god damn it because I lack self control I want to and I want to play the game

1614
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:14,480
I just keep playing it anyway or is it a problem of people legit don't give a fuck that they did

1615
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:19,040
that you know like is it because that would be the moral depends on the person but I think it's

1616
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,720
definitely both you know but like which one is the bigger problem that is an interesting

1617
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,280
definitely indifference because I every time I've seen people talk about the blizzard thing

1618
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:31,040
there's always someone responding what's the controversy what's going on yeah I'm gonna

1619
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:36,400
or who cares or this is a smokescreen for for other political ideas or some shit I suspect the

1620
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:42,560
jews are behind all of this it's really interesting if you look particularly at the reaction of the

1621
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:49,520
NBA because like what happened there was one guy uh one coach like came out in support of Hong Kong

1622
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:55,040
and then china like threatened the NBA basically like you have to fire this guy or else we're kicking

1623
01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:02,080
you out of the country and the NBA initially was going to you know they were they were just like uh

1624
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,080
you know trying to fucking get rid of this guy and sweep it out of the rug but then eventually

1625
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:11,520
they came around they they stood up for it and they got kicked out of china and like Lebron James

1626
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,160
got into a ton of hot water and got shit on all over twitter because of the fact that he accused

1627
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,920
that guy of like basically not thinking before he spoke and thinking about the effect it would

1628
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:25,040
have on the other people I mean he wasn't wrong he wasn't wrong but it was not very sympathetic to

1629
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:28,560
the plight of the Hong Kong people I mean the problem it's not about that it's about the free

1630
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:34,080
speech thing it's like in america our number one value is our freedom of speech if you tell somebody

1631
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:41,200
they're not allowed to you know speak anti-communist values then uh you know like it's like whoa this is

1632
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,760
like the most un-american decision you could possibly make would be like fire a guy for his opinion

1633
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,560
on another country because you want to keep your business there you know and there were other NBA

1634
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:55,200
people who came out and spoke for the other side who were like uh I think uh Shaq came out and said

1635
01:23:55,200 --> 01:24:00,960
exactly what I just said and so like I'm wondering how many like like I think we as americans we have

1636
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:07,360
to look at these companies and say it is not okay for you to diminish like the core american value

1637
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,160
of free speech in order to keep your market in china we will not support you if that's the route

1638
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:16,480
you're going to take well it comes down do you value do you value democracy or do you value

1639
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:21,200
capitalism I mean clearly they value capitalism because they're capitalistic banning because banning

1640
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:28,000
this speech serves capital and allowing it serves uh democracy and freedom I mean for you

1641
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:34,000
what is it uh my businesses can do what they want right so I'm curious what what if for example let's

1642
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:40,080
say you had a small podcast and let's say on that podcast just for example you had some people who

1643
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:45,040
started saying things that you don't like and they were perhaps even alienating your audience and you

1644
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:51,200
were losing customers so you made a business decision to remove that person uh is that censoring them

1645
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:55,920
because that seems a similar kind like is it just the degree I think it depends on your your

1646
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,520
justifications I mean in the case of blizzard or or the NBA you have to think of it this way it's

1647
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:07,040
not that it's not that the NBA was offended by what this guy said it's that they didn't want to lose

1648
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:12,320
their business in China and China is offended by what this guy said and so like it's one thing if

1649
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:18,800
you're if you're kicking somebody out because you're like okay let's say somebody said I'm trying not

1650
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:24,640
to say the hard R n word on the show because I know we'll lose monetization but that's nothing

1651
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:28,880
to do with moral quandary it's just this is me doing the same thing right now I'm literally doing

1652
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:34,160
what I'm complaining about um I want to keep the money for all of you because I know it will

1653
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:40,080
fuck all of you out of your money uh from the monetization if I say what I want to say but

1654
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:46,480
you know in this specific instance I'm willing to exert self-control so let's say I say nigger oh

1655
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:59,600
shit oh no I win him but if you one thing if you guys were like I don't like that that guy uses the

1656
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:05,680
hard R n word I'm kicking him out it's another thing if like but we love it we could not be more

1657
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:10,560
excited about it here on the broadcast let's say let's say that like uh there was a listener who's

1658
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:17,200
like uh $15 let's say he's a $40 patron right big roller patron and he's like I'm going to quit

1659
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:24,720
this patreon unless you kick off digi for saying the hard R n word then the question is not a matter

1660
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:30,960
of like what you guys value it's about do we value our money over his ability to say that he

1661
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:37,840
what if a quarter of our patrons were like I can't I won't support this unless you you know if you

1662
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,760
if you allow this we would have to come to a decision of like yeah we'd have to decide something

1663
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,000
do we care more about being able to say whatever we want or do we care more about making the money

1664
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,400
and like it'd be one thing if all of us came to a mutual like let's say that you talked to me

1665
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:55,680
and I agreed like okay I will stop saying the hard R n word because I too care about the money

1666
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:01,600
and make it good for everybody you know but like if I was like no fuck that I'm gonna say whatever

1667
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:07,120
I want then the question becomes like do we cut this guy because he's bad for the money you know

1668
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:11,440
and like we shouldn't we shouldn't give our audience ideas that they can unionize against us

1669
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:21,280
but Ben known anti-union organization yes yes the the thought that like that these companies

1670
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:26,080
are are doing like going against the values that they themselves would purport to have

1671
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:32,800
in order to you know sell more in in this foreign market like selling out the values

1672
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:38,160
and literally the people of their country in order to you know broaden their profit margins I just

1673
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:43,920
have to ask like are we as American people not going to do anything to stop that are we just

1674
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:50,480
gonna say this is fine I mean what I mean I mean Amazon shows that nobody cares right everyone hates

1675
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:56,800
Amazon nobody stops using Amazon Blizzard is an American based company right yes although they

1676
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:01,200
are partially owned by Tencent which is a Chinese company yeah okay why a lot of people think this

1677
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:06,400
happened in the first place yeah um fair enough I'm sure that has something to do with it uh I mean

1678
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:14,880
well what could we possibly do other than boycott them right and and people won't do it that's like

1679
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,760
like it but that's why the question I want to know is like is it that people won't boycott because

1680
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:25,360
they don't care or is it that they just can't bring themselves to like care enough to stop playing

1681
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:29,280
the game I'll tell you how I feel there's a huge difference between there's a huge difference between

1682
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:35,280
like I don't care what Blizzard does and this upsets me but I can't stop playing I think I'm

1683
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:41,120
gonna I'm gonna date definitely probably most people are just like that's some politics that

1684
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:45,440
doesn't affect me yeah I don't want I'm not gonna take a stand on that because I just the people

1685
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:49,920
the people who just legitimately want to experience the thing I think will probably just pirate it

1686
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:55,040
and call it a day and be like this is a fair enough I mean it's difficult to do that and I mean

1687
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,520
you can't pirate Blizzard games they're all online games yeah you have to be in those servers

1688
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:05,520
so mostly I mean you could go to a private service you can't really pirate world of warcraft yeah I

1689
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:10,080
think it'd be yeah I don't know if that's really I mean you you you could pirate and play only on

1690
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:15,440
private servers which you know like before vanilla wow was created that was what that existed there

1691
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:19,520
was a vanilla wow private server but you know there's always a risk of cease and desist you don't

1692
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,960
have all the same you're not going to get updates in real time you're not going to have it's also

1693
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:31,200
just not the same experience if you're mostly by yourself well I don't know I mean I think I think

1694
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,680
the vast majority of people don't care I think it's just like they'll be like that sucks I think

1695
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:40,080
they care for like in the moment like they hear it and they're like oh that they hear it and they're

1696
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:46,400
like oh no that's terrible but then they get here's a related question which do you think Matt okay to

1697
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:53,600
a to a mostly disengaged person who is like whether they care at all or not at all and maybe

1698
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,720
they're like eh but it's not that big a deal they're still gonna play blizzard games they like

1699
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:03,520
fucking was this overwatch was the game was this this was about what game was it was about

1700
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:08,240
hearthstone hearthstone yeah yeah like they like hearthstone whatever which do you think matters

1701
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:16,320
more to them that like they that blizzard did this thing but like blizzard like banned a guy

1702
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:22,400
over this or that like um wait fuck what was the alternative I guess my question is do you think

1703
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:27,520
people are people bothered about that like like not so much about the political issue but about

1704
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:33,680
this player getting fucking axed because I think it's a mix they definitely care more about the uh

1705
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:40,000
the banning because like they're into the yeah the narrative of competitive play that seems like

1706
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,760
even if you don't care all about Hong Kong it's that seems just like a really bad optics at the end

1707
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:52,480
of the day it's just in the in the dopamine addled thrill seeking mind of the kumer kumer is gonna

1708
01:30:52,480 --> 01:31:09,440
coom at the end of the day there's no getting in between them you can't I can't support I can't

1709
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:15,600
support no not november because unlike other forms of entertainment there is ethical nutting under

1710
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:20,480
capitalism and therefore it should be encouraged every month of the year but yeah like what got

1711
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:26,480
me thinking about all this is just like I in a very general way hate disney like as a corporation

1712
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:33,360
I hate their their slow overreach of fucking taken over all media and just putting it all into one

1713
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:40,880
goddamn thing and so I like this cartoon that you linked I'm like I like I look at this cartoon and

1714
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:47,040
I think man the people who made this cartoon are clearly like pouring a lot of heart and soul and

1715
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:54,640
talent into it I think these are like talented passionate only it could have been not disney

1716
01:31:54,640 --> 01:32:00,560
yes I'm not I know that disney made this possible and granted I don't have to feel that bad about

1717
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,480
stealing this because it's not like the people who made this are going to profit off of me watching

1718
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:10,320
it on youtube disney would profit off of that so it's kind of like it's it's nice that disney

1719
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:15,520
caused this thing to exist but I don't want to give them money for that because that's

1720
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,840
ultimately what all these companies want to do is like the reason they make these more experimental

1721
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:24,000
more art house things like the reason they're willing to bankroll that stuff is because they'll

1722
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,320
give it a small budget and they'll recoup that small budget with very minimal advertising and it

1723
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:36,400
satisfies people who would reject the mainstream stuff of disney and like it's so it's an insidious

1724
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:41,680
way to get people onto your side to be like oh well I may hate disney but at least they did this

1725
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:46,000
you know same with like ubisoft like bankrolling all these you know little indie games and it's

1726
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,480
like oh ubisoft may suck but they funded this little indie studio to do this thing and we

1727
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:55,520
wouldn't have got that without them and it's like yeah but that doesn't mean that the system isn't

1728
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:02,160
broken like just because they did that doesn't mean that it should be that we need them to do that

1729
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:07,120
you know we we got to create an alternative way of getting these things made so that we

1730
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:12,880
don't have to rely on these corporations to do it some animation studio somewhere had a choice

1731
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:17,120
and their choice was they could do something else they could they could make what they wanted to

1732
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:22,400
make for some money or they could work they could do something else for however much money or they

1733
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:28,480
could do they could animate this they could animate mickey mouse for probably like 10 times as much

1734
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:34,640
money and i'm sure that like it's um fine like i'm sure to a lot of people it doesn't matter

1735
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:38,480
what they're making like a lot of them probably just like to draw an anime just for the sheer joy

1736
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:46,160
of the craft which is fine and i and i don't have any disrespect for that um but yeah like did disney

1737
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:52,880
did disney did come in and with the power of its of its um of all its resources it did scoop up these

1738
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:57,520
people who would have been making something else probably and gave them a bunch of money and now

1739
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:03,120
we have this instead but like whatever else would have been i mean how do you know that they would

1740
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:08,000
have made something that was better well you don't you don't you don't know they would have made

1741
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,320
something that was better but they would have made something that wasn't disney that wasn't owned by

1742
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:18,800
disney we don't know like this this animation studio how much of them have like how much they

1743
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,920
have gained in personnel based on this like maybe they got a really good writer or like really good

1744
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:29,360
storyboard guy from disney to work with them to make this like it could have been a boon for them

1745
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:33,200
i was it could have been a boon for them and maybe because they got more funding because

1746
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,920
they chose to do this they were able to hire more people and like they got a bigger team

1747
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:43,920
and more people were a are are now able to work in this field because a bunch of jobs were created

1748
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:52,400
by this faustian bargain struck by their ceo's or whatever um and um let's talk about this best

1749
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:58,640
guy ever pcb bingo that nature's posted it's funny you know digi let's do that uh but we

1750
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:04,000
gotta move on to the voicemails uh all right let's just cut it off that's one of the things on

1751
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:10,960
the thing that's one of the things on the bingo oh my god there you go aside from free space and

1752
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:17,360
word which i think is hilarious uh my absolute favorite is no my favorite is i don't know i'm

1753
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:24,560
not an expert you do say i can hear your voice saying it as i read it it was magical yeah it's

1754
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:30,880
it's a good one uh although this one of shitting on my dog i defend yeah why are mostly i don't

1755
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,000
know you're you're not you're not like the guy who brings up rfc like you you do bring it up

1756
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,840
sometimes slime corp every day i feel like they were a little bit strained veil when he was making

1757
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,280
this was a little bit reaching for some of them i think like that one i think that should have been

1758
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:48,400
replaced with like slime corp but in the minecraft server i think that's where that's coming from

1759
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:53,120
which way you can find on patreon.com slash pcb minecraft join five dollars a month for all

1760
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:58,640
the minecraft one of these squares should be no like six of these squares should be like really

1761
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:04,640
excitedly explaining something you just learned about like the bare minimum like 101 level

1762
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:11,280
foundations or something like minecraft or the stock market or something yeah yeah sure sure i

1763
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:16,960
feel like i haven't even done that that much uh but nonetheless you did it on the i did it last

1764
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:21,600
time or whatever it was two times ago whatever no was it was it munchy munchy complained to me like

1765
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,880
i can't believe nate is explaining he's like he looks like he's just learned what a stock is

1766
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,160
he was like well i never owned one i never looked into it i don't know sure sure i mean i know what

1767
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:37,760
i don't take stock and such things per se you know what i will say this i didn't fully grasp

1768
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:42,400
see that this was my misunderstanding i assumed that the way it worked was like if let's say

1769
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:49,680
own a stock in like apple or whatever oh okay great like apple did really really well so my stock

1770
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:55,680
in apple went up okay great but like i assumed it was like isolated to that one business i wasn't

1771
01:36:55,680 --> 01:37:01,520
aware of this amorphous the whole market grows that's how we all hope to get ahead as like an

1772
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:08,800
amorphous blob of businesses that are all part of the trading thing i guess the you mean the market

1773
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:13,760
the market or the like a mutual fund whatever we talked about this last time no i'm just saying

1774
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,800
that's what i like is is the farmer's market in the small villages where you see all the weird

1775
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:23,280
kooky things and then sometimes they have video games and i see ah that's a good video game but

1776
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:30,000
it's really cheap yeah fresh fresh grown fresh grown from from the farm well i say farm market

1777
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:36,080
i was i was making i was making like a i meant like not a flea market like a village market like

1778
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:40,960
it's just a bunch of stalls of people usually there's a lot of farming like a bizarre uh like

1779
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:48,320
like a like a community yard sale uh you know just a fucking shop you know one of those fucking

1780
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,680
just a hole in the ground where people can throw their crap and you can come get some and toss some

1781
01:37:53,680 --> 01:38:00,160
money in oh that reminds me that reminds me uh i'm gonna start no shit november where i'm not gonna

1782
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:09,520
that should be no shit september you missed it by a month everything happens on november this is

1783
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:16,320
the new rule okay listen how okay well after no shit after no shit november i fasted for a week

1784
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:22,480
so maybe i'll do no food december or no food february go for a whole month this february i'm sure

1785
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:27,360
people have gone you know i definitely got a month without eating before yeah ben that does seem like

1786
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:31,920
an interesting idea to like fund a community though to like have everybody just leave like

1787
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:37,840
whatever they don't want just like put it in this shop i guess it's basically like a like a pawn shop

1788
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:43,760
but where the money all just goes to the community itself just like everybody just resell all your

1789
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:48,400
shit that you don't want and this one big thing like all the money just gets piled up and then like

1790
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:52,480
spent on a public works project or something maybe that's already a thing that exists i feel like

1791
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:59,520
i'm just describing reality now there there is a there is a cool thing in my town there is a community

1792
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:05,360
garden and what you can do is you can pay like some small amount of money to rent out a little

1793
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:12,160
like plot of like soil in this fenced off area and you can just go there and like that's your soil

1794
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:16,240
you can just plant whatever you want in it and like come back and you know 10

1795
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:22,240
about that dank kush my dude probably not we i think it's it's legal and well is it legal to

1796
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,920
grow like i don't know whatever it might be maybe not to grow yeah i think it's legal to grow you

1797
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,160
just can't sell you should yeah there's like there's a little community garden where people can

1798
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:34,400
rent out little plots and they just grow a little they probably just grow like herbs or whatever

1799
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:40,800
just grow a little like vegetables you should grow like well there's all weed you should grow

1800
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:46,160
one of those like super deadly poison plants that if you touch them you die within five minutes

1801
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:52,560
or one of those hentai rape like venus fly trap that's not real sexy i was talking about a real

1802
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:57,280
thing oh that's real in my mind is there a plant that's like so deadly that it'll like kill you in

1803
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:01,600
five minutes if you touch it uh yeah i was i have a feeling it doesn't grow around here

1804
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:08,080
well just get the seeds uh tar oh shit that's right that's what you need system have it

1805
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:14,960
yeah that's a good idea i can use their seeds to get the girl he needs i i saw a tom scott video

1806
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:20,800
that murder he needs i think it was a tom scott video and he went through a poison garden which

1807
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,680
had like all of the deadliest plants of all time uh and don't touch them because some of them will

1808
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:32,080
kill you just instantly it was really cool that's pretty funny what how did that man achieve this

1809
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:38,400
position of getting to do cool shit like that uh basically he he did it a few things and then

1810
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:45,440
people come to him to say please come to talk to us for advertising kind of did you guys see his uh

1811
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:53,280
his vpn video i did i did see that one which is very interesting red shirt man british red shirt

1812
01:40:53,280 --> 01:41:00,560
man describes things yeah red shirt man describes things i know exactly who you're talking about

1813
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:08,880
on iran yeah that vpn video well we're going to be examining one of the the oldest known things

1814
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:16,720
to mankind like he always says ice ice ice has been with us what is ice really i don't know

1815
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,520
uh but yo that that vpn video was enlightening because he basically told me what i already knew

1816
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,000
like why do i have a vpn wait a minute it's for torrenting shit that's why i have it and he's like

1817
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
that is one of the main reasons you would want that video was enlightening because he basically

1818
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,000
told me what i already knew well no it's he he reaffirmed what i long suspected that the only

1819
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:44,080
real reason to have a vpn is like if you're literally just trying to do things and not be seen

1820
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:48,720
by people like all this shit yeah you hear the shill say that's what but beth of course that's

1821
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:54,240
what they're for the contrast here ben is with what the advertisers say yeah when they're doing a

1822
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:58,800
pitch nate's doing a bad idea of explaining this but basically i'm doing a bad job of explaining

1823
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:05,680
it i have a great idea of playing it vpn's uh they like everything that they claim in the ad

1824
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:10,800
that they do that they protect you from he like denounces a lot of it he's like dubious at best

1825
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,880
like they they they claim that like you know all your passwords and stuff will be like unprotected

1826
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,640
if you're on public wi-fi or something and he's like that's just patently false like

1827
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:27,440
like you know and he works in that like he works on developing like cyber security

1828
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:32,080
like that's his background so he's like believe me as a security guy i know these vpn's are not

1829
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:38,160
saving you at all like unless you are just torrenting massive amounts of shit like that's the only

1830
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:43,920
kind of use that like the regular person would have for this thing vpn ads illegal activity

1831
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:48,000
vpn ads are like the equivalent of like smoke shops they say they're for tobacco but you know why

1832
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:53,440
they're really i mean that's what i would absolutely take a vpn sponsorship because i

1833
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:59,360
fucking use this shit all damn day every day and i totally endorse uh fuck the man go off the grid

1834
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:05,120
man do whatever it was funny how like by saying the truth he didn't get the sponsorship deal with

1835
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:10,160
the vpn company because they just didn't want to be associated with the truth the truth yeah well

1836
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:16,000
there's a pitch to everything you know there's um speaking of speaking of smoke shops can we talk

1837
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,200
have i talked about the vape ban on massachusetts oh no we talked about it after the show because

1838
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:27,040
we forgot to mention it like two or three weeks ago yeah okay so i live in hell and the way that i

1839
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:33,680
know that is because like at like the end of sometime last month the fucking governor of

1840
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:42,400
massachusetts in response to some bullshit declared like all these the display and sale of all vaping

1841
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:48,000
and e-cigarette related products banned in massachusetts it's not illegal to have them or to use them

1842
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,520
only to display them and sell them so my twitter banner that says vaping is not a crime is still

1843
01:43:53,520 --> 01:44:01,120
technically accurate um but um i think the most amazing thing about this like decision is that it

1844
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:07,280
is like it is obviously patently retarded but it is like the problem with the vaping thing in the

1845
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:12,960
first place and the reason why they even like wanted it banned is because there are black market

1846
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:20,160
uh uh thc carts that use a certain ingredient that caused lung damage it is all it is all in

1847
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:26,640
response to that you have it is only the thc kind so not the kind i use of vaping but it's all

1848
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:32,720
banned anyway to go use gray market alternatives and increase the problems you've done nothing

1849
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:40,160
but make the problem worse yeah and like damage literally good job i have to go i found i found uh

1850
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:46,240
i found like shut down like possibly the most burgeoning business right exactly five years like

1851
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:51,360
the mouth of vape shops that have sprung up everywhere in the country in the last half decade

1852
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:56,160
is like astonishing and now they're all going to be and and like there's like some sort of lip

1853
01:44:56,160 --> 01:45:01,200
service like okay like people are bringing like business owners are bringing suit against the

1854
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:06,800
state of messachusetts for this and like i hope they win but like the law like like the emergency

1855
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:13,600
like declaration or whatever says like emergency this like yeah cuz like 30 people contracted cases of

1856
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:18,880
this um this like mysterious lung disease hey man you gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet

1857
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:25,600
that's what i'm saying man that's what i'm saying um but uh um it doesn't like it does it says that

1858
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:31,760
like the ban like will be like reviewed again in a couple months so like there's no there's no hard

1859
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:36,480
deadline of like this is a temporary ban it will end on such it's like this is gonna last for four

1860
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:41,520
months and then maybe we'll lift it four months from now and i think big tobacco is probably just

1861
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:45,600
gonna lobby for it to stick around so we're just of course i just i just think this i just think

1862
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:50,960
this um this great and valuable product for society okay it's probably it's probably just so

1863
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:57,440
when are you gonna move down to the libertarian south where i hate the south digi i hate the south

1864
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:02,720
i it's bad about the south it's bad and i don't like what's wrong with it i don't like your accent

1865
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:08,240
and i don't like you that's exactly the same um okay cigarettes are really cheap though it's pretty

1866
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:16,640
cool um but i did find i did find a one store you know with an indian guy with a really thick

1867
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:21,600
accent i can barely understand him but if i ask him for jewel pods he'll take some out from under

1868
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:26,640
from under a secret a secret place behind the counter and he'll sell me some and i went back

1869
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:31,680
one day and i was like hey you got any jewel pods and he's like uh and i'm like uh mint and he's

1870
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:39,200
like oh yeah yeah he brings out some grape and i'm like yeah cool i'll take it and i went back

1871
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:42,880
and i was like hey you got any more of those jewel pods he's like yeah he gave me some

1872
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:46,720
rings me up cool they're cheaper now because they don't have to tax them because he's selling me

1873
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:51,440
under the table now they're costing did you a favor they cost way they cost he could be gouging me

1874
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:55,760
he's not yeah yeah so i go back the other day listen i was drunk for like two days straight

1875
01:46:55,760 --> 01:47:01,200
before halloween so i don't really remember most of this journey but i went on a big circuitous route

1876
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:04,960
because i had to pop off to one liquor store to buy a certain thing i was looking for and then i

1877
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:10,000
want to stop at this place and i must have been hammered or something i must have made a huge

1878
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,200
fool of myself but i guess i must have gone in there because i came back with like 12 boxes of

1879
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:21,040
these of these jewel pods in my backpack and i'm like cool that's that sorted out for a month or

1880
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:27,440
so um and that's my vape story and you know what i heard that you had a supplier going out of state

1881
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:32,640
to uh to acquire them for you you know crack crack did make one trip to across the border to new

1882
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:38,880
hampshire crack cocaine reminds me that i had i had a subscription for like cbd vape cartridges

1883
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:43,680
and the next second one never came in so i guess that's why they just can't ship it to me oh yeah

1884
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:49,120
yeah okay i thought that maybe jewel.com would still like ship and like they would be slow to

1885
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:54,480
respond to this ban no the very day that the ban went into effect they immediately cancelled like

1886
01:47:54,480 --> 01:48:00,480
my next order my next it's illegal now i guess so meanwhile but here's the thing if they had sent

1887
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:05,120
if they had sent it the day before it would have been fine because it's still it still could have

1888
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:09,440
come through the mail and that would not have been illegal but selling it to me online think about

1889
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,760
the fact that there is there's a website i could that we could all go to right now where you could

1890
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:23,280
buy a sheet of 50 acid tablets legally and not jewels like there's you can buy what are considered

1891
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:34,160
uh research chemicals um which are just legal versions of hard drugs uh namely acid that are

1892
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:39,840
very easy are they expensive as fuck um not really actually it's quite cheap but you have to buy

1893
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,160
them in like gigantic sheets like you get a sheet of like 50 tabs for a hundred dollars or something

1894
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:53,520
like that that'll be a stretch goal for radcon four is when uh when i'm looking at when i'm looking

1895
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,840
to propose to the little lady one day i'll make sure i have a tab or two i would love to just set

1896
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:02,720
up a camera in a room where all of us are doing acid and just see what happens right that's that

1897
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:07,920
that's a different that's an acid bro packed no that's that's degeneracy uh you know when i when

1898
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:12,000
i got to digi's house did you was like would that be illegal would we be allowed to post that

1899
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:20,400
um we bought it legally and what are they gonna say you did acid like it's not illegal to do

1900
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:26,080
acid it might be illegal to do acid also it again this is a legal it's illegal to do certain

1901
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:32,800
drugs online uh we're talking about the research chemicals it's legal it's legal to to buy it's

1902
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,360
legal to do but it's not legal to have so if we have it for like one second well yeah we have to

1903
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:41,680
we have we have we have to buy it from the distributor it has they have to place it directly

1904
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:46,240
into our mouths i mean for for what it's worth technically these these reason like the reason

1905
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:50,560
that they can sell them is that you're supposed to be buying them as research chemicals like

1906
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:56,480
not to use but to to do other things i feel like there might be terms of service that say like no

1907
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:02,880
using drugs what if it falls into my mouth accidentally it's not my fault like like snoop

1908
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:08,800
dog has a talk show on youtube where they just smoke blunts and the whole show like it's definitely

1909
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:14,000
allowed to like do drugs those are blunts though i don't know snoop dog he has he has money coming

1910
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:20,080
and he's got those views so i'm sure well i know that um uh nearly senior citizen yet a gamer my

1911
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:29,200
favorite dwarf fortress streamer on youtube is uh he smokes medical marijuana on uh on on on

1912
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:36,480
it's it's medical yeah he's a disabled veteran you know okay so he's got the hookup we we have

1913
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:42,560
not established if weed is the same as acid in this capacity but fair enough some drugs i mean how

1914
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:47,600
would they even like we would probably do the acid before we started filming so there'd be no evidence

1915
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:51,760
of us doing it we could just claim we were acting i mean that yeah that might be that might work even

1916
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:56,400
if it is anybody in the future is listening it was a joke we're not actually talking about doing this

1917
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:01,440
wing and obviously both of preamble about how guys we're going to do a little performance art piece

1918
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:07,040
called what if we all took ass i mean obviously we should do pcp if we're going to do a hard

1919
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:16,720
pcp pcp scares me a lot more than that's almost worth it for the meme though it would be a good

1920
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:22,800
way to end the podcast permanently when we're all about this i i think pcp might be addictive though

1921
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:31,680
so oh it's fine you guys are well i'll take all of your doses for you i will remain pure i mean

1922
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:35,360
when i went to digi's house did you was like net you really gonna spend your whole time here without

1923
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:41,200
smoking any dank weed with me and i remained pure you didn't smoke even a single bud of the devil's

1924
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:44,560
that's pretty lame that's pretty gay though for what it's worth you were in a

1925
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:49,440
fucking room full of smoke so i'm sure you were definitely hot boxing but you know i didn't

1926
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:59,680
feel much what an absolute dorkus malorkas yeah well that's true you did consume plenty of alcohol

1927
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:04,880
though so it's not until you were straight edge i mean i never got even close to drunk but i did

1928
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:10,240
in fact consume alcohol did i mention that i was like straight up like intoxicated like full on

1929
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:14,800
hammered for like two whole days leading up to hell you mentioned it but i am you are full on

1930
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:21,360
hammock right now no i find i find i have some leftover alcohol in my room and the very side

1931
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:28,320
of it disgusts me was that the then was that the longest you've ever been drunk for no god no

1932
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:37,760
senior year of college i was fucking i was tipsy 24 7 damn for a for a i mean for a period there

1933
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:46,000
okay all right well you say that you were an alcoholic no well that no because i was still

1934
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,400
pretty functional i wasn't like fit i wasn't like flunking my classes or anything how do you

1935
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:56,720
define an alcoholic exactly just depended on every day or addicted to alcohol right it's it's um

1936
01:52:56,720 --> 01:53:03,680
yeah well like like any like any um debilit or debility or what's the phrase um you know it's

1937
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:08,400
based on how much it impairs your function so like oh okay i'm trying to not have it or whatever

1938
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:13,760
so it might be not a weed addict if i can survive while being high all the time maybe someone would

1939
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:21,920
contest this but i'm pretty sure that if alcohol does not impair if if a if a substance use a habit

1940
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:26,560
does not impair your ability to function or your like happiness or satisfaction or whatever metric

1941
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:31,840
you want to use then it's not technically an abuse problem that can't be i mean if you're smoking

1942
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:36,640
like nobody who smokes is like having their life fucked up by if you're if you're drinking

1943
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:41,680
if you're drinking a lot and it's like not causing you any problems what's the point in calling you

1944
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:46,080
an alcoholic because you're dependent upon a substance well you're still damaging your body

1945
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:51,760
like you are doing yeah i mean isn't the issue being dependent to function yeah addiction is just

1946
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:58,080
i mean like most of us are caffeine addicts you know and like it's not a problem but we are addicted

1947
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:03,360
you know i mean it becomes a problem if you don't have it which is just as bad see this is the

1948
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:08,960
weird thing i don't feel like an addict i don't feel like i need it but i do consume it regularly

1949
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:14,320
well i don't know that you need it until you don't have it and then you feel right i mean i feel like

1950
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:20,000
a day without caffeine would suck i mean that's that's how i would describe addiction is if when

1951
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:26,080
you don't have it anymore you feel worse like you feel like shit that's like like when i've been

1952
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:31,760
you know i've been like on and off full-blown addicted to weed in recent times and i'm saying

1953
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:38,240
the word addicted because uh just recently i think they changed the definition of addiction to include

1954
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:45,120
this stuff because like for instance uh like in the dsm i'm not sure but like okay like well

1955
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:50,480
game addiction did recently enter the dsm and like it was considered a compulsion for a long time

1956
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:55,360
because it was seen that uh something being an addiction meant it had to have like a chemical

1957
01:54:55,360 --> 01:55:00,800
influence over you like you it was forcing you to be addicted by the chemicals that are in the

1958
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:06,080
substance now they seem to be changing that because i mean what you're addicted to is whatever chemical

1959
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:13,680
is being released by your brain from partaking yeah so um but like for me like smoking weed i was

1960
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:18,640
just doing it so much that when i would stop i could not eat you know like and that's how i

1961
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:22,880
that's when i consider that an addiction it's like you know that seems like a clear case to me

1962
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:28,240
yeah yeah i mean granted it's only for a couple days but like you know it's a few days of being

1963
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:33,200
like oh i'm miserable i can't eat like i can't bring myself to eat this food that i have you know

1964
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:39,200
the reason why i was drunk for two days is because i went out to a liquor store looking for the

1965
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:46,000
specific ingredients to make my signature beverage the dragon raider and um what's in that uh well

1966
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:51,120
the original i got it from a thai restaurant in new york and the original recipe was a combination

1967
01:55:51,120 --> 01:56:01,840
of midori melon liqueur uh bakardi grand melon rum uh lime juice and a pulped kiwi fruit

1968
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:06,800
sounds good it's it's very fruity and it's very it tastes like a jolly rancher and it's very strong

1969
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:12,640
it gets you fucked up and um sick but they but they don't make they don't make bakardi grand

1970
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:17,360
melon anymore they've like changed the flavors that they offer from bakardi so now i had to i

1971
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:22,480
ended up having to settle for a dragon berry which i think is a dragon fruit strawberry blend it was

1972
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:28,000
fine um but so i went i asked them uh like well can you get it for me they were like we can try and

1973
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,080
order the grand melon for you and i was like all right fine in the meantime i guess i'll just get

1974
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:38,160
some sea ice my signature vodka brand sea ice 999 a handle can't afford not to drink it so of

1975
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:42,720
course that's what i immediately started doing so i just spent the next so i just spent the next

1976
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:47,200
two days just kind of casually working my way through this handle of sea ice because i thought

1977
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:54,320
it would be fun and it was there and that's my story classic tale it's a classic tale reminds me

1978
01:56:54,320 --> 01:57:00,880
of that time i just decided to just drink drunken halloween yeah on your stream right no i did

1979
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:06,960
that's the days before that wasn't i did get really drunk on twitch.tv slash saint comics that

1980
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:12,160
one time and then i fucking and then i this is i this is embarrassing i'll talk about it because

1981
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:18,880
when else am i gonna talk about it yeah i just i i got super hammered on stream uh set a bunch of

1982
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:25,760
shit about chris chan uh-huh that should have completely turned chris off to me forever people

1983
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:32,320
clipped it showed it to chris chris listened to it and then responded to me like hey ben i listened

1984
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:37,520
to your commentary here's my here's what i think about all this every don't worry about it we're

1985
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:44,720
all we're friends i'm like nice it all works it all works out um and then i and then i ended i was

1986
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:50,720
hammered i ended the stream and then somehow i started the stream again and it's fucking embarrassing

1987
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:54,640
because i like stand up and i fucking like take my shirt off and stuff and i'm like getting ready

1988
01:57:54,640 --> 01:58:00,080
for bed i'm glad my fucking dick didn't come out or anything because it's a bannable fence

1989
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:04,880
almost like full dsp there but but then i just i take my shirt off i turn the lights off i presumably

1990
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:11,120
get into bed and then what follows is five hours of pitch blackness and five hours of ripping fat

1991
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:17,040
farts constantly while sleeping shaking the room most most likely i got i got several messages

1992
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:24,240
how much money from people did you get nate call ben help him help him help him assist him nate

1993
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:29,520
what did you do i think at least one person donated like a like a hundred bits it was just

1994
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:36,960
while i was asleep so it was worth it i'm asking you boys why not stream while we sleep why not

1995
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:40,400
get the viewers why ever why answers been in front of us all the whole time make money while

1996
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:44,400
you're sleeping of course we just had to do it literally why ever end the stream that's what i'm

1997
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:49,600
saying i mean what there's there's a video where uh where mr beast gave a guy who was sleeping on

1998
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:54,400
stream like 10 grand just to see what he would react when he woke up so that's all need to sleep on

1999
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:58,880
stream all the time when the off chance is anyone else sick of mr beast shit i get it you've got

2000
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:04,400
lots of money you like to give it away i'm bored now are you bore me unless you give me the money

2001
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:10,080
that i'm no longer bored i'm invested in the narrative now by my by my engagement coward

2002
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:16,800
um but uh wait there was oh no okay i did get really drunk on that stream but then on halloween

2003
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:22,560
i got fucking wasted and i puked but i don't think i puked because of the alcohol i think i puked

2004
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:27,840
because i ate too much halloween candy and i puked i puked all over the bathroom and it tasted

2005
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:33,360
like chocolate coming up uh on the second pass i just went to mr beast's channel and i know things

2006
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:37,920
are only gonna get worse because his latest video is i spent a hundred thousand dollars on lottery

2007
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:44,000
tickets and won now he's got even more money he might have won like you can always win like a

2008
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:48,880
five dollars did he ever get did he win more than he more than a hundred thousand dollars and find out

2009
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:54,320
that's the question that would be that would be astounding that would be always tell us the

2010
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:58,640
odds are bad but what if the odds are actually really good when you play the lottery that's

2011
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,400
hmm you know you can't prove they're not

2012
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:12,080
okay it's not it doesn't seem as though

2013
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:17,840
he's like the whole thing is him like doing scratches and calculating like how much has

2014
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:23,440
he won versus how much has he spent on the yeah okay that's why i'd be curious there's no way he'd

2015
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:30,160
win more than he spends that would be truly shocking and i and anyway planted 20 million trees

2016
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:34,560
apparently well he's he's trying to that's the i i don't know whether you know about that i

2017
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:40,320
assumed everybody i don't know anything i didn't watch mr beast i'll i'll explain just uh just so

2018
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:46,720
that i can show that i care about the trees uh huh um mr yeah dude that's what i'm saying climate

2019
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:52,320
change we gotta talk about climate change it's not no good mr beast uh did one of his like wouldn't

2020
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:58,560
this be a really good click bait and everyone around him was like yeah that would and uh to the

2021
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:06,720
challenge to plant 20 million trees by the end of the year and there's like this uh this uh

2022
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:13,680
foundation this tree planting thing uh i forget the name of it but he's partnered with them to

2023
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:20,240
actually do this and he made a video where he like got a bunch of people around for like a number of

2024
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:26,960
days planted like a few thousand trees in a huge field and you know that's just youtube vlogger like

2025
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:32,160
jokes and and all that after that do that a couple thousand times yeah i mean even even looking into

2026
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:36,320
this has taught me about a functionality i did not know youtube had yeah it's a very new i think

2027
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:41,600
it's a it's a brand new functionality for this um it's a thing under a certain number of like

2028
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:48,240
there's smarter every day there's mr beast uh captain disillusion was also doing this uh

2029
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:55,440
they have a special little button uh which directly funds this thing of like you give a

2030
02:01:55,440 --> 02:02:02,480
dollar you you get a tree planted i've pledged money to it haha i'm so cool i'm so smart and

2031
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:08,880
better than everyone else um and the idea is the idea is on a massive scale one dollar does

2032
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:14,480
plant a tree and they're going to actually do it if uh i assume they're gonna plant as many

2033
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:18,640
you know trees as they get dollars and hopefully they'll get 20 million

2034
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:23,920
by the end of the year why why spend money planting trees when you could spend that money

2035
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:30,560
on andrew yang shirts the the profits of which will go directly to bernie's campaign when you buy

2036
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:38,240
them for my teespring right no no no the trees were made the t-shirts were made from trees that's

2037
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:46,320
why the t-shirt for every tree you plant i will tear down five of them to produce a t-shirt a cotton

2038
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:52,960
v-neck um actually that's pretty cool and uh considering the climate change is terrifying and

2039
02:02:52,960 --> 02:03:01,040
i will probably be displaced within my lifetime um yikes possible i mean i'm on the coastal city

2040
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:09,280
so you know that close to the ocean though you're like inland not boston is like on the

2041
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:13,760
it's a port i don't think boston is gonna get fully swallowed in your lifetime by water

2042
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:20,160
i don't know unless things get like accelerate somehow i mean things are gonna accelerate

2043
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:24,640
they okay i you know i'm curious i actually don't know the extent of like how much the water levels

2044
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:30,560
are predicted to rise if like things don't change their trajectory or whatever they say they say

2045
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:36,240
that like climate change and like rising water levels are now irrevert they are they are irreversible

2046
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:42,160
they will happen but hey that's that's business baby but we but we can still like if we reduce

2047
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:48,400
emissions if we start reducing emissions in the next like decade we can like reduce we can significantly

2048
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:55,760
reduce the amount to which they will occur yeah it's not it's not gonna happen because i am praying

2049
02:03:56,160 --> 02:04:02,640
well we could do we could we could do something maybe the 20 million we could reduce emissions

2050
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:08,720
perhaps the 20 million trees thing is is like the opposite of reducing emissions because people

2051
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:14,080
just don't like the idea of reducing their emissions they don't want to be like like judged for using

2052
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:19,360
an airplane they don't want to be told to like do all of this bullshit busy work at home i'm just

2053
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:25,040
gonna say this i'm just gonna say this it is not it is not i i totally reject i fully reject the

2054
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:32,880
idea that like we the people ought to do anything to like oh don't waste don't waste water turn the

2055
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:39,760
lights off when you like agree like no it is like we must fucking legislate our fucking corporations

2056
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:46,800
it doesn't allow them to do this then the problem is that even if we do that it's only we will do it

2057
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:52,240
like yes i know i know it's china has to do it too and all the other superpowers yes here the two

2058
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:57,280
big ones right now yeah so like in in terms of the grand scheme of like how difficult this is to do

2059
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:02,800
planting a bunch of trees that will slowly but surely eat up some of that carbon dioxide is it's

2060
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:08,080
something you know yeah and 20 million is not insignificant i'm glad i'm saying if we just put

2061
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:13,200
a tree in the back of every car it would offset it then we'd never i mean if you know what and help

2062
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:18,480
it grow then yes where do i give a fucking tree where do i give a fucking tree i guess on mr beast

2063
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:26,080
yeah go to mr beast channel i will get the link and post it as well please mr beast flexing with

2064
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:30,480
all his money but he doesn't fund 20 million trees what a coward all right well i don't want us to sit

2065
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:36,480
here and promote other people's content yeah no the money needs to be ours please i got the thing

2066
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:41,520
it's teamtrees.org i'll post the link you don't need to go through a youtuber to do it it's just a

2067
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:46,720
button youtube is implemented in order to make it easier for people who don't want to click links

2068
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:52,720
i said that even though i spent 20 minutes promoting steve 1989 mre so i guess i'm completely wrong

2069
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:57,040
yeah that i don't want to support when i when i see mr beast and his unbelievable success i just

2070
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:02,560
sit back and cross my arms and scowl and say fuck that guy we don't hate youtubers we hate we hate

2071
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:08,640
new tubers this new kind of internet celebrity that does mediocre content i have no problem with

2072
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:13,680
mr beast's videos are actually great like why does this guy have so much money i feel like we've

2073
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:18,960
talked about him before he's because he's just sort of like a youtuber who uses his youtube money

2074
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:24,160
to make the videos that are like whoa he's got so much money and then it just perpetuates itself

2075
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:29,280
he does do impressive things i mean he the way he started was just doing like crazy weird stunts

2076
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:34,000
like i'm gonna read an entire dictionary or like i'm gonna livestream myself counting to a million

2077
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:39,840
and like just he was that guy which he did yeah i've never seen a mr beast video so i know nothing

2078
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:44,480
about him all i know is that the philanthropy is uh tainted in my mind because his name is

2079
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:52,240
mr beast and it makes me feel like he's a smug he's a hot beast boys oh he clearly isn't mr beast

2080
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:59,440
tongue he's fine i wish him well he's doing just anyway the pcp endorses team trees dot org

2081
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:05,120
i don't endorse anything i'm i'm gonna donate five trees right now with the custom tree message

2082
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:11,360
hashtag feel the burn yeah you really want to put that on a tree that seems to burn spreading

2083
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:19,280
between all the trees in california not literally don't let's hey hey guys let's be burn let's bern

2084
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:27,360
down the house over here in this man-made tree enclave am i right fellows okay he's right and with

2085
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:32,800
that also about how about voicemails yeah just just want a little snippet okay okay um if you want

2086
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:38,560
to know a bit more about the science of of how to do like tree planting of on such a scale

2087
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:45,760
smarter every day did a video on t the tree thing and he he goes into like how do you do that like

2088
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:51,520
how do you do that and it's how do you plant 20 million trees don't like like there are ways all

2089
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:58,160
day no because there's ways to do it wrong that's the reason this uh charity thing is all like set up

2090
02:07:58,160 --> 02:08:02,240
so that the people who are actually going to plant the trees know what they're doing to make

2091
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:08,000
sure that the trees live to be long to to grow tall and all that well this is all well and good

2092
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:13,600
why plant trees when you can smoke trees if you know what i'm saying might you tell you because

2093
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:17,200
like if you plant them too close together they'll like choke each other out and starve each other

2094
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:24,080
for a space yeah stuff like that smoke each other there it is all right there you go let's do the

2095
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:31,680
fucking voicemail singular this week wait really got one because all the others god well okay honestly

2096
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:38,880
let me just give a little so so our voicemail god this motherfucker left like 10 voicemails

2097
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:44,400
but in his defense in his defense so he one of his last ones was like guys am i living too many

2098
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:50,640
voicemails that's a weak defense yes leaving too many voicemails uh at least he's aware of the problem

2099
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:55,200
and we can now diagnose it and cut out the cancer you're leaving too many voicemails and some of

2100
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:59,360
yours i may have been tempted to play but there was just too many and i got annoyed and i didn't

2101
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:05,840
want to play them on the show uh so here's your fickle god you know at work so like just just two

2102
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:10,960
or three guys next time you next time you want to make a voicemail don't go over that if it's

2103
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:18,080
still funny in the morning by all means okay because that's the problem it's quality over quantity

2104
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:22,000
and not the quantity which we said last time which we said we're dealing with the follow-up

2105
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:27,440
i mean we keep saying that but you keep choosing shit ones is that why i'm playing one this very

2106
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:32,560
episode give wow what a coincidence looks like i solved the problem your welcome zero next week

2107
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:38,640
i hope they'll be less than one they'll be minus one you'll have to make your own voice

2108
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:44,480
nate look we got very few this week from anyone except voicemail god and there were too many by

2109
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:49,840
him was like 90 i'm not and i'm not gonna sit here for 45 minutes playing messages from voicemail

2110
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:57,360
god so just pick the cream of the problem let's fucking end this charade i will say i will say

2111
02:09:57,360 --> 02:10:01,600
though that one of the messages uh was just that you know we were saying like he said last time

2112
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:06,320
something about like uh oh you guys uh guess who i am and we're not gonna play that fucking game but

2113
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:11,360

2114
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:18,560
guess who i am i'll leave clues every week no who are you no i'm not doing that voicemails

2115
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:24,000
to pick up all your clues if it's two people that it's not me crumb trail i don't know he probably

2116
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:31,360
if i can hear his voice i'll try and think about if i've heard it before we will never

2117
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:37,600
hear his voice on the show ever again i thought you met the end of it well i was from a different

2118
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:42,880
person well from a different person uh so voicemail god just get it under control chief you just you

slash the procrastinators give us money for doing these episodes you're welcome five dollar bonus

2147

2148
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:52,640
i can't remember but i think it was good right questions right oh that's why we were talking

2149
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:57,120
questions that's right we answered your questions as we as we try to do and we tried to find decent

2150
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:04,720
ones uh no luck wait the quest continues wait wait a minute yeah i thought i thought the bonus episode

2151
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:11,200
was like viewer topics that's what it was it morphed it morphed into just questions it just

2152
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:15,520
morphed into a q and a somewhere topics somewhere topics that people said i wasn't there what's the

2153
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:21,920
difference when you get right you know what's my idea the very topic is is more nuanced a question

2154
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:28,640
requires an answer a topic requires thought and and and exploring the idea in more detail and we've

2155
