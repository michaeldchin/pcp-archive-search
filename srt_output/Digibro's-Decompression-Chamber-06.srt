1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,480
You know, I suspected a day was going to come when I was going to start feeling nostalgic

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,600
about things. I used to always say that I don't really get nostalgic because I think

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,000
most people, at least it seemed to me, like when people talked about things that made

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,840
them nostalgic, that nostalgia usually came from a place of wanting to go back to a time

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,000
when you were happier. Like, it seemed like so many people who were obsessed with nostalgia

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,720
properties or people who felt like their childhood was happier than their adulthood

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,320
is. And I never felt that way. I feel like everything's gotten much better. If you listen

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,560
to the previous podcast, The Depression Chamber, you know exactly why. I was pretty miserable

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,960
up until my twenties and now I feel great. But there is nostalgia is not that linear,

10
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,800
I don't think. And I think maybe I was just still too young to really feel nostalgia about

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,760
a lot of things. Because, you know, obviously most of the things I'm nostalgic about from

12
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,600
the past are the good memories I do have. You know, they're the things that helped me

13
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,160
get through all of those tough times. So they still have that impact of like, you know,

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,840
bringing a smile to my face to think back on how much these things meant to me back

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,720
at the time. But right now I have been in like an almost downward spiral of nostalgia.

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,760
That's maybe an over-dramatic way of putting it. But lately it's like, you know, I just

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,200
played through Pokemon Sun and Moon. And Pokemon's always a nostalgia thing, you know, because

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,080
it was a huge part of my childhood. Much more so than I think. I mean, Pokemon makes most

19
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,120
people nostalgic because they're like, oh yeah, I was really into that for like a year.

20
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,520
You know, for me, it's like that was what my life was for four years, you know, as a

21
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,800
kid. And it's not that it's ever completely gone away. And in fact, in recent years, it's

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,840
been even bigger because of, especially this year with Pokemon Go coming out and all these

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,600
nuzzlocks happening and stuff. And, you know, it felt kind of natural to play through Pokemon

24
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,640
Sun, whereas with X and Y, it was kind of like this whole return to Pokemon. But nonetheless,

25
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,120
it's still a nostalgia thing. You know, me and Victor have been recording Digi Bros.

26
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,000
I think the first episode of Bomberman will be out before this podcast. So you'll see

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,400
that, you know, we've been playing this old N64 game, which Digi Bros is usually old games.

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,960
We usually play classics, you know, but we're getting back into that. I've been listening

29
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,280
to a lot of old music, like music that I used to listen to when I was younger. Because this

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,760
year, I just kind of got sick of all the music I had. Because basically, I think I talked

31
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,160
about this a couple podcasts ago, maybe on the first decompression chamber that like,

32
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,520
you know, a couple years ago, I'd had a hard drive failure. So most of what is on my computer

33
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,680
is whatever was on my phone, which is just mostly newer stuff or stuff that I got into

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,560
in the last few years. And I've had a pretty consistent input of like new bands and new

35
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,960
stuff to listen to until this year. There's been barely anything I really liked this year.

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,880
It's been a real rough year for music for me. So I've been looking back a lot. I've been

37
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,160
downloading a lot of the old discographies, the bands I used to listen to all the time,

38
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,600
you know, sort of getting back into these old bands, remembering how much I liked these

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,480
records and why, even though most of it is very nostalgia, you know. And even the other

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,120
stuff I'm listening to that is stuff that I didn't listen to as a kid is still older

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,480
music. So, you know, lots of older, more nostalgic tunes going by. And then I've also been looking

42
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,760
more and more to my old work, like, because, you know, lately, I've entered this extreme

43
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,360
high productivity sort of frame of mind where I'm constantly putting out videos and vlogs

44
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,000
and all this other stuff and looking at all this new shit. And, and, and I feel like on

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,560
some level, I've become kind of a machine, you know, like I just kind of churn out product

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,240
and it's just ideas, ideas, ideas, here's an idea, that's a video, here's an idea, that's

47
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,240
a video. And there's a lot less, like, artistry to it. There's less of that open-minded creativity

48
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,600
of, like, expressing my, my innermost feelings and thoughts, you know, which a lot of my

49
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,440
older work was exceedingly personal. And I don't know whether it's a good thing or not

50
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,480
because, like, my current self kind of cringes at a lot of it. A lot of it's like, oh, God,

51
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,440
why did I have to try? Like, why did I feel like every little thing that was important

52
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,440
to me had to be out there, you know, even if some of it's gross or weird. But then I

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,080
kind of look at a lot of the stuff that I'm a fan of and a lot of it's like that, you

54
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,200
know, I guess it's only weird because it's me, but so much of what I consume is, like,

55
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:14,400
grossly personal and intense and in your face, you know. So maybe, maybe I'm missing out

56
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,800
on some level by, by the fact that now that I finally have an audience who could appreciate

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,760
those things, you know, those aspects of myself, I've sort of gotten that audience by not approaching

58
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,680
those subjects and I haven't had the desire to approach those subjects again. So it's,

59
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,320
it's kind of an odd, an odd sense of progression there. Like, like, I feel like my 20 year

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,920
old self would be kind of disappointed that, that my, my content now is so kind of clean

61
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,800
and straightforward. And I mean, not that it's totally that I'm still pretty, you know,

62
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,080
fairly out there, I think. I still make weird stuff every now and then, but the kind of

63
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:00,440
shit I made when I was younger was so much more like, gross. So what really brought this,

64
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,200
what really brought me into this is that I, I finally, and I hope this is also out on

65
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,800
my Reddit, I didn't want this to be a wide release, but I recorded an audio book of the

66
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,840
book that I wrote in 2010, which is very bad. It's not as bad as I expected, which is why

67
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,640
I decided to do an audio book of it. I thought the ideas were interesting, and that some

68
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,360
of it was kind of okay. And I really just want closure on the whole thing. I want to

69
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,600
finally be able to like, you know, not think about the story all the time. But the irony,

70
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,880
of course, is that reading through it again just reawakened all my memories about it.

71
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,000
It reminded me of what I was like back then, and what things I cared about, and I started

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,280
thinking about all these characters again, and who they were, and why, you know, a lot

73
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,560
of stuff I'd forgotten. So much of what's in this book, because I never read the book.

74
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,800
So much of it is stuff that was so typical of me at the time, and is not now, and it's

75
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:07,200
weird to feel that sort of dualism or dichotomy or something. I'm not sure what word I'm looking

76
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,080
for. But at the same time, it's kind of dragging me in. Like, it's reminding me of things that

77
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,160
I used to feel, and like, sort of prodding me to feel those things again. Like, hey,

78
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,840
didn't you care a lot about this subject, you know? But I don't now. So it's very jarring

79
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,160
and strange. And like, just being surrounded with so much nostalgia stuff, like my mind

80
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,480
is trying to rush back to this time. And if I had to over explain it, and I don't know

81
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,400
this is really the case, maybe it's just a coincidence. But I do feel like maybe there's

82
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,680
some yearning on my part to return to when I was more artistically minded, when I was

83
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,080
more expressive and more like, trying to feel something deeper or more romantic than what

84
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,280
I do now, because I've just become such a machine. I've become such a content, just,

85
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,720
you know, crank. Like, now it's just every day I've got some kind of vlog or some kind

86
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,800
of podcast. I do so many back to back podcasts that I can't even like, I can't edit them

87
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,920
fast enough. Like, the reason this episode is delayed is just that I was working on

88
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:26,200
so many other things that there was no room for a decompression podcast. Like, I'm finally,

89
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,360
as of probably when this is coming out, I've probably started releasing these Let's Plays.

90
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,920
I have a whole month of Let's Plays. I have, you know, 12 episodes of Bomberman, and we're

91
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,160
probably going to finish that game and schedule it for the rest of the month and like, 15 plus

92
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,680
episodes of Wario Land 4 with me and Davoo. So those are all coming out now. And I had those

93
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,840
sitting on my computer for a while, because I couldn't edit them because I was doing too many

94
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,120
other things. I have my three hour commentaries I released at the end of the month, edited one of

95
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,360
those, I edit the PCP, and I'm on it every week. I don't edit the Pub Crawl, but I'm on that every

96
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:08,000
week. You know, I've got this podcast now. I guest on people, I guested on Mumkey. It was like,

97
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,560
the last three days were, we did a Pokemon PCP, that was two hours. Then the next day,

98
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,760
I guested on Mumkey's thing, which was an hour. And then the next day, I guested on Pub Crawl,

99
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,360
which is an hour. And like, just doing those three back to back, it's like every day I had to be

100
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,880
prepared for, you're gonna spend an hour doing a podcast today, in between editing other podcasts

101
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,560
and having vlog ideas. And then I'm also working on like, this hour long video that I've been

102
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,440
fucking putting off constantly, because it's kind of a pain in the ass to edit. And it's not, it's

103
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,360
not that great. So like, it's, it's, it's like a way too big of a video for the level of quality

104
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,920
that it is, you know, that I just kind of don't feel like editing. And then I'm also editing the

105
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,720
audiobook, which is even less of high quality. It's, it's painful because it's bad, like editing,

106
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:04,800
putting so much effort into something that is bad, is painful. It's like, you know, I'm fucking

107
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,080
sitting there trying to make sure that I add enough gap, like, because I don't want it to be, you

108
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:15,560
know, shitty. But it's hard to like, time out how long should the gaps be between me reading each

109
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,280
sentence in an audiobook, what would make for a comfortable listening experience of this terrible

110
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,320
book, you know, like, oh God, there is no comfortable listening experience, because the story

111
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,400
itself makes me uncomfortable. It's such a nightmare. But just being surrounded with all this

112
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,400
nostalgia, while I'm in the middle of being like this, this, this mechanism of content creation is

113
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,160
pulling me in weird directions. And I feel like I need to take a step back sometime soon, you

114
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,560
know, like, because so much of this is just for the hell of it. Like, there's no reason for me to

115
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,440
put out this much content. It's totally like, it's totally asinine that I've gotten myself involved

116
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,880
in so many things, like that I stacked this podcast on top of like, you know, pub crawls every

117
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,520
week, which is low effort, low, low on my part, because I just show up and talk, you know, and

118
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,880
drink, though the drinking can be a bit of a commitment. If I get myself drunk, then I'm kind

119
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,720
of stuck that way. For the rest of the night. But PCP, like, you know, I'm editing them. I don't

120
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,880
know why I don't know why I'm on every episode, I don't need to be, you know, you've got enough

121
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,360
people, you can always do it without me, but I always end up showing up in doing that, and taking

122
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,080
all these other podcast offers and shit, and then editing this. And it's so unnecessary, and I don't

123
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,320
need to have a vlog out every day, and I don't need to do all this. I've been doing more and more

124
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,760
unpaid work, like for myself. I keep giving myself more things that are like, something I just post

125
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:53,000
on my Reddit, you know, like something that has no nothing to do with anything is just a pure passion

126
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,280
project. And it's like, I mean, it's cool that this is what I like doing. But I think I need to get

127
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,800
a girlfriend. I need it. And I started thinking, like the way I've been thinking about stuff like

128
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:11,800
that is like, like I was seriously contemplating just like buying a love doll and being like, I

129
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,040
don't, you know, well, if my lifestyle is going to be that I never leave the house and never talk

130
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,400
to any other humans, I might as well have some companionship, you know, but it's like, maybe

131
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,520
what needs to change is the lifestyle. Maybe I shouldn't be living a life where I do nothing

132
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,320
but make videos so often that I can't even talk to other people, you know, considering I've made

133
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,040
no effort in that regard. I haven't even tried. I have not once like attempted just talking

134
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,960
to someone, you know, or, or trying to date or something. And I feel like that would be a great

135
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,360
distraction. It's a great way to get out like, you know, I'm always saying, oh, I need some kind

136
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,480
of hobby other than just making videos, you know, like that would be a good hobby, something to

137
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,680
occupy some of that time. As long as it was a healthy relationship with which God knows how

138
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:09,560
to find one of those, you know, but again, I haven't even tried. So who knows what's out there.

139
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,480
Yeah, I just feel like I'm getting too wrapped up in my work. I'm doing too, doing too much as

140
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:27,560
bus driver saying about way too much and, and, and bugging myself in all this nostalgia is kind

141
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:35,080
of not helping. It's just igniting like the way it's reminding me of the artistic passions I had

142
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,880
when I was younger that I don't really feel anymore. But I feel like I like I'm supposed to

143
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,680
or something like I feel guilty for not doing more unpaid work for not doing more like a,

144
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,960
like, you know, speak from the soul kind of shit, which I really don't need in my life.

145
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,840
Like it's not something I think would be fun to do. It would just be a bunch of bullshit, you know,

146
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:05,400
and I'm editing a book I wrote fucking six years ago. That's not even good for some reason.

147
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,920
But hopefully when I'm done with it, that'll all be behind me and I can get back to

148
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,680
whatever I do. I don't know. I don't know what it like. I don't see any future for myself,

149
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:25,240
like outside of this. Like everyone else I know, I think has this mindset that, that things are going

150
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,080
to, things are going to change eventually, you know, like, you're going to hit a certain amount of

151
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,040
money that you're making or a certain amount of fame and things are going to change in some

152
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,520
meaningful way. Like, you know, Jesse is trying to save up enough money that he can get himself

153
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,800
like a nice car and move into his own place and start traveling the country. That's his dream.

154
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:55,960
He wants to see the real America travel the country. You know, Nate wants to eventually

155
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,560
make enough money on his art that he can become a full-time artist. Hippo wants the same thing.

156
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,840
Tommy Oliver wants the same thing. You know, he wants to finally release the shackles of being a

157
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,720
video maker and having a day, two day jobs and just become a writer. You know, they all want

158
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,960
something different from what they have. I'm sure DeVu, you know, even though he's comfortable

159
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,520
right now editing for me, I'm sure he'd eventually like to be famous on his own terms, you know,

160
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,120
and make stuff for himself. I know he wants to be a game developer eventually or at least to make,

161
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,360
he wants to make enough money one day that he can pay people to bring his game ideas to life.

162
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,800
You know, all those guys have all these other, all these other goals and all I ever really wanted

163
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,560
was to make enough money doing whatever I want that I could continue doing whatever I want.

164
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,800
And I'm already there. I don't know where to go from here. There's no,

165
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,120
there's no higher ceiling than what I've achieved. You know, I already make enough money.

166
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,120
I don't need any more. There's nothing I want that's so expensive that I can't afford it, you know.

167
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:08,200
There's no challenge that I've yet to undertake that I feel like, you know, like there's certain

168
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,600
video projects I'm working on, but I don't think they're any harder or more like more relevant

169
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,240
than what I did before. Like I kind of feel like I, after like the Astroscore series, like I wrote

170
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,760
a book in video form, that's like, that was kind of my highest echelon of what I thought could be

171
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,360
done with the with analysis videos and I've already hit it. So from here, it's just like, you know,

172
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:38,360
maintaining that level. So it's like, there's got to be something else I can do, you know, like,

173
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,240
not to say that it's kind of like with lifting, like me and Ben have been lifting, right? And

174
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,960
every other day, we raise our weight limit, like we, we, we lift every other day and like,

175
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,240
we do squats and it's like, today I'm doing 205. So the next time we do squats, I do 210, you know,

176
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,560
and keep pushing it further so that your muscles keep expanding. And then eventually,

177
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,040
when you hit your max, that's when you just start doing maintenance, when you just start

178
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,120
lifting the same amount just to keep the figure you currently have. And that's where I am. I'm

179
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,080
just doing maintenance. I'm just doing reps to keep things the way they are, you know,

180
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,200
my Patreon's not really going up significantly anymore. It's just kind of sat in a place,

181
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,120
you know, my view counts are not significantly going up. So I'm kind of like, you know, for the

182
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,040
last couple months, it's been like, all right, this is how much money I make, you know, this is

183
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:38,440
how many videos I can get out in a month, which is three to five, pretty much. This is the level

184
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,240
of quality that me and DeVu can achieve. You know, DeVu doesn't seem to be trying to like push

185
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,000
himself to do like bigger and better editing jobs, you know, he's, if anything, he's more

186
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,920
into streamlining it, you know, and trying to get more done in less time. And he's just been

187
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,640
spending all his off time watching tons and tons of anime. So like, yeah, I don't know, I feel

188
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,920
stagnant. And I don't, it's weird, I don't want to say like, I hate it, because I feel fine,

189
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,680
you know, everything's fine. It's just that like, it's weird to not have an image of where

190
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,080
things are supposed to go from here, because I always did before. I always had a, there's the

191
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,840
next peak, there's the next thing I have to get to. And like, the only thing I really have to be

192
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,880
that is money, like make more money, make significantly more money. But I don't need

193
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,960
any more money. I don't know what I'm going to do with that money. If I get it, my savings are

194
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,120
getting ridiculous right now, you know, like I have a ton of money saved up. I don't need a whole

195
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:45,640
lot more. You know, this month, this past month, November, because I'm recording this on the 30th,

196
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,120
like I had this goal that me and DeVoo were going to put out five videos because I was like,

197
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,880
yeah, we didn't, we didn't get out that many in the last couple months, you know,

198
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,840
so we didn't make a shit ton of money. So this month, let's try to make more money than before.

199
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,640
And then like, we were coming up on the end of the month and I had the fifth video that we had

200
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,920
planned as like a more complicated one than the other ones. And we didn't really have enough time

201
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,440
to do it. And at first I was like, all right, we're going to buckle down, we're just going to work

202
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,240
nonstop for four days, you know, but then it was like, we were already having like complications

203
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,480
gathering all the footage. And so I was like, all right, well, you know, let's just put it on,

204
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,000
let's let's just put that video on hold, I'll just write a shorter video that we can do by the

205
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,520
end of the month. And then I was going through like trying to come up with one that would be easy

206
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,880
enough to do. And then I was just like, why I don't even need to, I don't need to, I made enough

207
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,800
money on the four videos we've already made. There's no need to force myself to make a fifth video,

208
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,080
especially when I'm in the middle of editing this audio book and doing all this other shit.

209
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,760
So fuck it, you know, why push myself? Why am I, why am I trying so hard when it's not going to

210
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,520
change anything? And that's, that's a, I don't, yeah, that's the thing I don't like. Like, it's

211
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:02,600
not that I feel day to day pain, like I feel great, but I, it's, it's, you know, I'm looking at Casey

212
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,480
Neistat over here who just canceled his vlog and like moved in this whole, you know, different

213
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,840
direction just because he felt like he'd plateaued. And I'm like, that's how I feel, you know, but it's

214
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,520
not showing in my work, because everything I do is still unique and interesting. And, and I still

215
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,520
really like the videos I'm making, you know, I think everything I'm putting out is great. I think

216
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:30,360
the vlogs are, you know, are always interesting, fresh little ideas. The podcasts show at least

217
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,720
somewhat different angles of the same, you know, opinions and stuff. But like, I don't know, I

218
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:45,640
don't know what I'm doing. I think, I think the best solution is not right now, I don't think the

219
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,200
solution is take on an even bigger project, because there really is no bigger project that I

220
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,240
need to do. What I really need to do is find something else to do, something else to be

221
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:03,960
passionate about. So, you know, like a relationship would be the obvious answer. That's the one

222
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,440
that's like, yeah, that'll occupy your time. It's something that, you know, that I probably want.

223
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:16,520
But do I even for any like, why even? I don't know. It's so weird. I don't know what else I would

224
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,240
want to do though. There's nothing else that I'm interested in like, becoming passionate. I don't

225
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:32,040
want to play sports, you know. I don't want to just pick up some random fucking hobby to do. I don't

226
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:37,400
want a day job, because I like my sleep, I like being able to sleep and wake up whenever I want,

227
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:45,640
even though the last few days I just like straight up slept like for the majority of two days. Like,

228
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,000
I felt weird and shitty because I had eaten something wrong and sat in a chair for too long

229
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,720
recording an audiobook for fucking six hours and then I just felt like shit and just kind of passed

230
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:06,040
out for the better part of two days. So, and the idea that there's no negative consequence for that

231
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:15,720
is almost scary. So I guess that's where I'm at. I'm too comfortable. I need to find something

232
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,600
interesting to do with myself other than making videos. But I don't want to stop, you know,

233
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,720
none of this is to say I want to stop what I'm doing now. Like, unlike Casey in the vlog, I don't

234
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,920
think anything I'm doing has gotten dry. I don't think I need to stop doing vlogs or change the

235
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:39,160
nature of my videos. Like, all those are going fine. I just need another thing. Alright, I'm

236
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,520
probably repeating myself at this point, so I'll see you in the next part.

237
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:54,440
Okay, so this is me coming back a few hours later after the previous recording and I feel

238
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:03,560
at my wit's end when it comes to understanding the world and other people and my place within it.

239
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,400
Because I decided, you know, after I said all that stuff in the last part, the last part where

240
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,600
I was like, hey, you know, maybe I should seek out a relationship. Maybe I should start dating. I

241
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,120
was like, well, let's just get to it. Let's put my money where my mouth is. Let's go sign up for

242
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:27,720
some dating sites. So I went around and looked at a bunch of them and made some profiles. And I just

243
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:35,880
don't get it at all. Like, none of the parameters that are suggested on a dating site on any of the

244
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,880
ones I looked at seem like any reason that I'd want to talk to someone. You know, like,

245
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,480
they're like hobbies and like all this really general information and all this like boring

246
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,440
shit. I was just like, none of this makes me interested in a person that I'd want to talk to

247
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:58,760
them or, or, you know, like, and everyone just looks like aliens to me. I don't know what it is.

248
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,840
People, no one looks human to me. All of the women I was, I was looking at, I was just like,

249
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,720
you know, something about seeing just a photo of someone. It's like, it's not even a person.

250
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:17,160
I don't know. I feel so weird looking at like other humans, especially like just normies,

251
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,880
you know, everyone I looked at has this just looks like a normal person. I don't know how to

252
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,480
communicate with normal people. I don't like, when I see someone who looks particularly normal,

253
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,280
then I just feel like I would have nothing to talk to this person. Like, I have no idea how I

254
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:39,240
would communicate with a normal looking person. You know, it's, it's a bizarre feeling. I was

255
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,640
like, I guess I need to look at some kind of like dating site for weirdos. And then I looked into

256
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,720
those, but then everyone there looked weird. So I don't know what the fuck I'm looking for.

257
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,080
I don't know how to fill in information on these sites. Everyone that I get matched with seems to

258
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:03,080
have way more interest than I do. I have such a narrow field of interests, which I guess sounds

259
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,240
weird, because like all of my interests are just media consumption, which to me, like, you know,

260
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,520
to people who are into media, I guess that's like a broad range. Oh, you're into anime and comics

261
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,360
and movies and all this stuff. But like to me, that's kind of all just one umbrella. You know,

262
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,840
like if you're, if you're filling out stuff on a dating site, that's really just one thing. Like,

263
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:28,360
I like movies and you know, and maybe you could check video games and maybe, maybe art or music.

264
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,040
But there's no like, you know, that's like, that's like a drop in the bucket of all the things that

265
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,760
are listed as like things you could be interested in. And I have no interest in anything else,

266
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,480
other than eating out. One of the profiles I made, it just made it look like all I care about

267
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:53,560
is eating out, which I guess is fair. I do go out to eat a lot, but like, it just felt like that was

268
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,680
my only hobby in the world, because it was the only thing I listed as like something I go out to do

269
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:05,880
for fun. I don't even know what kind of human being I want to talk to. I don't know what I'm

270
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,400
looking for out of anybody, you know, like, because I don't need any friends. I have enough friends,

271
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,880
so I'm just looking for someone to date. But what the hell do I want to talk to them about?

272
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,440
What are the parameters? I have no idea. I went through Reddit, I went on all these different

273
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,520
dating subreddits where people are talking about dating, but all of their problems are totally

274
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:32,600
unrelatable to me, you know. One of my concerns is like, I mean, I'm like an internet personality

275
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:40,440
guy, you know, like, I don't know how to describe myself without talking about the fact that like,

276
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,960
what I do is I make videos all the time. Like, that's who I am. I don't think I have a personality.

277
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,920
I think I'm like, I think, I think I've reached a point in my life where I just am a thing that

278
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:59,080
appears in videos. You know, like, there's no life outside of that. There's no additional me,

279
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,720
you know, what I do for decompression time is make a fucking podcast. When I'm not making a podcast,

280
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:11,160
I'm making a podcast. I, there's nothing left of me. And there's no, there's no dating site for

281
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,760
girls who are into guys who make podcasts all the fucking time. You know, that's like a,

282
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:27,960
I don't, I don't know how to, I don't know how to be interesting or to find interest in anyone.

283
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:38,760
Um, there's certainly, I don't know any, like, uh, like, hot single girls who are into podcasting,

284
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:46,760
you know, like, seeking companionship and someone to do podcasts with, like, that's the kind of ad

285
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:55,400
that would grab my eye. Oh God, I found some hilarious dating sites. The funniest one I saw

286
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:02,360
is called Awake Dating. And it's literally for people who are like, awake to the truth. It was

287
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,160
like, basically woke. They could, they should have called it woke dating or stay woke dating,

288
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,640
because that's literally what it was about. It was, it was hilarious to realize that's a place.

289
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,840
Um, but then I thought, I wonder if that's, I wonder if I need a, if I need a black pilled partner.

290
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:30,120
Uh, stay woke dating. Oh God. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know who, I don't even know

291
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,080
who to talk to for advice about my particular problems, because who else in the world's dating

292
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:45,160
issue is I have no personality outside of the fact that I make podcasts and vlogs and that's my life.

293
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:56,360
Or, or just like looking for someone to, you know, to understand where I'm coming from when I dump

294
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,880
dialogue on them for 20 hours a day. I don't know.

295
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:19,400
Uh, all right. Well, continuing where I left off after about just shy of two days

296
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:27,160
of trying my hand at the misery that that is online dating where everything's weird

297
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:35,400
and nothing makes sense. And, and as a guy, you really, you, you really are fighting a losing

298
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:41,800
battle because, and I know this to be true, not just from women saying it, but from the way I

299
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:48,760
see other guys using dating apps, that women are just constantly, constantly getting likes and

300
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:55,560
messages from every guy on the planet. I mean, basically the way guys use a site like Tinder

301
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:02,680
is just hit like on absolutely everybody. And therefore with girls, they basically can just

302
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:09,000
take their time and sift through all the guys who've hit like on them and respond to which ones that,

303
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,400
you know, they think are attractive or, or interesting, read a bunch of articles, sort of

304
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:22,440
corroborating this as well. But yeah, that's sort of the phenomenon of, of internet dating.

305
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,480
So for me, it's just a matter of like every once in a while happening to stumble upon the one out

306
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,000
of 30 profiles that I actually think is pretty interesting. I'll be like, huh, this girl's

307
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,680
actually kind of cute, and she's got a decently written profile. That's cool. And then I hit like,

308
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,640
and then chances are that is the end of my interaction forever, you know, that they're

309
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,320
not going to hit like on my picture, especially because I have no good pictures of myself. There

310
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,800
are really none that exist. Certainly no current ones that are good. You know, I tried taking some

311
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,040
selfies of myself, but I don't know, I think I personally think I look like a psycho killer

312
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:11,000
in every picture I take of myself. So I'm sure others feel similarly. And, and yeah, I just feel

313
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,560
like there's no odds of getting that swipe back, you know, or getting that response to a message

314
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:24,600
somewhere. But I do think it's fascinating, especially Tinder. Tinder is basically a video

315
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:33,800
game, because it's just it's this it's the most simplified version version of finding people

316
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:39,080
interesting or attractive, right? It's like, you just see a picture. And so immediately you decide

317
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,160
based on the first thing you see, like, is this person even, you know, in my wheelhouse of what

318
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,880
I'm attracted to. So first, you just make that decision right out the gate. If you're unsure,

319
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:56,280
you look at a couple more pictures. And then they typically have like, a sentence to a paragraph

320
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,320
describing themselves, often not even sometimes they have no information. But at most they have a

321
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:08,440
sentence to a paragraph and you kind of look at it. And you decide, is this person two into dogs

322
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:16,600
or not? Because about 50% of everyone is just way into dogs, who's on these sites. And I hate

323
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:23,640
dogs. So I decided whether or not they're two into dogs, and then choose whether to hit like or

324
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:30,760
dislike on their profile. It's a little more complex than that. But, but I feel like it only

325
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,920
is for me, I feel like most people don't even make it as far as I do in that decision making

326
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:40,600
process. And then like, that's it, you just keep swiping, and then do that forever and then see

327
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:49,480
no results. And yeah, it's just a video game. It's like, it's like finding out both what your

328
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,000
tastes are exactly and how many people in your area fit them, and then doing nothing with the

329
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,960
information. That's basically the game that you're playing. So it's a huge waste of time. I spent

330
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,320
like hours swiping in different directions on Tinder. It was a bottomless fucking pit. Never

331
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,080
fucking hit the end. I'm pretty sure there's supposed to be a limit to how many likes you have

332
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:17,320
in a day, never hit it. It started cycling me back through people I'd already swiped on,

333
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:23,080
you know, after a few hours. And I was just like, Oh, God, this is a this is a fucking hell.

334
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:30,840
You know, looking on the online websites. It's just so weird for me to imagine myself talking to

335
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,040
most people. Like, the kind of people who I've spoken to in my life, there's there's very much

336
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:42,600
a type of person identifiable by sight, who I think of as like, my people, you know, like,

337
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,320
this is the kind of person who I see them. And I think that's the kind of person I'm used to talking

338
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,440
to, you know, and sometimes someone doesn't quite look like the kind of person I expect myself to

339
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,720
talk to. But I read their description. And I think, Okay, they seem in the wheelhouse of people

340
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,920
I've spoken to before, you know, or, or I think I could find an approach to talk to this person.

341
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,800
But it's, you know, it's weird to think that there's such a huge dichotomy between a kind of person

342
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:17,720
I'm used to talking to, which is basically nerds, you know, nerdy girls tend to look a certain way,

343
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,520
even if they're not even to say about like, whether they're attractive or not, just like,

344
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,280
I don't know, I feel like there's a certain way that people who like go to anime cons or,

345
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,680
or watch YouTube videos look, it's just this like, and everyone else just looks like a normie to me,

346
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:39,240
you know, and when I see the normie girls, I'm like, I can't imagine having a conversation with

347
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:46,600
someone like this. Maybe it's just a weird vein kind of like metric I'm using, but I don't know,

348
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,000
it feels strange. But anyways, in the midst of all this, I thought it would be interesting to talk

349
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:58,120
about, to talk about the kind of flirting that happens just from being an internet personality,

350
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,760
because I feel like some people who are listening to this must be thinking,

351
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,840
surely you have a reach of like hundreds of thousands of people who watch your videos,

352
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:15,560
many of whom are fans of you, surely some of those people are interested in you romantically. And

353
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,040
yeah, let me touch on that subject, because it can be interesting.

354
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,960
So I'd say pretty much everybody I know, who's a content creator, creator, or has been for a

355
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,760
long enough time, has done some kind of flirting with fans of their work or people who watch their

356
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:41,560
stuff and you know, and are interested in them romantically or sexually. I'd say everybody

357
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,840
is at least flirted with someone, you know, whether or not they've actually gotten into a

358
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:50,600
relationship before. And about, I mean, half of the PCP has been in relationships with people we

359
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:57,720
met through our work, you know, whether they were fans or, or just, you know, found out about us

360
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,080
through the work, particularly. And if you followed me for long enough, you know, that was what my

361
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,640
first and last relationship was like, was I was dating a girl for six months on the basis that

362
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:17,160
she was a big fan of my work. And she was in the pub crawl chat. And just like I was literally

363
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,920
complaining about how I don't have a I was 23 and it never had a girlfriend. And she was like,

364
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,520
I'll be your girlfriend. And I was like, Oh, really? But you know, here's why it's here's why

365
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,440
it can be weird. And I don't I don't get flirted with a lot. Not a lot of girls come out and say

366
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,120
anything, you know, I don't know if it's just because they think that like, because I know

367
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,400
there's girls who are interested. And I hear about it sometimes something like, like, Sider has told

368
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,800
me many times over the years that there's like girls who talk to him about how they like me,

369
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,000
but they never talk to me about how they like me. And I don't know if it's just because I'm, you

370
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,840
know, somewhat internet famous, maybe I'm hard to approach, you know, or you're just scared,

371
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:10,280
you think it won't work. But um, but yeah, I rarely rarely get approached. But even when I do,

372
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:16,200
it's super weird because I feel like, and this is what I realized this because of Tinder, because

373
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,960
I actually think that aside from the fact that you never get anyone responding to you on Tinder,

374
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,440
as a guy, I think it has the perfect information that I need to know before I'll talk to somebody,

375
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:35,240
which is what do you look like? How old are you? And where are you? Those are the those are three

376
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,920
pieces of information I consider to be crucial before I'm going to even consider, like, you know,

377
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:48,760
approaching you on a romantic level. Because, like, you know, if if we're trying to hook up if we're

378
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,960
trying to, you know, test the waters of dating or whatever, then like, it's kind of important that

379
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,160
we're attracted to one another, you know, and like, you already know what I look like. If someone's

380
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,680
messaging me, they know what I look like, I've got a thousand videos out there, but I have no

381
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,120
idea what you look like. And it takes a while, it takes a while of talking to somebody who's like

382
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,160
your fan, who's someone who knows you from online, you know, who you're trying to like kind of be

383
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,160
polite to because there's someone who likes your work. It takes a while to get to the point where

384
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:25,080
you're like, Hey, can I see what you look like? You know, and that's a it's a it's it's also very

385
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,320
weird. And it feels terrible to reach that point in the conversation to get pictures of somebody,

386
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,200
and then to see, Oh, I'm not attracted to this person, and then to try to get your way back out

387
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,600
of the conversation. Like, you know, it sounds it might sound shallow or something, but I'm sure

388
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:48,120
you all understand what that would be like, you know, to reach to reach that point, and then have

389
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,000
to kind of backpedal, especially to someone who you don't want to hurt their feelings, because

390
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,440
they like your stuff, you know. So yeah, that's the first problem is that people don't tend to just

391
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:07,720
upfront have pictures of themselves. I mean, and I can guarantee it would feel weird to send someone

392
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,760
pictures of yourself randomly, someone you, you know, you're a fan of and you don't know and you

393
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,800
just send them pictures of yourself might seem a little presumptuous, but I promise you, it would

394
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:26,600
be a huge help. If someone did that. And then also age, where I've had times where people like flirt

395
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:32,040
in my comments and stuff, you know, they'll say things like, Oh, digi, you're so sexy or something.

396
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:38,520
And I'm like, if you're like a 17 year old, then I'm not going to like hit you up, you know, like,

397
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,760
I've had people who seem to be like flirting in the comments that I'm like, I don't want to approach

398
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,520
this. If it turns out that this person's underage, you know, I mean, I probably won't even date somebody

399
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,760
under 21. But if you're under 18, then obviously not, you know. So like, that's the second thing

400
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,880
that makes it weird. And then location, because the last relationship I was in, the girl lived

401
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,920
in Montana at the time, you know, anytime we actually wanted to see each other, that was a $400

402
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:14,360
round trip playing ticket. So, you know, at the time I was inexperienced and didn't mind. But in

403
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:21,000
retrospect, I was like, I don't want, I don't want to be in a relationship where just actually

404
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,760
spending time together costs an enormous sum of money, you know, like it feels like the relationship

405
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,960
is tied to spending a shit ton of money just to hang out. And that's why, and then also like,

406
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:40,120
you end up like way overcompensating for the fact that you don't see each other that often in person

407
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:46,440
by constantly seeing each other online. And that's excessive, you know, I don't want relationships

408
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,840
where I end up in Skype conversations all day, which is what happened last time, you know. So

409
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:58,520
like, that's why, even though it seems like, you know, you'd think, well, I have a huge audience,

410
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,760
some of those people must be interested. But like, it's just that I don't know anything about anybody,

411
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,360
you know, I don't know anything about the people who, who post like one little flirtatious line,

412
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:14,520
you know, maybe hoping I'll follow up on it. But it's like, I have, you have way more information

413
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,520
about me than I do about you. You just constantly hear me at my most interesting, at my, at my best,

414
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:26,120
you know, doing podcasts, talking about myself, learning everything about my life and what I'm

415
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:32,440
up to and what my interests are. You don't need any icebreaker for me. But I know absolutely nothing

416
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:39,160
other than the vague sense that maybe you're not joking about being interested, you know, which

417
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,000
even then I have no idea when people are joking. And I get lots of attention from, from men as well,

418
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,640
you know, like I've had plenty of gay guys who talk about how hot I am. So I don't want to pursue

419
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:56,120
you only to find out that you're not even a woman or, or anything, you know, there's just,

420
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:02,120
there's a thousand way a troll, you could just be a troll, you know, as a, as someone who's known on

421
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,240
the internet, plenty of people want to troll me. It was funny too, I like, there's, there was stuff

422
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,880
like a, like an anime dating site. And I was like, it would be tempting to go on here because I think

423
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,320
it's funny that it's like a site that matches you based on your taste in anime. But I was like,

424
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,440
everyone on here would, would know who I am or they, or they could easily find out, you know,

425
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:29,240
people who, who know me from my videos and think of me as like a mimetic character might be on here,

426
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:35,560
you know, I might try to troll me or something and it's just a huge waste of time. So yeah, that's

427
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,320
why it's really weird to try and pursue these kinds of relationships. And I'm not saying,

428
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,960
you know, don't, I'm saying, I mean, if you want to send me messages where you actually say,

429
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,640
hey, I'm being completely legitimate, here's three pictures of me at my age and location,

430
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,280
that would be greatly appreciated. And it would be fucking hilarious if it worked, because then

431
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:05,480
it would prove that the only game I have is complaining about how I don't have any,

432
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,560
how I don't have a girlfriend online. That would mean that that's the only way I know how to get

433
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:17,720
relationships, which would be sad and hilarious. But I don't know, I'd be okay with it because

434
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:28,520
it's not working out any other way. Yeah. So I was giving some thought to why exactly I'm so

435
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,400
frustrated with all this, like with this whole online dating thing, because I mean, two days ago,

436
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,400
I felt totally fine about whatever I was doing. I think I did. I don't remember. But,

437
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:46,520
but once I started this, I started feeling just totally down and depressed and upset.

438
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:54,120
And I think it's just a matter of like putting effort into something that has absolutely no

439
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:00,040
tangible or evident benefit, and in which I feel completely out of my depth, which is not something

440
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:09,320
I'm used to. I'm used to things that I can do and immediately understand the benefits, right? Like

441
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:16,920
a vlog. I come up with an idea for a vlog. I record it instantly, post it online instantly, get, you

442
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,040
know, the reaction I want instantly. I'm used to lots of that. Like I'm, I have a very confident

443
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,760
approach to everything I do in my life. I know exactly what I'm going to get out of it, and how

444
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,200
much work it'll take to reach the finish line, you know, and, and there's always that exact like

445
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:39,400
feeling of I'm doing something I know what to do, know how to do, and, and I can do it and know

446
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,600
everything about it and feel the payoff. But with this, it's just like throwing,

447
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,760
throwing stones at a barn blindfolded and trying to hit the blind side of a barn,

448
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:57,480
uh, literally blind. I don't know how you, I don't know exactly what the blind side of a barn is.

449
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,640
Um, yeah, and I just don't know what I'm doing. So it's like, it's like, I have no idea if I'm

450
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,440
even going in the right direction with anything I'm posting. Like am I just totally off base with

451
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:14,360
the pictures I'm choosing or the descriptions I'm writing, or by even attempting this? Am I on the

452
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:19,800
completely wrong websites? You know, I've, I've been doing tons of research. Like my approach to

453
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,280
something like this is find every Reddit board with any information about this,

454
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,520
find every article about this, figure out exactly what I'm doing, and I've come to

455
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:35,960
basically no conclusions. Um, so that's what's so frustrating about it. And I was thinking about how

456
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:42,520
there would be ways to make it, like if it wasn't for the fact that all these websites and stuff

457
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,160
ask questions or, or base their stuff on parameters that like don't mean a lot to me,

458
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,080
that's kind of part of the issue. Like for instance,

459
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,680
these sites will always have something like, you know, what are some of your favorite books

460
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:05,000
and movies and TV shows and stuff. And like to me, that's not a very helpful question because at

461
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,560
best we're going to have like one or two things we both like, who boy, you know, like maybe it'll

462
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,520
give me something to talk about like, oh, you like Rick and Morty, I like Rick and Morty, that's cool.

463
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,440
But like, it doesn't really cut to the heart of the matter, which is how much do you care about

464
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:27,160
TV and movies and books, you know, like you can have a favorite book that you read five years ago,

465
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,400
and you don't really think about it or talk about it, you just list it when the topic of

466
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:38,040
favorite books comes up. What it should really say is like, how often do you read? How much do you

467
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:45,800
like books, you know, how much does your favorite media mean to you? Then we have an idea of where

468
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,080
this is going, you know, like, if I bring up that book, are you going to be like, oh my god,

469
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:56,440
someone to talk about this book with, you know, like when I when I list out this stuff, I always go

470
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,120
really basic because you would think, well, Digi's got a million favorites, surely he'll list all of

471
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,640
them, but to me, it's like, no one cares, that's the way I see it, like who would possibly care

472
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,960
that I like these 500 different fucking, you know, anime shows, most people never heard of any of them,

473
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,840
you know, so I usually just post like, I like a lot of anime, you know, like basically all anime,

474
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:25,880
I think it's what I listed on one profile, like, you know, it's, it's a huge difference between

475
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,320
I like this show and I care about this show, and I think a lot of the answers on these websites

476
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:37,080
could be more like that, you know, like they say like, do you like food? It's like, yeah,

477
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,760
everybody likes food, everybody likes going out to eat, how often do you go out to eat? How much

478
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,240
money do you spend when you go out to eat? These are questions I want to know, you know, because

479
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,720
like me and my friends go out to eat all the time, I almost as often as I can, I take somebody out

480
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,040
with me, but most of my friends are cheap, you know, most of my friends don't spend as much on

481
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,640
food as I do, so you know, that determines where we're going and what we're doing, you know, if I,

482
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:07,320
if you like to eat out every single day, probably I'm not gonna always pay for every meal we have

483
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,720
together, but if we eat out all the time, then that would be super cool, it'd be interesting,

484
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,040
like how much, not just how much money do you make, but how much do you spend on food?

485
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:23,320
Is there anybody who eats out as often as I do? Another question, what's your sleep schedule?

486
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,720
Now, I know that for most people, the answer will probably be the same,

487
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,720
but for someone like me, I'm currently recording this at three o'clock in the morning and I

488
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:38,200
like just woke up like an hour ago after a series of weird, and all I've been doing for the last

489
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,480
two days other than dating sites is like sleeping and jacking off intermittently, it's just been

490
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:51,400
like this nonstop back and forth, wake up, up for like an hour, jack off, fall back to sleep,

491
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:59,320
it's just been like constant ever since, ever since a few days ago, so before even this whole,

492
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,440
this whole thing started, it's just been the last few days for me.

493
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:09,160
So, so how, when are you awake? How often are you awake? What times are you most active?

494
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,400
Do you prefer to go out and hang out at noon, or do you prefer to hang out at night, or do you

495
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,440
prefer to hang out at three in the morning? Do you actually find things to do at three in the morning,

496
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:25,880
you know? These are all the kind of questions I want the answers to in a dating profile.

497
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:35,000
How about, how about how many times per day do you leave the house, or per week, per month,

498
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:42,600
to go do a thing? Like, do you like to go out with other people, or by yourself? Because I like

499
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,960
to go out every day with other people if I can, you know, me and Victor, anytime Victor's home,

500
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,280
we're either going to go to lunch, or we're going to go check out, like, the bookstore,

501
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,440
the comic store, just like, I want to get out of the house, and I don't like going out alone,

502
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:03,080
you know, so I prefer to snatch up Ben or DeVue and be like, hey, I'm going to this place,

503
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,000
you want to come, you know, even if it's just like a short drive, who wants to come with me?

504
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:13,320
You know, are you into that person on dating profile? How often do you leave the house with

505
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:21,720
other people? How often do you go to just, you know, frivolously spend money on food to do something

506
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,680
that's not sit at home, you know? Or do you have much more exciting things you go out and do

507
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,440
that are unbeknownst to me, that I don't even realize exist, you know? I've had a,

508
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:39,000
there's like, two people, well, only one who I actually messaged, but there were two people on

509
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,320
OkCupid who I had like a decent match percentage with, and one of them said, like, it said, like,

510
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:51,560
what's your typical Friday night? And she said, going to a place where I can, like, a place with

511
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:58,360
good beer and a little personality where they play good music at a volume where you can have a

512
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,360
conversation over it. And I was like, where the hell did she find a place like this in Virginia

513
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,840
Beach? I even messaged, I messaged her and said, like, hi there, where did you find a place that

514
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,680
has all these characteristics in Virginia Beach? Haven't gotten a response yet, but I'm legitimately

515
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:16,440
curious. I'd love to go somewhere that has beers and decent music, you know, her musical tastes

516
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,680
seem more similar to mine than, you know, what's typical, which is why I don't go to bars. I love

517
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,920
the concept of a bar, go to a place, have them serve you awesome, interesting alcoholic beverages and

518
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,360
hang out with other people and listen to music, sounds great, except every bar just blasts shitty

519
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:40,840
music at the highest possible volume. And you can't talk to anybody. And, and I don't want to hear

520
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,000
that music. Would love to know these places these people are finding that I don't know about.

521
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,920
One girl had a bunch of pictures of her doing rock climbing on like legit cliffs. I was like,

522
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,560
where the fuck are you finding these cliffs in Virginia Beach? It's a flat plane. Are you driving

523
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:03,320
out to the mountains to do this? Real curiosity. So yeah, maybe everybody else knows a much more

524
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,720
fun and exciting version of this town than I do. That's, that's what I'm always suspecting, you know.

525
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,880
I mean, Ben St moved in and he thinks this place is hell. He was like, this, there's nothing to do

526
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,480
here. This place is just a wasteland. It's a hellhole. And I kept assuring him like, I know

527
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,280
there's stuff to do here, because other people who live here do stuff. Most people who live in

528
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,600
Virginia Beach seem to be happy here. Just the stuff that they do is not stuff I want to do.

529
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:32,920
Most people go to the beach. I don't like the beach. Most people go to clubs and bars don't

530
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:38,920
like clubs and bars. You know, there's a million clubs and bars in this town. There's definitely

531
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:44,120
things to do. I'm just not sure, you know, what they are where and a lot of them are expensive

532
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,440
things to do. You know, there's lots of like little fun. You could go canoeing out on the river.

533
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,760
You could go paddle boarding or something. You can go fishing. There's a lot of water here. There's

534
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:58,600
a lot of water based activities. There's hiking areas. There's ultimate frisbee golf and shit.

535
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,280
But all that's like, you know, you have to spend money to do on the end of that shit.

536
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:12,120
Indoor trampoline gyms and indoor rock climbing, bowling everywhere, laser tag, all things you

537
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:18,280
have to pay money for. So probably not something that I think Ben's more looking for like hipster

538
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:26,200
coffee shop I can sit down at, you know, or something. But I don't know. It's not a lot.

539
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:33,480
Not a lot that is of interest to me or seemingly him around here. So whatever everybody else is

540
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,120
doing, I'd love to know it. Love to know where they're going and why they find it appealing.

541
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,600
But personally, I can't say I understand it myself.

542
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:50,600
And that really makes me think, you know, I've been talking a lot about moving all the PCP here

543
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:58,120
to Virginia Beach. And the only real reason for it to be Virginia Beach over any where anybody

544
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:04,600
else lives is that I have the most, I have personally have the most stability in my income

545
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:10,280
and in housing situation. And I, you know, I've already got Ben and DeVue living here for like

546
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,560
really low rent compared to what it would be if we were trying to, you know, get our own place.

547
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:22,680
You know, and of course that rent is also split between my, both of my brothers and

548
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:29,720
Shade's girlfriend. So like, you know, it makes sense because we have a good housing situation

549
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:36,280
with good rent. And, you know, DeVue works for me anyways. So he's basically best wherever I am.

550
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:42,120
And, and like no one else, like we don't want to move out to where Jesse is because he lives in

551
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:46,920
the middle of bumfuck nowhere in a town even smaller than ours. You know, Nate lives in Ohio,

552
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,680
but he's not really from there. So even he's not really connected there. Because he's originally

553
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:59,080
from Michigan, which both Ben and Nate are both from not Michigan, I meant Massachusetts. Ben

554
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:04,440
and Nate are from like outside Boston. And Nate, I mean, Ben kind of misses where he was from.

555
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:11,720
But I do feel like we should eventually just move this whole operation. Like,

556
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,920
we, we moved into this house because my parents wanted to keep the house, you know, they wanted to,

557
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,400
they wanted to give us our own place while simultaneously not having to give up their

558
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,680
house. That was sort of the whole dream with getting the, with the whole setup we have right

559
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:33,400
now is don't have to sell the house that we've been living in for seven years and done all this

560
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,440
work on and, you know, don't have to uproot everybody and move them around. You know,

561
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Shade's got his girlfriend who wants to stay around. Victor's got his girlfriend who wants to

562
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,920
stay around. They're not trying to like move out and get into all this other shit. But eventually,

563
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:55,160
Victor's going to probably move in with, with Hope. I don't know what Shade and Amber will do,

564
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:01,400
but like, I don't know if moving like, I want everyone in one place, but this doesn't have to

565
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,640
be the place because it really doesn't seem like Virginia Beach has anything to offer us.

566
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,840
And that's becoming more and more clear to me over time. We're like, for instance,

567
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,240
you know, even though my lifestyle has me indoors like all the time and not really talking to

568
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:23,160
anybody, I feel like there must be in other cities, people I could actually hang out with,

569
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,480
communities I could be a part of, you know, like people I could see in real life

570
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,400
or places I could go and do things, you know, if we lived in New York City or something,

571
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,200
which I don't know if I'd want to live in New York City because it's, you know,

572
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,960
grossly overpopulated and there's just too many, I don't want to live like surrounded on all sides

573
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:46,440
by people and things and sounds and shit, you know, there's anything I've learned from Casey

574
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:53,080
Neistat vlogs is that the sound pollution is terrible. You're constantly, there's always some

575
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:59,640
weird shit going on. Probably wouldn't be a great recording environment unless I like

576
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:08,600
created a whole fucking studio. But nonetheless, like, this maybe is not the place to keep this

577
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:14,600
going. It's a great place for getting everybody in one spot, but only for us to work together.

578
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:19,400
There's nothing outside of this group, you know, which I kind of always had it in my head that

579
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,400
that was okay, that like, well, we're all going to be working together. So we should all be,

580
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,960
you know, like, who else do we possibly need to talk to other than one another. But then it's

581
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:34,760
like, yeah, but what about the all the time you're not working, you know, that's the time I've kind

582
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:40,200
of left unaccounted for. And for a really long time, I had this like romantic idea in my head

583
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,880
of exploring everywhere in Virginia Beach, like, because I didn't, because I kind of saw myself

584
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:51,000
as like a spokesperson for the town, like I live here, it's important to me that I am a part of

585
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,240
this place, I grew up here, you know, I'm going to be the guy who represents the city or something,

586
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:03,320
or be the most interesting thing to come out of this town. And so I should explore it and find

587
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,320
out all that's here. And now I feel like I have and there's nothing here, you know, I feel like

588
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:11,880
I've done the exploring. I'm sure there's some stuff I haven't seen yet that's interesting, but like,

589
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,160
on a day to day basis, there's nothing here I want to be doing, you know, I've been to all the cool

590
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:24,760
restaurants, that's over, you know, I've been to all the the comic stores have been to all the game

591
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,360
shops and the record stores and the bookstores and all the things that interest me. And there's

592
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,760
there's not a whole lot left, I don't want to hang out down at the beach strip, where it's a

593
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,720
25 minute drive to everything being overpriced. And there's not as much down there as I first

594
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,640
thought. Like when I I used to think that like there's all this stuff down at the beach, and I

595
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,280
just haven't really gone down there. But then like I have driven around there, not really anything,

596
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:55,400
but bars and clubs. So, you know, maybe this town just isn't meant for the the procrastinators.

597
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,880
Maybe we're going to end up setting up base somewhere else. And I mean, like, we don't really

598
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:07,720
know where yet. So, you know, if I don't I don't want anybody to put down on a on a lease here

599
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,040
or something, and then get trapped in a house for a year, and then we're all kind of stuck.

600
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:17,320
But at the same time, I don't want us to just pack up and go to some other town without thinking

601
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,680
about it, you know. But especially if it's going to be even more expensive, which Virginia Beach

602
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,560
is not a cheap place to live. But if we're trying to move somewhere even cooler, then it just means

603
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,520
the rent's going to be even higher, you know. So, so I don't know where we could go that we could

604
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:40,440
all live in one place, and it would still be inexpensive, and also cool. But maybe we'll find

605
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:49,960
out. I certainly would like to. Alrighty, well, I think I'll just keep this one short, kind of stuck

606
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:55,400
to one topic, or at least one train of thought through the whole thing. So, you know, might as

607
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:02,360
well keep it as it is. It's a bit late anyways, a few days late. Maybe the next one will

608
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,600
not be a whole week before it comes out. Who knows? Who knows how much decompression I'll

609
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:12,760
have to do between now and then. I hope you enjoy the new song choice. I know it's a real

610
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:32,200
crowd pleaser, so you'll probably all be into it. And enjoy it, and have a nice day.
