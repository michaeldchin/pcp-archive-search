1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Routing, fuckers, cop, killers, inn, Kurgostarworth, the complete saga.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you guys want to move so Kazzy's like in frame?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, I gotta be in frame still.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Can we make Kazzy a frame, please?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A frame, what?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Can we make Kazzy a frame?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah, sure, you know what? Kazzy's the new a frame.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Congratulations, other new a frame.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I wish my beard were darker.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sorry.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It blends in and it makes it like a Hitler stash because this part is not thin enough.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Did anything happen? Did you get a haircut or something? Did you change something about the way that you look?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you Roman?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You can sort of look like a god.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You look like you're about to star in a pornography film.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Painous.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I didn't even know.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I thought when you pressed your core we were going to have a little bit more time, I don't know, fuck around.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Whatever, start going.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The game's open, right? The game's open, click that fucking game.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's not open, actually.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Click open, click open.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's on the other screen, and here we go.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey, give me this shit.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's mine, it's mine.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
People have been fucking clamoring for this game ever since we unveiled it at the last rfckcon.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
People have just been like, where's the LEGO Star Wars episode?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Where's LEGO Star Wars complete saga for the Wii or the 360?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Or where's my pee?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's gone all ways.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's all over the dang place. It's all over my fucking bathroom.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Pee on a keto strip like a normal person.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I pissed all over Ben's room and it was an accident, and then I thought, wow.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I should do this on purpose next time.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Next time?

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we're finally delivering it to the people.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is the best game ever made.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ben, I know that we've had our differences.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You had a track record of loving shit.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Ben, we've had our differences before.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We've come to different conclusions about classic video games.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
For instance, for some reason, maybe you were in a cranky mood that day,

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but you just didn't like losing.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You didn't like XT Gale of Darkness for some reason.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You woke up on a bad note that day.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
All 175 days that we recorded it.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It was just bad luck.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think we're going to bring this one around.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because listen, you could take Super Smash Brothers Brawl,

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you could take Pop Tropica,

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you could take Pokemon XT Gale of Darkness,

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and you could roll them all into one, into one contiguous ball,

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
drop it into a pot, boil it into like a nice broth,

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and then add noodles to it.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Reduce it down into a syrup, maybe?

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Reduce it down into a syrup, drain it into your fucking eyeballs,

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
or through your nose, and you wouldn't get half the hype.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You wouldn't get half the hype that you get when you play this fucking game.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Lego Star Wars Complete Psycho.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Or as I like to call it, cool wokely lead,

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
here in the hood, we call it, curgo stirrer work.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, introduce your game.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Uh, you know.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm the ratty fucker, and this is the cop killer.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Woo!

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Alright, alright, now we can see.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We have the juvie kingpin, Tommy Oliver.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, that's me.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And the other juvie kingpin.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's me, Tom Oliver.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We have a loud juice.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We've allowed juice to enter the sanctum.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And to the juice.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Much to our great chagrin.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You know, cop killer sounds really gone downhill, you know?

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Boy, boy howdy.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Uh,

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Where's up here in Ascertain Heights?

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We're just fucking trying to have a good time,

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and these juves are coming around,

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
asking for directions to the fucking Arson Brook farm,

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
like, oh.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey, where's the farm, guys?

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey, where's the mill?

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I've been looking forward to getting some daughter apples.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I just can't wait to saturate my slimeoid.

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, yeah, fuck off.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No salt on my razor nuts, please.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Jesus Christ.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
See, Ben, look at this.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's Legos, and it's Star Wars.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How big can you get? How big can you get?

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How well can you grow?

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's pretty big.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're growing so fast right now, Ben.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's pretty big. Do you want to, like,

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
do you want to leave the door open?

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why?

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'd probably be really loud that way.

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah? I think the louder we are, the better.

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, you don't have to do anything serious.

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We respect people's boundaries.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hey, oh my god, it's the sun god, Apollo.

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's canonical.

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's talking about his cop killers now.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you recording?

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, yeah, dude.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let me ask you a question.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Who out here?

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We ain't fucking playing.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What is Star Wars the complete saga, dude?

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The best game ever made.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Listen, listen, man.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Everyone's going to make fun of Legos.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Star Wars the complete saga coming here.

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, oh, what's this baby game?

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Literally for 12-year-olds.

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Literally for 8-year-olds.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Literally for 10-year-olds.

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
For the whole family, and for baby.

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Listen, all I'm trying to say is that fun family fun

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
doesn't mean they have to be not fun.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we're going to get in here with Qui-Gonjin and Obi-Wan Kenobi,

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the two best characters ever made in fiction.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And we're going to hup the fuck around.

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Fuck you, Ben.

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Slime Fest 5.

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Slime Fest 5.

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Slime Fest 5. Over.

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Delete his slime.

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You just got shot. How do I kill you?

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No, you can't do it, dude. Don't worry.

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't worry, dude. You can't do it.

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Slime Fest 6. Slime Fest 6.

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Slime Fest 6.

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is why Legos Star Wars is the best.

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Star Wars sucks. Star Wars is awful.

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If you like Star Wars, you're stupid.

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But you should probably kill yourself.

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes! Slime Fest 6 is over. Take a slime.

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But Legos are sick.

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And that makes it okay.

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Legos are so zoom-er-core, they're customizable.

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They're all about conversation.

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They're all about the internet integration.

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Dude, you go and you open up fuck...

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, literally give me a hashtag

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
fucking like hard-resonant chat if you know what I'm talking about right now.

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You go your mom's work because it's signature child of the work day.

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then you boot up one of the powerful ass computers there at her work.

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Fucking Lego 3D builder,

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that application that you can get from the Lego site.

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And you start making 3D Lego models inside of your computer.

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And you're like, what the fuck?

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Are you as powerful as the Lego site? What the hell?

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Are we supposed to kill all those people?

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, this isn't even level.

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This is the hub world, my friend.

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Dude, we're going to defend this.

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, name one...

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Name a better movie than the Phantom Menace.

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Like right now, like I'm begging you.

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Indiana Jones, The Crystal Skull.

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How about The Last Jedi?

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, you know what? You're right.

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You didn't think they could improve perfection, but somehow they found a way.

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Alright, we're gonna get right into this.

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, alright. This cutscene

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
is like the most iconic thing.

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You know, Rosebud.

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's baby shit. That's some fucking

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
chocolate toy fucking...

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
for a baby's first story.

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Baby's first narrative.

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The baby's first story?

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Here's for some real actual plot.

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Here's the plot. Here's the plot of Gilgamesh.

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Two.

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is Gilgamesh two right here.

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
All the chicks, dude.

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, get ready for this.

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Anki-Doo. Anki-Doo.

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's my favorite.

188
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, this is Gilgamesh right here. He's so big and chunky.

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, he's chunky already.

190
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Dude, Ben, do you remember when we went

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
to the Trade Federation and they tried to kill us?

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I remember that

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
there was a lot of slime

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
coin on the line.

195
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And they were

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
showing for it.

197
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Their eyes? Oh, they're gone.

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, they're gone. But you think it's sad? No, it's actually funny and a joke.

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Look, oh, they fall down.

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They break the pieces like a Lego.

201
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, we're scared. Now we're on fault.

202
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's too sad. I can't.

203
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Ben, I'm not to introduce you to something.

204
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What are the friendly characters and why?

205
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're a friendly character.

206
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We have to do it at the same time.

207
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right, Ben, I'm not to introduce you into...

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We'll assume we're the band of your existence.

209
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why can't I joke?

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
These miscolored

211
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
slime coin right here, these physical copies,

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
like these like millennium, like challenge coin

213
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
slime coins. These are called studs.

214
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Is that bar that fills up?

215
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah. There's a state.

216
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There's a game state called true Jedi.

217
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
When you get enough studs, then you get true Jedi.

218
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's part of getting 100%.

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We're getting true Jedi every single level, Ben.

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So that means that we're going to be

221
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
scouring each level for

222
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
literal hours trying to find

223
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
every studs available. We're not going to have to solve riddles.

224
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We're going to have to solve the Spinks' riddles 3

225
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
in order to get the studs. What are you doing?

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Why are you doing this?

227
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They're dancing and we get studs for it.

228
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We get money. We get fucking cold, hard catch.

229
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Listen, I...

230
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
When I was a kid, I was a communist.

231
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then I played this game and I thought, wow, what a fucking dumb ass I was.

232
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Time to get fucking rich

233
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and banked in new communism.

234
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
A.K.A. Kirgo Sturrward.

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The complete surger.

236
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay, so is this the game just like running around

237
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and using the force on things to make studs pop out of them?

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, but we also... Yes, yes.

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
All right, well, we're winning.

240
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think we're winning, Munchy. I think we're doing it.

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So I want to let you understand,

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
just so you know, it means you have no frame of reference.

243
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a normal game, like, you know, like the game

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that you play, like, to, like, win the game.

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Uh-huh.

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Like, it's almost like a beat-em-up almost.

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You got an attack and you fight enemies,

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you just progress through the level, there's puzzles and shit,

249
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
you know, it's like a normal, like, 3D platform or whatever.

250
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But the meta game, the real game,

251
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
is getting as many studs as you...

252
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A BLUE ONE! A BLUE ONE!

253
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm crushing you in studs right now.

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, that's fun.

255
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I used to watch my brother play this game

256
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and when he didn't get the blue stud, I'd be like,

257
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm like, I'm fucking in $100.

258
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Dude, okay, you know that feel

259
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
when you come across the purple stud

260
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and you just literally have to change

261
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
your fucking pants.

262
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wait, there's a purple stud?

263
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Wait, when? The legendary, the mythical.

264
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Is that in a different one?

265
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay, this game is teaching some crazy fucking moral

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
because only the Sith can get purple studs.

267
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't remember the purple stud.

268
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's because they have, like, 10,000 each.

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's a purple stud.

270
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Is that why I don't remember it? Yeah.

271
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's a lot of studs.

272
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We're already halfway to true Jedi.

273
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This game is literally free money.

274
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You play this and you get paid.

275
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's free money, the game.

276
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No, I love this shit because you just knock it.

277
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Like, if you knock your sword...

278
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
MEDICATE!

279
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

280
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Wait, we're gonna die.

281
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Kill these guys.

282
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Kill these so we can have

283
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
a quiet space for me to do

284
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
the most important thing I've ever done in my entire life.

285
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Owls back there?

286
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We gotta go back, we gotta go back

287
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
after I...

288
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Guys, please, a moment of silence.

289
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Come back over here, Ben.

290
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A moment of silence for the best video game sound effect

291
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
of all time.

292
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
BUSH A WING!

293
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
BUSH A WING!

294
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's a mini-kit.

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
10 in each level. Get them all 100%.

296
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I used to play this game

297
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
literally, religiously, more than I went to church.

298
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And you know what? I became more moral

299
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
because of it. I understand the concept of justice.

300
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
For all the times that I was robbed of my mini-kit,

301
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I learned the value of courage and justice.

302
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You have not explained what a mini-kit is.

303
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
A mini-kit with the concept of what I just got.

304
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It is a tiny little, it's like a little box.

305
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a little like, like, cylinder thing.

306
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I mean, I saw what it looks like.

307
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, then you get it. I'm okay.

308
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Do I? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh my god!

309
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm gonna cry right now.

310
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay, okay, now you...

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Ben, do you want the honors? Do you want the honors, Ben?

312
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I would love to. Thank you, my friend. Die.

313
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Ha ha!

314
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Alright, no, wait, no, we need that whore.

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
God damn it! You balled the door to his whore!

316
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He was too... Oh, he's back, he's back.

317
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Alright, don't worry. Okay, T9-

318
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
109-111-3000. Alright, we're gonna come over here

319
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and we're gonna fuck some fucking whores.

320
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Are you ready? Let's go to the whorehouse.

321
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Go to the brothel.

322
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He walks funny. I don't like the cut of his gym.

323
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No, listen, okay.

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You may have thought of yourself, wow, mindless.

325
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's give a third eye on his body.

326
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's just the way he likes to roll, dude.

327
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No, you...

328
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I used the force on him and I turned him and...

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, he's glowing, it's so tempting.

330
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Well, wait, who's short-haired white man and who's...

331
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm long-haired white man.

332
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm Mr. Silver right now.

333
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're Mr. Silver?

334
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, I am Mr. Silver.

335
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Look at the top right, okay. Why would you do that?

336
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll tell you right, Ben. You may have thought this game was brainless.

337
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
In fact, it is the epitome of puzzles.

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It is literally more puzzles

339
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
than any other thing in existence.

340
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Look at this, collectibles, studs.

341
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You have to use your brain to unlock secrets.

342
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

343
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

344
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Capitalism.

345
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This is literally like, better teaching you capitalism

346
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
than the society in which we live.

347
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
All right.

348
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ben's more studded.

349
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, it's gonna pick you up.

350
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Ben's more studded.

351
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He's better than studded.

352
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
All right.

353
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, no, we have to work together,

354
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
but we have to work together, okay, okay.

355
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,240
Use the force, use the force.

356
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,560
I'm using it.

357
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,400
No, you aren't.

358
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,360
You aren't doing it correctly.

359
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,240
Oh, there we go.

360
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,960
Spit out the stuff.

361
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,240
No, no, no, don't worry, it's going to lift me up.

362
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,960
And now, don't push us!

363
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
True Jedi!

364
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Oh my god!

365
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
What does it mean?

366
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
True Jedi!

367
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,320
What does it mean?

368
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,280
That means we're true Jedi, true Jedi, pure of heart men,

369
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,080
pure of heart!

370
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,560
Do we have super powers now?

371
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640
We can beat the level now.

372
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,040
Yeah.

373
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,080
Is that all it means?

374
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,640
Yeah, OK, OK.

375
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,600
All right, now check out this mini kit.

376
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,760
All right, you need to work together with me.

377
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,960
We need to put aside our differences.

378
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,640
Our mental and racial differences.

379
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,760
You know, I crossed the border begging for money

380
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,160
and you supplied like a dumbass.

381
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,960
Now it's time to mend all of our wounds.

382
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,360
Put down the hatchet.

383
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,960
We're going to bury the hatchet in this droid's fucking skull.

384
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Oh no, he shot me, dude.

385
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,840
He shot me, I'm down.

386
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,400
When you die, your studs all pop out

387
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,640
and you can lose true Jedi.

388
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,280
So we have to make sure we don't loot that shit happen.

389
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,040
Now let's fucking run through like men in black

390
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,800
or like the other men which aren't black.

391
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,560
Sorry if you're racist.

392
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,680
Are we over yet?

393
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,280
No, no, over here.

394
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,120
Can we beat the game?

395
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,360
No, no, we're sprinting.

396
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,080
We're sprinting.

397
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,960
Can we, can we be done?

398
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,160
Can we be done with it?

399
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,480
Dude, you fucked up, dude.

400
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,080
Okay.

401
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
We got a purple.

402
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,520
All right, this right here, this is only bounty hunters.

403
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,960
Oh, this is only to R2-D2.

404
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,600
We have to come here when we're doing free play.

405
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Once we unlock R2-D2 and such R4,

406
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,440
we're going to have to go back here

407
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,560
and we're going to have to unlock here this zone

408
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,840
so we can get a mini-kit that's inside here.

409
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,360
We're probably at the red power brick.

410
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,000
Red power brick, there are three collectibles.

411
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There are the studs where you use true Jedi or mini-kit.

412
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,320
So there are 10 of them in each levels.

413
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,440
There's also the red power bricks

414
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,240
and once there's one each level

415
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,960
and then they're locked here, the extras.

416
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,920
Dude, I got power up.

417
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,800
Dude, pick up power.

418
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,920
You got power up, you got purple.

419
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,360
Dude, you're killer, you're killer.

420
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,280
I'm Mace Windu.

421
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,520
I'm going to be like that.

422
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,440
I'm just putting you out of your room.

423
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,720
Tom, this game's so good, confirm.

424
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,800
There's Jar Jar.

425
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Where is Jar Jar?

426
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,640
No, no, no, no.

427
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,840
There's Jar Jar.

428
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,880
Don't worry, best game.

429
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, look, fuck Jar Jar.

430
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,920
Don't worry.

431
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,000
Dude, don't worry.

432
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,360
Because she's the cause me daddy Tusa

433
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,440
and we're going to be able to meet with her real soon.

434
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,400
Fuck yeah, all right.

435
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,560
Now I'm invested.

436
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,400
All right, now we have to build.

437
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,960
Remember, Lego bricks, remember 9-Eleven.

438
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,920
We're coming right back real soon.

439
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Oh my God, I'm floated.

440
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,000
Dude, literally.

441
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
Somehow you're ahead of me.

442
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,560
It makes me mad.

443
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,440
You're younger and richer than me.

444
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,680
And now this is me.

445
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
My two favorite things to be.

446
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,240
Ah!

447
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,120
Fuck him up.

448
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,520
Dude, don't worry, we fucked him right up.

449
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,360
Okay, look at this.

450
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,280
Whoa.

451
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,120
Oh, you fucked up.

452
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,280
You fucked it up for me.

453
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,320
You're gonna get those hybrids.

454
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,280
When does the game end?

455
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,600
There's no part of it.

456
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,080
There's no game here that isn't just collecting the studs.

457
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,360
The studs are the game.

458
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,840
Apparently.

459
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,320
So why?

460
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,760
They make a nice noise when you collect them.

461
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,440
I don't think I like being a true Jedi.

462
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,640
Now I have expectations I have to live up to.

463
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,360
No, don't worry.

464
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,240
You'll never be able to live up to the true Jedi.

465
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
Okay, put that thing, Ben.

466
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,840
We're gonna set some ground rules in this version,

467
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,320
but it's gonna work.

468
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
You're gonna need to assist me.

469
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,440
Why do my back flips?

470
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,400
Why do my parkour?

471
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,320
You're gonna need to assist me.

472
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,560
Or else I'm gonna fuck you up.

473
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,600
Or else I'm gonna beat you.

474
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,880
This is the basis of good relationship.

475
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,160
Don't want me to use the force or what.

476
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,720
Don't want to use the force or what.

477
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,320
Okay.

478
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,240
No, okay, didn't work.

479
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,720
It didn't work.

480
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,840
Nice job.

481
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,920
Nice job, asshole.

482
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,640
No, wait.

483
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,360
Okay, and you know what?

484
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,680
You're right.

485
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,120
Never mind.

486
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,760
Bye.

487
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,520
Dude.

488
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,240
Ah!

489
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,880
Oh, you got a power.

490
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,480
If you're a pig now.

491
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

492
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,000
I have to destroy the Jets.

493
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,760
Dude, the destroyers.

494
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,680
Oh, they roll.

495
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,720
Just like in the film.

496
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,280
Are you not putting a filter on the game?

497
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,680
No, why not?

498
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
No, they're just not filter on the game.

499
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,640
Are you disappointed?

500
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,120
Yeah.

501
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,720
Can I disappoint you?

502
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,360
I'm pretty disappointed in you.

503
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,320
No, listen.

504
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,160
Listen, this game is so good, you eat it twice.

505
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,080
This same game.

506
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,760
End of game.

507
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,480
This game's so good, you'll be nice.

508
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,560
Game over, please.

509
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,320
Game over, please.

510
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,800
This game's so nice, you don't make fun of it in class.

511
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,880
You ever notice that Tom and Ben are like the same?

512
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,600
Yeah, they are.

513
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,360
Feeny, beard, other.

514
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,600
Yeah.

515
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,520
That's our character.

516
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,440
No life, no skill, no game, no life.

517
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,080
That's a good one.

518
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,520
Oh, look at this guy.

519
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,480
Can I beat him?

520
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
You can't beat the biome.

521
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,320
You can do whatever you want.

522
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,880
This is like a Star Wars.

523
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,560
That's a little bit of an imagination to the audience.

524
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,800
Why can't I build?

525
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
Why can't I build new friends?

526
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,840
You can.

527
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,640
You can build.

528
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,240
You haven't been as good as it.

529
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,600
You haven't been as good as me, so you

530
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,520
don't know how to build things.

531
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,600
Look, they have the confirmed child labor in Star Wars.

532
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,480
Why'd you break it?

533
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,440
Because I fucking hate you, babe.

534
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,640
Why'd you break the conveyor belt?

535
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,440
It was moving.

536
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,840
They were going to the over here.

537
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,800
Listen, we're rich enough.

538
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,600
We don't need anymore.

539
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,120
I've said no millionaire ever.

540
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,600
Mm-hmm.

541
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,520
Let's just use the force on these things.

542
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,200
Then we're going to get through.

543
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,560
That's what I'm doing.

544
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,760
That's exactly what I'm doing.

545
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,200
Jump through?

546
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,280
Oh my god.

547
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,600
Hold on.

548
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Oh, it's definitely in a parkour.

549
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,800
He's not smart enough to do that.

550
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,120
Oh, this is one of those puzzles, right?

551
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,600
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
I've heard about these.

553
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,120
Bailey, this avenue is a secret former route.

554
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,480
How do you think, Amber?

555
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,560
So that's in my server?

556
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,360
Yeah, in your own server.

557
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,840
Don't you fucking touch my server.

558
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,200
That's my safe space, and you invaded it.

559
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,200
That's classic abuser tactics.

560
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,560
Classic.

561
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,800
Oh my god, this game is going to make me cry, dude.

562
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,520
OK, all right, the blue stuff.

563
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,160
OK, all right, Ben.

564
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
By making me play the LEGO Star Wars.

565
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,240
Ben, turn into the whore, and then make the whore button go.

566
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,000
Hey, I did it.

567
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,840
Oh yeah, in the lead.

568
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
Oh, blue stuff.

569
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,880
No, no, activate the button.

570
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,960
Activate the button.

571
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,440
What?

572
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,200
Activate the button.

573
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,080
Oh, did I do it?

574
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,960
Did I do it or what?

575
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,040
Ben, Ben, I'm rich, climax.

576
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,280
Gross.

577
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,080
So you come, man.

578
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,160
Yeah, dude, look at this.

579
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,800
You need to come.

580
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,600
Oh.

581
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Hey, anyone need to come?

582
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,360
Anyone need to come?

583
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,640
Yeah, yeah, can you pick me up sometime?

584
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,280
Yeah, there you go.

585
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,200
Hey, can you pick me up?

586
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,280
Come from the store, please.

587
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,480
Can you pick me up a Cummys?

588
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,600
Dude, free play unlocked.

589
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,040
We got one gold brick for that.

590
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,600
And guess what?

591
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,640
We got true Jedi, and the unlock of these characters.

592
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,000
We're going to get way more red bricks.

593
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
I don't understand, Munchie.

594
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
We unlocked true Jedi.

595
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,960
We unlocked a gold brick, but I still

596
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,360
feel unfulfilled in my life.

597
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,520
Oh, no, we're going to reach a million other true Jedi's.

598
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,000
Don't you fucking worry for this stud total.

599
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,520
Our stud total is going to reach the high heavens, bro.

600
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,440
Look at this, look at this.

601
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,200
All right, good time, good time.

602
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,720
Do you know, maybe this game eats so bad.

603
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,480
When we get make-up, we build LEGO sets.

604
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,800
And when we reach, ultimately, we reach a whole set.

605
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,680
Level complete.

606
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,440
True Jedi.

607
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Jesus Christ, Jesus.

608
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,760
Ben, knock it off.

609
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,280
No.

610
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,600
Knock it off.

611
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,400
That's my character.

612
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,160
Knock it off.

613
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,640
That's what separates me from Tom.

614
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,520
How would you know the difference if I wasn't vaping?

615
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,280
Knock it off.

616
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,920
Yes, he had to vaping.

617
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,720
He had to suppress and suicide.

618
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,080
He was an absentee fove.

619
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,440
Hey, autosave.

620
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,320
Hell yeah, dude.

621
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Fuck yeah.

622
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,240
Dude, this game has autosave.

623
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,720
Fuck yeah.

624
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,160
Well, this is for the future.

625
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,920
Yeah, this is a little bit of a wrap-up.

626
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,440
Yeah.

627
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,520
All right, we're getting more plot.

628
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,240
We're getting more plot.

629
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,600
OK, all right, all right.

630
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,720
OK, so there are some things happening right here.

631
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,320
Oh, god, oh, god.

632
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
There they are.

633
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Look.

634
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,200
They can't.

635
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
They think they're going to get run over.

636
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,600
They're going to get run over.

637
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,480
All right, well, that's what we're doing right now.

638
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Which one am I?

639
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:23,960
Am I those?

640
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,040
You're a walkie-talkie.

641
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
I'm the young man.

642
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,400
You're a fucking Obi-Wan, bro.

643
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,840
Die, Gungans.

644
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,240
And die.

645
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
And die, Gungans.

646
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,440
Dude, it's a jar jar.

647
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,320
Dude, I saw a jar jar.

648
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,520
No, it's just his race.

649
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
You can't say all they'll look the same.

650
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,560
Oh, it took him apart.

651
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,160
It was great.

652
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,040
It was worth it.

653
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,120
A Gungan is a Gungan.

654
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,880
You can't say it's only half of a race.

655
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,240
Half.

656
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,400
Dude, I am best friends with TJ Henry Yoshi on Twitter.

657
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,120
All right, hey, Ben, I'm going to make a hit.

658
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,960
Well, I'm going to make a hit.

659
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,720
I follow him.

660
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,280
So, yeah.

661
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,080
You follow him?

662
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,160
Does he follow back?

663
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
No.

664
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,400
Best friends, best friends.

665
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,880
Best friends.

666
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,800
That's all it takes.

667
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,880
I know this guy.

668
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,160
It's like you follow him.

669
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,600
Yeah, that's it.

670
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,240
I have a friend on the internet.

671
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,040
It's time to start the Ben St.

672
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,520
Hit piece.

673
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,440
Here's what's going to be.

674
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,480
You are a race, like a butcher.

675
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,600
No, thief, Ben.

676
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,760
You are the two other people's races.

677
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,960
I'm sick and tired of it.

678
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,480
The other day, I heard you ordering some Mexican food

679
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,760
on this phone.

680
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,680
Not cool.

681
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,760
Not OK.

682
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,840
Not all right.

683
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,040
Just because we're friends doesn't mean it's all right.

684
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,880
So I'm going to kill you now.

685
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,760
I'm stimulating their economy.

686
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,000
Why would you do that to me?

687
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,920
Look, my head is right there.

688
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
I know.

689
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,480
You stole everything I own.

690
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,560
I know I did.

691
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
Just I'm best nine.

692
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
Everything that I own is gone.

693
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,840
Thank you.

694
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,400
Hey, I want to kill that big yellow thing.

695
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,440
Six times the amount of studs that you have right now.

696
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
They stole all the studs that you killed.

697
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,080
I'm going to fucking murder him.

698
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,440
I'm going to murder him for the studs.

699
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,920
The cooperation over it.

700
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,840
It's a burst battle.

701
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,880
It's a, how are you evading my weapons?

702
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,120
Duh.

703
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,560
He's so slippery.

704
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,280
You actually gained more health from me trying to kill you.

705
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,440
That doesn't make sense.

706
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
I know.

707
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,520
I got him.

708
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,440
I got him.

709
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,200
Slimefest.

710
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,440
Slimefest 5, baby.

711
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,600
That's not how the movie went.

712
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Slimefest 5.

713
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,960
It's way more interesting.

714
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,080
I want to kill one of those big yellow pack animals.

715
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,040
Remember in episode one where we were like, no, we got to get out the studs.

716
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,520
Don't progress.

717
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,600
We got to kill one of those big yellow studs.

718
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,760
Dude, give me those studs.

719
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,560
Give me those studs.

720
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,240
Don't take those studs.

721
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
That's literally how I played this game.

722
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,440
That is actually what I did.

723
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,000
Competitive.

724
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,080
Dude, overheat this fucking bongo.

725
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Oh, damn it.

726
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
I fucking pulled him.

727
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Yeah, okay.

728
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
I get it.

729
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
I get it now.

730
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Listen, you know what?

731
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,080
This game reminded me a little bit too much of my dad, but now...

732
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Listen.

733
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Okay.

734
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Your dad can be many things.

735
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
It doesn't have to be only bad.

736
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
So let's get rid of him and my dad.

737
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
We're also good parts.

738
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Oh, dude.

739
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
Guess who it is?

740
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
No.

741
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Guess who it is?

742
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Is it Jar Jar?

743
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
She's the cause of my daddy, Tusa.

744
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Jar Jar.

745
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
She's the cause of my daddy, Tusa.

746
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
What the gentle soul he is.

747
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
She's the cause of my daddy, Tusa.

748
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
What does that mean?

749
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:17,080
It means that Jar Jar is like a frat boy BDSM ABDL kid.

750
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,080
And then he comes over to his girlfriend's house and he's like, and she says to her dad,

751
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,080
She's the cause of my daddy, Tusa, implying that when they have sexual intercourse, Jar Jar is called dad.

752
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
We both immediately go to kill him.

753
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Get the fuck back here.

754
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
You know these folks.

755
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
Get the fuck back here.

756
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
She's...

757
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
What's the one that can fly?

758
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
Uh, the nun.

759
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
It's a nun.

760
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Yeah.

761
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Thinking of that nun from that one show.

762
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
I forget what it's called.

763
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Rocko's Martin Life?

764
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
It's about a nun that can fly.

765
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Okay.

766
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
That's what I was asking about.

767
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Thanks.

768
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
Rocko's Martin?

769
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
No, it's me.

770
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
It's me.

771
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
But it's just me.

772
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
It's just me.

773
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Oh, it was you?

774
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
Oops.

775
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Sorry.

776
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
You just looked really upsetting.

777
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
It made me mad.

778
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
She's mad.

779
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
She's so hot.

780
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
We switch characters.

781
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Yeah, it's not a she.

782
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
But you know what?

783
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
Yeah.

784
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Well, she's the cause of my daddy, Tusa.

785
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Yeah.

786
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
No.

787
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
Jar Jar is the kid.

788
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
Jar Jar is the foot job kid.

789
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
No, she's so hot.

790
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Foot job kid.

791
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Is she topless, dude?

792
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Yeah, dude.

793
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
No, you dumb fuck.

794
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
No, you have to make it.

795
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
You have to make things right.

796
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
You have to make things right.

797
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
I'm trying.

798
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
I can't get back up.

799
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,080
These pulses are out of the world, man.

800
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
I can't get back up.

801
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Ben, you're literally like ruining my life right now.

802
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
I can't get back up.

803
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
I'm sorry.

804
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Oh, there we go.

805
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Wow.

806
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
It's almost like I didn't fucking do anything.

807
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
You dumb.

808
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
And I couldn't do it.

809
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,080
That somehow I just couldn't manage it.

810
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
Jesus.

811
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
This is the simplest of tasks.

812
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
This is like this.

813
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
I died.

814
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
You know what?

815
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
You know what?

816
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
This is the most let's play episode of our escape.

817
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,080
This is going to be the most like, you know, last thing we're talking about fucking taxes

818
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
and we're talking about fucking aspirations.

819
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,400
Sometimes you've got to fucking chill out and just reminisce about how great fucking video

820
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
games are.

821
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
And with this, literally the best game ever.

822
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
This is the for better.

823
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Only.

824
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Only banner hunters can do this.

825
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
It's part of these studs.

826
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
All right.

827
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Hell yeah, dude.

828
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Dude.

829
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Like three of those were blue.

830
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
All right.

831
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Are we whores?

832
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Question and answer.

833
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Answer.

834
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Yes.

835
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Because we get so many studs.

836
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Just imagine their twitch bits.

837
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Where are the mini kids at?

838
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Where are the mini kids at?

839
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Just imagine their twitch bits and get excited.

840
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Oh God.

841
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
I dropped so many.

842
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Thousands of bits.

843
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Help me.

844
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Where's our true?

845
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Where's our true Jedi meters?

846
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
You're fucking up.

847
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
There.

848
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
No, no, no.

849
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Look, I fixed it.

850
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Look, I made everything right.

851
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
This is the only part of the game I remember.

852
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Yeah.

853
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Okay.

854
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
This is those moss.

855
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
This is totally Kazikor.

856
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Oh, Kazisnap.

857
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Kazisnap.

858
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
It's Snepkor.

859
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Hey.

860
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Hey.

861
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Hey.

862
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Hey.

863
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Are you able to get fucking Snap in Endless War?

864
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
I mean, A.K., let's go start with Complete Saga.

865
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Because you're going to need to get it real soon.

866
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Because you're fucking proper.

867
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
I know.

868
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
That was my plan all along.

869
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
You can Snap in fucking Endless War.

870
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Dude, we got to put Snap in Endless War.

871
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
We should literally put it.

872
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Dude, look at this.

873
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
This is limited to the jail.

874
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
It's food stamps.

875
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
We need food stamps in Endless War.

876
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
No.

877
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Okay.

878
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Hold on for a second.

879
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Hold on.

880
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
I did do that.

881
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
I did.

882
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Hold on.

883
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Dude.

884
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I can't hear it.

885
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
You can.

886
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
No.

887
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Turn that shit up, y'all.

888
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Get the hell ahead, dude.

889
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,400
I mean, we'll shut up next time so you can hear it.

890
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
I heard it the first time, but I wasn't impressed.

891
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
It doesn't sound.

892
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
No, it's so cool.

893
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Oh, Ben.

894
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
You're so fucking terrible.

895
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
You make me want to kill myself.

896
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
How does that keep happening?

897
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
How do I...

898
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Oh!

899
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Ben!

900
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
You dumb fuck!

901
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
I'm better than this.

902
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm better than this.

903
00:25:30,400 --> 00:26:00,400
The only reason I die is because Ben who can't protect me for shit and I can't attack is Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,600
Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar No Your Next Video

905
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,120

Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar OD Jar Jar

907
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:28,640
Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar

908
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,720
That's a BA, aka an abbreviation of Boba Vacchina, merged with Basics, some BA6 from a book entitled

909
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,880
BA6, which is formatted like the Holy Bible, aka 3 colon 7, talking about how we have to

910
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,560
have real actual revolution in the United States.

911
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,400
Was real actual revolution actually entailed, as opposed to fake revolution, as opposed

912
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,880
to the revolution you hear about on TV, it's all a fad.

913
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,600
Listen, I'm telling you right now, real actual revolution has come to the United States.

914
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
How did you get up there?

915
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I want to get up there.

916
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
You double jump, bitch.

917
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
I'm double jumping.

918
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
I'm double jumping.

919
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Don't, don't help him.

920
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
If he's not Jar Jar Binks.

921
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
I wouldn't ever say that.

922
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
But I want it.

923
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
I want it.

924
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
I want it.

925
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
I don't worry.

926
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,600
I won't tell Ben that he can never get up here unless he's Jar Jar Binks.

927
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Thanks to you.

928
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Unless he used a double jump.

929
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
No.

930
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Why is Jar Jar such a good jumper?

931
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Because don't you remember the movie?

932
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
It's not a she.

933
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
The Breastices.

934
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Isn't there a thing?

935
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
He speaks funny.

936
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
He jumps good.

937
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Look at her Breastices.

938
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Isn't her sticking out of her Lego form?

939
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Isn't that part of like the Jar Jar is a simpler theory that like there's a part where Jar Jar jumps

940
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
really high and if people theorize that he could only do it if he had zip powers?

941
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Yeah.

942
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Is that when he like dives into the water and does like a triple flip and then he's weird?

943
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Okay.

944
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,840
You know that feel when you're like talking about Pokemon with someone and then they use

945
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,840
a gendered pronoun so you know they want to have sex with them?

946
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Yeah.

947
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Yeah.

948
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
That's all, that's all Kazi has.

949
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Yeah, that's all you.

950
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
When I talk about Terran and I say I love her.

951
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Kazi only talks about Pokemon that she calls she.

952
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
Well, no.

953
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,840
I talk about Pokemon that are fuckable and call them he like Floatsoul.

954
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Yeah.

955
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
Floatsoul.

956
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
Everyone's favorite.

957
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
Out of everybody you could have been.

958
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
That's the most fuckable Pokemon.

959
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,840
Everyone's favorite Pokewifu Floatsoul.

960
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Yeah, okay.

961
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Well, that I understand.

962
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,840
We have a big problem here.

963
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,840
I'm not into that group shit.

964
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Magnemite?

965
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Magnemite, but not magneton.

966
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
What the fuck do you see in magneton?

967
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Not magneton.

968
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
I don't do foursome.

969
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
I'll give you threesome.

970
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
That's fine.

971
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
I want two magnemites.

972
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
No more.

973
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,840
What's the one, what's the two headed dinosaur?

974
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Are you thinking of giraffe or egg?

975
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,840
No, two headed dinosaur gen five.

976
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
Oh, durate.

977
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
Durate.

978
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Hydraga.

979
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Hydraga.

980
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
Hydraga, but the second one.

981
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
Twinsoul.

982
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,840
That one's fine because that one only has two heads.

983
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Fuck, what's the second one called?

984
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Twin dragon.

985
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Double headed dragon man.

986
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Double headed dragon man.

987
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Double headed dragon man.

988
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
That one's cool.

989
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
That one's got like an emo haircut.

990
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
Dude, all right, we're about to be boss nests.

991
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,840
We're about to meet boss nests first of all.

992
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
You failed so hard.

993
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Look at myself compared to yours.

994
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
You're the reason why you need a true Jedi.

995
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
I fucking hate you, Ben.

996
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
I fucking hate you.

997
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
It's because I kept falling off ledges.

998
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
This doesn't count for anything.

999
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
You're so fucking dumb.

1000
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Look at this.

1001
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,840
If you had to be raped by Pokemon, which one would it be?

1002
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Look against my will?

1003
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,840
That's what the word implies, yes.

1004
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
It could choose, yeah.

1005
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
You don't get to choose.

1006
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
He wants the fuck, Jinx.

1007
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Yeah, I do.

1008
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
That's very racist.

1009
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
That's very racist of you.

1010
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,840
She's super effective against Rekweza because she's an ice type.

1011
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
A nice type?

1012
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Why would you want to fucking ice type?

1013
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Because it's super effective against Rekweza.

1014
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
We failed.

1015
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
We're not true Jedi.

1016
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Your fault.

1017
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Look at you.

1018
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Dude, we fucked up.

1019
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Dude, we lost.

1020
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,840
We lost the game.

1021
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
We lost.

1022
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
It's your fault, Ben.

1023
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
I'm sorry that we weren't good enough.

1024
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
No.

1025
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
We couldn't make it.

1026
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
No.

1027
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
We just couldn't make it happen.

1028
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
You boy jinked four.

1029
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
You boy jinked.

1030
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Boy jinked?

1031
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Boy jinked?

1032
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
This game's putting me to sleep.

1033
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Wait, they're off.

1034
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
We're making that fun.

1035
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
Yeah, sure.

1036
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
I can behind that.

1037
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Can you pass me my fucking whore juice right there?

1038
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Hell yeah, juice.

1039
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
I'm not getting...

1040
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Oh, actually, yeah.

1041
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
I guess...

1042
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
Yes, dude.

1043
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
I'm not cracking the mic.

1044
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Crack that fucking shit with stone juice.

1045
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Kidney stone juice?

1046
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
It's just concentrated kidney stone.

1047
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
No.

1048
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Maybe.

1049
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Hey, Ben.

1050
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Can I ask you a question?

1051
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Yeah.

1052
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Can I ask you a question?

1053
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Yeah, bro.

1054
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,840
How long have you been spending on that dumb bitch juice?

1055
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Ever since.

1056
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Ever since my discovery.

1057
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Ever since I discovered it at Aldi.

1058
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
All right.

1059
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
And nothing was ever the same.

1060
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,840
You're crazy for thinking that tastes like Bangkok candy.

1061
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
Bangkok candy is so much more potent and so much more flavorful.

1062
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Wait, which one tastes like Bangkok candy?

1063
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
It's the same.

1064
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840
No, it's completely different.

1065
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Is there a Rockstar cotton candy?

1066
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Yeah, yeah.

1067
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Rockstar experience.

1068
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
I haven't had the Bangkok candy.

1069
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
He wants the sobby, obvious, scientific fact.

1070
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
I'll try it.

1071
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,840
That's munchies, but I don't know if he's going to drink it.

1072
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Oh, it smells so good.

1073
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
No, you can have a sip, bro.

1074
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,840
I don't want this at all.

1075
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
It's similar, but not identical.

1076
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Hold on.

1077
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Let me see.

1078
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
You have so many different ends.

1079
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
You can drink to your bed.

1080
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Holy shit.

1081
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Well, that was mine.

1082
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
That was his...

1083
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
I've been collecting them.

1084
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
I gave him that one.

1085
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
I gave him that one.

1086
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
But that one's mine.

1087
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
This one's mine.

1088
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,840
I've been collecting them so that I can smash them on screen.

1089
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Dude, this smells like a cotton candy.

1090
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Oh, fuck!

1091
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,840
I just wanted to be mad at the smashed sour apple.

1092
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
That smells like a cotton candy and gogurt.

1093
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Ben, have you considered like PCP or just cocaine or anything else?

1094
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Have I considered PCP on a daily fucking basis, dude?

1095
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,840
I would never associate with a PCP.

1096
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
I wouldn't fuck with that.

1097
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Is it a PINE or a MEP habit?

1098
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,840
I think I would probably be very well suited to a co-cab, though.

1099
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
I'm gonna vomit.

1100
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,840
I like I love this, but I'm going to throw up at the same time.

1101
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
This is highly controlled.

1102
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Well, it just makes me think of cotton candy and gogurt, which is really good.

1103
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
Yeah.

1104
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
But then it's also like an energy...

1105
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Ooh, ooh.

1106
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Yeah, yeah.

1107
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
Oh, no.

1108
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Oh, damn.

1109
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Schedule an Uber.

1110
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
What the hell?

1111
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Schedule an Uber.

1112
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
I had no idea that you can schedule an Uber.

1113
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Makes sense.

1114
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Okay, so I do that?

1115
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,840
You can press a button to say, don't talk to me.

1116
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Really?

1117
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
Can you really?

1118
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Yeah, you're rolling another feature.

1119
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
There's also the bus.

1120
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
You don't have to either.

1121
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Well, I mean, it's like, it's the reason.

1122
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
There is the bus.

1123
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Well, if you take the bus, you have to transfer to the train.

1124
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
All right, so where are you going to, Tom?

1125
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
Where are you going?

1126
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Back Bay.

1127
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Back Bay?

1128
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Okay.

1129
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Crack Bay.

1130
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Crack Bay.

1131
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
You're going...

1132
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Okay.

1133
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
Where?

1134
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
I mean, are you going to the station?

1135
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
No, I'm just at Back Bay is on the computer.

1136
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Back to where I'm going.

1137
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Oh, damn.

1138
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
So it's one step, it's a little cheaper to go one step.

1139
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Okay.

1140
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,840
All right, Back Bay MTA bus station.

1141
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
Okay.

1142
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,840
Is that where you guys met up?

1143
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
No, I've been firing this.

1144
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Schedule.

1145
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
What the fuck?

1146
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
What the fuck?

1147
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Um...

1148
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Oh, okay.

1149
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
Win?

1150
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Win?

1151
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,840
Win?

1152
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Do you want it?

1153
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Um...

1154
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Sure.

1155
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Sure.

1156
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
This is a weird clock.

1157
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Yeah, I know.

1158
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
I don't know if I like it.

1159
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
All right, 7.15 to 7.25.

1160
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,840
If anybody wants to kill me, now you know where I'll be.

1161
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Now's the time.

1162
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,840
It's vulnerable.

1163
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Yeah.

1164
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
All right.

1165
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Schedule and you'll ride.

1166
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Schedule and you'll ride.

1167
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Get in town and I'll go the fuck out of here.

1168
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Dude, Princess Naboo just got exploded.

1169
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Princess Naboo.

1170
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
There are studs in that plant.

1171
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Go left.

1172
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Yeah, but I can't get them because I don't have them.

1173
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Hell yeah, dude.

1174
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
I'm not a Jedi.

1175
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Hell fucking yeah.

1176
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
I'm not a Jedi, so I can't interact with this stuff.

1177
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Where the fuck am I?

1178
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
What's happening?

1179
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Who are you?

1180
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Who are you?

1181
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm Queen Amidala.

1182
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Queen Amidabada.

1183
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
I'm Queen Amidabada.

1184
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
I'm Queen Amidabada.

1185
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Queen Amidabada.

1186
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:23,840

it's from life!

1189
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,400
It's from the proud culture of Native American DNA Indians

1190
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,200
I always assumed that what it was from was that you made a comic back in The Pony Days where Spike is looking at rarity

1191
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,160
a habadabadabadabadabadabadabadeee

1192

00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:23,300
Oh yeah i know you can do that, but it does seem like that could be the case in another lifetime

1195
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,780
Absolutely, you can see it in his eyes. He's got the glint in his eyes just for me talking about

1196
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,420
No, spare he's not freaking spare he's normal in Christian. It's my purpose. It's my purpose

No, we lose we lose studs every single time well, then well, okay, all right

1206
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,620
Yeah, of course, dude, it's it's about a mindset. It's all about the frame

1207
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,160
You see like a fucking dumb ass whore how about that?

1208
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:48,560
We can't interact with anything and we can't build the blocks we're fucked. Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself. It's so pitiful being not a Jedi

1209
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Yeah

1210
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,440
She must she must just like Jar Jar Binks

1211
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,080
Better if you can believe it far far if you can believe it then Jedi Binks

1212
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080

God, what a terrible fate we can't interact with anything

1217
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Stop that

00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,320

Yeah, well, no, no, no, no, this is definitely gonna be a series where we do the entire thing

1221
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,960
We might not we're probably gonna do it on one thing does it would take literal hours

1222
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
No, well, we progress to be a

1223
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Via bridge

Let's tell yeah

1245
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:06,980
Let's talk about what flavors I made really fucking good, okay best one that you made was the lemon poppy seeds

1246
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,980
I agree

1247
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:14,620
We enter your household just looking to you know bang some sluts instead of any women, which was fine

1248
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:21,380
We found we found some keto doughnuts. Yeah, and when they were in that and you were making them you were scrounging up materials from raw

1249
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,220
From raw earth trying to create them

1250
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,100
Drunk enough so we could witness your science and we were able to watch you go to fucking town

1251
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:40,220
Some keto don'ts and was truly magical to watch you in your kitchen scooping up blackberries

1252
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:44,780
You crush them in your hands and throwing the containers into the batter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah meat flavor

1253
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,020
Okay, we're talking about how you made a meat flavor of don't make you don't play

1254
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:53,940
Listen, I was I was experimenting with the recipe. I tried putting blackberry and some it didn't come out great, you know

1255
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,860
I that's that's just I bit into the blackberry keto doughnut literally tasted like a steak like a fucking

1256
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,860
I don't agree

1257
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,220
It was like a chewy skirt steak

1258
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,220
It was like a chewy skirt steak that that keto doughnut

1259
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,140
Hadn't said that it tasted like me. I would have just eaten it and been like, yeah, okay

1260
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,460
But since you said this tastes like me, I've been into it. I was like

1261
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,900
If it tasted like me that was your expecting to meet

1262
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,900
Thank you, thank you very much for noticing my joke

1263
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500

1266
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:50,420
Yeah, it is well, it's it's on your when you're doing a flip jump you do the ground pound otherwise you just do like an air slash

1267
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:58,620
The air slash combo. Whoa, I broke it for more money. Yeah, dude. Don't what are you? What are you doing inside of here?

1268
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,300
Is oh my god, you fucking that wasn't even on purpose, but I'm glad I did it

1269
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,940
All right inside of here. There is a dangerous thing. Cool. Is it me? Yeah

1270
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,420
Well, there's an ancient evil. Oh in the actually sorry in this one. There's an ancient evil

1271
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,260
There's an ancient evil century is old. How do you get it? I don't know

1272
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,140
But there is it sits only so we won't be able to interact with it anyway

1273
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,740
What was the point but the point is you're wasting my time to let you know that your kinship is in there

1274
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:33,300
My mom called me. I gotta call my mommy. Did you go on stream on on on recording? Oh, I'm already calling her. We got to call mo vlogs

Okay, why are they like rotating and then explode?

1282
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,260
I don't think this game values my time very much. I don't think this game that's cat and Panenka

1283
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,700
Did you see that? Did you see that combo attack we did? We both value studs. We both yeah

1284
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,140
Yeah, oh god. No, we just value studs. It teaches you it teaches you that the mom value studs

1285
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,580
At the end of the day, it's all it's all about the studs

1286
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,060
And if you think about the game we're doing so but okay, you are you are just

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,120
We have to beat we have to beat Bulber

1394
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,280
Yes

1395
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,360
We can't and until we beat the ball best the best no listen to Bulba will face the fears

1396
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,800
No, no, oh my god, okay, okay, Ben you have to fucking be proficient or I'm gonna go fast

1397
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,600
No, you just get this you have to get in the speed bumps you get in the speed bumps green arrow green arrow

1398
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,120
That seems that seems pretty that seems pretty straightforward. Tom. You're always like a pure kid

1399
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,040
You're a fucking like weird pure tin beliefs like oh fucking don't cheat on your wife. Oh

1400
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,680
Don't comment on YouTube videos

1401
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,760
ever

1402
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,680
We're not getting through the fuck well when us this pod race. I don't think I doubt it

1403
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:50,720
Wait, there's a secret. No, you dumb fuck. No, you don't fuck secret cave. No

1404
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,880
I saw it. It's all about that speed need for speed need for speed

1405
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,600
I can't tell what I'm going fast when I'm going slow. They feel the same. That's fine

1406
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,960
Okay, we have to get through we have to get through you can't even jump in this game

1407
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,960
No, no, you can you can been you're all over the place right now. You're all over the place. Come on. Oh, yeah

1408
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,640
Yeah, I'm just going where I need to be. I'm going over the green

1409
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,200
Impossible he's about to win right now. Are you just impossible literally?

1410
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,960
Did we just like just wondering about that? How are you supposed to hit every single speed?

1411
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,320
I think so. I have no I like this was trying to go through. Did we just do really bad in the first two laps?

1412
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,720
No, no, no, you're just really bad at this game. Oh, okay. No, no, no, I

1413
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:36,400
Hope so when we have two people we're more likely to bump in each other and reset our acceleration to zero

1414
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,800
Also, we're more likely if you're a bad player aka Ben, then you're gonna hit all the road stop to make us lose

1415
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,320
It's all your fucking fault. Don't mess with myself. Yeah

1416
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,840
No, no one can play besides me. This is our scams. It's gonna be me playing the game. I wish also Ben

1417
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:58,800
I have an admission. Yeah, I did take that percussa and I do feel good. Why can't believe you took my fucking percussa

1418
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,040
I like we go we go so much. I do we go so much faster once we fucking go once you're not here, Ben

1419
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,680
All right, don't take any more. I mean, I'm gonna need that if I ever get another kidney stone

1420
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,040
Should I have asked my mom to say something on speakerphone? Yes, you should know $10 if you want man

1421
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,360
I don't think a one of those worth $10 on the street. Hell. Yeah, dude. Oh, well

1422
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,120
Then drop out right

1423
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,160
Enjoy

1424
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,080
Have a great time

1425
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,320
Hit the green hit green green is good. Yeah, green is good

1426
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,080
Yeah

1427
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:43,120
It's just hitting no no not hitting anything else. It's it's a fucking cargo Star Wars, dude

1428
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,640
Probably have to hit that right slow. That seems cute. No, no, no

1429
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,640
Choice. No, it does the choice, but we can't access it because we're not a tie fighter

1430
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,520
We have to be impurely aligned if we want to access that part of the game

1431
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,600
Damn

1432
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,120
All right, hit this one hit this one. I hit this one. Yes

1433
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:11,000
Your yes, is that forward green arrow? Is that subolva? Yeah. Yeah, you're so far behind. I know

1434
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
No, listen, no, we can do it

1435
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,640
Hold on

1436
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,880
No, no, we can't do this. I know we can't there's a tie fighter thing right there

1437
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,360
Look, we're gonna crash. We do it. It's for if you're a tie fighter

1438
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,240
You come back in free mode. If you come back in free play mode, you're able to lock in the game

1439
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,800
It's high fighter

1440
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,040
No, that won't help us because we get more if we go this way

1441
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,920
It's all about the amount that we get we have to maximize the amount that we get

1442
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,680
No

1443
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,800
No, okay, I think it's impossible to I think it's impossible to player

1444
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,960
The second

1445
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:53,880
So bad Tom does it not feel like the game just plays itself. It's a very little it feels like you're not really doing it

1446
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,960
I kind of got the sense of like, you know when you give your little brother

1447
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,760
There's no we voted you just press the buttons. It's like that

1448
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,440

Want to restart it's only single player only single player

1451
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,640
Why is this a game state? Why is this a game state?

1452
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:42,120
No, don't worry. Don't worry game over. I'm gonna steep state of mind. No right now. Okay. My my adrenaline is pounding

No, guys, we're gonna bring it down. We're gonna talk about emotion right now. We're just gonna talk about what we've been doing

1459
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,080

Okay, okay, now you maybe now you may get the privilege of playing more like a star

1468
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,000
Perfect detector. We need to take where the power bricks are that will help us in our journey

1469
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,880
But we'll be able to be located all the power bricks in each of the levels in which we encounter them pretty good

1470
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,800
That's gonna be fucking

1471
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,400

Too much kindness in my heart, but literally you can be the farming master

1492
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:59,000
It'll take no commitment whatsoever farming farming is farming master farming is powerful and

1493
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,440
Emotionally rewarding. Yeah. Yeah, and and hard ass fucking work that you have to do on your hands

And he's probably and what and when do you put your hand on the slime cork mill and I said just a hand mill

1495
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,280
But on like the crank where you put your hands there's spikes that drain slime from you

1496
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,720
And you have to crank it over and over and over again to use

1497
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:27,000
Trap on you. Yeah, suckin suckin out of your veins. You know, you're really out of your wall. It's hard. So all right, Ben

01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,600
But oh

1501
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,640
There's a point. No, there is a clear

1502
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,560
Overlining goal when it comes to this game. This game is hints. This game. Yeah

1503
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,860
This game the point of it is

1504
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:59,600
To grind and grind reach that one hundred percent and to achieve that you gotta get through Jedi

1516
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,400
My entire life used to be unlocking the characters in lego star wars

Dude, that's literally the entire reason that feel when you like okay

1518
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,360
You see a character in a cutscene and then you think yourself that character so cool

1519
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,320
I love Darth Maul. Darth Maul so well designed and also well developed

1520
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,600
Give me the phone

1523
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,680
But I like I like sprinted at the door like really fast like excited to see crack in the jeep

1524
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,240
But instead of cracking in the jeep behind him

1525
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,720
There was like a van with like four ladies in it that just like stared at me and we're like what the hell are you doing?

1526
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,720
Because I like ran outside and I looked really expectedly at the street. We take the palace

1527
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:30,240
I think those women are like buying the house across the street or something. I think that's what their deal is

1528
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,520
I think they might not be buying it anymore. Ben. How did you found?

1529
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,000
How'd you make it the way that you did today? Like I like you just walked in you just

Okay, that might be funny. Tom is probably done. Is it time for you to take it? Oh

1554
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,040
I had prior to the only

1555
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:43,120
Way we're able to play this game is because of these xbox controllers that tom got us

1556
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,560
So the tom is the reason why you're why you're watching this

1557
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,440
Tom is the reason why I have to suffer through lego star wars

1558
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:54,080
Kergo star wars the complete surger is the best game ever made. Okay. Wow

1559
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,560
We'll leave it up to the people to decide on that. Yes phone in the comments on whether you killed tom or munchie first

01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,240

Give me my phone. Where's my phone? Oh, there's my phone and the fucking garbage

1575
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:13,280
You're a fucking garbage, man. You're a fucking garbage. You're off screen. I say by the way, and then I start eating garbage

1576
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,640
Ow, I got shot four times. But there was a reason I was eating garbage. See, I was depressed

1577
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,320
And suicidal and suicidal

1578
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,280
It was no, I thought there was someone

1579
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,520
Yeah, dude, I think you're chinese ghost money back. It's a japanese ghost

1580
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,400
Oh my god

1581
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,800
Was that a japanese ghost? I think that was a japanese ghost. Yeah, like like you do

1582
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,200
I can't believe you have so many fucking supernatural spirits

1583
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:46,880
You had the sun god apollo enter and then the japanese ghost made his appearance. Where did apollo go?

1584
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,880
He just ate my perks

1585
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,880
Classic apollo move

1586
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,920
Okay

1587
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,160
What's up with you and sun gods, bin?

1588
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,120
Well, you know, I just think that

1589
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,800
I say, well, I'm a rain god. I'm a rain god. I never tell you about never tell you about

1590
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,120

1591
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,920
It's it's it's definitely it's definitely caroline. Yeah, I'm in cassey. No

1592
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,360
Yeah, no problem cassey snap

1593
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:25,200
By the way, stupid bin, I haven't tell you about brain for breakfast. Tell me more. I'm interested

1594
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,920
It was this youtuber that I followed and he said something that reminded me of him. He was no mo vlogs

1595
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,120
He was no mo vlogs. Unfortunately the the the truest gym of all

1596
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,600
Uh, I want to be r2d2

1597
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,280
Well, he's uh dead

1598
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:46,800
So, oh my god, that's fine. Do r2d2 you got a point? No response!

1599
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:53,840
I don't know. What are you even talking about? Oh, but you know, not not like dad isn't he doesn't come to me like dad isn't like he has

1600
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:00,240
Yeah, yeah, who's dead? Who's dead? So this this this youtuber I used to follow he died

1601
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,400
I think I told I think I said in the pcp chat and you responded like it was a long time ago

1602
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,440
Anyway, it was this educational youtuber. It was like he used a pole in the ball. Which is very nice

1603
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,200
How do I use this spot? You have a gun guy. You have to be a gun girl

1604
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,920
Well, I don't want to. Okay, that's fine. I just want to be r2d2 and any fucking I I just woke up one day

1605
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,720
I saw my recommended and I don't need boss nas

1606
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:27,600
You can you can be him once we get back to the cantina. Well, I try it and then it made me be this idiot

1607
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Well, we have to do in free play

1608
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,520
So if you ever want to come back and replay level, which I know that you would love to do

1609
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:40,240
Nothing would please me more than to do this all over again. Exactly. So we're only 100% don't worry. I'll play as the cop killer

1610
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,200
Yeah, hell yeah, you're gonna be the new cop killer real soon

1611
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,680
Actually, now I regret that because I'm going to fall asleep if I don't have something in my hands

1612
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:52,160
Okay, what are the controls for this game? What uh, it's it's up. It's upright left and b

1613
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,280

1614
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,480
Hold on. You have to get up here. We have to progress. You have to progress to get

1615
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,720
Up here

1616
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,960
Yeah

1617
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,640
It's a gun. Okay up here. It's a little stung. It's a little stung. It's a little stung on here up here

1618
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,200
Click on this click on this click on this click on this click on this yeah

1619
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,800
Anyway, he was this educational YouTuber that I loved, and he was the best in the game.

1620
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,520
He was literally my favorite YouTuber in the genre, in fact, probably of all time.

1621
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,080
And I loved watching his videos, and he was like, he was a young man, right?

1622
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,160
He was a small YouTuber.

1623
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,720
I think he was at like 300k, so like, not like nothing or anything, but he was like,

1624
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,720
you could tell.

1625
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:41,800
You know, it's a big pond, you can hover, you can hover.

1626
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,760
It was like, you knew who was going to rise to greatness.

1627
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,360
Just like all female video games characters, you can float, like R2-D2.

1628
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,360
Exactly.

1629
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,360
You knew that he was going to achieve greatness.

1630
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,360
And then he fucking straight up just died out of nowhere.

1631
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,360
Is it?

1632
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,360
It's pretty hot.

1633
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,360
Well, I can switch it to AC.

1634
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,360
I can steal, I can steal, I can steal from you outside.

1635
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,360
I don't believe that this is a gun.

1636
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:12,360
It's not literally a gun, but it's in every practical sense.

1637
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,360
Oh, I think maybe I should go to the left.

1638
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,360
Why?

1639
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,360
Why?

1640
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,360
That's, why would you do that?

1641
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:22,360
Well, I mean, you know, sometimes you're intuition is right, but not always.

1642
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,360
Oh my god, all I wanted was to fucking die.

1643
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:31,360
We gotta get, oh my god, look at our true Jedi.

1644
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,360
We shouldn't even try.

1645
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,360
We're not going to get it.

1646
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,360
No?

1647
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,360
No, we're not going to get it.

1648
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,360
There's no way.

1649
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,360
What?

1650
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,360
Look at how little we have.

1651
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,360
With my dedication to the fucking silver bullet.

1652
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,360
You will never be a true Jedi.

1653
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,360
This was your last chance.

1654
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,360
No, listen, we're about to defeat the Phantom Menace right now.

1655
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,360
That's not true.

1656
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,360
Yeah, we are.

1657
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,360
Wait, really?

1658
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,360
Yes, you dumb fuck.

1659
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,360
What was the Phantom Menace?

1660
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,360
I'm not playing this game.

1661
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,360
I think I'm pretty sure I never actually played LEGO Star Wars my entire life.

1662
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,360
I think I only ever watched those people playing it.

1663
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,360
That's, I mean, that's fine.

1664
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,360
That's really, you get, you get a lot out of it anyway.

1665
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,360
I want the blue one.

1666
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,360
I want the blue one.

1667
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,360
I want the blue one.

1668
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,360
I want the blue one.

1669
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,360
I want the blue one.

1670
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,360
I want the blue one.

1671
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,360
I want the blue one.

1672
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,360
I want the blue one.

1673
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,360
What?

1674
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,360
You're not allowed to show feet on Twitch.

1675
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,360
Really?

1676
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,360
Yeah.

1677
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,360
This isn't Twitch though.

1678
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,360
There's no rules.

1679
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,360
There's no fucking rules.

1680
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,360
Wait, are you serious?

1681
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,360
Yeah.

1682
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,360
Why?

1683
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,360
They would turn into like a...

1684
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,360
Yeah.

1685
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,360
Because there's too many...

1686
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,360
Click on this.

1687
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,360
Click on this.

1688
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:32,360
There's too many foot dudes on Twitch and if you show feet then like it's basically porn.

1689
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,360
Caroline's a private.

1690
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,360
What?

1691
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,360
The sketchbook?

1692
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,360
Uh, I mean, you know...

1693
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,360
I've seen it.

1694
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,360
Go up.

1695
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,360
Go open it.

1696
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,360
I've seen it.

1697
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,360
There's no tits.

1698
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,360
Oh, sad.

1699
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,360
Oh, how embarrassing.

1700
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,360
There's no tits.

1701
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,360
How embarrassing.

1702
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,360
There's no tits right here.

1703
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,360
There's no tits where?

1704
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,360
I've seen them.

1705
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,360
Right here.

1706
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,360
Oh, I didn't draw that.

1707
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,360
But there's...

1708
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,360
It doesn't count.

1709
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,360
There is tits in there probably.

1710
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,360
Well, apparently, yeah.

1711
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,360
Yeah.

1712
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,360
You've established that.

1713
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,360
A two-draw long-legged horseman.

1714
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,360
No!

1715
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,360
Don't read it.

1716
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,360
You can't...

1717
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,360
Okay, you can look at things but you can't read it.

1718
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,360
Two-draw?

1719
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,360
It's like a to-do list.

1720
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,360
Yeah.

1721
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,360
Draw a long-legged horseman.

1722
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,360
Don't look.

1723
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,360
Don't forget.

1724
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,360
Don't forget about the long-legged horseman.

1725
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,360
Look at these bubbles.

1726
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,360
Look at these fucking bubbles.

1727
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,360
It tastes like forget things that I like to draw.

1728
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,360
In beauty.

1729
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,360
In every single fucking...

1730
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,360
Can I not be this motherfucker?

1731
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,360
Yeah.

1732
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,360
Yeah.

1733
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,360
Go up to another person.

1734
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,360
Go up to anyone.

1735
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1736
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1737
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1738
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,360
What?

1739
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,360
And do what?

1740
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,360
Press Y.

1741
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,360
Press Y.

1742
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1743
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1744
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1745
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1746
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1747
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1748
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1749
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1750
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1751
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1752
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1753
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1754
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1755
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1756
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1757
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1758
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1759
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,360
Captain戦士.

1760
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1761
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1762
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1763
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1764
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1765
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1766
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1767
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1768
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1769
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,360
Captain Pinocchio.

1770
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,360
What do you say about that?

1771
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,580
ClassicHALE.

1772
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:05,780
Hellobaby?

1773
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,360
Is itching for die for?

1774
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,360
Ohhhh!

1775
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,360
Bidna small dick play!

1776
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,360
Welcome back to Seder Dick Reviews.

1777
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,360
We're gonna compare the top 10 Seder Dicks.

1778
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,360
Hey, speaking of our actual show, like what we actually do like no joke for real.

1779
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,360
Uh-huh.

1780
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,360
The Monsters?

1781
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,360
I'm sorry.

1782
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,360
The Rockstar?

1783
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,360
Pretty good.

1784
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,360
Pretty good.

1785
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,360
Not a good thing, but like surprisingly, like Rockstar didn't fuck up.

1786
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,360
Rockstar ex-durance.

1787
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,360
Yeah, like despite their history of being the absolute worst swill you can buy.

1788
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,360
And there's some swill you can get.

1789
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,360
And there's some swill.

1790
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,360
But Rockstar ex-durance?

1791
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,360
It's a good line.

1792
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
It's a good series.

1793
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,360
I think the cotton candy is just as good as the bank cotton candy.

1794
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,360
I don't think so, but you know what?

1795
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,360
That's fun.

1796
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,360
Oh my fucking god!

1797
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,360
Also, I just like that it's blue.

1798
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,360
Uh, yeah, it's like, it's weird to me.

1799
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,360
I don't know who did it first, actually.

1800
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:05,360
I always say that people are ripping off Bang, but I don't know if Bang was not even the progenitor of it.

1801
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,360
It just felt that way, because I learned about it in that order.

1802
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,360
Hey, Caroline?

1803
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,360
Yeah, what's up?

1804
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,360
You're gay.

1805
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,360
Stop!

1806
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,360
You're going some other way.

1807
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,360
Come over here.

1808
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,360
Don't touch my shit!

1809
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,360
Other people's room, by the way.

1810
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,360
You're going some other way.

1811
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,360
I can't touch it anymore.

1812
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,360
Come over here.

1813
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,360
Come over here.

1814
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,360
Come over here.

1815
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,360
Come over here.

1816
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,360
Be a Jedi.

1817
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,360
You can't jump as high if you're not a Jedi.

1818
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Be a fucking Jedi.

1819
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,360
Be a fucking Jedi.

1820
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,360
Be a fucking Jedi.

1821
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,360
Be a fucking Jedi.

1822
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,360
Be a fucking Jedi.

1823
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,360
Be a fucking Jedi.

1824
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,360
You're passing battle forms, still.

1825
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,360
Do Crack and Heart know that they can come in if they want?

1826
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,360
I texted Crack, and I said, where are you?

1827
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,360
With a picture of his car.

1828
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,360
Okay.

1829
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,360
Okay.

1830
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,360
What are the controls there?

1831
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,360
I don't want them to think that they shouldn't come in.

1832
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,360
Crack!

1833
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,360
Crack!

1834
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,360
Crack!

1835
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,360
You're going to put it back in the Crack box, dude.

1836
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,360
Crack, no.

1837
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,360
Okay.

1838
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,360
Alright.

1839
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,360
Okay.

1840
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,360
No, yeah.

1841
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,360
That makes sense.

1842
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,360
You haven't acknowledged the fact that you have a wife, like, at all, on any, anywhere.

1843
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,360
In text or in video games.

1844
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,360
Well...

1845
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,360
You have a green card marriage?

1846
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,360
I'd get cut if anyone knew that I had a wife.

1847
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,360
I'm sure of it.

1848
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,360
Cab lovingly incubated Claire for you.

1849
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,360
Sinclair for you.

1850
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,360
And you haven't acknowledged your existence even once.

1851
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,360
Uh, it's a green card marriage.

1852
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,360
Okay.

1853
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,360
I needed citizenship.

1854
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,360
Look at these beautiful bubbles right here.

1855
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,360
Yeah, I'm over them.

1856
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,360
Yeah, I'm over them.

1857
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,360
Dude, look at me pissed right now.

1858
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,360
Right into my fucking face.

1859
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,360
I like how your piss comes out red.

1860
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,360
Dude, yeah.

1861
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,360
Hell yeah.

1862
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,360
Dude.

1863
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,360
Don't look at me.

1864
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,360
Don't look at me, dude.

1865
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,360
I'm fucking peeing.

1866
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,360
No, dude.

1867
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,360
Oh, look.

1868
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,360
It's my friends.

1869
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,360
Okay.

1870
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,360
Get them.

1871
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,360
Get them.

1872
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,360
Get them.

1873
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,360
Obliterate them.

1874
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,360
Yes.

1875
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,360
Our whole party.

1876
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,360
We need no friends allowed.

1877
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,360
Our whole family.

1878
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,360
Our whole clan.

1879
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,360
I had to do it.

1880
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,360
I had to do it to activate my fucking sharring on or whatever.

1881
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,360
Listen, when you kill someone, you get their worth.

1882
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,360
So you have a binary, like a numeral, like integer.

1883
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,360
A numeral?

1884
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,360
A numeral integer as it sounds.

1885
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,360
A numeral integer.

1886
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,360
A numeral integer for each of your worths.

1887
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:14,360
And your worth can go up and it can go down based upon numerals.

1888
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,360
That's the guy that did the Colorado piece.

1889
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,360
No, you know, stop, stop, stop it.

1890
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,360
Oh, actually, sorry.

1891
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,360
That wasn't him that was actually watching about that.

1892
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,360
Yeah, sorry.

1893
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,360
Did he think something stupid?

1894
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,360
No, no, no.

1895
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,360
I wasn't talking about that.

1896
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,360
You can out me as a hack in a fraud.

1897
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,360
That's fine.

1898
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,360
But as long as you don't fuck me up.

1899
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,360
No.

1900
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,360
No.

1901
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,360
Oh, god, fucking die.

1902
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,360
What?

1903
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,360
Oh, sorry.

1904
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,360
I'm not going.

1905
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,360
It's pretty much.

1906
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,360
You love it.

1907
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,360
You love it.

1908
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,360
Oh, my God.

1909
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,360
Carolyn, you.

1910
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,360
No, sorry.

1911
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,360
I'm getting the blue shit.

1912
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,360
Your camera.

1913
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,360
Your camera work is stunning.

1914
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,360
You'll be a photographer one day.

1915
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,360
You'll be a cinematographer.

1916
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,360
A photographer.

1917
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,360
A forestographer.

1918
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,360
Okay.

1919
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,360
Where are we going?

1920
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,360
All right.

1921
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,360
All right.

1922
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,360
All right.

1923
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,360
All right.

1924
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,360
All right.

1925
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,360
All right.

1926
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,360
All right.

1927
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,360
All right.

1928
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,360
All right.

1929
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,360
You know, you know, you know, as a small character, well, I'll tell you fucking who it's, but

1930
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,360
and just kind of her in parentheses, boy.

1931
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,360
What?

1932
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,360
All right.

1933
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,360
Check out this shit.

1934
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,360
You thought this game didn't have small hatches of characters to walk through.

1935
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,360
Well, in fact, it does have small hatches.

1936
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,360
Carries.

1937
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,360
What do you mean?

1938
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,360
Small characters.

1939
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,360
You're all at the same side.

1940
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,360
Small hatches.

1941
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,360
You can walk through.

1942
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:26,360
You don't like in, uh, in, in Super Paper Mario for the Wii when you get, uh, pixel.

1943
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,360
Anakin is exactly the same size as everyone else.

1944
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,360
No, no.

1945
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,360
You ruined it.

1946
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,360
God damn it.

1947
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,360
So bad.

1948
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,360
Yes, you did.

1949
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,360
Yeah.

1950
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,360
Yeah, I did.

1951
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,360
Yeah, I did.

1952
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,360
Yeah.

1953
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,360
Just use the force, dude.

1954
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,360
What are you doing?

1955
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,360
Get over here.

1956
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,360
Get over here.

1957
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,360
Get over here.

1958
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,360
Get over there.

1959
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,360
Yeah.

1960
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,360
Forest powers.

1961
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,360
Who's Qui-Gon?

1962
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,360
You.

1963
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,360
Can I jump all the way over there?

1964
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,360
Okay.

1965
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,360
I'm Noah.

1966
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,360
Yeah, come on.

1967
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,360
Come on.

1968
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,360
Come on.

1969
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,360
Come on.

1970
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,360
Come on.

1971
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,360
Blue.

1972
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,360
Oh my gosh.

1973
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,360
What you want me to join?

1974
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,360
Thank you.

1975
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,360
Thank you.

1976
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,360
Thank you.

1977
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,360
What are those two again?

1978
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,360
Anything?

1979
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,360
Look at our faces.

1980
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,360
They add up to 10.

1981
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,360
Oh, okay.

1982
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,360
And then once it hits 10, then you get a prize.

1983
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,360
Oh.

1984
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,360
A prize.

1985
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,360
Look at that brick detector.

1986
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,360
Did it detect more red bricks?

1987
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,360
Dude.

1988
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,360
Oh, well, okay.

1989
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,360
That's part of it.

1990
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,360
That's part of the equation.

1991
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,360
Don't you worry.

1992
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,360
How damn it.

1993
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,360
This game sucks.

1994
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,360
Right?

1995
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,360
Tell me about it.

1996
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,360
So much hard dick because it's so good at having sex.

1997
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,360
So much hard dick.

1998
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,360
Yo.

1999
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,360
You see, Mike went to Whole Foods.

2000
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,360
That's what happened.

2001
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,360
Oh, you were buying rosé.

2002
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,360
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

2003
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,360
You were just there yesterday.

2004
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,360
What were they thinking?

2005
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,360
Well, they only got half the foods.

2006
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,360
Well, they were buying, they're buying celery and...

2007
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,860
Dude, I got all the sea ice you can drink.

2008
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,360
What more did you want?

2009
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,360
Yes, yes.

2010
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,360
So much sea ice.

2011
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,360
Yes.

2012
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,360
Whole Foods.

2013
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,360
No, I got it to save more behind the Whole Foods.

2014
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:49,360
The sea ice is a terrible vodka, but there's two big handles of it.

2015
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,360
It's a plastic bottle.

2016
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:54,360
I had to buy both of them because it was $9.99.

2017
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:59,360
$8.99 for a liter, $9.99 for a liter, $75.

2018
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,360
These numbers don't lie.

2019
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,360
That's closed off.

2020
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,360
This is a gated community.

2021
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,360
And they're whispering behind me.

2022
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,360
This is a gated community.

2023
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,360
There's a gated retirement community on the way between here and Whole Foods.

2024
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,360
And it's fucking sick.

2025
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,360
Yeah.

2026
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,360
It's fucking sick.

2027
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,360
Literally, what are gated communities?

2028
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,360
It's like you have to apply to get in.

2029
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,360
Yeah.

2030
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,360
You're just...

2031
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,360
Gated communities.

2032
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,360
You're just watching TED Talks.

2033
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,360
We made it in.

2034
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,360
Oh, yeah.

2035
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,360
Hey.

2036
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,360
Hey.

2037
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,360
Stop.

2038
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,360
Please.

2039
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,360
Wait, why can't I go?

2040
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,360
Because you're not...

2041
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,360
Yeah, even though you're the same size.

2042
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,360
Okay, we'll have a go.

2043
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,360
All right.

2044
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,360
Please remove this box.

2045
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,360
I'm appealing...

2046
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,360
Please what?

2047
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,360
Please remove this robot.

2048
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,360
Please.

2049
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,360
Remove what?

2050
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,360
This robot, please.

2051
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,360
I don't know what's happening to you.

2052
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,360
I don't know what's happening to you.

2053
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,360
I don't know what's going on, please.

2054
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,360
Hit the red button.

2055
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,360
Hit the side button.

2056
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,360
Hit the red button.

2057
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,360
Hit the right button.

2058
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,360
Yeah, do that.

2059
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,360
Do that.

2060
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,360
Oh, my God.

2061
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:55,360
Yeah, when things glow, it means you can use force power on them.

2062
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,360
I did not know that that was the force.

2063
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,360
That's the force.

2064
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,360
That's the force.

2065
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,360
Hey, what's in this little chimney here?

2066
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,360
Oh, it's a red power button.

2067
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,360
That was a red...

2068
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,360
You gonna do it or what?

2069
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,360
You gonna do it or what?

2070
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,360
There you go.

2071
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,360
There we go.

2072
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:09,360
The puzzles are out of the world.

2073
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,360
They're fucking nuts.

2074
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,360
Dude, they're too hard for me, bro.

2075
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,360
They're too hard for me.

2076
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,360
That's even the Chinese.

2077
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,360
Let me tell you.

2078
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,360
Okay, first of all, glowy shit.

2079
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,360
You're gonna use force power on it.

2080
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,360
Can you each stand on the other block and just raise each other at the same time?

2081
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,360
Yeah, no.

2082
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,360
That's the puzzle.

2083
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,360
Oh, that is the puzzle.

2084
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,360
You had another epic puzzle.

2085
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,360
Just face me.

2086
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,360
Face me.

2087
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,360
Face me.

2088
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,360
Oh, my God.

2089
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,360
The power of friendship, the power of understanding.

2090
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,360
That's beautiful.

2091
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,360
That's so cute.

2092
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,360
Oh, that's so cute.

2093
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,360
So cute.

2094
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,360
You raise me up so I can reach to Jeddah.

2095
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,360
That's so cute.

2096
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,360
Can you go in there?

2097
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,360
Are you trying to be tiny?

2098
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,360
No, I'm not small.

2099
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,360
Either one of you is small.

2100
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,360
God, just look with your...

2101
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,360
Look with your eyes.

2102
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,360
Yeah, just look.

2103
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,360
Just look at him.

2104
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,360
Look at him.

2105
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,360
He's small.

2106
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,360
Look.

2107
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,360
Make him tell that he can squeeze through tiny holes.

2108
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,360
He's so small.

2109
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,360
Why don't you wear his tiny holes?

2110
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,360
We need more than three of us to unlock.

2111
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,360
No.

2112
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,360
When are you starting your NSFW vlog?

2113
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,360
Why don't you fuck tiny holes?

2114
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,360
Why are there stunts in the gates?

2115
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:19,360
There's stunts in every object that's just laden with them.

2116
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,360
Every object is just laden with some cryptocurrency.

2117
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,360
Like physical cryptocurrency.

2118
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,360
I guess it's got to be a true Jedi.

2119
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,360
Unfortunately, we aren't even close.

2120
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,360
Every space in this universe is diffused.

2121
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:41,360
Like the curled up M-brains of string theory are just packed full of quantum bits.

2122
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,360
Wait, what are they called?

2123
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,360
Nodes.

2124
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,360
Nubs?

2125
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,360
Naves.

2126
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,360
Naves.

2127
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,360
Naves.

2128
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,360
What are the things?

2129
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,360
What are the monies?

2130
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,360
Um, dude, like 42.

2131
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,360
I just answered the universe.

2132
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,360
What are the pieces?

2133
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,360
The little shiny little pieces.

2134
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:00,360
Dude, dude, like fucking 42, dude.

2135
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,360
I'm so smart.

2136
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,360
I love Hot Topic.

2137
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,360
I love fucking going there.

2138
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,360
I love the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

2139
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,360
I love literature.

2140
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,360
It was a better time.

2141
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,360
Can't we have to go back?

2142
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,360
No.

2143
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,360
Can't we have to go back?

2144
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,360
Can't we have to go back?

2145
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,360
We have to go back.

2146
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,360
No, fuck.

2147
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,360
This is a nightmare.

2148
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,360
No.

2149
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,360
This game is terrible.

2150
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,360
This is so amazing.

2151
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,360
Yeah, this is so...

2152
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,360
You made it.

2153
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,360
Yeah, no joy.

2154
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,360
You got the blue.

2155
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,360
We got the blue.

2156
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,360
What?

2157
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,360
Is there anything else?

2158
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,360
No, we got the blue.

2159
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,360
I got the blue.

2160
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,360
That was all that for a blue.

2161
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,360
Okay, okay.

2162
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,360
I was a platforming genius.

2163
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,360
No, no, no.

2164
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,360
I got you.

2165
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,360
I was a platforming genius.

2166
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,360
You're so...

2167
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,360
Yeah.

2168
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,360
Yeah.

2169
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:52,360
So, okay, so you can play this single player, right?

2170
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,360
Of course.

2171
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,360
Yeah.

2172
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,360
No.

2173
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,360
It's only 42.

2174
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,360
Well, I did in fact do that earlier, so you should know.

2175
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,360
I forgot.

2176
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,360
I was asleep.

2177
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,360
Oh, my good boy.

2178
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,360
I was taking a little nappy now.

2179
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,360
What does Bibendum say when he wants to congratulate you?

2180
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,360
Oh, he says, uh...

2181
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,360
What is Bibendum's red aura?

2182
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,360
Cystis nest Bibendum.

2183
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:17,360
It is time to drink to our life as he drinks a big goblet full of broken glass shards,

2184
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,360
because he's so fucking tough and durable.

2185
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,360
No, no, no.

2186
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,360
Karen, please, please, please, please, please.

2187
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,360
Oh, I'm so sorry.

2188
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,360
Oh, you should be.

2189
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,360
Oh, I'm so sorry.

2190
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,360
Oh, jeez.

2191
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,360
You should be, you fucking nerd.

2192
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,360
Wait, wait, wait.

2193
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,360
What day is it today?

2194
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,360
I don't know.

2195
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,360
Tomorrow?

2196
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,360
God damn it.

2197
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,360
Guys, we missed the fucking free comedy, the free comedy night at Limelight.

2198
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,360
Limelight.

2199
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,360
No.

2200
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,360
God.

2201
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,360
It was, dude, Ben.

2202
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,360
All right.

2203
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,360
Literally the first week I get back in Boston, we're fucking doing that shit.

2204
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:49,360
Yeah?

2205
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,360
We're going to Limelight.

2206
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,360
We're going to the Limelight, so you can see.

2207
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,360
So you can have your time in the Limelight.

2208
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,360
Because they got the Limelight special going right now?

2209
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,360
Hell yeah, dude.

2210
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,360
Ben, do you have a type 5 uniform?

2211
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,360
Um, a type 5.

2212
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,360
Is that like, is that some kind of new Slymoyd breed?

2213
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,360
Type 5 set, you know.

2214
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,360
What does that mean?

2215
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,360
Like a type 5, you know.

2216
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,360
Oh, a type 5.

2217
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,360
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2218
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,360
Make me go up please.

2219
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:17,360
I'm going to hang 10 on my type 5.

2220
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,360
You're the only type 5 I see is my fucking girlfriend, you know what I mean?

2221
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,360
Yay!

2222
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:36,240
Scraping children can we finally release that video by the way if you saying I really wish I had a girlfriend you know

2223
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:42,480
I was being funny on purpose, right? No, you know I was being retired on purpose, right? Ben, me too.

2224
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:50,360
I was, I was, I was being, I was just acting. It was satire. Yeah, but you said, you said you never released that video.

2225
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:59,040
Because, because, because, because brainless like you are all out there and they would be like there's no, I didn't detect no trace of irony in this delivery.

2226
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:03,680
You, you can't like do something bad. I thought you were just embarrassed because you were super wasted.

2227
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:10,280
Look, don't talk shit about brainless when you're fucking five-year-olds, okay? Yeah, literally. They'll both get offended.

2228
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:14,440
No, they have small brains. They're not built yet. Well. But it makes your pussy so tight.

2229
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,840
Oh, so it's so delicious.

2230
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:25,040
When I said a, when I said a type five, when I said a type five, I meant like she's a five out of ten. That's what I meant.

2231
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:31,480
That's what I was trying to get. Oh, yeah, right. All right, Doc's this guy right here. Doc's this guy right here.

2232
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,480
Hey, why am I this man suddenly?

2233
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:39,240
You probably hit Y. I did not hit such a thing. You probably hit Y. I did not. It's easy to do.

2234
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:43,400
Dude, you go in the different fucking button. No, I want this one. I was, I was here first.

2235
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,240
I was here first.

2236
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,240
I wanna be, I wanna be a, how much you owe me?

2237
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,040

2239
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,040
Hey, get out of this one.

01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:06,040
Oh God, no, we're back into the fray. Into the fro, into the fro, yo.

2241
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,040

2327
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:08,520
beginning well sure sure at first we walked in we were just the only yeah yeah

2328
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:12,760
souls in the entire audience and then people followed and we thought okay so

2329
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:16,640
we're literally the only people this marketing trick worked on but no we were

2330
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,960
because as more and more people walked up to the stage do their bit to do their

2331

2337
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:01,360
go inside like and it's like we are the only people there that's it it's the first time I

2338
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:08,240
ever been to a comedy show and it was like really kind of hilariously bad in a way okay it wasn't

2339
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:14,480
like it wasn't bad but it was it was like okay here's the thing if you tell a joke on stage and

2340
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:20,800
you're at a comedy show I know and there's only a couple people in the audience no matter what

2341
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,200
even if everyone like laughs at your joke you're still only getting what sounds like a little

2342
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,560
tiny laugh yeah because there's not that many there's not enough people to have it be like

2343
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:35,760
haha yeah oh for sure yeah yeah yeah so when someone tells a joke and they're and then there's

2344
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:43,120
free and people laugh it sounds like the joke didn't land and so they go cool so look at that yeah

2345
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:49,120
that's cool by the way dude fucking the police sirens are blaring they're coming for you so because

we this is the titular limelight by the way what you're doing right now the titular limelight

2347
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,720

2419
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:08,560
where in the house that we remember

2420
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,580
everything that comes

2421
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:15,220
in the place that it's supposed to be in.

2422
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:18,380
You left these studs on the table, man, hi.

2423
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,020
Well, listen, man, listen, man,

2424
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:22,740
Ace of Spades is playing Ghost Star of the Jedi.

2425
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:24,220
Yeah, not even close.

2426
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:25,820
I know, it's truly pitiful.

2427
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:27,180
Hey, you did it.

2428
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:31,580
Fucking, here, look, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2429
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:33,740
Please, please, please, what do you mean?

2430
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,460
Oh, there's the boys!

2431
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:36,300
No.

2432
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,460
The boys.

2433
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:38,300
Damn!

2434
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:41,140
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

2435
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:41,980
You want a trophy?

2436
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:43,540
Okay, all right, bid us to play the next level,

2437
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:47,300
because it's the most climactic thing to ever exist.

2438
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,580
Caroline, over here, Caroline, over here.

2439
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:50,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2440
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:51,260
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

2441
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,220
Oh my God, I have to come right now.

2442
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:53,060
What were we talking about?

2443
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:54,140
Oh yeah, the hot pot sucked.

2444
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:57,260
The broth tasted like fucking dish water.

2445
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:58,660
It wasn't very delicious.

2446
01:48:58,660 --> 01:48:59,980
They overcharged us.

2447
01:48:59,980 --> 01:49:00,820
They wail.

2448
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:02,980
Ridiculously overcharged us for some shit.

2449
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:06,180
Okay, so there's an item on the menu called meat lovers.

2450
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:07,020
It was called meat lovers.

2451
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:09,140
It was not called meat lovers, it was like a meat platter.

2452
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:10,460
Okay, Laura, beef lovers.

2453
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:11,620
It was called beef lovers.

2454
01:49:11,620 --> 01:49:12,580
It was called beef lovers.

2455
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,420
Was it actual?

2456
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:14,580
Yeah, it was called beef lovers.

2457
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:15,900
Okay, so it was called beef lovers.

2458
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:16,740
We get it.

2459
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:17,580
What was shit?

2460
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:19,540
It's $35, and we think, okay, $35.

2461
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:22,860
That's gonna be like a big thing for a group to eat.

2462
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:23,700
Yeah.

2463
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:27,020
Well, they said it was for two, and we got it for three, so.

2464
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:27,860
Yeah.

2465
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:28,700
Well, okay, okay.

2466
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:29,540
We had to tip this off.

2467
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:32,900
No, wait, hold on, that is relevant.

2468
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:35,100
However, I will say that we knew that,

2469
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:35,940
but you get the information,

2470
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:38,100
and then it got sides all of us each

2471
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:39,460
to compensate for that.

2472
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:41,300
So we got the meat lovers thinking that would be our meat,

2473
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,740
and then we would get sides to fill up the rest.

2474
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,580
You guys.

2475
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:45,420
Super slide, we got super slide.

2476
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:46,260
Yeah.

2477
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:47,100
Well, you did at the end.

2478
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,420
And the point is it was like,

2479
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:50,140
it was barely enough for one person.

2480
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:52,140
Like, I don't think it would even be enough for one person.

2481
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:53,940
No, we would play for one.

2482
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:55,620
Maybe, maybe.

2483
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:57,860
But the point is that it was way overpriced,

2484
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:00,820
way not enough, and it wasn't very good.

2485
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:01,860
It wasn't very delicious.

2486
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:03,380
But you know, the concept of the hot pot,

2487
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:06,900
the romantic, platonic ideal of the hot pot,

2488
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:09,500
being like a social experience,

2489
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,700
where you're all in the hot pot,

2490
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:15,420
it's just this big, warm, boiling pot of broth.

2491
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:16,900
You stick shit in the pot,

2492
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,460
you take it out of the pot, you eat it.

2493
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:19,420
The idea of that,

2494
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:20,740
mwah.

2495
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:22,580
So we think we must be doing something wrong.

2496
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:23,980
I researched.

2497
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:26,060
I learned how to do the hot pot correctly,

2498
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:28,500
and we went to a place that we were thinking of going to

2499
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,660
on the first day,

2500
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:32,260
but we didn't go to in favor of Cassey Snip.

2501
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:33,100
Because you-

2502
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:33,940
Big mistake.

2503
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:35,820
Because no way, right.

2504
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:37,460
No, you, oh yeah, you wanted lamb.

2505
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:38,300
You wanted lamb chops.

2506
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:39,140
Yeah, no, no, no.

2507
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:40,700
I wanted to go to the happy lamb.

2508
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:41,860
You were pushing for lamb chops.

2509
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:43,900
Well, you were pushing for the happy lamb purely

2510
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,660
on the basis of the name.

2511
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:46,500
Yeah.

2512
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,900
There was no way to tell.

2513
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:50,220
Yeah, no, but I knew, but I knew that would be good.

2514
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:51,540
There was no information.

2515
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:52,380
I was-

2516
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:53,220
No, okay.

2517
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:54,300
Because they didn't have like a menu on their website,

2518
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,580
they didn't have a website or anything.

2519
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:57,220
Oh, okay, okay, no, no, okay, hold on.

2520
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:58,900
Here's how I knew.

2521
01:50:58,900 --> 01:50:59,980
I walked by.

2522
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,020
Oh, the movie's starting.

2523
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:01,860
Oh, oh, yeah.

2524
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:02,700
Yeah, everyone shut the fuck up.

2525
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:03,540
Everyone shut the fuck up.

2526
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:04,380
It's starting.

2527
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:05,220
Chapter six.

2528
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:06,060
Chapter six.

2529
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:07,380
Door is small.

2530
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:10,060
The trade federation army has been neutralized,

2531
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:11,460
but I can't, I won't go in.

2532
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:12,300
Give me that.

2533
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:13,140
I'm switching in.

2534
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:13,980
I'm tagging in.

2535
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:14,820
All right, fine.

2536
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:15,660
I'm tagging in.

2537
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:16,500
All right, fine.

2538
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,340
Now I get to play the video game.

2539
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,140
Okay, no, here's how you tell a good restaurant.

2540
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:21,260
Literally, here's how you tell, you look at it

2541
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:24,140
and think, wow, is it good graphic design or not?

2542
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:25,420
It had great graphic design,

2543
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:28,740
and I could tell that it was chic and crowded as hell.

2544
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:31,540
That's great, unironic, great justification

2545
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:32,660
for going to a restaurant.

2546
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:33,500
Okay.

2547
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,740
Casus temp was out of the way and not very cool.

2548
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:40,180
Well, you know, when we start,

2549
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:43,620
when we got the regular beef, and it's not the beef lovers,

2550
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:44,660
like it was just the beef lovers

2551
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:46,180
that was overpriced and shit.

2552
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:48,180
Like everything else was not so bad,

2553
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,740
but we didn't get any of that.

2554
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:50,860
We just did it wrong.

2555
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:53,580
You are a fucking moron.

2556
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:55,060
We have to play the game.

2557
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:55,900
Come on.

2558
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:58,100
So it just automatically reflects the days back.

2559
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,700
Yeah, but you had to time it.

2560
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:02,380
Come on, Dara.

2561
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:03,220
Hell yeah.

2562
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:04,060
Come on, Mr. Mall.

2563
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:07,500
I wonder, I took a picture of when we went to Happy Lamb

2564
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,180
and got a really good hot pot.

2565
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:10,980
Yeah, put it on the screen.

2566
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:13,940
Yeah, it was really colorful and really beautiful.

2567
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:15,500
I kept looking at it and I took a picture.

2568
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,980
Wait, hold on, before we put it on,

2569
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:21,980
I just want to say, I really didn't like Casus temp.

2570
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,980
And so until a couple of days later,

2571
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:26,540
I still wanted hot pot because I wanted to redeem myself.

2572
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,700
So we go to Happy Lamb, finally you cave the pressure

2573
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,380
and you allow me to go to the place that I knew it would be great

2574
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:31,500
and it was.

2575
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,980
We go in like five minutes before they open.

2576
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:36,220
It's completely shrouded in darkness.

2577
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:37,740
It's shrouded in darkness.

2578
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:38,580
We walk.

2579
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:39,740
Wait, you got there as they open?

2580
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:42,660
Yeah, we got there like 30 minutes before they're opening

2581
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:45,700
and we walked in, like the door was unlocked,

2582
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:48,180
but the lights were off, but all the tables were set.

2583
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:50,500
I thought it was like scary.

2584
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:51,700
What are you talking about?

2585
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:53,540
And then some lady appeared from out of the shadow.

2586
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:54,380
Are you literally stupid?

2587
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:55,420
Maybe.

2588
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:56,420
We get true dead eye.

2589
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:58,780
Oh wow, thanks for the droids.

2590
01:52:58,780 --> 01:52:59,620
Get the blue.

2591
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:02,140
We got to get all the sets, bro.

2592
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:03,780
Come on, we've lost our ways, we gotta do that.

2593
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:05,580
Anyway, yeah, so we go to Happy Lamb

2594
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,700
and just show them the image,

2595
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:09,100
because that's all you need to know.

2596
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,500
That's all you fucking need to know

2597
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:11,540
is show them that fucking image.

2598
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:12,860
Let's see how it looks on.

2599
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:15,020
Yeah, great.

2600
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:16,980
Okay, well you can't really.

2601
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:18,300
It looks like a fetus.

2602
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,300
It looks like some fucking mess.

2603
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,660
You can't really tell that good.

2604
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:24,780
No, no, but trust us, it looks great.

2605
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:25,620
It's really.

2606
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:26,460
It's a lot of meat.

2607
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:27,300
It's a lot of meat.

2608
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:28,140
Okay, and.

2609
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:29,660
No, it's not the plate of meat, it's the bra.

2610
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:31,060
Oh, okay, I'm gonna show them the preview.

2611
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:33,020
So can you give like an estimate

2612
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:34,980
of how big the plate that we got at Cassey Snap was?

2613
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:38,300
Like how big the $35 plate.

2614
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:41,380
Maybe like this big, and it had,

2615
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:45,380
honestly there were only maybe like 20 slices of beef on there

2616
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:46,780
and like their thin slices.

2617
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:50,340
It had, I would say it had five different types of beef

2618
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:51,180
and then maybe like.

2619
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:52,780
No, there were like three.

2620
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:54,620
There weren't that many, there were like three.

2621
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:57,540
This under $10.

2622
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:58,380
It's okay.

2623
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:00,140
Oh, there you go, there you can see it.

2624
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:03,100
Under $10.

2625
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:04,060
Look at all that slime.

2626
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:07,660
Look at all that fucking delicious shredded podrans.

2627
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:10,660
Imagine thinly sliced podrans that you dip into a hot pot

2628
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:11,500
full of juvie blood.

2629
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:14,460
Oh, dude, you just fell, you fell, you dropped the glue.

2630
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:15,740
We'll never get through Jedi now.

2631
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:18,300
All right, that's, you know what, that's fine.

2632
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:19,140
That's fine.

2633
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:20,060
Is it though?

2634
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:20,900
No, it's not.

2635
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:22,660
Yeah, I didn't think that.

2636
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:24,260
It was pretty good, and also they had potatoes.

2637
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:25,100
We just started the whole game over.

2638
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,580
They had potatoes with this hot pot.

2639
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:27,620
That was one of the vegetable options.

2640
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:29,460
That was a really good decision.

2641
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:30,420
Okay, okay.

2642
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:32,460
You know, like it melts in your mouth.

2643
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:35,380
It might seem obvious to those of you who know

2644
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,220
the hot pot experience.

2645
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:38,740
It may seem like, you know, oh, obvious,

2646
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:40,340
but like the point of the hot pot

2647
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:42,460
is to literally just make a soup.

2648
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:44,500
You know, you have to make the broth yourself.

2649
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:46,220
So you're the whole point of it

2650
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:47,780
is that over the course of the meal,

2651
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:49,860
you are creating the exact soup that you want,

2652
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:51,980
adding in the materials and adding all the stuff.

2653
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:53,620
So what's really important to a soup,

2654
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:55,420
obviously is the broth.

2655
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:57,700
And when your broth tastes like fucking dishwater,

2656
01:54:57,700 --> 01:54:59,220
it's not gonna be an experience.

2657
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:03,060
But this fucking place was so like into their broth

2658
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:06,500
that they had a giant neon sign that said broth so hard.

2659
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,580
Oh yeah, yeah, broth so hard.

2660
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:09,540
That's their slogan.

2661
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:12,060
All the shirts in place. Yeah, yeah, that's their slogan.

2662
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:14,380
It's broth so hard.

2663
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:15,460
Broth so hard.

2664
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:17,460
It's broth so hard.

2665
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:20,660
Three blues, three blues, three blues, three blues.

2666
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:21,980
Blue man group, blue man group.

2667
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:22,820
Blue man group.

2668
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:23,660
Blue man group.

2669
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:24,500
No, not.

2670
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:25,340
You're gonna fall as you're dumb.

2671
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:26,180
No.

2672
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:27,020
Oh man.

2673
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:27,860
It was delicious.

2674
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:31,740
You, I got like fucking like a meat

2675
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:33,700
and it was so, so delicious.

2676
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:34,540
I got lamb.

2677
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:36,340
I got the titular happy lamb.

2678
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:38,140
I got lamb and I got, I got, I got,

2679
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:41,260
I got garlic beef, which was really good.

2680
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,820
I got Napa cabbage.

2681
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:44,900
I got fucking, I got, I got buck choy.

2682
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:46,100
Raise me, raise me you fool.

2683
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:46,940
I'm trying to.

2684
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:47,780
No you're not.

2685
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:50,020
I got garlic beef and then some mushrooms

2686
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:51,860
and then some potatoes.

2687
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:52,740
That was, that was really good.

2688
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:53,580
So good.

2689
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:54,620
Only stormtroopers can access.

2690
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:55,540
No, we can't do anything up here,

2691
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:56,380
but we can't get blue though.

2692
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:57,220
Well there's blue though.

2693
01:55:57,620 --> 01:55:58,780
We can't get blue though.

2694
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:00,340
We can't get blue man group.

2695
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:02,580
Hey Ben, you want to join like a blue man group again?

2696
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:04,780
Oh, you just like, just like fucking.

2697
01:56:04,780 --> 01:56:07,060
A blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

2698
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:07,900
Yeah.

2699
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:09,060
Is that what they do in the blue man group?

2700
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:09,900
That's what they do in the blue man group.

2701
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:10,740
What is blue man group?

2702
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:12,900
Blue man group seems like it would suck.

2703
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:13,740
Oh.

2704
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:14,580
Yeah.

2705
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:17,980
It's a, well it's like, it's like music,

2706
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:20,180
but it's also like a performance thing.

2707
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:21,020
They like.

2708
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:21,860
On the steam powered draft.

2709
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:22,680
They do like cool.

2710
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:23,520
Yeah, exactly.

2711
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,360
They do like.

2712
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,180
When he was a boy.

2713
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:32,020
He'd play by the sea and then by the sea.

2714
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:36,180
By age 15, he'd left the shore.

2715
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:42,180
On a captain sailing on the shore.

2716
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:43,140
Woo.

2717
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:45,940
The navy was just taking a lick.

2718
01:56:45,940 --> 01:56:48,740
Pirates had invaded the ship.

2719
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:51,180
Balak's was on the Aint Harpoon.

2720
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:53,940
He rang their round with a spark and a boon.

2721
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:58,380
The pirate's away.

2722
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:04,380
And navy said, Captain Albert Alec Zander.

2723
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:09,060
Look down in the sea.

2724
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:14,340
But that Captain Albert Alec Zander.

2725
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:17,820
Look down in the sea.

2726
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:21,780
And the end.

2727
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:22,780
Yeah.

2728
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:23,700
My favorite song.

2729
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:25,180
Hell fucking yeah dude.

2730
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:27,540
It's a good, it's a jaunty little tune.

2731
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:30,260
That's for sure.

2732
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:31,540
Chotey little friend.

2733
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:32,580
He's a chotey little friend.

2734
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:34,540
Yeah, it's a Chotey little friend.

2735
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:36,260
Chotey little friend doesn't die when you cut him in half.

2736
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:36,760
No.

2737
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:37,260
What?

2738
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:38,020
That feel when you.

2739
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:38,900
We haven't cut him in half yet.

2740
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,220
We just threw barrels at him.

2741
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:42,900
When you cut him in half, he falls to the ground and doesn't die.

2742
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:44,300
Yeah, he just gets robot legs.

2743
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:45,060
Ben, Ben.

2744
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:46,460
That feels like it's hard to even half.

2745
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:48,460
He comes back in Clone Wars with robot legs.

2746
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:50,260
Ben, you know what makes me so mad when we're walking down

2747
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:52,940
in the city and you like move like faster than me and Kazi.

2748
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:54,420
And these are moving so fast, the screen moves,

2749
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:56,820
and we get like automatically slided to where you are.

2750
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:58,660
Like that.

2751
01:57:58,660 --> 01:57:59,580
Classic.

2752
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:00,660
I hate when you do that.

2753
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:02,300
Classic move on my part.

2754
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:03,100
Got no stash, bro.

2755
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:03,980
Blue.

2756
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:04,940
Blue.

2757
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:06,580
You're so fucking dumb.

2758
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,300
And we won.

2759
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:07,820
We won.

2760
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:09,500
And we won.

2761
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:12,500
We're so close to Tujena right now, by the way.

2762
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:13,500
Look at that mannequin over there.

2763
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:14,580
Are you joking, man?

2764
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:15,620
I don't think they're joking.

2765
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:19,020
I think they're good, luxurious.

2766
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:21,020
What were we talking about before we started singing?

2767
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:22,540
A hot pot.

2768
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:23,460
Oh, yeah.

2769
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:24,380
Never again.

2770
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:25,820
No, not even the good one.

2771
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:26,820
No, no, no, dude.

2772
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:28,100
Ben, hot pot.

2773
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:28,820
All right.

2774
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:29,660
Yeah, you know what?

2775
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:30,380
You're right.

2776
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:31,060
Dude, straight up.

2777
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:32,260
It will be so fucking good.

2778
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:35,540
The Happy Lamb is actually Kino, unironically.

2779
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:36,300
OK.

2780
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,660
All right.

2781
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:38,220
You know what?

2782
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:39,460
You know what I want to do so bad?

2783
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:40,860
I want to have another RSVK con.

2784
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:42,540
So, like, unbelievable much.

2785
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:44,700
Aren't you doing one in Europe?

2786
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:47,940
Yeah, but you know, fucking whatever.

2787
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:50,300
How many European members do you have?

2788
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:51,260
There's a lot, actually.

2789
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:52,020
There's actually a lot.

2790
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:52,620
Yeah, no.

2791
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:55,140
Like Portugal and, like, Ireland.

2792
01:58:55,140 --> 01:58:56,260
Right at the top of my head.

2793
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:57,300
There's Ladderless.

2794
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:57,980
There's Shawnee.

2795
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:58,620
There's Hale.

2796
01:58:58,620 --> 01:58:59,100
There's Magic.

2797
01:58:59,100 --> 01:58:59,940
A bunch from Germany.

2798
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:00,620
A bunch from Germany.

2799
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:02,460
Yeah, I do two of the codes from Germany.

2800
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:05,420
Spain, Tardis from Spain.

2801
01:59:05,420 --> 01:59:06,220
Tardis from Spain.

2802
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:09,820
Slimes is from Portugal, I'm pretty sure.

2803
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:12,020
I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.

2804
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:15,260
Dude, there were so many Portuguese, right?

2805
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:17,100
There were so many Portuguese.

2806
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:18,500
You're so bad.

2807
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:19,780
Yeah, well, what are you going to do?

2808
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:22,340
You've really ruined the game for us.

2809
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:23,980
Yeah, I should have ground pounded.

2810
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:24,540
What?

2811
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:25,460
They obliterated me.

2812
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:26,980
You're so, you're going to literally make us

2813
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:28,820
lose true Jedi by looking at you.

2814
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:30,020
Like, Ben.

2815
01:59:30,020 --> 01:59:31,860
I tried ground, you, that was you.

2816
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:32,460
That was you.

2817
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:34,700
I tried ground pounding and they just shot me out of the air

2818
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:35,660
and I died.

2819
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:39,940
You are so, like, the opposite of someone who's good.

2820
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:41,740
I'm not, you're saying I'm not a true Jedi?

2821
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:43,340
Yeah, I'm saying that you are a fake Jedi.

2822
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:45,100
You're a fake fan.

2823
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:47,340
What's worse than being a fake fan of true Jedi?

2824
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:49,880
No!

2825
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:51,780
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

2826
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:55,420
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

2827
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:58,740
Da-bup-ba-da-da-bup-ba-da-da-da.

2828
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:01,340
This is like slime pest all over again.

2829
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:02,300
Only better.

2830
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:03,340
And for free.

2831
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:04,540
For free.

2832
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:05,220
Hell yeah.

2833
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:06,580
Actually, you know what?

2834
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:08,540
Apollo was exactly right.

2835
02:00:08,540 --> 02:00:10,780
It was just about ground pounding.

2836
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:11,460
Ground pounding you win.

2837
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:11,740
I know.

2838
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:15,820
I've been doing that at the highest entire time.

2839
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:17,220
You may sail the way.

2840
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:17,720
Dude.

2841
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:18,220
Free.

2842
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:31,220
You remind me of a fucking mollusk.

2843
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:32,220
No.

2844
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:34,220
Oh, I only got one.

2845
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:39,220
No, this fucking guy over here is calling his fucking jockstrap assholes to come in.

2846
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:42,220
God, my favorite fetish is jockstrap assholes.

2847
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:43,220
Yeah.

2848
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:44,220
No, yeah.

2849
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:45,220
I love, like, smelly men.

2850
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:48,220
I love men that are smelling also fat and also muscular.

2851
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:51,220
You just keep attacking and you just deflect all their shots.

2852
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:52,220
Yeah.

2853
02:00:52,220 --> 02:00:53,220
You'll never get hit.

2854
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:54,220
That's the game.

2855
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:55,220
You're not even MLG.

2856
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:56,220
That's the game.

2857
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:57,220
Racket killer.

2858
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:58,220
Come over here.

2859
02:00:58,220 --> 02:00:59,220
Come over here.

2860
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:00,220
Come over here.

2861
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:01,220
I'm coming.

2862
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:02,220
I'm going.

2863
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:03,220
I'm over here.

2864
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:04,220
Come over here.

2865
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:05,220
Come over here.

2866
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:06,220
I thought you were about...

2867
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:07,220
I thought I was going to eat it.

2868
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:08,220
Look at us right now.

2869
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:09,220
Yeah, we were so close.

2870
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:10,220
Ha-ha.

2871
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:11,220
Where'd we go?

2872
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:12,220
Are we done?

2873
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:13,220
No.

2874
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:14,220
No.

2875
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:15,220
Not even close.

2876
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:16,220
Not even close.

2877
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:17,220
Is our adventure at an end?

2878
02:01:17,220 --> 02:01:18,220
Not even close.

2879
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:19,220
How long have we been recording?

2880
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:20,220
Two hours.

2881
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:21,220
Not only two hours, it feels like...

2882
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:22,220
It feels like an all day.

2883
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:23,220
Not, dude.

2884
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:24,220
It feels like the 24-hour stream all over again.

2885
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:25,220
No, no, no, no, bro.

2886
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:26,220
Not, dude.

2887
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:27,220
I have the words on Nightmare.

2888
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:28,220
You know what we should do, though?

2889
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:29,220
You know what we should do?

2890
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:31,220
We should just do, like, an episode of each thing.

2891
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:36,220
So we can have six ready-fuckers cop killers fucking this.

2892
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:37,220
Oh, fuck you!

2893
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:38,220
Hey, fuck you!

2894
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:39,220
Oh, hey, man!

2895
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:40,220
No, fuck you!

2896
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,220
Come here!

2897
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:42,220
Hey, no, fuck you, dude!

2898
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:43,220
Come on!

2899
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,220
Come on!

2900
02:01:44,220 --> 02:01:45,220
Fuck!

2901
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:46,220
Or even be on the show.

2902
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:47,220
Actually, you know what?

2903
02:01:47,220 --> 02:01:48,220
No, no, no, no.

2904
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:49,220
I'm still wearing a go.

2905
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:50,220
I can go all fucking night.

2906
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:51,220
Let's do episode two.

2907
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:52,220
Let's do episode two.

2908
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:54,220
Let's fucking go Clone Wars.

2909
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:57,220
The best fucking movie that there is.

2910
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:58,220
That's accurate.

2911
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,220
Yeah, hell yeah.

2912
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:03,220
I liked the video game almost as much as I liked.

2913
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:04,220
I gotta get this blue.

2914
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:06,220
I gotta get this blue.

2915
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:08,220
I thought it was gonna be good.

2916
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:09,220
Come on, dude.

2917
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:10,220
Come on, dude.

2918
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:11,220
Oh, dude.

2919
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:12,220
Well.

2920
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:13,220
Wow, you did eat it.

2921
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:14,220
Wow, you did eat it.

2922
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:15,220
Oh, I lost.

2923
02:02:15,220 --> 02:02:16,220
Oh, twice.

2924
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:20,220
I don't have any more bits to lose.

2925
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:21,220
Ah!

2926
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:24,220
190 fucking studs.

2927
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:25,220
That's me.

2928
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,220
Oh, my God.

2929
02:02:26,220 --> 02:02:28,220
Ben, did you see yourself?

2930
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:29,220
What?

2931
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:30,220
Did I just almost go over?

2932
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:31,220
Yes.

2933
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:33,220
Well, but I didn't, though.

2934
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:34,220
Easy.

2935
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:35,220
Easy.

2936
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:36,220
Easy.

2937
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:37,220
Yeah?

2938
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:38,220
Is it?

2939
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,220
Oh, oh.

2940
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:44,220
Dude, I don't even have any more fucking things to lose.

2941
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:46,220
God damn it.

2942
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:47,220
Help me.

2943
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:48,220
No, he's not.

2944
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:49,220
What am I supposed to do?

2945
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:50,220
Oh, my God.

2946
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:51,220
You're so defensive.

2947
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:52,220
You're like a juvie.

2948
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:53,220
All right, Ben.

2949
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:55,220
I'm a true Jedi, dude.

2950
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:56,220
All right, Ben.

2951
02:02:56,220 --> 02:02:57,220
Here's what I want to talk about exclusively.

2952
02:02:57,220 --> 02:02:59,220
Here's the only thing I want to talk about.

2953
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:00,220
You've been fucking me up.

2954
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:02,220
Oh, by the way, did you release the Vaporette?

2955
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:05,220
Did you release the Vaporette that you said you were gonna do by next PCP?

2956
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:07,220
I forgot.

2957
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:09,220
That was today.

2958
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:10,220
Wait, no.

2959
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:11,220
Is it Friday?

2960
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:12,220
Yes.

2961
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:13,220
Oh, my God.

2962
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,220
I totally forgot to do that.

2963
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:16,220
Fuck.

2964
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:17,220
How embarrassing.

2965
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:18,220
That's really embarrassing.

2966
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:20,220
I mean, I have it.

2967
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:21,220
It's not like I don't have it to release.

2968
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:23,220
I just forgot today was Friday.

2969
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:24,220
That's really funny.

2970
02:03:24,220 --> 02:03:25,220
Okay.

2971
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:29,220
Well, as soon as we're done, we should end this immediately so I can go do that.

2972
02:03:29,220 --> 02:03:31,220
What are we doing?

2973
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:32,220
Oh, wait.

2974
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:33,220
Okay.

2975
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:34,220
Okay.

2976
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:35,220
One, two, three.

2977
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:36,220
There we go.

2978
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:37,220
Wow.

2979
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:38,220
What a great puzzle.

2980
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:40,220
What the fuck is what is happening?

2981
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:42,220
Like, what does that do?

2982
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:43,220
Okay.

2983
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:44,220
Great.

2984
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:45,220
Okay.

2985
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:46,220
Okay.

2986
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:47,220
Speaking of Vapers.

2987
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:48,220
You need...

2988
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:49,220
Dude, I'm so pissed now.

2989
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:50,220
I'm so pissed at myself.

2990
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:51,220
Yeah?

2991
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:52,220
Are you?

2992
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:53,220
Yeah.

2993
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:54,220
I fucked it up.

2994
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:55,220
Whatever.

2995
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:56,220
Dude, you had a busy week or something.

2996
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:57,220
Yeah, I did.

2997
02:03:57,220 --> 02:04:00,220
I mean, yeah, that is why, but it's still disgusting.

2998
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:01,220
That's horrible.

2999
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:02,220
All right.

3000
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:03,220
Kind of three.

3001
02:04:03,220 --> 02:04:04,220
Kind of three.

3002
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:05,220
One, two, three.

3003
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:06,220
Wow.

3004
02:04:06,220 --> 02:04:07,220
Why didn't it work?

3005
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:08,220
One, two, three.

3006
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:09,220
There we go.

3007
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:10,220
Get the studs.

3008
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,220
Get the studs.

3009
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:12,220
Okay.

3010
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:15,220
Ben, when are you going to return home?

3011
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:17,220
No, really, actually this time.

3012
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:19,220
What are you talking about?

3013
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:22,220
Unironically, your presence is needed in this war.

3014
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:23,220
Especially...

3015
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:24,220
Okay.

3016
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:25,220
I'm going to get real with you for a second, Ben.

3017
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:28,220
I'm going to get absolutely unironically real right now.

3018
02:04:28,220 --> 02:04:30,220
No, not again.

3019
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:36,220
One of these days, in real life, I will be here in Boston, which will be good for RFCK,

3020
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:39,220
the show, but I'll be here doing college.

3021
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:46,220
I will not have as much free time as I do right now to code and to be the sole kingpin

3022
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:48,220
that there is in the game.

3023
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:54,220
RFCK cannot exist, or I'm sorry, endless war cannot exist if both kingpins are completely

3024
02:04:54,220 --> 02:04:55,220
absent.

3025
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:57,220
It cannot exist without us.

3026
02:04:57,220 --> 02:04:58,220
RFCK...

3027
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:01,220
I keep saying RFCK when I mean endless war.

3028
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:06,220
Endless war is the most creative, imaginative, and most amazing thing that I have been a

3029
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:08,220
part of to this day.

3030
02:05:08,220 --> 02:05:14,220
And to let it completely clay-fallow while I'm not able to personally be there would

3031
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:16,220
be an absolute fucking travesty.

3032
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:20,220
And you need to, as a kingpin, to clock in during that time.

3033
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:22,220
Will you be able to do so?

3034
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:23,220
No.

3035
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:24,220
Yeah.

3036
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:25,220
Yeah?

3037
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:26,220
Yeah.

3038
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:27,220
So?

3039
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:30,220
Yeah, I mean, I don't mean to never come back.

3040
02:05:30,220 --> 02:05:32,220
I wasn't a plan.

3041
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:34,220
And I don't want to grill you either.

3042
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:35,220
I'm just saying.

3043
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:36,220
You're totally grilling me, dude.

3044
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:38,220
I know I am grilling you because you fucking deserve it.

3045
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:40,220
Okay, so you did mean to grill me.

3046
02:05:40,220 --> 02:05:41,220
Well, yes.

3047
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,220
Is what you're saying.

3048
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:43,220
Yeah.

3049
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:45,220
Everyone loves you, Ben.

3050
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:48,220
Everyone wants you to be a part of their lives.

3051
02:05:48,220 --> 02:05:49,220
Listen.

3052
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:51,220
It's not that I didn't like it.

3053
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:53,220
That's not why I haven't been around.

3054
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:55,220
I've just been busy.

3055
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:57,220
Well, you know, it sucks.

3056
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,220
That's how it is.

3057
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:01,220
Can you not find time to come in?

3058
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:03,220
Can you find it in your apartment?

3059
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:04,220
Yeah, he's dead.

3060
02:06:04,220 --> 02:06:05,220
He's excised.

3061
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:06,220
Yeah.

3062
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:07,220
What?

3063
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:08,220
He's dead.

3064
02:06:08,220 --> 02:06:09,220
What?

3065
02:06:09,220 --> 02:06:10,220
Yeah.

3066
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:12,220
Also, what did Ben not do that was embarrassing?

3067
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:13,220
What?

3068
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:14,220
I heard.

3069
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,220
Oh, oh, oh.

3070
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:17,220
I said I was going to release the vaporette on the website today.

3071
02:06:17,220 --> 02:06:18,220
And then I forgot to do it.

3072
02:06:18,220 --> 02:06:21,220
I mean, it's technically still today.

3073
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:26,220
But I said it was going to be out when the PCP came out and the PCP's out.

3074
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:27,220
And I forgot to do it.

3075
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:28,220
Check out it on his website.

3076
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:29,220
Yeah.

3077
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:30,220
I mean.

3078
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:31,220
Say comments.com.

3079
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:32,220
It'll be out by the time you see it.

3080
02:06:32,220 --> 02:06:33,220
I'll do it tonight.

3081
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:34,220
That's so dumb.

3082
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:35,220
Lol.

3083
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:37,220
Dude, are you ready?

3084
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:38,220
Our Just Desserts.

3085
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:39,220
Our Just Desserts.

3086
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:40,220
Tell us a story.

3087
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:43,220
Hey, how long are you guys going to record for?

3088
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:45,220
Do you want to do episode two?

3089
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:47,220
Was this just episode one?

3090
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:50,220
Honestly, I mean, not particularly.

3091
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:53,220
But like, I don't, I don't know.

3092
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:56,220
I feel like it's, we haven't gone, we only gone two hours.

3093
02:06:56,220 --> 02:06:57,220
Yeah.

3094
02:06:57,220 --> 02:06:58,220
We haven't really gone that long.

3095
02:06:58,220 --> 02:07:00,220
I mean, how long did you want to go for?

3096
02:07:00,220 --> 02:07:04,220
I was thinking we'd do episode two.

3097
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:09,220
I mean, like what's, do you have a plan in mind for like how long you want to go?

3098
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:11,220
And like what, what do you do after?

3099
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:14,220
Well, I think we just beat episode two and that's it.

3100
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:15,220
That's it?

3101
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:16,220
Yeah.

3102
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:17,220
All right.

3103
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:18,220
All right.

3104
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:19,220
Yeah, we're doing it boys.

3105
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:20,220
7.1%.

3106
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:21,220
7.1% actually.

3107
02:07:21,220 --> 02:07:24,220
That's 7.1% of the entire game.

3108
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:26,220
We got 100% of it.

3109
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:27,220
Well, hold on.

3110
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:31,220
Video games are meant to last for years, if not hours.

3111
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:32,220
Yeah, but.

3112
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:34,220
Come on, come on dude.

3113
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:35,220
LEGO Star Wars.

3114
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:38,220
Ben, do you agree that this is the best game we've played ever?

3115
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:39,220
Yes.

3116
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:40,220
I agree.

3117
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:41,220
All right.

3118
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:42,220
Episode two, dude.

3119
02:07:42,220 --> 02:07:43,220
Episode two.

3120
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:44,220
Wait.

3121
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:45,220
Wait, dude.

3122
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:46,220
Did Hart come in here?

3123
02:07:46,220 --> 02:07:47,220
Yeah.

3124
02:07:47,220 --> 02:07:48,220
She popped her head in.

3125
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,220
She popped her head in.

3126
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:50,220
That is cracks here.

3127
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:51,220
Does it?

3128
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:52,220
Is that what that means?

3129
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:56,220
I think his jeep is down there.

3130
02:07:56,220 --> 02:07:58,220
I told you that four hours ago.

3131
02:07:58,220 --> 02:07:59,220
No, I know.

3132
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:00,220
But they were at the grocery store.

3133
02:08:00,220 --> 02:08:03,220
I texted Crack and he said he was at the grocery store.

3134
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:04,220
Uh.

3135
02:08:04,220 --> 02:08:05,220
Tell them we don't have enough.

3136
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:07,220
Can you make sure you have enough?

3137
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:10,220
Tell them to get their sexy asses in here.

3138
02:08:10,220 --> 02:08:12,220
I want to get them all so bad.

3139
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:13,220
All right.

3140
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:14,220
I'll get them.

3141
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:15,220
Okay.

3142
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:16,220
I don't know.

3143
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:17,220
They might be busy with something.

3144
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:18,220
Ben.

3145
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:19,220
Uh-huh.

3146
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:20,220
Oh, he has an interview.

3147
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:21,220
How do I?

3148
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:22,220
Press start?

3149
02:08:22,220 --> 02:08:23,220
F2.

3150
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:24,220
What?

3151
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:25,220
What's happening?

3152
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:26,220
I'm pressing.

3153
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:27,220
How did you leave?

3154
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:28,220
I don't know.

3155
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:29,220
I mean, I'm pressing buttons.

3156
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:30,220
Press start?

3157
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:31,220
I am.

3158
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:32,220
What?

3159
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,220
What?

3160
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:34,220
Um.

3161
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:35,220
Cool.

3162
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,220
Hey.

3163
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:37,220
Hey.

3164
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:38,220
Oh.

3165
02:08:38,220 --> 02:08:39,220
Anyway.

3166
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:40,220
Rowdy culture.

3167
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:41,220
Flourishy.

3168
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:42,220
Killer culture.

3169
02:08:42,220 --> 02:08:43,220
Stag.

3170
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:44,220
In the fucking toilet.

3171
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,220
Yeah.

3172
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:46,220
In the toilet.

3173
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:52,220
There's no, there's no, like, you know, like, cohesive, like, actual culture there.

3174
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:56,220
It's just a bunch of people who, like, are killers for reasons completely other than

3175
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:57,220
you in any way.

3176
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:58,220
That's fine.

3177
02:08:58,220 --> 02:09:00,220
Honestly, that doesn't bother me much.

3178
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:01,220
Well, sure.

3179
02:09:01,220 --> 02:09:05,220
But there's no, like, actual, like, there's no, being a killer means nothing other than

3180
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:06,220
that your name is purple.

3181
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:07,220
There's no.

3182
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:08,220
That's good enough, right?

3183
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:09,220
No.

3184
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:10,220
No, it's not.

3185
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:11,220
That's plenty.

3186
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:12,220
Okay, hold on.

3187
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:13,220
Is your controller got unplugged?

3188
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:15,220
I think maybe the controller got unplugged.

3189
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:16,220
That's fine.

3190
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:17,220
It's me only now.

3191
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:18,220
Hey, Apollo.

3192
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:19,220
You're the new cop killer.

3193
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:20,220
No.

3194
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:21,220
Cop killer.

3195
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:22,220
Hey, nice.

3196
02:09:22,220 --> 02:09:23,220
Still the cops tonight.

3197
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:24,220
Tonight.

3198
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:25,220
Whoa.

3199
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:26,220
Cop killer.

3200
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:27,220
It's the law.

3201
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:28,220
That's all.

3202
02:09:28,220 --> 02:09:29,220
That, that, that was the inspiration of the name.

3203
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:31,220
I remember when I first came up with the name where I first cop killers.

3204
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:32,220
Did you pause it?

3205
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:33,220
What's going on?

3206
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:34,220
You, you broke it.

3207
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:35,220
No, you broke it.

3208
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:36,220
What do you mean I broke it?

3209
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:37,220
No, you broke it, dude.

3210
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:38,220
Wait, it moved.

3211
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:39,220
Because you broke it.

3212
02:09:39,220 --> 02:09:40,220
It moved.

3213
02:09:40,220 --> 02:09:41,220
No, Ben, you broke it.

3214
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:43,220
No, I saw him move, but you broke it.

3215
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:44,220
What do I do?

3216
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:45,220
What do I do?

3217
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:46,220
Well, it's running now.

3218
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:47,220
Good.

3219
02:09:47,220 --> 02:09:48,220
No, it has auto saved.

3220
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:49,220
No, it has auto saved.

3221
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:50,220
No, no, Ben.

3222
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:51,220
When should I restart it?

3223
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:53,220
It's broken forever now.

3224
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:55,220
You can't fix it like the disc is broken.

3225
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:57,220
Oh, you cracked the disc.

3226
02:09:57,220 --> 02:09:58,220
You cracked the disc.

3227
02:09:58,220 --> 02:09:59,220
The disc slipped?

3228
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:00,220
Yeah.

3229
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:01,220
You broke it.

3230
02:10:01,220 --> 02:10:02,220
You broke it.

3231
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:03,220
You broke it.

3232
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,220
Wait, it moved.

3233
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:05,220
Because you broke it.

3234
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:06,220
It moved.

3235
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:07,220
The disc slipped?

3236
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:10,220
You're going to have to fucking, we're going to have to take us to GameStop.

3237
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:12,220
I hate GameStop.

3238
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:14,220
I hate GameStop employees.

3239
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:18,220
I hate when they try and make video game references out of our credit card transactions.

3240
02:10:18,220 --> 02:10:25,220
And when we say, hey, you know, this, this, it sounds weird when you get a confirmed transaction

3241
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:27,220
in your debit card and it goes, eh, eh.

3242
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:29,220
Definitely it's like as a cancellation.

3243
02:10:29,220 --> 02:10:32,220
Oh, speaking of it, how much am I being paid for this right now?

3244
02:10:32,220 --> 02:10:33,220
You are.

3245
02:10:33,220 --> 02:10:34,220
$500 per second.

3246
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:35,220
Thank you.

3247
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:36,220
Thank you so much.

3248
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:37,220
You are making bank right now.

3249
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:43,220
You are siphoning the money out of our bank account.

3250
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:44,220
Okay.

3251
02:10:44,220 --> 02:10:46,220
By the way, this is like literally like the worst level in the entire game.

3252
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:47,220
Cool.

3253
02:10:47,220 --> 02:10:48,220
I'm glad we decided to do it.

3254
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:50,220
Hey, it still doesn't think that I'm playing the game.

3255
02:10:50,220 --> 02:10:51,220
Well, that's fun.

3256
02:10:51,220 --> 02:10:52,220
It's not.

3257
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:53,220
No, it's not.

3258
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:54,220
It's not.

3259
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:55,220
No, no, listen.

3260
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:56,220
It's bad.

3261
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:57,220
Well, here, here.

3262
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:59,220
Well, yes.

3263
02:10:59,220 --> 02:11:00,220
Much.

3264
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:01,220
No.

3265
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:02,220
No cutscenes.

3266
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:03,220
They're aged up right now.

3267
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:04,220
They're aged up.

3268
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:05,220
No more cutscenes.

3269
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:06,220
No more cutscenes.

3270
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:09,220
Dude, don't you remember the Clone Wars?

3271
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:10,220
Don't you remember the Clone Wars?

3272
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:13,220
Don't you remember how they're trying to assassinate QAnon?

3273
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:14,220
Look at that, dude.

3274
02:11:14,220 --> 02:11:15,220
That's what you look like.

3275
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:16,220
That's pretty cool.

3276
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:18,220
How many cops do you kill while you're at the police station?

3277
02:11:18,220 --> 02:11:19,220
Four dots.

3278
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:21,220
Well, you'd have to have a gun.

3279
02:11:21,220 --> 02:11:22,220
I don't think that many, honestly.

3280
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:24,220
I mean, how many, like, active police officers are just like,

3281
02:11:24,220 --> 02:11:26,220
hang on like the lobby of a police station?

3282
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:27,220
Probably not that much.

3283
02:11:27,220 --> 02:11:30,220
You could kill like a receptionist, but that wouldn't be a cop, really.

3284
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:33,220
They'd probably have a cop on duty at the desk, right?

3285
02:11:33,220 --> 02:11:34,220
I mean, maybe.

3286
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:35,220
I don't know.

3287
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:36,220
But I'm saying that's not the most effective way.

3288
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:37,220
Dude, they're always trapped.

3289
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:40,220
Unironically, thinking about cops just going into a cop station just now,

3290
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:43,220
maybe you want to eat the rest of those donuts downstairs.

3291
02:11:43,220 --> 02:11:44,220
What?

3292
02:11:44,220 --> 02:11:45,220
Yeah.

3293
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:46,220
Actually, they might be gone.

3294
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:47,220
Dude, this game sucks.

3295
02:11:47,220 --> 02:11:48,220
Why can't I control a character?

3296
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:49,220
Yeah, good question.

3297
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:52,220
Hey, like, literally, like, what happened?

3298
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:53,220
You know what?

3299
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:54,220
You know what?

3300
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:55,220
This is fine.

3301
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:56,220
It's a senior game now.

3302
02:11:56,220 --> 02:11:57,220
Good luck, Ben.

3303
02:11:57,220 --> 02:11:58,220
Here.

3304
02:11:58,220 --> 02:11:59,220
You're welcome.

3305
02:11:59,220 --> 02:12:00,220
This is fine.

3306
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:01,220
I like this.

3307
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:05,220
Oh, oh, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

3308
02:12:05,220 --> 02:12:06,220
Oh, my God.

3309
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:08,220
Ben, I'm about to do something crazy right now.

3310
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:10,220
You're not going to fucking believe what I'm about to do right now.

3311
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:11,220
What are you going to do, dude?

3312
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:12,220
What are you going to do?

3313
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:13,220
You're going to make true Jedi?

3314
02:12:13,220 --> 02:12:15,220
Dude, no, I'm going to do something way better.

3315
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:17,220
I'm going to do something way, way, way, way, way fucking better.

3316
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:19,220
You're not going to believe the shit I did.

3317
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:21,220
There's so much collateral damage in this game.

3318
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:24,220
So many people die, but it's okay because they just fall apart,

3319
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:26,220
and you can always get more LEGO pieces.

3320
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:28,220
All right, hold on.

3321
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:29,220
One out of five?

3322
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:32,220
Yeah, one out of five, two out of five.

3323
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:33,220
Hold on.

3324
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:35,220
Okay, you guys may be thinking yourselves,

3325
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:37,220
oh, wow, you know, a video game.

3326
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:38,220
I love video games.

3327
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:39,220
You may be thinking to yourself,

3328
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:40,220
this is not my beautiful house.

3329
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:41,220
This is not my beautiful life.

3330
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:42,220
This is not my beautiful life.

3331
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:43,220
How did I get it?

3332
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:44,220
You may be thinking to yourself,

3333
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:45,220
this is not good commentary.

3334
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:46,220
How did I get it?

3335
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:49,220
Is there a YouTube community of video games?

3336
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:50,220
There must be, right?

3337
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:51,220
There's board games.

3338
02:12:51,220 --> 02:12:53,220
I know board games.

3339
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:55,220
I feel like there is a video game,

3340
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:57,220
and I feel like I might have said it.

3341
02:12:57,220 --> 02:12:59,220
Dude, it's the anger video game there.

3342
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:00,220
It's not stupid.

3343
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:02,220
The anger video game is Alter Ego Board James.

3344
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:03,220
Oh, it's Alter Ego.

3345
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:05,220
He's like split personality.

3346
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:06,220
Yeah.

3347
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:08,220
He's chill personality.

3348
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:09,220
I remember more.

3349
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:10,220
I think so.

3350
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:13,220
I think Board James is just like a nice man.

3351
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:15,220
So I hate him.

3352
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:17,220
I remember the only episode of Board James

3353
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:19,220
that I ever saw was like him going through

3354
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:21,220
board games that he made when he was like a kid,

3355
02:13:21,220 --> 02:13:22,220
and it was like shit.

3356
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:24,220
He's always like, why are you showing me this?

3357
02:13:24,220 --> 02:13:26,220
Board James is the number one YouTube channel.

3358
02:13:26,220 --> 02:13:27,220
Like what, by the way?

3359
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:30,220
I saw an episode of Board James

3360
02:13:30,220 --> 02:13:35,220
where he's playing video game board games.

3361
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:37,220
You know, like there's a Mario board game

3362
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:39,220
and a Pac-Man board game.

3363
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:41,220
The Pac-Man board game I had as a kid,

3364
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:45,220
and it was like a plastic Pac-Man piece,

3365
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:47,220
and there were marbles on the thing,

3366
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:48,220
and you would move it around.

3367
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,220
You would stamp it on the marbles,

3368
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:53,220
and it would pick the marbles up underneath it.

3369
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:55,220
And I was like, whoa, I played that game, dude.

3370
02:13:55,220 --> 02:13:56,220
I played that video game.

3371
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:58,220
Wow, you're so special for playing a mass

3372
02:13:58,220 --> 02:14:00,220
produced game video game.

3373
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:02,220
I also engaged with that media.

3374
02:14:02,220 --> 02:14:04,220
Wow, dude, I love brands.

3375
02:14:04,220 --> 02:14:05,220
I love brands.

3376
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:07,220
I don't know almost as much as I love franchises.

3377
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:08,220
Hell yeah.

3378
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:11,220
Okay, Ben, you're not prepared for what I'm out to do right now.

3379
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:13,220
Okay, I know a secret.

3380
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:15,220
I know a little bit of a fucking secret.

3381
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:17,220
You can even say that I'm a secret meister.

3382
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:18,220
All right.

3383
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:20,220
Woof, I would never want to.

3384
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:21,220
I don't think I would do that.

3385
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:22,220
That doesn't sound any better.

3386
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:24,220
It requires a little bit of skill.

3387
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:27,220
I might not be able to do it on the first one, but that's fine.

3388
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:29,220
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3389
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:30,220
I was so close.

3390
02:14:30,220 --> 02:14:32,220
I was so close.

3391
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:33,220
Okay, hold on.

3392
02:14:33,220 --> 02:14:35,220
I'm going to wait for them all to respawn.

3393
02:14:35,220 --> 02:14:36,220
End it.

3394
02:14:36,220 --> 02:14:37,220
No, don't worry.

3395
02:14:37,220 --> 02:14:38,220
End it.

3396
02:14:41,220 --> 02:14:44,220
Yeah, I think Kazzy decided that the bargain cracker

3397
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:45,220
cooler than us.

3398
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:46,220
Yeah, you know what?

3399
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:47,220
That's fine.

3400
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:48,220
I did it.

3401
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:49,220
What is this?

3402
02:14:49,220 --> 02:14:50,220
What happened?

3403
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:51,220
The red balloon.

3404
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:53,220
You know what they say about red balloons?

3405
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:55,220
The harder they fuck, the harder they ball.

3406
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:01,220
Red balloons blow by.

3407
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:05,220
You know about new endless warming?

3408
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:06,220
No.

3409
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:08,220
You know about lat dancing?

3410
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:12,220
You know about lat dancing, bro?

3411
02:15:12,220 --> 02:15:13,220
No, sir.

3412
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:14,220
No, sir.

3413
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:15,220
I do not.

3414
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:16,220
I know nothing.

3415
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:19,220
Yes, red brick, red brick, red brick.

3416
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:20,220
I'm just a secret meister.

3417
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:21,220
We're going to trouble, sir.

3418
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:23,220
You are literally going to shit your fucking pants

3419
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:25,220
when you find out what that red brick has.

3420
02:15:25,220 --> 02:15:27,220
Because that means each red brick has its own

3421
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:29,220
like individual power up that it gives you.

3422
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:30,220
It's not randomized at all.

3423
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:32,220
And you're going to shit your fucking pants

3424
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:34,220
when you see what I've got for you.

3425
02:15:35,220 --> 02:15:36,220
Look at this side.

3426
02:15:36,220 --> 02:15:38,220
Look, this is like literally just in like

3427
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:39,220
inside slump or HQ right now.

3428
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:41,220
This is how they commute to work.

3429
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:44,220
It's delicious.

3430
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:45,220
And I know, right?

3431
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:47,220
I'm getting you hooked.

3432
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:48,220
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

3433
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:49,220
I can't smoke.

3434
02:15:49,220 --> 02:15:52,220
I can't get a fucking hooked.

3435
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:54,220
It's far more deadly than breathing in

3436
02:15:54,220 --> 02:15:56,220
than just smoking yourself because it's unfiltered.

3437
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:58,220
Yeah, of course.

3438
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:03,220
Jesus Christ again, again with this thing.

3439
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:06,220
Wow.

3440
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:10,220
This game, like, okay.

3441
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:11,220
Oh, no, sorry.

3442
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:13,220
This level is like not my favorite.

3443
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:16,220
Unlike all the other levels?

3444
02:16:16,220 --> 02:16:17,220
Yes.

3445
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:18,220
So every other level, don't worry.

3446
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:21,220
It's completely fine for what will happen.

3447
02:16:21,220 --> 02:16:23,220
This level is like...

3448
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:24,220
Oh, it's an incredible payoff.

3449
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:26,220
No, no, literally yes.

3450
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:28,220
You're not going to believe what we got.

3451
02:16:28,220 --> 02:16:30,220
This game would be so fucking bad

3452
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:32,220
if it weren't for what I just did just now.

3453
02:16:32,220 --> 02:16:35,220
Like the game scene that I've entered currently

3454
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:38,220
is going to rock your little socks off.

3455
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:39,220
Am I crazy?

3456
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:40,220
Or is it too cold in here?

3457
02:16:40,220 --> 02:16:41,220
Yeah, you are crazy.

3458
02:16:43,220 --> 02:16:44,220
But you know what?

3459
02:16:44,220 --> 02:16:45,220
Your house, your rules.

3460
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:46,220
That's right.

3461
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:47,220
Wow.

3462
02:16:47,220 --> 02:16:48,220
Thanks.

3463
02:16:48,220 --> 02:16:49,220
Oh, it actually got colder.

3464
02:16:49,220 --> 02:16:51,220
It's actually colder outside than inside.

3465
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:53,220
Wow, I suburbed in and out of that.

3466
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:54,220
Wow.

3467
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:55,220
Please.

3468
02:16:55,220 --> 02:16:56,220
Please.

3469
02:16:57,220 --> 02:16:58,220
Please.

3470
02:16:59,220 --> 02:17:00,220
Please.

3471
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:01,220
Better you than me.

3472
02:17:02,220 --> 02:17:03,220
What?

3473
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:04,220
You idiot.

3474
02:17:04,220 --> 02:17:06,220
Just touch it.

3475
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:09,220
Just hit it for fuck's sake.

3476
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:13,220
Why can't you do it?

3477
02:17:14,220 --> 02:17:15,220
Okay, there.

3478
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:17,220
Even that didn't look like you actually hit it.

3479
02:17:17,220 --> 02:17:18,220
What?

3480
02:17:18,220 --> 02:17:20,220
That one, I don't know what happened.

3481
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:26,220
Just hit it.

3482
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:28,220
Crack is here.

3483
02:17:28,220 --> 02:17:30,220
Does he want to hang out?

3484
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:31,220
He's making dinner.

3485
02:17:31,220 --> 02:17:32,220
What?

3486
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:34,220
They're making dinner downstairs.

3487
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:35,220
What are they making?

3488
02:17:35,220 --> 02:17:40,220
They're making like pasta with like a spinach cream sauce.

3489
02:17:40,220 --> 02:17:41,220
Pasta?

3490
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:42,220
Are they using the Alfredo?

3491
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:43,220
Garlic bread.

3492
02:17:43,220 --> 02:17:44,220
Are they using my Alfredo?

3493
02:17:44,220 --> 02:17:45,220
I don't know.

3494
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:46,220
Thank God.

3495
02:17:46,220 --> 02:17:47,220
Thank fucking God.

3496
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:48,220
You're so bad at this.

3497
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:49,220
No, I'm not.

3498
02:17:49,220 --> 02:17:50,220
I'm really great.

3499
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:51,220
I'm so embarrassed for you.

3500
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:52,220
What happened here?

3501
02:17:52,220 --> 02:17:53,220
He couldn't fucking hit the thing.

3502
02:17:53,220 --> 02:17:54,220
Why isn't it RFCK now?

3503
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:56,220
He couldn't perform the series of tests.

3504
02:17:56,220 --> 02:17:57,220
I know, right?

3505
02:17:57,220 --> 02:17:58,220
I think purple and green.

3506
02:17:58,220 --> 02:17:59,220
Yeah, it's pretty good.

3507
02:17:59,220 --> 02:18:01,220
I thought you guys put a filter on it for a minute.

3508
02:18:01,220 --> 02:18:02,220
Nah, dude.

3509
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:03,220
This is just straight up.

3510
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:04,220
Yeah, you wish.

3511
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:07,220
Don't you remember Star Wars Episode II?

3512
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:09,220
Were they going to Neil?

3513
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:10,220
Los Angeles City?

3514
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:11,220
I can't even walk in.

3515
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:12,220
Where is this?

3516
02:18:12,220 --> 02:18:13,220
This is Coruscant.

3517
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:14,220
This is Coruscant.

3518
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:15,220
What?

3519
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:16,220
This is Coruscant.

3520
02:18:16,220 --> 02:18:17,220
Come on, dude.

3521
02:18:17,220 --> 02:18:18,220
Yes.

3522
02:18:18,220 --> 02:18:19,220
Yes.

3523
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:20,220
It's a Patreon you get.

3524
02:18:20,220 --> 02:18:21,220
You're looking at it.

3525
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:23,220
You see it before you.

3526
02:18:23,220 --> 02:18:27,220
It's a Patreon you can get inside Nero Cafe, Cafe Nero.

3527
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:33,220
It's a free Discord game you can play in your browser for free.

3528
02:18:33,220 --> 02:18:35,220
Click the link in the description.

3529
02:18:35,220 --> 02:18:37,220
I love this by the way.

3530
02:18:37,220 --> 02:18:38,220
What?

3531
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:39,220
It's just the way that it's flying.

3532
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:40,220
What do you mean?

3533
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:41,220
He can't.

3534
02:18:41,220 --> 02:18:42,220
He just can't do it.

3535
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:43,220
It's funny.

3536
02:18:43,220 --> 02:18:44,220
He just can't fucking do it.

3537
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:45,220
He can't handle it.

3538
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:46,220
Nah.

3539
02:18:46,220 --> 02:18:47,220
What do you call this right now?

3540
02:18:47,220 --> 02:18:48,220
I don't know.

3541
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:49,220
What do I call this?

3542
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:51,220
What do you call this right now?

3543
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:52,220
Come on.

3544
02:18:53,220 --> 02:18:55,220
Give me a little cheat.

3545
02:18:55,220 --> 02:18:58,220
Give me a little fucking pork.

3546
02:19:03,220 --> 02:19:05,220
Cracks a little bit of a snake man.

3547
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:07,220
He's a total snake.

3548
02:19:07,220 --> 02:19:08,220
Absolutely.

3549
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:13,220
I'm not really scared because I looked at him constantly and I ran up to him to go to the toilet.

3550
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:15,220
You just charged him.

3551
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:16,220
He got a wrangle.

3552
02:19:16,220 --> 02:19:18,220
He got a wrangle that man.

3553
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:21,220
Did he go into a defensive posture?

3554
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:23,220
Dude, it's an all out brawl.

3555
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:24,220
All out brawl right now.

3556
02:19:24,220 --> 02:19:25,220
All out brawl.

3557
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:26,220
All out brawl right now.

3558
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:28,220
In this war right now.

3559
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:33,220
By the way, if you ever want to know, there's a video game abstraction of fighting in this war.

3560
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:35,220
You shoot them and you're like, what does it really look like?

3561
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:36,220
This is what every encounter looks like.

3562
02:19:36,220 --> 02:19:38,220
This is what every encounter looks like.

3563
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:41,220
What did you do?

3564
02:19:41,220 --> 02:19:43,220
I put your ass on Instagram dude.

3565
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:45,220
Damn dude.

3566
02:19:45,220 --> 02:19:47,220
Dude Chris, remember this part?

3567
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:49,220
Oh, he got down in flames.

3568
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:51,220
Crash into the fucking ground.

3569
02:19:53,220 --> 02:19:54,220
Yeah dude.

3570
02:19:54,220 --> 02:19:55,220
Hell yeah.

3571
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:58,220
No, kill him.

3572
02:19:58,220 --> 02:19:59,220
Not kill him.

3573
02:19:59,220 --> 02:20:00,220
Okay, dead.

3574
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:02,220
He shot him.

3575
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:05,220
Now his face has to melt.

3576
02:20:05,220 --> 02:20:06,220
It didn't do it.

3577
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:07,220
Alright, you're going to scream.

3578
02:20:07,220 --> 02:20:10,220
We'll let you find out what was in that red brick that I got here.

3579
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:11,220
I already want to scream.

3580
02:20:11,220 --> 02:20:13,220
Stunt magnet.

3581
02:20:16,220 --> 02:20:20,220
So now we're going to be able to get studs and look halfway across the fucking universe.

3582
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:22,220
Dude, we're going to get true Jedi every single one.

3583
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:23,220
I know.

3584
02:20:23,220 --> 02:20:24,220
Besides the one we just did.

3585
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:26,220
Yeah, not that one obviously.

3586
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:27,220
That's fine.

3587
02:20:27,220 --> 02:20:28,220
Obviously that's never happening.

3588
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:29,220
Can you story it?

3589
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:30,220
Why doesn't it work?

3590
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:31,220
Please.

3591
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:32,220
Dude, no.

3592
02:20:32,220 --> 02:20:33,220
Please.

3593
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:34,220
Please.

3594
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:35,220
No.

3595
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:36,220
Please.

3596
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:37,220
No.

3597
02:20:37,220 --> 02:20:38,220
Please.

3598
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:39,220
No, sorry.

3599
02:20:39,220 --> 02:20:40,220
Okay, okay, please.

3600
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:41,220
Okay, please.

3601
02:20:41,220 --> 02:20:42,220
Okay, please.

3602
02:20:42,220 --> 02:20:43,220
Okay, please.

3603
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:45,220
It used to let you skip the cutscenes.

3604
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:46,220
No, it didn't.

3605
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:47,220
Yes it did.

3606
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:48,220
When?

3607
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:49,220
I remember skipping the cutscenes.

3608
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:50,220
No you don't.

3609
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:51,220
Yes I do.

3610
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:52,220
It was really short.

3611
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:53,220
No.

3612
02:20:53,220 --> 02:20:54,220
There was even a button.

3613
02:20:54,220 --> 02:20:55,220
It was like Chris started to skip.

3614
02:20:55,220 --> 02:20:56,220
No.

3615
02:20:56,220 --> 02:20:57,220
Yes.

3616
02:20:57,220 --> 02:20:58,220
It happened.

3617
02:20:58,220 --> 02:20:59,220
No.

3618
02:20:59,220 --> 02:21:00,220
It happened.

Adaptive difficulty?

3637
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:27,220
It adapts to our actions to create a harder game?

3638
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:28,220
Why would we want that?

3639
02:21:28,220 --> 02:21:33,980
Well, because we want to challenge ourselves. I don't I absolutely don't want that. Oh wait what?

3640
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:36,860

3656
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:55,700
This guy doesn't even want to grind studs

3657
02:22:56,500 --> 02:22:59,700
People know this game are like frustrated like dude like you could get so many studs right now

3716
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:10,580
Whoa

3717
02:27:10,580 --> 02:27:12,580
Whoa, I told you

3718
02:27:13,300 --> 02:27:15,300
Whoa

3719
02:27:15,380 --> 02:27:17,380
He loves it

3720
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:20,740
Dude, you know, okay. Do that again real quick. This is how you do it Simon

3721
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:23,620
You have to you have to always like you have to like like whenever you want to enter the HQ

3722
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:27,540
You just have to go on these like fucking like dancing little panels right here make the jingle play

3723
02:27:28,820 --> 02:27:30,820
Look at this right now

3724
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:39,700
Realizing it was an executive plan course their pro quo they're expecting

3725
02:27:48,020 --> 02:27:55,540
No, no, um, of course prick per quo you're expecting a ruler's executive

3726
02:27:56,820 --> 02:28:02,580
But it's not the kind you've been used to but certainly game for a laugh

3727
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:13,060
That's that's the cut version of ah, no, uh, please enlist jv

3728
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:18,980
No, no, okay start killer Mufasa's juvia and Simba's rowdy

3729
02:28:20,420 --> 02:28:22,420
Simba's a fucking jew

3730
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:25,940
Mufasa's a killer. Yeah, okay. Mufasa's absolutely a killer

3731
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:32,180
The arc of the lanking is Simba becoming going from a juvia, going from a juvia learning how to be around

3732
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:36,820
No, no, no, no, well, that's I actually disagree with that. He goes from being a rowdy with pigma and

3733
02:28:37,380 --> 02:28:39,380
Mufasa, pigma and sumo

3734
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:46,260
He's he's yeah, okay. He's a rowdy. Then he becomes a state. He starts as a rowdy hanging hanging out with some kind of a car

3735
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:53,620
He's lying around doing nothing. He's not doing anything at all. Okay. Okay, but but he's being rowdy while doing nothing

3736
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:57,780
I okay, I think the progression is clear

3737
02:28:57,780 --> 02:29:02,740
He's a juvia rowdy and then he has to become like a quote-unquote noble person aka a fucking bitch

3738
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:08,420
That'd be mowed down in the streets, right, dude. Dude if Mufasa were here, how would it beat the shit out of him, dude?

3739
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:11,940
We'd beat the shit out of him, dude. We'd be like antelope on that motherfucker

3740
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:17,620
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was. We would be like antelope on the line. What does that mean?

3741
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:22,340
Because he died because he got trampled by antelope. That's not antelope. Will there be?

3742
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:25,540
So you dumb. I don't know what the difference between those two things are

3743
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:29,460
And I don't suspect that there is none. There is a big difference

3744
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:35,380
Wildebeest are just like antelope, but if you like made them barra, that's so terrible

3745
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:42,740
It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. You made that up. You invented that. They're puffing animals in Africa with horns

3746
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:46,580
The same they're just they're just barra antelope

3747
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:50,660
Antelope are just petite wildebeest

3748
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:54,660
Petite? Petite something a fucking like a wrong word to say

3749
02:29:55,220 --> 02:30:01,780
Not it not that sexual. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's so like it means something but like, you know what it means, you know

3750
02:30:03,460 --> 02:30:08,660
Like people can say things and like like they try to act like they we know they don't want to have sex

3751
02:30:08,660 --> 02:30:11,940
But like we know they do want to have sex when you can tell you can see it in their eyes

3752
02:30:13,220 --> 02:30:16,260
The worst kind of person is one that wants to have sex

3753
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:20,980
Well that but even worse than that at least people who want to have sex and say that they are are honest about it

3754
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:22,500
People who are like

3755
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:27,780
They do things or like draw things or speaking away and which isn't like directly horny

3756
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:35,220
But you know deep down that they are horny like what are I see I see artists all the time that draw like huge tits and ass

3757
02:30:35,620 --> 02:30:39,940
All the time. It's not that they're drawing porn, right? It's not like they are in our nuts. If we're artists

3758
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:44,660
That's their job. They are making porn. They are honest about it. It's like they're trying to pretend in a way trying to not

3759
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:47,060
accentuate

3760
02:30:48,020 --> 02:30:52,980
They're trying to not accentuate the fact that they are obviously drawing like porn and tits and shit like that

3761
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:57,860
It's just it's just dishonest. Well, okay, not even that even if they don't have like the big tits and the big ass

3762
02:30:58,020 --> 02:31:03,620
You can tell. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no great. When any artist draws any character you can tell based on the way they draw

3763
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:08,260
Even in just the face if they want to fuck that character. Agreed. Agreed. Yeah, just the face you can tell

3764
02:31:08,260 --> 02:31:10,260
Usually it's the indication is

3765
02:31:10,820 --> 02:31:12,820
Is they have eyelashes

3766
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:17,700
Well, if it's a girl like just this is just in general if there's if there's blushy if there's a lot of blushy

3767
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:23,060
Yes, they want to fuck the character. I would say if there's a character who doesn't have eyelashes normally

3768
02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:26,900
And it's a girl. Yeah, but then they give it eyelashes. Oh, yeah

3769
02:31:27,620 --> 02:31:33,060
You see I'm more perceptive with uh, when this happens male characters. Uh, where do we go? Really?

3770
02:31:33,140 --> 02:31:37,380
I'm way more prospective with with with female characters. I want I wonder why

3771
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:41,140
I wonder why because this this are tits

3772
02:31:41,620 --> 02:31:43,620
No, there are

3773
02:31:45,620 --> 02:31:52,980
Okay, muchy, where do I go help walk around? I am do it harder. Oh wait Ben's playing. Yeah, put a dumb ass

3774
02:31:54,100 --> 02:31:58,900
Me? No, no Ben. Yeah, dude. Fuck it. Yeah, come on, dude

3775
02:32:00,740 --> 02:32:06,180
Come on, dude. Where do I go? Go back. Are you looking at uh, what's this place?

3776
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:10,820
Yeah, I'm trying to find the the 10 step program on how to throw the over go behind this government

3777
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:12,260
How'd you find this?

3778
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:14,260
Because I just came back to the to the

3779
02:32:15,220 --> 02:32:18,260
Table and tom we're just talking about it. Well, okay

3780
02:32:18,820 --> 02:32:23,140
Because because one of my friends isn't call it down every single day. He gets stopped by

3781
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:28,420
The the bob of vacan uh radical revolutionary communist party

3782
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:31,060
And uh, I want to point so

3783
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:36,980
So there there's some it's it's really confusing you see because there are so many things that are all titled things

3784
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:41,540
That I would think that I would want to click on but in fact, they're actually just dead ends because what's like doesn't work at all

3785
02:32:42,020 --> 02:32:48,500
So there's stuff like points of attention for the revolution find out about the revolution club of continuing interest and key questions

3786
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:53,780
Of orientation and strategy important publications. I don't always question my orientation. Oh, yeah

3787
02:32:54,740 --> 02:32:56,740
I think it might be under how yes, oh

3788
02:32:57,540 --> 02:33:02,900
Duh, of course it's under how we can win wins and bold how we can really

3789
02:33:03,700 --> 02:33:08,740
Really and make and revolution are all in bold how we can really make revolution to do this

3790
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:13,220
You need to know we need an actual revolution what we need to do now

3791
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:19,620
How we can do to defeat them why we need real revolution. Do you follow? Yeah, I'm with you, man

3792
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:24,820
Okay, so he has this big long prologue bob of vacan the literal god bob of vacan

3793
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:27,060
In fact before I even go any further

3794
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:31,220
Let me just go let me just point out bob of vacan and the way that he chooses to

3795
02:33:31,860 --> 02:33:38,660
Represent himself in like like on the main page of his website. This is how he chooses to to do it

3796
02:33:38,740 --> 02:33:43,540
Anyway, I'll also tell how bob I know but again friends in college gets off every single day by these guys

3797
02:33:43,700 --> 02:33:49,060
And they try and convince him to join a party a political party that that is called

3798
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:56,260
The the revolutionary communist party and when you put revolutionary in your political party name

3799
02:33:56,660 --> 02:34:00,260
It's so disingenuous because it's like if you're a player revolution

3800
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:05,220
Not gonna make that you're like your stated goal, you know, but anyway, this is bob of vacan

3801
02:34:05,540 --> 02:34:09,220
He'll show up real gay. He has a fucking true blooded julie, right?

3802
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:16,660
He looks he looks great. He looks great. He looks way worse. Please navigate to revcom.us

3803
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:19,380
Please do that so you can understand what he looks like. Anyway

3804
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:25,940
Here are he he he was he's been campaigning since the fucking 60s. He was a hip the original one nice

3805
02:34:26,580 --> 02:34:28,580
He's need deep in communism

3806
02:34:28,820 --> 02:34:32,580
And he's been calling for communism and I'm just gonna read

3807
02:34:33,140 --> 02:34:40,340
Some I'm gonna read under how we could defeat them. This is his stated wages is 50 nights in his government and

3808
02:34:41,300 --> 02:34:47,860
I just want you to listen clearly to what he is saying and try and parse through all the pros what the actual

3809
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:56,340
You know stated steps are so please try really hard. Yeah, okay. This is from bob of vacan. This is part of the ba6

3810
02:34:57,620 --> 02:35:00,820
When the revolutionary situation is clearly emerging

3811
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:08,420
rapidly transform backbone forces of the revolution into organized fighting forces in key strategic areas

3812
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:10,900
Carry out the necessary training

3813
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:19,060
Obtain the necessary equipment and provide for the basic logistical needs of this revolutionary fighting force to start the all-out fight

3814
02:35:19,540 --> 02:35:23,860
While preventing the enemy from crushing the revolutionary forces at this crucial juncture

3815
02:35:24,180 --> 02:35:29,700
Back up these core fighting forces with millions of organized into powerful reserves for the revolutionary

3816
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:34,660
Where's he gonna get millions organized into no no no ben you're not listening

3817
02:35:35,220 --> 02:35:37,860
Rapidly transform backbone

3818
02:35:38,660 --> 02:35:41,620
into this fighting force for the revolution

3819
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:51,300
So like like when the red when the revolution is a situation is clearly emerging like right now

3820
02:35:52,580 --> 02:35:56,980
For example currently then just rapidly transform backbone forces

3821
02:35:58,020 --> 02:36:00,660
So that's first step that well that answers my first question

3822
02:36:01,620 --> 02:36:03,620
Initiate actions throughout the country

3823
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:07,540
Accompanied by a bold declaration to the world

3824
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:15,300
Which makes clear that there is an organized force determined to defeat the forces of the old order and bring into a new

3825
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:21,620
revolutionary system upon completion of these initial actions quickly regroup forces for

3826
02:36:22,100 --> 02:36:27,940
Follow on actions and maintain the momentum of the revolution. Okay. I can I can agree with all

3827
02:36:28,100 --> 02:36:30,660
So so so tell the world that the week is this

3828
02:36:31,300 --> 02:36:33,700
Yeah, which okay good plan good first

3829
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:41,780
Counter the enemy's superior destructive force by seeking superior force the superior destructive force by seeking to

3830
02:36:42,180 --> 02:36:43,940
in in italics

3831
02:36:43,940 --> 02:36:48,980
Fight only on favorable terms and actively avoiding decisive encounters

3832
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:53,700
Which would determine the outcome of the whole thing until the quote unquote

3833
02:36:54,020 --> 02:36:59,460
Balance of forces has shifted overwhelmingly in the favor of the revolution so win

3834
02:37:00,180 --> 02:37:02,980
Yeah, yeah, well, it's like wait to fight until we can win

3835
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:11,700
Utilize equipment captured from the enemy in ways that fit the fighting strategy of the revolution

3836
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:16,580
Build up political and logistic basis of support in key strategic areas

3837
02:37:16,820 --> 02:37:21,620
But do not attempt to openly control or govern territory until the necessary

3838
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:26,020
Favorable balance forces has been these are a lot of words. Yeah. Yeah

3839
02:37:26,820 --> 02:37:29,300
You're getting it Caroline. You're you're starting to get it

3840
02:37:30,340 --> 02:37:36,580
In in a real revolution none of this like means anything tactile. Yeah, so it's all like

3841
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:41,700
Listen when the revolution starts when the revolution starts

3842
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:46,580
We win it. We win. Yeah, basically like we transform into a fighting force

3843
02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:48,820
Then use guerrilla tactics to win

3844
02:37:49,220 --> 02:37:55,940
That's the entirety of the plan not like what cities to capture and it's not like this is for like to export into the entire world

3845
02:37:55,940 --> 02:37:58,580
This is like four of the united states four right here right now

3846
02:37:58,900 --> 02:38:03,780
He could clearly get into detail about what his plans are but but i'm sure

3847
02:38:04,180 --> 02:38:09,460
I'm sure that he's ready for the legality of it and like if he actually tries to ferment actual revolution

3848
02:38:09,700 --> 02:38:13,540
They could very easily get shit on and destroyed by the actual government

3849
02:38:13,700 --> 02:38:17,620
So it's just being so vague that it means absolutely fucking nothing

3850
02:38:17,860 --> 02:38:21,860
So why write this blog post of it if it is just you saying listen

3851
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:24,500
When the revolution starts

3852
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:26,500
Wait until we win

3853
02:38:26,660 --> 02:38:31,220
Okay, so what is this revolution for by the way? What's the problem? Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, Ben

3854
02:38:31,380 --> 02:38:35,780
You're way all fucking based on the way out face. Okay, it's new communism

3855
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:40,100
Which is scientifically proven to enhance the human condition

3856
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:47,300
Scientific communism a.k.a new communism, which is what he calls it. I believe that I believe that on 100%

3857
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:51,140
I think he's right. I'm on board. You're on board with new communism. Yeah, I think so

3858
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:57,140
Bob the vacant. He's meditated on communism through the good and the admittedly bad, you know of communism

3859
02:38:57,140 --> 02:39:03,460
That's why he's released communism to a new communism. What like new coke this time. It'll be better

3860
02:39:04,420 --> 02:39:07,380
It's scientifically proven to our business new communism

3861
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:10,260
Did you even read the b.a.6?

3862
02:39:11,380 --> 02:39:13,380
I've been even reading b.a.6. I haven't

3863
02:39:13,700 --> 02:39:15,700
He was depressed and suicidal

3864
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:22,740
He had to fuck the pedophore. He had to skip Bob the vacant's course on new communism because he was depressed

3865
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:25,220
and suicidal

3866
02:39:26,020 --> 02:39:29,620
Well, what would you do if you were depressed and suicidal and suicidal?

3867
02:39:32,180 --> 02:39:34,260
I mean, I mean what mr. Mead man made a video

3868
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:39,700
We all watched it and it was used to Mr. Mead man made a free game you can play

3869
02:39:41,460 --> 02:39:43,460
Right now click that link in the description

3870
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:46,180
And list killers all I really care about

3871
02:39:47,140 --> 02:39:52,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, honestly, that's like the best part of the entire occasion is was listening to his voice

3872
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:56,580
And suicidal this degenerate

3873
02:39:57,620 --> 02:40:00,660
Uh, I murdered him. You got him. Do you see a killer guy?

3874
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:04,100
No, you didn't dude. You're about to go into the kill or you're about to splatter on the floor

3875
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:06,820
Oh

3876
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:14,900
I got shot with a ship gun. That's bad. Dude. I love Boba Fett. Dude. Oh my god. But dude, that's my favorite character

3877
02:40:15,700 --> 02:40:23,140
He's rich. He's rich in that feel that feel when you walk into t-do and you and they say boba and I say

3878
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:29,780
Boba fett because I fucking love star wars start panning on the desk jump over the desk beat the shit out of them

3879
02:40:30,740 --> 02:40:32,740
You should

3880
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:38,660
You can't take high five tonight

3881
02:40:39,300 --> 02:40:43,940
If I accidentally breathe in your face through my mouth, you'll die. Yes. Yeah. I choke on it

3882
02:40:44,980 --> 02:40:50,580
It makes me cough. That's funny. Dude. I love cough the the going with the dead dude. Breathe that in through your mouth

3883
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:53,540
No, when it's breathing in

3884
02:40:53,860 --> 02:40:54,820
Yeah

3885
02:40:54,820 --> 02:40:58,020
Fuck yeah, dude. That's so terrible. It gets caught in your throat

3886
02:40:58,020 --> 02:41:08,020
Oh my god, Ben. We're so close. Not close enough. We're super close. We're super close. We're zero calories sweetener right now. We're zero calories sweetener.

3887
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:11,020
That's right. Close. I know.

3888
02:41:11,020 --> 02:41:14,020
Continue your story, bro. You gotta continue that story.

3889
02:41:14,020 --> 02:41:27,020
I must. By the way, guys, we were talking over Baba Vakyan's word, dude. We gotta continue. We gotta know how to fight the real actual revolution, which is how we refer to it constantly in bold and italics, the actual revolution.

3890
02:41:27,020 --> 02:41:30,020
As opposed to the other revolutions, which don't count.

3891
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:34,020
Oh, this is the thing I can skip at the start, but that's what I was thinking of.

3892
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:44,020
Open. Open. This is the worst level in the entire game. This is so, so fucking...

3893
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:50,020
Wait, I believe it's this level. It might not be. It might be the next level after this. I forget.

3894
02:41:50,020 --> 02:41:52,020
Word up.

3895
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:58,020
Oh, no, no, no. This is actually just a long cutscene. Never mind. This is great level. This is fantastic. This is the best level I've ever heard in my entire life.

3896
02:41:58,020 --> 02:42:01,020
Okay. I thought it might be. I had a suspicion.

3897
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:06,020
Oh. Again. Again.

3898
02:42:06,020 --> 02:42:09,020
Look at it.

3899
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:12,020
I would give anything to skip this cutscene.

3900
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:15,020
Dude, Ben, I'm hard right now.

3901
02:42:15,020 --> 02:42:18,020
Me too, but it's not in a good way.

3902
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:21,020
It's too much for the podcast.

3903
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:23,020
Look, you're going into Saturn right now.

3904
02:42:23,020 --> 02:42:24,020
That's not.

3905
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:26,020
This is a galaxy far, far away.

3906
02:42:26,020 --> 02:42:28,020
Why is someone going to piss in a jar and find out what color it is?

3907
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:30,020
I'll do it. If I have to pee, I'll do it.

3908
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:33,020
You can pee if you try.

3909
02:42:33,020 --> 02:42:38,020
Okay. When you pee and you don't have to, or even when you pee but you don't do it, right?

3910
02:42:38,020 --> 02:42:39,020
When you fuck it up.

3911
02:42:39,020 --> 02:42:42,020
Oh, no, no, no. Ben, all right, Rockley, let me know if you know this feel.

3912
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:49,020
When you pee, but just sometimes randomly, it's like if you still feel like you have to pee and like you were at like mid-pee but you know that you don't have to pee.

3913
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:50,020
When you have an E.T.I.

3914
02:42:50,020 --> 02:42:52,020
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3915
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:54,020
Okay, audience, it's hard to explain.

3916
02:42:54,020 --> 02:42:58,020
Sometimes I'll pee and then like it will like, I'll stop.

3917
02:42:58,020 --> 02:42:59,020
I'll just fuck it up.

3918
02:42:59,020 --> 02:43:03,020
But I'll fuck it up somehow, like I'll pinch my dick too hard or something to that effect.

3919
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:05,020
And then like it will feel like I'm still pee, but I'm not.

3920
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:09,020
You know, I go for the twist, I go for the dick twist and it just doesn't quite...

3921
02:43:09,020 --> 02:43:10,020
Yeah, exactly.

3922
02:43:10,020 --> 02:43:11,020
Doesn't work out.

3923
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:12,020
Exactly. See, Ben gets it.

3924
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:17,020
Maintain the initiative, or if it is temporarily lost, regain it.

3925
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:18,020
Oh my god.

3926
02:43:18,020 --> 02:43:20,020
Yeah, okay, I'm on board with that.

3927
02:43:20,020 --> 02:43:21,020
That makes sense.

3928
02:43:21,020 --> 02:43:22,020
That makes sense to me.

3929
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:26,020
Through surprise and maneuver, fight in ways...

3930
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:28,020
This guy's really thought about it.

3931
02:43:28,020 --> 02:43:30,020
Fight in ways the enemy does not anticipate.

3932
02:43:30,020 --> 02:43:33,020
Full sentence in the fight.

3933
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:45,020
Carry out actions to keep the enemy off balance, disrupting the concentration and utilization of his forces and contributing to their disintegration.

3934
02:43:45,020 --> 02:43:46,020
Who's he?

3935
02:43:46,020 --> 02:43:48,020
The enemy.

3936
02:43:48,020 --> 02:43:49,020
So who's the enemy?

3937
02:43:49,020 --> 02:43:50,020
The United States.

3938
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:53,020
Okay, so he is the United States forces.

3939
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:54,020
Yeah.

3940
02:43:54,020 --> 02:43:55,020
We'll never anticipate.

3941
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:57,020
We gotta make sure they don't anticipate our sneak attack.

3942
02:43:57,020 --> 02:43:58,020
Dude, that...

3943
02:43:58,020 --> 02:44:00,020
Okay, you went to a party?

3944
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:02,020
And you invited the United States government?

3945
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:03,020
In part of the enemy?

3946
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:05,020
Maybe a little friend?

3947
02:44:05,020 --> 02:44:07,020
I did, I can't get enough of them.

3948
02:44:07,020 --> 02:44:14,020
God, Ben, do you remember when I, your truly little friend, N.Y.A., were forced...

3949
02:44:14,020 --> 02:44:18,020
Forced a third party to get buffalo wings on Halloween.

3950
02:44:18,020 --> 02:44:19,020
I did, I do.

3951
02:44:19,020 --> 02:44:20,020
And you know what?

3952
02:44:20,020 --> 02:44:22,020
It was cruel and unusual.

3953
02:44:22,020 --> 02:44:28,020
Yeah, because with tooth decay, Albert fucked that horse and he went away.

3954
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:31,020
Nay, nay, whip, nay, nay.

3955
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:32,020
Oh, you died to hit those.

3956
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:33,020
You died to hit them.

3957
02:44:33,020 --> 02:44:36,020
Even if you jump up into them, even if you jump up into them, you die by the way.

3958
02:44:36,020 --> 02:44:38,020
Well, I should probably consider it then.

3959
02:44:38,020 --> 02:44:39,020
Yeah.

3960
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:40,020
Don't you jump up into that?

3961
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:41,020
The thing that you would do?

3962
02:44:41,020 --> 02:44:42,020
Yes.

3963
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:43,020
Wait, what?

3964
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:44,020
Okay, good job.

3965
02:44:44,020 --> 02:44:46,020
Could you just touch it, period?

3966
02:44:46,020 --> 02:44:47,020
Yeah.

3967
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:48,020
Who's Ben?

3968
02:44:48,020 --> 02:44:49,020
What do you think we're trying to do here?

3969
02:44:49,020 --> 02:44:50,020
What are we trying to do here?

3970
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:51,020
Ben's trying to get all the nukes.

3971
02:44:51,020 --> 02:44:52,020
Like, there's one.

3972
02:44:52,020 --> 02:44:53,020
Ben has such a blue or his.

3973
02:44:53,020 --> 02:44:54,020
There's one.

3974
02:44:54,020 --> 02:44:55,020
There's one.

3975
02:44:55,020 --> 02:44:56,020
There's one.

3976
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:57,020
There's one.

3977
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:58,020
I got one.

3978
02:44:58,020 --> 02:45:00,020
Ben's such a kind of person who doesn't try to get all the nukes.

3979
02:45:00,020 --> 02:45:06,020
Always conduct operations and act in ways that are in line with the emancipating outlook

3980
02:45:06,020 --> 02:45:08,020
and goals of the revolution.

3981
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:09,020
Yeah.

3982
02:45:09,020 --> 02:45:11,020
And turn the barbaric actions of the enemy against him.

3983
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:14,020
To win greater forces for the revolution.

3984
02:45:14,020 --> 02:45:17,020
Including those who come over from the ranks of the enemy.

3985
02:45:17,020 --> 02:45:18,020
Oh, yeah.

3986
02:45:18,020 --> 02:45:20,020
So we'll be a forgiving god.

3987
02:45:20,020 --> 02:45:21,020
Yeah.

3988
02:45:21,020 --> 02:45:22,020
We'll let them.

3989
02:45:22,020 --> 02:45:23,020
We're going to go Julius Caesar.

3990
02:45:23,020 --> 02:45:26,020
We're not going to kill the people who we probably should kill.

3991
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:29,020
And it worked out really good for him.

3992
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:34,020
Combining strategic direction and coordination for the fight as a whole.

3993
02:45:34,020 --> 02:45:38,020
With decentralized actions and initiative by local units and leaders.

3994
02:45:38,020 --> 02:45:42,020
Relying on mass support, the intelligence this provides for the revolution.

3995
02:45:42,020 --> 02:45:44,020
And the denial of intelligence to the enemy.

3996
02:45:44,020 --> 02:45:49,020
Counter the enemy's efforts to find, fix, and annihilate revolutionary leadership and

3997
02:45:49,020 --> 02:45:50,020
key fighting units.

3998
02:45:50,020 --> 02:45:53,020
Rapidly replace forces and leaders that are lost.

3999
02:45:53,020 --> 02:45:56,020
Continue to train and deploy new forces and leaders.

4000
02:45:56,020 --> 02:45:57,020
Yeah.

4001
02:45:57,020 --> 02:45:59,020
It's going in one or not the other at this point.

4002
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:00,020
Um.

4003
02:46:00,020 --> 02:46:01,020
No.

4004
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:02,020
Listen.

4005
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:03,020
Dude.

4006
02:46:03,020 --> 02:46:04,020
Dude.

4007
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:05,020
We got to replenish our leaders.

4008
02:46:05,020 --> 02:46:10,020
Directly hinder the relation between this all out fight and the situation, including

4009
02:46:10,020 --> 02:46:13,020
the character and level of revolutionary struggle.

4010
02:46:13,020 --> 02:46:16,020
Struggle in countries to the south and the north.

4011
02:46:16,020 --> 02:46:18,020
Let's struggle like this.

4012
02:46:18,020 --> 02:46:19,020
All right.

4013
02:46:19,020 --> 02:46:20,020
This is the final point.

4014
02:46:20,020 --> 02:46:21,020
What time is it?

4015
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:22,020
How did I make it?

4016
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:23,020
How did I get through?

4017
02:46:23,020 --> 02:46:24,020
I don't understand.

4018
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:25,020
Just walk through.

4019
02:46:25,020 --> 02:46:26,020
Are you fucking dumb?

4020
02:46:26,020 --> 02:46:27,020
Just walk through.

4021
02:46:27,020 --> 02:46:28,020
Wait, it blocked me.

4022
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:29,020
It blocked me.

4023
02:46:29,020 --> 02:46:30,020
No.

4024
02:46:30,020 --> 02:46:31,020
No, dude.

4025
02:46:31,020 --> 02:46:32,020
No.

4026
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:33,020
Then why is it a yellow barrier if I can just walk through it?

4027
02:46:33,020 --> 02:46:34,020
Sure.

4028
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:36,020
This is how to defeat the America.

4029
02:46:36,020 --> 02:46:37,020
This is the final step.

4030
02:46:37,020 --> 02:46:38,020
How to defeat him?

4031
02:46:38,020 --> 02:46:39,020
Yeah.

4032
02:46:39,020 --> 02:46:45,020
When the quote unquote balance of forces has shifted in favor of the revolution, conduct

4033
02:46:45,020 --> 02:46:47,020
operations aimed at achieving final victory.

4034
02:46:47,020 --> 02:46:48,020
Oh, I see.

4035
02:46:48,020 --> 02:46:53,020
While continuing to quote unquote calibrate these operations so that the decisive encounters

4036
02:46:53,020 --> 02:46:57,020
are still avoided until the forces of the old order have been brought to the brink of

4037
02:46:57,020 --> 02:46:58,020
total defeat.

4038
02:46:58,020 --> 02:47:02,020
And then fully, finally, rout and dismantle the Romanian enemy force.

4039
02:47:02,020 --> 02:47:03,020
That's how we win.

4040
02:47:03,020 --> 02:47:04,020
Did he put calibrate in quotes?

4041
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:05,020
Yes.

4042
02:47:05,020 --> 02:47:06,020
Why?

4043
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:07,020
Quote unquote calibrate.

4044
02:47:07,020 --> 02:47:08,020
Calibrate them.

4045
02:47:08,020 --> 02:47:13,020
That means they won't know that we're fucking our chances of winning.

4046
02:47:13,020 --> 02:47:14,020
Okay.

4047
02:47:14,020 --> 02:47:17,020
If they knew that, then that would just be a disaster.

4048
02:47:17,020 --> 02:47:22,020
In case it was lost upon you, let me read what the final action is.

4049
02:47:22,020 --> 02:47:28,020
When the quote unquote balance of forces has shifted in favor of the revolution, conduct

4050
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:30,020
operations aimed at achieving final victory.

4051
02:47:30,020 --> 02:47:33,020
So when we're about to win.

4052
02:47:33,020 --> 02:47:34,020
Win.

4053
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:35,020
Win.

4054
02:47:35,020 --> 02:47:36,020
Win.

4055
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:37,020
Win.

4056
02:47:37,020 --> 02:47:38,020
Win.

4057
02:47:38,020 --> 02:47:39,020
Win.

4058
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:40,020
Win.

4059
02:47:40,020 --> 02:47:41,020
Win.

4060
02:47:41,020 --> 02:47:42,020
Win.

4061
02:47:42,020 --> 02:47:43,020
Win.

4062
02:47:43,020 --> 02:47:44,020
Win.

4063
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:45,020
Win.

4064
02:47:45,020 --> 02:47:46,020
Win.

4065
02:47:46,020 --> 02:47:47,020
Win.

4066
02:47:47,020 --> 02:47:48,020
Win.

4067
02:47:48,020 --> 02:47:49,020
Win.

4068
02:47:49,020 --> 02:47:50,020
Win.

4069
02:47:50,020 --> 02:47:51,020
Win.

4070
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:52,020
Win.

4071
02:47:52,020 --> 02:47:53,020
Win.

4072
02:47:53,020 --> 02:47:54,020
Win.

4073
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:55,020
Win.

4074
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:56,020
Win.

4075
02:47:56,020 --> 02:47:57,020
Win.

4076
02:47:57,020 --> 02:47:58,020
Win.

4077
02:47:58,020 --> 02:47:59,020
Win.

4078
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:00,020
Win.

4079
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:01,020
Win.

4080
02:48:01,020 --> 02:48:02,020
Win.

4081
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:03,020
Win.

4082
02:48:03,020 --> 02:48:04,020
Win.

4083
02:48:04,020 --> 02:48:05,020
Win.

4084
02:48:05,020 --> 02:48:06,020
Win.

4085
02:48:06,020 --> 02:48:07,020
Win.

4086
02:48:07,020 --> 02:48:08,020
Win.

4087
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:20,420
If we call all the steps, if we try to win, and then we do win, and then we do things

4088
02:48:20,420 --> 02:48:25,060
in accordance with things that we've caused us to have and for them to lose, then maybe

4089
02:48:25,060 --> 02:48:26,060
you will win.

4090
02:48:26,060 --> 02:48:27,060
We might.

4091
02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:33,860
I would be how it would go down well if we conduct operations that will lead to us having a final victory

4092
02:48:33,860 --> 02:48:36,820
And then the tide and the balance of forces

4093
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:41,380
Indicate that the revolutionary all that fighting force may win then indeed

4094
02:48:41,380 --> 02:48:43,380
I think that we have a good chance of

4095
02:48:43,380 --> 02:48:49,140
So you mean that if we perform actions that are in line with winning and the other side

4096
02:48:49,140 --> 02:48:53,940
Losing and we stick to those actions of winning which will put us at an advantage to win

4097
02:48:53,940 --> 02:48:57,900
And then when we see the goal in sight we continue to try and win

4098
02:48:58,140 --> 02:49:01,100
Obviously that we might win like you're saying like obviously

4099
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:03,740
Can you guys put in other words, please?

4100
02:49:08,380 --> 02:49:11,460
We got it in the bag we solved all the problems

02:49:11,980 --> 02:49:13,980
This is an actual

4102
02:49:14,220 --> 02:49:15,180
Unironic

4103
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:22,340
endorsed sponsored paid for ad by the revolutionary communist party of America not a joke

4104
02:49:22,340 --> 02:49:27,820
They actually paid us to do this like for real like we are members of that political party

4105
02:49:27,820 --> 02:49:29,300
We are we are war criminals

4106
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:33,260
We are literally war criminals because we've read those steps allowed if you read them loud

By age 15

4118
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:29,060
My favorite song

02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:31,580
It's a song about family

4120
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:38,940
Hey, hey, hey, you you left the shore. Wait, where did Obi-Wan go? I want him back

4122
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:54,380

02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:31,740
You need he's like an escort you have to like you have to do it. He's an escort. Yeah escort

02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:33,740
No, no, not like that, but yeah like that

4130
02:51:35,460 --> 02:51:41,140
Which one is it like that you have to get three CPO from there to there

4131
02:51:43,060 --> 02:51:46,700
So what a dumb thing you just did a dog a dog

4132
02:51:47,420 --> 02:51:49,420
But don't where's Captain Panaca

4133
02:51:50,940 --> 02:51:55,980
Panera you think I can beat this one up Panaca. Dude Ben got us free

4134
02:51:58,540 --> 02:52:02,740
Oh, yeah, okay, whatever right about the guy who hit his kid though. Do we secure?

4135
02:52:03,740 --> 02:52:06,220
I'll tell the story. Yeah, please they were turned around

4136
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:13,220
But when we were in the line for Panera bread, there was a father and a mother and like two or three daughters

4137
02:52:13,220 --> 02:52:17,420
And one of the daughters just like if he's I don't know what happened

4138
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:20,740
The guy said that she was like fiddling with his watch or something

4139
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:25,980
But the father of this young child how how much like it's like

4140
02:52:26,620 --> 02:52:32,340
She's probably like between six and eight. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, she looks so right

4141
02:52:32,780 --> 02:52:35,020
and he like

4142
02:52:36,220 --> 02:52:41,700
Shows her and like like on the forehead like yeah, yeah like that and like

4143
02:52:42,140 --> 02:52:46,980
Does that turn she like falls back and like falls into the mother's like arms

4144
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:59,060
Kid like in the line of Panera bread the guy behind the counter was like what what like he came out

4145
02:52:59,060 --> 02:53:02,020
Yeah, like do something about it, but he didn't fucking do shit

4146
02:53:02,020 --> 02:53:06,740
Yeah, and the mom was like what the hell are you doing? And the dad was just like

4147
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:14,140
Shoes shoes mess with my watch. Yeah, and they like all the whole family ran out of the store. Yeah

4148
02:53:14,140 --> 02:53:20,260
Yeah, that was extremely awkward. I yelled at him. I was like I was just like what the hell get out of here

4149
02:53:20,460 --> 02:53:23,420
Yeah, did you yeah, I did I was like get this guy out of here

4150
02:53:25,700 --> 02:53:27,700
Okay, it was okay

4151
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:34,060
Well, what I want to hone in on that is is what I found most striking and that's that like the mom

4152
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:41,340
Seemed like so unbelievably surprised like as if it were strange what it which it is

4153
02:53:41,340 --> 02:53:44,300
Yeah, well, I just think to myself, okay

4154
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:49,140
You know there are people who are abusive and there are people who are not and you know if you if you're like an abusive dad

4155
02:53:49,140 --> 02:53:52,460
You probably have done it before and you are probably will do it again. It's like, you know

4156
02:53:53,020 --> 02:53:56,860
An unfortunate thing you are just a bad guy a bad guy

4157
02:53:56,860 --> 02:54:03,820
But what if you just you know, we're married to someone completely normal like upstanding person like, you know

4158
02:54:03,820 --> 02:54:07,900
A good guy then just one day you're in Panera one day. He enlists around

4159
02:54:11,620 --> 02:54:13,620
Obliterate your kid

4160
02:54:14,500 --> 02:54:19,820
I mean, I saw the woman. I mean she was outraged. I mean if this had been going on a lot for a while or

4161
02:54:20,780 --> 02:54:22,780
You know you'd be outraged either way

4162
02:54:23,460 --> 02:54:25,460
Sure

4163
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:27,660
You're so terrible

4164
02:54:29,220 --> 02:54:33,460
Don't don't even try you're gonna lose what I just spawns me there now jump out

4165
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:39,540

4168
02:54:44,980 --> 02:54:47,900
You leave her Paul you leaving us back and forth

4169
02:54:48,220 --> 02:54:50,020

4170
02:54:50,060 --> 02:54:52,060
Stream favorite Apollo

We got him okay, we got him on the show. All right. We got Captain Pinocchio. We got Apollo in wars growing so much today

4172
02:55:07,380 --> 02:55:09,380
The Lord just keeps expanding

4173
02:55:10,380 --> 02:55:12,380
You know, you know

4174
02:55:14,820 --> 02:55:21,420
What that Instagram, you know, you know, yeah, do you know what you're talking about when people send

4175
02:55:22,180 --> 02:55:25,840
Like selfies and smoking dope when people send selfies and they

4176
02:55:27,140 --> 02:55:29,580
They do a peace sign over their mouth

4177
02:55:29,580 --> 02:55:35,180
I think I have because they don't want to show off there like this area. Why wouldn't they want to show off that area?

4178
02:55:35,460 --> 02:55:37,460
What's wrong with that area?

4179
02:55:37,660 --> 02:55:41,300
Okay, I don't know why you'd be self-conscious about that specifically

4180
02:55:42,740 --> 02:55:48,100
I think part of it is trying to be like out of cute in a way. I think it's part of it. Yeah, I

4181
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:51,220
Okay

4182
02:55:52,260 --> 02:55:59,460
People on Twitter people on Twitter, maybe you want to die. Yeah, you show me like like tweets from this person

4183
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:03,420
You know, that's like it's it's it's frankly say the name

4184
02:56:04,420 --> 02:56:06,420
I

4185
02:56:07,060 --> 02:56:13,660
Literally don't know but it's like stuff like wow. I'm so horny right now. I'm so desperate

4186
02:56:13,860 --> 02:56:15,860
I'm so sad and depressed

4187
02:56:16,780 --> 02:56:22,780
Also, I'm horny right now. I'm depressed like the same he was he had depression

4188
02:56:26,020 --> 02:56:28,140
He had to fucking know one

4189
02:56:30,700 --> 02:56:32,700
So it's like

4190
02:56:33,420 --> 02:56:37,900
I just hate people being desperate on the internet. It's such a bad look

4191
02:56:40,780 --> 02:56:44,940
Yeah, definitely and he probably knows that it's a bad look, but he just can't help

4192
02:56:45,580 --> 02:56:52,580
Fine. Yeah. Yeah, somehow. It's worse. Yeah, cuz I like expected it. Let's see. Oh, is it here?

4193
02:56:52,580 --> 02:56:56,620
Oh, I didn't look like it knew it. Okay. Well, whatever

4194
02:56:57,860 --> 02:56:59,860
but it's I

4195
02:57:00,740 --> 02:57:05,740
Hate seen okay. This is like this isn't like like a like a ha ha much. He hates that's thing

4196
02:57:05,740 --> 02:57:09,780
This is I this is feel separate in my mind. So it probably is in reality as well

4197
02:57:09,780 --> 02:57:12,060
I think you might I heard that I

4198
02:57:12,700 --> 02:57:16,060
What when I see man himself like I don't know

4199
02:57:16,460 --> 02:57:24,100
It's so it's unbecoming when people are so like desperate on Twitter and like God, you know, I'm so bad

4200
02:57:24,100 --> 02:57:29,580
I'm so gross God. No one will love me. It's just a fucking nightmare. It's so bad

4201
02:57:29,900 --> 02:57:31,900
It's such so terrible

4202
02:57:34,380 --> 02:57:36,380
I think I think we'd have to be to play

4203
02:57:36,900 --> 02:57:45,060
Sick that was great. What a nightmare. Good. I'm so happy. I'm off Twitter. It's it makes it made my life so much fucking better

4204
02:57:45,860 --> 02:57:50,220
Now I don't have to deal with that. It's it's so like it was such a

4205
02:57:50,940 --> 02:57:56,220
Glory situation because like I stop and I did literally don't care doesn't impact my life at all

4206
02:57:56,220 --> 02:57:58,220
It really did not make any difference

4207
02:58:00,660 --> 02:58:02,660
Yeah

4208
02:58:03,780 --> 02:58:07,260
You know, I said I said this in the last hour of decay last hour of decay was in

4209
02:58:09,140 --> 02:58:13,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was I said this in the last episode

4210
02:58:13,140 --> 02:58:18,580
I really want to get back into like being online and social media in a way that is like

4211
02:58:19,020 --> 02:58:21,780
Yeah, like in a way that is actually I feel constructive

4212
02:58:22,140 --> 02:58:26,340
Where I actually instead of just like Twitter. What do you do out of Twitter?

4213
02:58:26,500 --> 02:58:29,620
You like on people you yell at people you like

4214
02:58:30,260 --> 02:58:36,740
Maybe maybe see an art and it's wrapped up. You're lucky if you're lucky and it's in the worst possible

4215
02:58:37,260 --> 02:58:45,060
Format for art. So it's not even like it's like a good place to do that. No, I do not want to look at art on a website where I cannot

4216
02:58:45,860 --> 02:58:48,540
Very meticulously archive it. Yeah

4217
02:58:49,100 --> 02:58:53,980

You may swing to pick up the power up. Yeah, I know now. He's just normal like that

4255
03:01:40,100 --> 03:01:42,820
Hey, why are all the black people like the default lego face by the way?

4256
03:01:43,620 --> 03:01:49,540
Because being black is enough. Okay. That's fine. Okay. It's fine. That's there special enough already

4257
03:01:50,340 --> 03:01:55,860
Dude that feel dude. Have you ever watched the um, the the the gindi terrorist conflicts?

4259
03:01:58,820 --> 03:02:00,820
Coors like movie

4260
03:02:01,300 --> 03:02:06,980
Uh, I've seen it's not a movie. It's like a bunch of like mini. It's like a mini series, right?

4261
03:02:07,460 --> 03:02:11,380
Is it a mini series? Yeah. Yeah, it's like a bunch of it. It was a movie. I've seen some of it

4262
03:02:11,460 --> 03:02:15,540
It was movie length. I believe like just all total like yeah, okay

4263
03:02:15,700 --> 03:02:18,100
So I probably I probably just like it was all the same deal

4264
03:02:18,180 --> 03:02:23,700
So I probably just like like even had to autoplay on or something. Okay, but it's even been really fucking cool, dude

4265
03:02:24,340 --> 03:02:29,540
Fuck yeah, dude. Look how I don't even have to go anywhere. I know. I don't look at this. Look at this. Look at this

4266
03:02:29,940 --> 03:02:31,940
I don't even have to think about anything

03:02:32,180 --> 03:02:36,980
Get that blue get that blue though. Get that blue. I hardly even need to approach it together. Yeah. Oh my god. It's so good

4268
03:02:37,620 --> 03:02:43,540

4269
03:02:43,620 --> 03:02:44,820
I saw something called fertilizer

4270
03:02:44,820 --> 03:02:49,140
Yeah, so when when you are on like like one of the fucking animals you can ride in this game

4279
03:03:18,900 --> 03:03:21,700
And then you are in your element. You are running

4280
03:03:22,420 --> 03:03:29,540
Maxing out your fucking studs right now. You are the champion footballer. Yes, and you are footballing so fucking hard right now

4281
03:03:29,780 --> 03:03:34,500

4282
03:03:34,500 --> 03:03:37,380
You are running to the goal as fast as you can ball in hand

4283
03:03:38,100 --> 03:03:42,340
You turn the side you see a man on his knees going

4284
03:03:44,900 --> 03:03:50,580
In the crowd in the stands just completely silent like literally like cells do not move nice single twitch

4287
03:04:03,860 --> 03:04:09,780
So fucking hard that you explode right there in the spot. What do you do? Other than die, of course

4288
03:04:22,580 --> 03:04:27,380
Yep, that's the emotion. I'm feeling right now. That's correct. All right

4289
03:04:28,180 --> 03:04:30,180
That's

4290
03:04:32,420 --> 03:04:35,460
To not delete not delete any rare pokemon and I just have

And I dumped the rest because they're all garbage. Ben. Are you aware of the trick that we played on Tuesday?

4294
03:04:48,820 --> 03:04:50,820
Uh

4295
03:04:51,620 --> 03:04:54,180
The epic prank which didn't even accomplish its goal

4298
03:05:06,740 --> 03:05:09,940
We invited Ben out it started at like what was 11?

4299
03:05:11,060 --> 03:05:19,620
He I get there like 12 30 at 12 30. Yeah, this happens every single time every single time. Yeah, so our community day a lot

4300
03:05:19,860 --> 03:05:21,460
And he's always there

4301
03:05:21,460 --> 03:05:25,220
We haven't done it in a while. You didn't hang out with me when I came into the city for the yang rally

4302
03:05:25,700 --> 03:05:27,700
I couldn't why are you such a bully? I couldn't

4303
03:05:28,180 --> 03:05:30,180
I don't have a bully anyway

4304
03:05:30,820 --> 03:05:38,100
So I believe that one. I think myself listen. I have the power in my hands. I know what to do and so I told you

4305
03:05:38,980 --> 03:05:43,380
Today we were going to meet at 11 for lunch. We were actually gonna meet at 12

4306
03:05:44,180 --> 03:05:45,780
12 30. Yeah

4307
03:05:45,780 --> 03:05:52,820
Well, then why did you then why did you tell me not to come? No, I I I I said that we were we had just met

4308
03:05:52,900 --> 03:05:54,900
And then it would probably take you a long time to get there

4309
03:05:55,380 --> 03:06:01,140
I said, okay. What look I I I messaged you at noon and I was like, hey, sorry

4310
03:06:01,380 --> 03:06:06,580
Like, you know, I I didn't set an alarm. Well, hold on. Wait. Okay. Like is it too late? Like should I not come and you're like

4311
03:06:06,580 --> 03:06:12,500
Yeah, it's too late. Oh, I said that we had just met tom which we just had okay, but still do you okay?

4312
03:06:12,660 --> 03:06:16,660
Wait, hold on. I could I told you it would take me like an hour to get there. Yeah, and we would have been done

4313
03:06:16,900 --> 03:06:20,740
Yeah, we would have been done with our stuff. No, that's wrong because you guys didn't get here until like four

4314
03:06:22,660 --> 03:06:24,260
Maybe three

4315
03:06:24,260 --> 03:06:26,980
Okay, well past two 30 we may have taken our time

4316
03:06:27,220 --> 03:06:31,220
But I don't I don't think that would have been worth it genuinely. All right, maybe no

4317
03:06:31,620 --> 03:06:34,900
I think that we would have been just in with our food and then walking around

4318
03:06:35,780 --> 03:06:41,220
Mmm. Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's probably that's probably the case. That is probably the case

4319
03:06:41,300 --> 03:06:46,100
But anyway, the point is is that I lied to you and the lie didn't succeed. So I'm really upset with you. Yeah

4320
03:06:46,900 --> 03:06:48,900
Hell yeah

4321
03:06:50,980 --> 03:06:52,980
What lying I want to start telling you

4322
03:06:54,100 --> 03:06:58,180
No, don't tell him because then he'll be like, oh time now I can wait two hours extra

4323
03:06:58,820 --> 03:07:02,180
Before leaving now. We never have to do anything. Yeah. Yeah

4324
03:07:02,980 --> 03:07:04,500
Oh

4325
03:07:04,500 --> 03:07:06,980
You didn't have to work for that truth yet. I just it's all came to you

4326
03:07:07,220 --> 03:07:12,580
I mean, I've just I've just been like running around killing things and it doesn't seem to be accomplishing anything

4327
03:07:12,580 --> 03:07:18,420
No, you got you have targets. You have hit lists up there. Slime corpus is a bounty for destroyka for two. Destroyka

4329
03:07:26,740 --> 03:07:28,100
I don't think so

4330
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:30,580
No, hey, there's like genocide in star wars, right?

4331
03:07:31,220 --> 03:07:34,820
A bunch a bunch. Yeah, damn happens all the time. That's cool

4332
03:07:37,700 --> 03:07:41,780
Dude, like why just I always in fiction like why can't we just have some like in real life? Yeah

4365
03:10:08,660 --> 03:10:10,660

03:10:30,340 --> 03:10:36,740
You don't have to enter this we're not we're not recording right now. Uh, uh, are you playing a tape like life a life?

4372
03:10:36,980 --> 03:10:42,980
Are you playing a fake actions that may lead to a change the balance of the forces that may lead to

4373
03:10:47,140 --> 03:10:49,140
Well once we're in a situation

4374
03:10:49,860 --> 03:10:54,660
Once the revolutionary situation is clearly there is such that we can win the next

4375
03:10:55,460 --> 03:10:57,460
I will leave the next step

4376
03:10:59,700 --> 03:11:01,060
Uh

4377
03:11:01,060 --> 03:11:03,060
There we go. I need to kill these red boys

4378
03:11:03,220 --> 03:11:03,940
Hell yeah

03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:09,300
Yeah

4381
03:11:09,300 --> 03:11:14,340
And and and and list rep we need that we need the communists, but you have to enlist communists. Yeah enlist new communism

4382
03:11:16,100 --> 03:11:17,300
You know, okay

4383
03:11:17,300 --> 03:11:24,420
Listen, I'ma I'ma. I'ma. I'ma. I'ma. I'ma shout out. I'ma shout out the worst rfck player the entire world star party

4384
03:11:24,820 --> 03:11:26,100
aka

4385
03:11:26,100 --> 03:11:29,140
Every single time anyone asks me I pardon star party

4386
03:11:29,940 --> 03:11:33,140
Whenever anyone sees no, you know, that's what it's gotta be. Yeah

4387
03:11:33,380 --> 03:11:35,460
I I know that he doesn't deserve to play the game

4388
03:11:35,700 --> 03:11:42,420
In fact, I've created a brand new funk called ban under which I ban people from joining a gang specifically for star party

4389
03:11:42,500 --> 03:11:47,060
That's the only reason I didn't so that he's forced to live the life of permanent juby because I hate him that much

4390
03:11:47,220 --> 03:11:49,220
Wait, what does he do?

4391
03:11:49,220 --> 03:11:50,660
He's like kevin too

4392
03:11:50,660 --> 03:11:52,420
Well, what's up?

4393
03:11:52,420 --> 03:11:55,620
Well, it sounds like he just he just joins teams then wants to pardon

4394
03:11:55,780 --> 03:12:00,820
Yeah, joining teams and wants to probably does nothing or or or either either does nothing or like, you know

4395
03:12:00,900 --> 03:12:04,340
Like steals from like loot crates or something or like like the the

Pair up trucks

4425
03:13:54,180 --> 03:13:56,180
Ever on the pcp

4426
03:13:56,180 --> 03:14:01,540
Our heyday is 2016 because that's one thing for me. That's that's what everyone that's when you were releasing

4427
03:14:02,100 --> 03:14:08,180
Vapers. No, I wasn't were you not? No, when were you listening? I never consistently released papers. I always

4428
03:14:08,660 --> 03:14:12,820
I don't I don't I'm always waited until the chapter. No, I don't I don't mean like that

4429
03:14:12,980 --> 03:14:16,820
I mean is in uh, it was the oh my god, Ben's doing like a comic. He's not anymore anymore

4430
03:14:16,820 --> 03:14:20,020
He's making like comics and he's he's been on this like new podcast

4431
03:14:20,020 --> 03:14:26,100
That's like in like it's a fucking infancy like a sub 20 episodes. I'm not saying that you were releasing the consistently

4432
03:14:26,100 --> 03:14:29,140
I'm saying that they were like a new thing that you've done the rock. That's true

4433
03:14:29,700 --> 03:14:31,700
Everything was new things were exciting

4434
03:14:31,780 --> 03:14:32,900
It was like a breath, you know

4435
03:14:32,900 --> 03:14:37,380
It was the end of an era of a pony area of a pony area in which ponies reside

4436
03:14:37,700 --> 03:14:44,660
And it was coming into like a brand new like glossing board into a new era of things under which we were doing art that we had never done before

4437
03:14:45,460 --> 03:14:47,460
Yeah, that's long since past. Yeah

4438
03:14:47,860 --> 03:14:49,860
Now it's about fucking series

4439
03:14:49,940 --> 03:14:56,260
It's about maintained in part of the creative and which is good in its own way, but we aren't we haven't captured

4440
03:14:56,420 --> 03:15:00,420
That's awful. Yeah, you know what honestly, Ben? It really sucks. It's dumb. That's stupid

4441
03:15:00,420 --> 03:15:05,780
And I am ashamed that it's even part of good situation. Uh, yeah, everything sucks

4442
03:15:06,100 --> 03:15:09,940
Yeah, you know, I want to get into that actually in a second though, but just to continue on the hippo train

4443
03:15:10,900 --> 03:15:13,140
That was the best time because we were releasing new things

4444
03:15:13,300 --> 03:15:16,100
But we got the stagger you were just releasing the same stuff over and over

4445
03:15:16,100 --> 03:15:18,900
I mean hippo himself had like the hypocrite show which like, you know

4446
03:15:19,380 --> 03:15:22,500
I liked the hypocrite show when it was a thing and you know, it was released

4447
03:15:22,660 --> 03:15:26,900
But like, you know, it's a video game review show. Yeah, how like hip and fresh can that be?

4448
03:15:27,220 --> 03:15:29,300
hip was a funny guy, but like, you know

4449
03:15:30,180 --> 03:15:36,580
Frankly, not that cool of a thing to do video game reviews and I'm sure he'd agree with that. I mean, I think that's why he stopped doing it

4450
03:15:36,580 --> 03:15:38,420
It's why he stopped doing it

4451
03:15:38,420 --> 03:15:40,420
But this jailbabe animation

4452
03:15:40,740 --> 03:15:45,540
Jailbabe is going on for a while now, but you have this amount to have this amount of effort

4453
03:15:46,020 --> 03:15:48,020
Put into this genuinely

4454
03:15:48,820 --> 03:15:51,700
I'm gonna I want to say that to the day. Oh, by the way, Ben. This is the worst level

4455
03:15:52,180 --> 03:15:54,180
And you're gonna want to scream that

4456
03:15:54,820 --> 03:15:59,700
I already want to scream dude. It's so terrible. That's what you're gonna look like by the time

4457
03:16:02,660 --> 03:16:07,860
Um, I mean, what do I have to do? You just no, just figure it out. Just figure it out

4458
03:16:07,860 --> 03:16:09,860
That's gonna be just passed a mini-kip by the way

4459
03:16:10,500 --> 03:16:11,940
So

4460
03:16:11,940 --> 03:16:13,060
What of it?

4461
03:16:13,060 --> 03:16:15,060
um, anyway

4462
03:16:15,620 --> 03:16:18,340
Yeah, this amount of effort put into like an animation

4463
03:16:19,220 --> 03:16:25,700
There's so much fucking creativity. It's almost like he's an artist. It's almost like he's a real artist. He's a real ass artist

4464
03:16:26,020 --> 03:16:27,380
Hippo Craig

4465
03:16:27,380 --> 03:16:33,460
Easily the most alpha PCP member that there fucking is this guy's got a real ass creative job

4466
03:16:33,620 --> 03:16:38,420
Then he's making and doing like actual work in the real world with his fucking writing job

4467
03:16:38,420 --> 03:16:43,940
It has for that fucking studio and on his side like do like while doing like actual real work

4468
03:16:43,940 --> 03:16:45,140
I'm sure he's a lot of time

4469
03:16:45,140 --> 03:16:47,380
He's always talking about how much he wants to do jailbait on this

4470
03:16:47,780 --> 03:16:51,860
But he has to do work, you know writing with even while doing this actual job

4471
03:16:52,100 --> 03:16:57,060
He has time and a creative juices point in his mind and a passion for the project

4472
03:16:57,220 --> 03:17:04,020
Is able to make a three-minute animation in like what like two or four minutes in like what like two months three months

4473
03:17:04,660 --> 03:17:08,820
Uh, not sure. Obviously he has had like a lot of time to prepare for it mentally

4474
03:17:09,300 --> 03:17:12,260
But just the fact that he was able to do this

4475
03:17:12,900 --> 03:17:17,780
This guy is fucking working. This guy is fucking. This guy has

4476
03:17:18,340 --> 03:17:23,060
Real actual creative passion to do more than what he has been doing for the past

4477
03:17:23,140 --> 03:17:28,500
He's able to grow and evolve and the best part about it is that he's honing skills that he's always had

4478
03:17:29,300 --> 03:17:30,980
You know in the long past

4479
03:17:30,980 --> 03:17:33,860
Tall man world tallest man fish at the door

4480
03:17:34,420 --> 03:17:39,060
Stuff like that, but he's weaving into this narrative. How do I get past this fucking wall? You need bombs

4481
03:17:39,780 --> 03:17:43,220
What they're purple orbs find some purple orbs give so cool

4482
03:17:43,620 --> 03:17:45,620
Not not only is he

03:17:46,100 --> 03:17:50,820
Outputting the most interesting creative content right now currently besides in this war

4484
03:17:50,820 --> 03:17:55,620
He's in this war is sick as hell and also it's me now so fuck you that's right, correct

Press B. Just hold B, just hold B. You have to carry that and you have to go bowling.

4492
03:18:27,780 --> 03:18:30,780
The game is playing itself.

4493
03:18:30,780 --> 03:18:31,780
Yeah?

4494
03:18:31,780 --> 03:18:32,780
Okay.

4495
03:18:32,780 --> 03:18:33,780
This is fine.

4496
03:18:33,780 --> 03:18:36,780
You have to lead it into there.

4497
03:18:36,780 --> 03:18:37,780
Is it here?

4498
03:18:37,780 --> 03:18:38,780
Yeah.

4499
03:18:38,780 --> 03:18:39,780
Hey.

4500
03:18:39,780 --> 03:18:40,780
Oh.

4501
03:18:40,780 --> 03:18:42,780
No, you have to do the other one.

4502
03:18:42,780 --> 03:18:43,780
That's fine.

4503
03:18:43,780 --> 03:18:44,780
I get it.

4504
03:18:44,780 --> 03:18:48,780
Not only is he making the freshest content right now, out of anyone else in the PCP,

4505
03:18:48,780 --> 03:18:51,780
but Hippo is like the nicest person ever.

4506
03:18:51,780 --> 03:18:52,780
Yeah.

4507
03:18:52,780 --> 03:18:55,780
Hippo is so nice and non-cynical and non-fucking good.

4508
03:18:55,780 --> 03:18:56,780
Yeah, he is.

4509
03:18:56,780 --> 03:18:58,780
He's such a, he's so real.

4510
03:18:58,780 --> 03:19:02,780
He's just a pleasant person to be to because he's not mean or angry ever.

4511
03:19:02,780 --> 03:19:04,780
He's just really cool.

4512
03:19:04,780 --> 03:19:06,780
He's a really fucking good guy.

4513
03:19:06,780 --> 03:19:07,780
Yeah.

4514
03:19:07,780 --> 03:19:08,780
He's a really fucking good friend.

4515
03:19:08,780 --> 03:19:09,780
Yeah.

4516
03:19:09,780 --> 03:19:10,780
Agreed.

4517
03:19:10,780 --> 03:19:11,780
Yeah.

4518
03:19:11,780 --> 03:19:13,780
I have nothing but honor for that man.

4519
03:19:13,780 --> 03:19:16,780
I have nothing but pure joy when I hear Hippo.

4520
03:19:16,780 --> 03:19:18,780
No, do you say no bad words?

4521
03:19:18,780 --> 03:19:19,780
No.

4522
03:19:19,780 --> 03:19:21,780
I said no bad words, but same thing.

4523
03:19:21,780 --> 03:19:22,780
Yeah, basically.

4524
03:19:22,780 --> 03:19:23,780
Oh.

4525
03:19:23,780 --> 03:19:24,780
Oh.

4526
03:19:24,780 --> 03:19:25,780
What?

4527
03:19:25,780 --> 03:19:26,780
Ben, I think you have to die.

4528
03:19:26,780 --> 03:19:27,780
I think you have to die.

4529
03:19:27,780 --> 03:19:28,780
No.

4530
03:19:28,780 --> 03:19:29,780
What?

4531
03:19:29,780 --> 03:19:30,780
Why?

4532
03:19:30,780 --> 03:19:31,780
Okay.

4533
03:19:31,780 --> 03:19:32,780
That's fine.

4534
03:19:32,780 --> 03:19:33,780
Zero studs.

4535
03:19:33,780 --> 03:19:37,780
Why is it that you're in a flying ship when you can't let go over a little old custom?

4536
03:19:37,780 --> 03:19:40,780
Anyway, all that to say, donate to that fucking punk plushie.

4537
03:19:40,780 --> 03:19:43,780
He's been wanting to do this Kickstarter for so fucking long.

4538
03:19:43,780 --> 03:19:49,780
He's got, if you want to give him money, but you don't want to spend all the money for a plushie,

4539
03:19:49,780 --> 03:19:54,780
he's also doing art commissions for the first year.

4540
03:19:54,780 --> 03:19:55,780
Yeah.

4541
03:19:55,780 --> 03:19:56,780
So he wants the plushie.

4542
03:19:56,780 --> 03:19:59,780
He'll get art, and it also says, oh wait, it says, shh, don't tell anyone.

4543
03:19:59,780 --> 03:20:02,780
I guess we'll have to look at the Kickstarter to check.

4544
03:20:02,780 --> 03:20:04,780
There's a secret in the art commission section.

4545
03:20:04,780 --> 03:20:05,780
Ooh.

4546
03:20:05,780 --> 03:20:06,780
Ooh.

4547
03:20:06,780 --> 03:20:08,780
It says, shh, don't tell anyone.

4548
03:20:08,780 --> 03:20:09,780
Ooh, okay.

4549
03:20:09,780 --> 03:20:10,780
Well, put the link.

4550
03:20:10,780 --> 03:20:11,780
Take a look.

4551
03:20:11,780 --> 03:20:12,780
Yeah.

4552
03:20:12,780 --> 03:20:18,780
I'm, oh god, that's terrible.

4553
03:20:18,780 --> 03:20:19,780
No, that's great.

4554
03:20:19,780 --> 03:20:20,780
That's great.

4555
03:20:20,780 --> 03:20:21,780
Oh my god.

4556
03:20:21,780 --> 03:20:22,780
That's outrageous.

4557
03:20:22,780 --> 03:20:23,780
That's outrageous.

4558
03:20:23,780 --> 03:20:24,780
That's so controversial.

4559
03:20:24,780 --> 03:20:25,780
You have to look.

4560
03:20:25,780 --> 03:20:26,780
That's so controversial.

4561
03:20:26,780 --> 03:20:28,780
You have to check out the Kickstarter.

4562
03:20:28,780 --> 03:20:29,780
That's insane.

4563
03:20:29,780 --> 03:20:30,780
You've got to check out the Kickstarter.

4564
03:20:30,780 --> 03:20:31,780
Legitimately, that's insane.

4565
03:20:31,780 --> 03:20:32,780
I can't believe that's happened.

4566
03:20:32,780 --> 03:20:33,780
Why is it insane?

4567
03:20:33,780 --> 03:20:34,780
What is it?

4568
03:20:34,780 --> 03:20:35,780
You have to click the link then.

4569
03:20:35,780 --> 03:20:36,780
You have to click the link then to click the link.

4570
03:20:36,780 --> 03:20:37,780
All right.

4571
03:20:37,780 --> 03:20:39,780
Well, now my mind is racing with possibilities.

4572
03:20:39,780 --> 03:20:40,780
You know what?

4573
03:20:40,780 --> 03:20:41,780
Yeah, you know what?

4574
03:20:41,780 --> 03:20:42,780
He doesn't click the link.

4575
03:20:42,780 --> 03:20:43,780
He doesn't click the link.

4576
03:20:43,780 --> 03:20:44,780
Don't be like Ben.

4577
03:20:44,780 --> 03:20:45,780
I never click the link.

4578
03:20:45,780 --> 03:20:46,780
Don't be like me.

4579
03:20:46,780 --> 03:20:47,780
But Ben, okay.

4580
03:20:47,780 --> 03:20:50,780
You may not click the link, but have you rang the bell?

4581
03:20:50,780 --> 03:20:51,780
Not even once.

4582
03:20:51,780 --> 03:20:52,780
Not even once.

4583
03:20:52,780 --> 03:20:55,780
How can you ring the bell without putting a subscribe?

4584
03:20:55,780 --> 03:20:57,780
Wait, you have to click something.

4585
03:20:57,780 --> 03:20:58,780
What?

4586
03:20:58,780 --> 03:20:59,780
Well, you rang the bell.

4587
03:20:59,780 --> 03:21:00,780
Oh, god.

4588
03:21:00,780 --> 03:21:01,780
I rang the bell without subscribing.

4589
03:21:01,780 --> 03:21:02,780
I am guilty.

4590
03:21:02,780 --> 03:21:03,780
Guilty is charged.

4591
03:21:03,780 --> 03:21:04,780
I'm guilty of ringing the bell.

4592
03:21:04,780 --> 03:21:05,780
No subscribe now.

4593
03:21:05,780 --> 03:21:06,780
What kind of freak?

4594
03:21:06,780 --> 03:21:07,780
What kind of freak?

4595
03:21:07,780 --> 03:21:13,780
I can't wait for the bell to become meaningless and then for YouTube to not show you notifications

4596
03:21:13,780 --> 03:21:16,780
from the bell so they have to come through with the wazoo.

4597
03:21:16,780 --> 03:21:18,780
You have to click wazoo in order to get notifications.

4598
03:21:18,780 --> 03:21:22,780
I get a YouTube notification for channels that I don't subscribe to.

4599
03:21:22,780 --> 03:21:23,780
Yeah, me too.

4600
03:21:23,780 --> 03:21:27,780
Notifications on my phone channels that I do not subscribe to.

4601
03:21:27,780 --> 03:21:28,780
Fuck yeah dude.

4602
03:21:28,780 --> 03:21:29,780
No, no, no, don't follow that pit.

4603
03:21:29,780 --> 03:21:30,780
Don't follow that pit.

4604
03:21:30,780 --> 03:21:31,780
Do you don't follow that pit?

4605
03:21:31,780 --> 03:21:32,780
Don't follow that pit.

4606
03:21:32,780 --> 03:21:35,780
You shouldn't be able to follow the pit because you're a ship that is hovering.

4607
03:21:35,780 --> 03:21:37,780
Yeah, you're a flying ship.

4608
03:21:37,780 --> 03:21:38,780
Off the ground.

4609
03:21:38,780 --> 03:21:39,780
No.

4610
03:21:39,780 --> 03:21:40,780
You don't understand.

4611
03:21:40,780 --> 03:21:41,780
You don't understand.

4612
03:21:41,780 --> 03:21:42,780
Is it like you're...

4613
03:21:42,780 --> 03:21:43,780
You're a hover ship.

4614
03:21:43,780 --> 03:21:44,780
You died.

4615
03:21:44,780 --> 03:21:45,780
All right.

4616
03:21:45,780 --> 03:21:46,780
You died.

4617
03:21:46,780 --> 03:21:47,780
I don't care if I died.

4618
03:21:47,780 --> 03:21:48,780
It gives a shit.

4619
03:21:48,780 --> 03:21:49,780
You're gonna die again.

4620
03:21:49,780 --> 03:21:50,780
So what?

4621
03:21:50,780 --> 03:21:51,780
Dine's not good then.

4622
03:21:51,780 --> 03:21:52,780
Yes it is.

4623
03:21:52,780 --> 03:21:53,780
No.

4624
03:21:53,780 --> 03:21:55,780
It means progress is happening.

4625
03:21:55,780 --> 03:21:57,780
Look at your little ship right there.

4626
03:21:57,780 --> 03:21:59,780
It's little sucks more than anything I've ever seen in my entire life.

4627
03:21:59,780 --> 03:22:02,780
This is the only fault of this game is this level.

4628
03:22:02,780 --> 03:22:03,780
The only...

4629
03:22:03,780 --> 03:22:04,780
The only fault.

4630
03:22:04,780 --> 03:22:05,780
You died.

4631
03:22:05,780 --> 03:22:09,780
Yeah, because I wanted to have all my health so I wouldn't die on the way.

4632
03:22:09,780 --> 03:22:10,780
What a nightmare.

4633
03:22:10,780 --> 03:22:11,780
It's called strategy.

4634
03:22:11,780 --> 03:22:14,780
It's called fucking being gross.

4635
03:22:14,780 --> 03:22:16,780
Yeah.

4636
03:22:16,780 --> 03:22:17,780
And...

4637
03:22:17,780 --> 03:22:18,780
Disgusting.

4638
03:22:18,780 --> 03:22:19,780
Disgusting.

4639
03:22:19,780 --> 03:22:21,780
Come on.

4640
03:22:21,780 --> 03:22:24,780
This is your precious cargo.

4641
03:22:24,780 --> 03:22:27,780
Ball on board.

4642
03:22:27,780 --> 03:22:30,780
How I'm ball.

4643
03:22:30,780 --> 03:22:35,780
Yeah.

4644
03:22:35,780 --> 03:22:38,780
Dude look at this guy right now.

4645
03:22:38,780 --> 03:22:39,780
There have to be more.

4646
03:22:39,780 --> 03:22:41,780
Oh for sure bro.

4647
03:22:41,780 --> 03:22:43,780
Look at that minikit by the way.

4648
03:22:43,780 --> 03:22:44,780
This game beautiful.

4649
03:22:44,780 --> 03:22:45,780
Yeah straight up.

4650
03:22:45,780 --> 03:22:46,780
Look at that graphic design.

4651
03:22:46,780 --> 03:22:47,780
Look at that profile.

4652
03:22:47,780 --> 03:22:49,780
Look at that profile image right there.

4653
03:22:49,780 --> 03:22:50,780
Yeah.

4654
03:22:50,780 --> 03:22:53,780
Dude, matching icons for you and your bae.

4655
03:22:53,780 --> 03:22:56,780
The player one and the player two of the same thing.

4656
03:22:56,780 --> 03:22:59,780
You want it smaller?

4657
03:22:59,780 --> 03:23:00,780
Oh bro, yeah.

4658
03:23:00,780 --> 03:23:01,780
Hell yeah dog.

4659
03:23:01,780 --> 03:23:02,780
Oh yeah.

4660
03:23:02,780 --> 03:23:03,780
Hell yeah.

4661
03:23:03,780 --> 03:23:04,780
Hell yeah.

4662
03:23:04,780 --> 03:23:05,780
Ow.

4663
03:23:05,780 --> 03:23:06,780
Ow.

4664
03:23:06,780 --> 03:23:07,780
Ouchie.

4665
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:08,780
Dude, whoa.

4666
03:23:08,780 --> 03:23:09,780
This is sphere.

4667
03:23:09,780 --> 03:23:10,780
Dude, whoa.

4668
03:23:10,780 --> 03:23:11,780
This is sphere.

4669
03:23:11,780 --> 03:23:12,780
What sphere?

4670
03:23:12,780 --> 03:23:13,780
What are you talking about?

4671
03:23:13,780 --> 03:23:14,780
That's sphere right here.

4672
03:23:14,780 --> 03:23:15,780
I don't even see a sphere.

4673
03:23:15,780 --> 03:23:16,780
I don't see shapes.

4674
03:23:16,780 --> 03:23:17,780
Okay.

4675
03:23:17,780 --> 03:23:18,780
He was a ship.

4676
03:23:18,780 --> 03:23:19,780
He had a bull.

4677
03:23:19,780 --> 03:23:20,780
This degenerate.

4678
03:23:20,780 --> 03:23:22,780
The gun ship from like a Star Wars complete saga.

Kill him.

4691
03:23:34,780 --> 03:23:35,780
Kill him.

4692
03:23:35,780 --> 03:23:36,780
Did I do it?

4693
03:23:36,780 --> 03:23:37,780
Was that the right thing to do?

4694
03:23:37,780 --> 03:23:38,780
No.

4695
03:23:38,780 --> 03:23:39,780
fertil the right thing to do?

4696
03:23:39,780 --> 03:23:40,780
Oh my Gosh.

4697
03:23:40,780 --> 03:23:41,780
A corpo one person who said he was so stupid.

4698
03:23:41,780 --> 03:23:43,780
What am I supposed to do with a ball?

4699
03:23:43,780 --> 03:23:44,780
Figure it out.

4700
03:23:44,780 --> 03:23:47,120
Just tell me so I can be done.

4701
03:23:47,120 --> 03:23:48,780
Hit the things with your ball.

4702
03:23:48,780 --> 03:23:49,780
That's what I did.

4703
03:23:49,780 --> 03:23:50,780
That's exactly what I did.

4704
03:23:50,780 --> 03:23:51,780
No, no.

4705
03:23:51,780 --> 03:23:52,780
The other things.

4706
03:23:52,780 --> 03:23:53,780
What other things?

4707
03:23:53,780 --> 03:23:54,780
Wow.

4708
03:23:54,780 --> 03:23:55,780
Okay how many things on your on screen?

4709
03:23:55,780 --> 03:23:56,780
One or two?

4710
03:23:56,780 --> 03:23:58,100
Maybe try the one that you didn't do.

4711
03:23:58,100 --> 03:24:05,100
do. What, like these things? Yeah. That's it? I just have to destroy all those? Yes. God,

4712
03:24:05,100 --> 03:24:11,100
kill me. No, I won't. You have to play more games. Hey, is this game made out of Legos?

4713
03:24:11,100 --> 03:24:25,100
Yes. What? God. No. Slam that shit like your dick. Yeah? Yeah. Now you have to blow up

4714
03:24:25,100 --> 03:24:31,100
those. Now you have to blow up those. What, those things they were guarding? Yeah. Shoot

4715
03:24:31,100 --> 03:24:39,100
it. Shoot it. Shoot it. How flat can you get your penis? Really fucking flat, dude. As flat

4716
03:24:39,100 --> 03:24:43,100
as you can even imagine. I don't think that's flat. I'm trying to think right now. If I were

4717
03:24:43,100 --> 03:24:49,100
to, like, really, like... If you were to rest... I think it would have maintained its shape pretty

4718
03:24:49,100 --> 03:24:53,100
well, actually. Yeah, I think so. If you were to rest your dick... I mean, there's stuff

4719
03:24:53,100 --> 03:24:58,100
in there, so there's stuff in there. Yeah, but it squishes. Sure, it squishes. I mean,

4720
03:24:58,100 --> 03:25:06,100
provided circumstances. Circumcision. Yeah. Dude, gang, free government circumcision.

4721
03:25:06,100 --> 03:25:14,100
Is that true? No, actually, he's anti-circumcision. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Good help. Oh, my

4722
03:25:14,100 --> 03:25:19,100
god. I'm sorry, by the way. I'm sorry that they can eat all of your kind. Yeah. My kind?

4723
03:25:19,100 --> 03:25:27,100
Yeah. It's fucked up, dude. I don't even have a dick anymore. To be honest, yeah. You know,

4724
03:25:27,100 --> 03:25:33,100
whatever. You know, I've never known life without. It's fine. It's fine. Without? Yeah, without.

4725
03:25:33,100 --> 03:25:39,100
You've never known life without? Or I guess with. Yeah. It's with... Oh. I've known life

4726
03:25:39,100 --> 03:25:46,100
with and without. It's fine. Hell yeah. Yeah. If I was a male with a penis and it was

4727
03:25:46,100 --> 03:25:51,100
I would be so... I would be like, unbelievably bad. Well, I can tell you that you would be

4728
03:25:51,100 --> 03:25:57,100
way overreacting, because it's NBD, honestly. Like, it's fine. I mean, how would you know?

4729
03:25:57,100 --> 03:26:03,100
Uh, because I got fucking circumcised as an adult. What? That's true. That's true. Wait, wait.

4730
03:26:03,100 --> 03:26:08,100
Did you not know? Have I not talked about this? No. Yeah, no. What? Yeah, no. I had

4731
03:26:09,100 --> 03:26:19,100
so I got circumcised. What? Yeah, what? What's the big deal? What the fuck? What's the big deal?

4732
03:26:19,100 --> 03:26:25,100
What are you upset about? I'm not upset about anything. I'm just unparalleledly

4733
03:26:25,100 --> 03:26:31,100
surprised, impressed, and intrigued. What? I just told you the whole story. I'm about

4734
03:26:31,100 --> 03:26:36,100
to get on the ground and crab walk around so that you will please become a real one.

4735
03:26:36,100 --> 03:26:41,100
There are no more details. Pinch me, I'm dreaming. There are no more details to explain. No!

4736
03:26:41,100 --> 03:26:48,100
Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Oh my god. Okay, so first of all... There's nothing else to ask.

4737
03:26:48,100 --> 03:26:53,100
First of all... I don't think Ben wants to talk about it. No, he's great.

4738
03:26:53,100 --> 03:26:57,100
I dare you to come up with one thing that I have not already told you.

4739
03:26:57,100 --> 03:27:03,100
So, you had fimosis since you were a child. Yeah. When, like, what age are you talking

4740
03:27:03,100 --> 03:27:06,100
about? We're talking adulthood. Like, actual adulthood? Or, like, when you were...

4741
03:27:06,100 --> 03:27:10,100
He's always had it. No, no, no, no, no. My force game was just, like, too fucking tight on my dick.

4742
03:27:10,100 --> 03:27:14,100
No, no. I mean, when did you get the circumcision? About 18. Before I went to college.

4743
03:27:14,100 --> 03:27:20,100
Wow, okay. So, like, you're fucked, bitches. What was... Like, okay. So, you have this thing

4744
03:27:20,100 --> 03:27:25,100
wrong with your dick. What is the process of becoming a built-circumcised? Because when

4745
03:27:25,100 --> 03:27:28,100
you're a baby, I understand that you... What kind of a stupid question is that? They circumcise

4746
03:27:28,100 --> 03:27:31,100
you. You fucking brainless. Not like you... Like, like, what happened to the surgery room?

4747
03:27:31,100 --> 03:27:35,100
I mean, do you go to the doctor and you say, hey, can I receive a circumcision? Yeah.

4748
03:27:35,100 --> 03:27:39,100
And then they do it for you. Yeah. Just, like, just like that? Yeah.

4749
03:27:39,100 --> 03:27:46,100
No, no, no. No religion... No religious? No. Okay. Okay. Okay.

4750
03:27:46,100 --> 03:27:51,100
Honestly, the reason I'm pissed now is just that I'm annoyed that anyone found it interesting.

4751
03:27:51,100 --> 03:27:55,100
No. Because I don't... I don't think it's that interesting. And they're like, oh, what?

4752
03:27:55,100 --> 03:28:00,100
That's interesting, trivia. And my reaction is, ugh, it's not interesting. There's nothing

4753
03:28:00,100 --> 03:28:05,100
to talk about. It's not weird, man. Wait, okay, okay. Okay, so you had sex without...

4754
03:28:05,100 --> 03:28:10,100
You had sex with the circumcised... Or with the uncircumcised, yes. No, I never had sex

4755
03:28:10,100 --> 03:28:14,100
with an uncircumcised... Well, okay, but you felt pleasure from that, you know, before

4756
03:28:14,100 --> 03:28:19,100
and you're like... Yes. Yes, I experienced pleasure. You fucking weirdos.

4757
03:28:19,100 --> 03:28:24,100
You think that there's no difference? Yeah, there's no difference.

4758
03:28:24,100 --> 03:28:30,100
Well, well, okay, cool then. Yeah, it's great. I'm here to sit... Guys, okay, I see people

4759
03:28:30,100 --> 03:28:36,100
on, like, line being like, oh, they mutilate, you know, these people are mutilated. People

4760
03:28:36,100 --> 03:28:39,100
think it's like, you know, it's fucked up that they do this to kids. They don't even

4761
03:28:39,100 --> 03:28:44,100
have consent. I agree. Yeah, you should probably get consent, but... And I'm not even going

4762
03:28:44,100 --> 03:28:52,100
to disagree with that. But people are like, you know, if you're circumcised, then you've

4763
03:28:52,100 --> 03:28:57,100
been mutilated. You should be angry about this. I know from personal experience that it is

4764
03:28:57,100 --> 03:29:03,100
no big deal. Like, it's fine. It's gonna be fine, everyone. There's really nothing to

4765
03:29:03,100 --> 03:29:11,100
freak out over. Jump. Oh, god. Stand on the fucking thing. It's gonna be a nightmare.

4766
03:29:11,100 --> 03:29:19,100
Stand on the thing. No, you have to do it. That's not true. Okay. What? I did it. No,

4767
03:29:19,100 --> 03:29:24,100
you didn't do it right. What do you mean? I stood on the button. Do it. Do it right, dude.

4768
03:29:24,100 --> 03:29:31,100
Come on, please. Please. All right. Oh, I see. He knows what's... And he has an

4769
03:29:31,100 --> 03:29:36,100
uncircumcised penis, and he knows what's up. And he loves it. Yeah, he knows he has better

4770
03:29:36,100 --> 03:29:45,100
sex than anyone else. He knows that Obi-Wan was mutilated. So weird. I'm still intrigued.

4771
03:29:45,100 --> 03:29:51,100
I have no more questions to ask. What? Yeah. Listen, you're right. I don't get it. There's

4772
03:29:51,100 --> 03:29:56,100
nothing more to add to the situation. There's literally no. It was just such a shock. Because

4773
03:29:56,100 --> 03:30:00,100
I've never known anyone who's an adult. I mean, I guess I knew consciously that that was a

4774
03:30:00,100 --> 03:30:05,100
thing, but I had never interacted or heard anyone say it ever. No, I know. It's messed up, man.

4775
03:30:05,100 --> 03:30:12,100
It's totally fucked up. Yeah, it is fucked up. What the hell is wrong with you? I guess you said

4776
03:30:12,100 --> 03:30:20,100
already. What's wrong with you? Just got like fucking a tight-ass foreskin. Well, hey, I got

4777
03:30:20,100 --> 03:30:25,100
it. Yeah, it was just tight. I imagine... Okay, you know, you know, Mr. Mon... I'm sorry,

4778
03:30:25,100 --> 03:30:31,100
Mon Jr.? Mr. Medeker? Yeah. I love that guy. I love him even more. You know, Mon Jr., how

4779
03:30:31,100 --> 03:30:36,100
it has, like, a little, like, weird, like, squiggly little, like, top of its head. Yeah.

4780
03:30:36,100 --> 03:30:40,100
And that's what Phymosis Dick looks like at the end, where it's, like, just like a squiggly

4781
03:30:40,100 --> 03:30:45,100
little, like, artistic rendition of, like, flaps. Oh. I can't picture what you're talking

4782
03:30:45,100 --> 03:30:49,100
about. Yeah. And I don't want to. Yeah, you get it? Yeah, no, I get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

4783
03:30:49,100 --> 03:30:55,100
she gets it. If the audience gets it. Oh, gross. Now I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry I said

4784
03:30:55,100 --> 03:31:00,100
anything. How is it possible that two members of our glorious show have had Phymosis?

4785
03:31:00,100 --> 03:31:05,100
That's, like, a rare, bizarre, like, freak disease, isn't it? I don't think so. Oh, yeah?

4786
03:31:05,100 --> 03:31:10,100
Is it normal? Is it normal? I think it's pretty normal. Ooh. Ooh. You learned something.

4787
03:31:10,100 --> 03:31:14,100
I'm learning so much right now. Anthony, you could have had it. You never know. Maybe you

4788
03:31:14,100 --> 03:31:20,100
had it. Oh, it was for my own good. You don't have to ask your mom. Yeah. Did I have Phymosis?

4789
03:31:20,100 --> 03:31:25,100
Did I have Digi Dick? And she would be like, I was waiting for this day to come. Um, what

4790
03:31:25,100 --> 03:31:30,100
am I supposed to do? Jump. That's only for a minute, by the way. You don't need to do

4791
03:31:30,100 --> 03:31:35,100
that. Okay. Well, I can't, I can't make it. So whatever. There's Emperor Palpatine right

4792
03:31:35,100 --> 03:31:41,100
there. It's count, it's count Palpatine. It's Dooku. It's count, count them. Count, count them.

4793
03:31:41,100 --> 03:31:47,100
Just hit them with your big old gun. I killed them. Died. Well, soon. Well, she's jumping

4794
03:31:47,100 --> 03:31:54,100
all. I'm a deadly warrior. No, he's forcing you. You forced them. You dumbass. I thought,

4795
03:31:54,100 --> 03:32:00,100
I thought that was me, uh, force pushing it. Boy, how will I defeat him? Dude, he's like,

4796
03:32:00,100 --> 03:32:05,100
his movements are so like, generate when you hit him. It's just like, just fall the fuck

4797
03:32:05,100 --> 03:32:10,100
over. It just stands there looking at you. Radiating force power. Oh, this will work.

4798
03:32:10,100 --> 03:32:15,100
Oh, shit. Fuck. Okay. No, don't worry. How could I have predicted?

4799
03:32:15,100 --> 03:32:21,100
Just standing around. Look at this. Look at these Lego parts. I know. Wait, is he a Lego?

4800
03:32:21,100 --> 03:32:30,100
No. Lol. He's not even worried about it. Yeah. Bye. He's just, he's like, he just pats

4801
03:32:30,100 --> 03:32:39,100
him down. Oh, dang. Oh my God, Yoda. The most powerful warrior. Time to fight Yoda, guys.

4802
03:32:39,100 --> 03:32:45,100
I'm Yoda. Dude, I'm going fucking ballistic. I know. Dude, Yoda goes crazy in his lightsaber.

4803
03:32:45,100 --> 03:32:51,100
And I like, actually, though. Dude, yeah. Um, why is it playing the imperial march when

4804
03:32:51,100 --> 03:32:56,100
the empire is not formed yet? In fact, this is still in the republic. And these people

4805
03:32:56,100 --> 03:33:01,100
have not instituted imperialist elements. They haven't won yet. They haven't. The, the,

4806
03:33:01,100 --> 03:33:06,100
the, the, the, the balance of forces has not indicated that Count Palpatine will win. So

4807
03:33:06,100 --> 03:33:09,100
I don't understand why they're making measures that would lead to final victory just yet.

4808
03:33:09,100 --> 03:33:11,100
What was I, what was I just doing?

4809
03:33:11,100 --> 03:33:14,100
Hey, how far into episode two are you going to win? What is it?

4810
03:33:14,100 --> 03:33:18,100
I think this is close to the end. I don't know what I, I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.

4811
03:33:18,100 --> 03:33:20,100
This is the end. This is the end. Yeah, this is the end.

4812
03:33:20,100 --> 03:33:22,100
Thank God. Thank God.

4813
03:33:22,100 --> 03:33:23,100
Just hit him. Just hit him.

4814
03:33:23,100 --> 03:33:25,100
Well, he, he, he force pushes me away.

4815
03:33:25,100 --> 03:33:27,100
Um.

4816
03:33:27,100 --> 03:33:36,100
What's, what's the move?

4817
03:33:36,100 --> 03:33:43,100
It doesn't, it does no damn. He just had to like to get you. It doesn't matter. He just doesn't.

4818
03:33:43,100 --> 03:33:45,100
He just walk around and it's normal.

4819
03:33:45,100 --> 03:33:47,100
What am I, what does it want?

4820
03:33:47,100 --> 03:33:55,100
Okay. Walk around. Surely there must be, okay. Force that. Force that. Yeah. Wow. Okay.

4821
03:33:56,100 --> 03:33:57,100
Shreddish.

4822
03:33:57,100 --> 03:34:00,100
No. Okay. Just walk around. Walk around.

4823
03:34:00,100 --> 03:34:03,100
Surely, surely there's something around here that you can interact with.

4824
03:34:03,100 --> 03:34:07,100
Maybe get that power up or something. You like get that power up, then walk over to him.

4825
03:34:07,100 --> 03:34:08,100
I don't think that's going to do it.

4826
03:34:08,100 --> 03:34:09,100
I don't know, man.

4827
03:34:09,100 --> 03:34:10,100
What?

4828
03:34:10,100 --> 03:34:11,100
Oh, okay.

4829
03:34:11,100 --> 03:34:12,100
What?

4830
03:34:14,100 --> 03:34:16,100
He's popped over.

4831
03:34:16,100 --> 03:34:20,100
Why would he do such a thing?

4832
03:34:20,100 --> 03:34:23,100
Um, is there a person with a gun?

4833
03:34:23,100 --> 03:34:25,100
No. It's just me and Yoda.

4834
03:34:25,100 --> 03:34:31,100
Do you, okay. I feel like you have to be two players for this. I feel like you have to.

4835
03:34:31,100 --> 03:34:34,100
Oh, maybe, maybe it's.

4836
03:34:34,100 --> 03:34:36,100
He's well, he's focused enough.

4837
03:34:36,100 --> 03:34:37,100
Oh, I see.

4838
03:34:37,100 --> 03:34:38,100
Okay.

4839
03:34:38,100 --> 03:34:40,100
All right. Okay. I understood.

4840
03:34:40,100 --> 03:34:44,100
It's what, yeah. It's when he's lightning one. You just got to switch.

4841
03:34:44,100 --> 03:34:45,100
Lol.

4842
03:34:45,100 --> 03:34:47,100
This game is so fun.

4843
03:34:47,100 --> 03:34:48,100
It doesn't even do him damage.

4844
03:34:48,100 --> 03:34:50,100
Yeah, it does. He takes down the heart.

4845
03:34:50,100 --> 03:34:51,100
Did it?

4846
03:34:51,100 --> 03:34:52,100
Yeah.

4847
03:34:52,100 --> 03:34:53,100
Oh, okay. Wow.

4848
03:34:53,100 --> 03:34:54,100
See?

4849
03:34:54,100 --> 03:34:55,100
Cool.

4850
03:34:55,100 --> 03:34:56,100
Terrible.

4851
03:34:56,100 --> 03:34:57,100
No, wait up.

4852
03:34:57,100 --> 03:34:58,100
Hit him.

4853
03:34:58,100 --> 03:34:59,100
Hit him.

4854
03:34:59,100 --> 03:35:00,100
He's grandparent.

4855
03:35:00,100 --> 03:35:01,100
Grandparent.

4856
03:35:01,100 --> 03:35:02,100
It'll do, it'll do tons of damage.

4857
03:35:02,100 --> 03:35:03,100
Yeah.

4858
03:35:03,100 --> 03:35:04,100
Look at that.

4859
03:35:04,100 --> 03:35:05,100
Mondo fucking damage.

4860
03:35:05,100 --> 03:35:06,100
Just do it.

4861
03:35:06,100 --> 03:35:07,100
Oh my God.

4862
03:35:07,100 --> 03:35:08,100
Kind of do goop.

4863
03:35:08,100 --> 03:35:09,100
Save this.

4864
03:35:09,100 --> 03:35:10,100
I hit.

4865
03:35:10,100 --> 03:35:11,100
Save this.

4866
03:35:11,100 --> 03:35:12,100
For all, for all kind.

4867
03:35:12,100 --> 03:35:13,100
Yes.

4868
03:35:13,100 --> 03:35:14,100
Sliced in half.

4869
03:35:14,100 --> 03:35:15,100
Slice and dice.

4870
03:35:15,100 --> 03:35:16,100
Oh my God.

4871
03:35:16,100 --> 03:35:17,100
Oh my God.

4872
03:35:17,100 --> 03:35:18,100
Oh my God.

4873
03:35:18,100 --> 03:35:19,100
Oh my God.

4874
03:35:19,100 --> 03:35:20,100
Oh my God.

4875
03:35:20,100 --> 03:35:21,100
Oh my God.

4876
03:35:21,100 --> 03:35:22,100
Come on, dude.

4877
03:35:22,100 --> 03:35:23,100
I've seen him say it.

4878
03:35:23,100 --> 03:35:24,100
No, when?

4879
03:35:24,100 --> 03:35:25,100
I read a book.

4880
03:35:25,100 --> 03:35:26,100
Oh.

4881
03:35:26,100 --> 03:35:27,100
I'm on right now.

4882
03:35:27,100 --> 03:35:28,100
Oh my God.

4883
03:35:28,100 --> 03:35:29,100
I can't believe he said it.

4884
03:35:29,100 --> 03:35:30,100
Three play unlawed.

4885
03:35:30,100 --> 03:35:31,100
Do we end?

4886
03:35:31,100 --> 03:35:32,100
Is that the end?

4887
03:35:32,100 --> 03:35:33,100
Yup.

4888
03:35:33,100 --> 03:35:34,100
Guys.

4889
03:35:34,100 --> 03:35:35,100
Three hours, 30 minutes.

4890
03:35:35,100 --> 03:35:37,100
That's a good length to stop at, I think.

4891
03:35:37,100 --> 03:35:38,100
True data.

4892
03:35:38,100 --> 03:35:39,100
Hey.

4893
03:35:39,100 --> 03:35:40,100
Hey.

4894
03:35:40,100 --> 03:35:41,100
Hey.

4895
03:35:41,100 --> 03:35:42,100
Hey.

4896
03:35:42,100 --> 03:35:43,100
Hey.

4897
03:35:43,100 --> 03:35:44,100
It's Craig.

4898
03:35:44,100 --> 03:35:46,100
He's offering you bread.

4899
03:35:46,100 --> 03:35:48,100
Did you make garlic bread?

4900
03:35:48,100 --> 03:35:49,100
Put it in the oven.

4901
03:35:49,100 --> 03:35:50,100
Wait.

4902
03:35:50,100 --> 03:35:51,100
Oh my God.

4903
03:35:51,100 --> 03:35:52,100
How do we eat this?

4904
03:35:52,100 --> 03:35:53,100
Oh my God.

4905
03:35:53,100 --> 03:35:54,100
I'm not going to have any, but it looks great.

4906
03:35:54,100 --> 03:35:55,100
Craig.

4907
03:35:55,100 --> 03:35:56,100
Get in front of the camera.

4908
03:35:56,100 --> 03:35:57,100
Say goodbye.

4909
03:35:57,100 --> 03:35:58,100
No.

4910
03:35:58,100 --> 03:35:59,100
Craig.

4911
03:35:59,100 --> 03:36:00,100
Where are you going?

4912
03:36:00,100 --> 03:36:01,100
I'm going to say goodbye.

4913
03:36:01,100 --> 03:36:02,100
Say goodbye to everyone.

4914
03:36:02,100 --> 03:36:03,100
Oh no.

4915
03:36:03,100 --> 03:36:04,100
Oh no.

4916
03:36:04,100 --> 03:36:05,100
Oh no.

4917
03:36:05,100 --> 03:36:06,100
We saw him.

4918
03:36:06,100 --> 03:36:07,100
He's on the KAA.

4919
03:36:07,100 --> 03:36:09,100
He's coming to the crack house tonight, buddy.

4920
03:36:09,100 --> 03:36:10,100
It's canon now.

4921
03:36:10,100 --> 03:36:11,100
Shut this shit off.

4922
03:36:11,100 --> 03:36:12,100
All right.

4923
03:36:12,100 --> 03:36:13,100
End of the stream.

4924
03:36:13,100 --> 03:36:15,100
I'm going to whip out my dick.

4925
03:36:15,100 --> 03:36:16,100
This game's terrible.

4926
03:36:16,100 --> 03:36:17,100
Really?

4927
03:36:17,100 --> 03:36:18,100
Yeah, I'm going to whip out my dick.

4928
03:36:18,100 --> 03:36:20,100
I can't wait to never play Lego Star Wars again.

4929
03:36:20,100 --> 03:36:21,100
All right.

4930
03:36:21,100 --> 03:36:22,100
All right.

4931
03:36:22,100 --> 03:36:23,100
See you guys.

4932
03:36:23,100 --> 03:36:24,100
Wait.

4933
03:36:24,100 --> 03:36:25,100
I have to close the game.

4934
03:36:25,100 --> 03:36:26,100
All right.

4935
03:36:26,100 --> 03:36:27,100
Here we go.

4936
03:36:27,100 --> 03:36:28,100
It won't let me do it.

4937
03:36:28,100 --> 03:36:29,100
It won't let me do it.

4938
03:36:29,100 --> 03:36:30,100
It's very unsatisfying.

4939
03:36:30,100 --> 03:36:31,100
All right.

4940
03:36:31,100 --> 03:36:32,100
I'm going to take it out.

4941
03:36:32,100 --> 03:36:33,100
All tab, you dumb fuck.

4942
03:36:33,100 --> 03:36:34,100
Yes, sir.

4943
03:36:34,100 --> 03:36:35,100
Mr. President, sir.

4944
03:36:35,100 --> 03:36:36,100
Take it out.

4945
03:36:36,100 --> 03:36:37,100
Take it out.

4946
03:36:37,100 --> 03:36:38,100
Take it out.

4947
03:36:38,100 --> 03:36:39,100
Take it out.

4948
03:36:39,100 --> 03:36:40,100
All right.

4949
03:36:40,100 --> 03:36:41,100
Here we go.

4950
03:36:41,100 --> 03:36:42,100
Get away from me.

4951
03:36:42,100 --> 03:36:43,100
You're stupid.

4952
03:36:43,100 --> 03:36:44,100
You're stupid.

4953
03:36:44,100 --> 03:36:45,100
I don't like you.
