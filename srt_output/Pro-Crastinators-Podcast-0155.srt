00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy ever and today we've got Hippocrit.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I've got the Oscar fever. Hope you got it too.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Got Tom Oliver.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
My brain is full of blood and all I do is suck blood.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Get that blood out of there, Ben Saint.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Get that brain out of here. That's so fucking nasty, man. That's so fucking nasty.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Munchy is present.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hi guys. Hope you're ready for some comedy gold on this podcast where I'll be exclusively quoting The Loco Bandito by Mike Matei.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's a rich bounty there.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Holy shit, says The Loco Bandito.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And of course, Endless Jess is here.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Bitch, me, I'm laying on my bed like a teen girl in a sleepover. I'm gonna lay down on my tummy with my feet in the air.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Nice.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Is that what sleepovers like? I never went to one.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I always wanted to go to a little girl's sleepover at a little, little bed, little teeny-bopper bitch.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You've been to a homoerotic male sleepover though, surely, correct?

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I mean, of course. I mean, I invented the homoerotic male sleepover.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I mean, I grew up straight.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I had a pretty homoerotic male sleepover, but with one guy and he just slept in my bed.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But with his feet near my head and my head near his feet.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, so you didn't know the position, right?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We were like ten. We didn't even understand what was weird about it.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We had lab dicks back then.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I got a funny story. I got a funny story that happened just yesterday, so I'm hanging out with a couple of friends.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not gonna say what their names were to protect the innocent.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's friend A and friend B.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You've never been this cautious before in your entire life.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And for the story, you said they're like their full name.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, I don't know. There's a mild chance that one of these three people might actually hear the show, so that would be embarrassing.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But it was really funny because there's friend A, friend B, and they have a mutual friend, friend C, who's not there.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Friend B is like, hey, A.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So yeah, you know, friend C, yeah.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It was really obvious when I met him that he was like into me in like a gay way.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And friend A is like a ghast.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's like, no, dude, no.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Friend C is absolutely not gay.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He's like my best friend.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He's totally not gay. That's totally impossible.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I mean, look, I know he's fucked around with it.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Shut up.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Like, I know he's like, I know he's fucked some guys before, right?

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But it's always been in like a straight way, right?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Like, it's always, this is not a joke.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He literally said like, I know he's fucked guys, but not, but in like a whole heterosexual way.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This gets down to the fundamental.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I believe that there is a heterosexual way to fuck a man.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There's not.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You and fucking friend A.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Get the fuck out of here.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Listen, I doubt that's what happened in this situation.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Here's a real situation.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're at a glory hole.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You get your dick sucked.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Turns out it was a guy.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That was a sexual encounter.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, well that's not gay.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Your intention doesn't matter.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, no, intention is everything.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Of course intention matters.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Of course intention matters.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, intention matters.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But no, no, that was a gay act, but you were not being gay.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Munchy, you're insane.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Of course intent matters.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There is a distinction between, like, I had this argue with Michelle just the other day.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's that the act itself, you could call gay sex between two men,

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
but the, like, to call the individual gay depends on their intention, I would say.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If someone has fucked dudes multiple times though,

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you only get so many get out of jail free cards in my thoughts.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, at a certain point you can doubt,

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
if they claim that every time was an accident,

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
then like, if that's true, then I suppose that's fair.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But one can doubt the credulity of these claims.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Alright, I have a strong opinion about all this talk of is it gay or not.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
All sex is just like rubbing meat parts together.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's all fucking gay.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's all the same shit.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's all fucking gay.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Fucking a woman is the same thing as fucking a guy.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm saying it.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, it depends how much you care about gender and sex, I suppose.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, you're just slamming into each other.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're just slamming into each other in some various, like, you know, twisted pretzels sort of way.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And like, ultimately, you're just feeling like the hot, sweaty meat action with, like, that's what sex is.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I mean, you're just throwing out the whole question of is it gay or not.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're saying that it doesn't matter.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're basically just dispensing with the whole proposition of gayness to begin with.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay, okay.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I gotta cover my angles.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hippo has answered the GQ.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, that's long last.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We've been searching for it.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I realized that it's pretty much the same question.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Remember when we were arguing about, like, the sort of, like, the trans-bathroom debate?

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then Digi's like, why even have separate bathrooms at all?

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And I was like, that actually makes sense.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That seems like the way to go.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't want poop where a girl can hear me.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, that's, you know, not to make it an issue, but I actually did hear recently that, like,

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the thing about that is that sexual assaults have actually gone up in, like, non-

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
or, you know, like, group gender areas where they just say everybody goes to the same bathroom.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But you know what?

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't know.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Maybe it's an imperfect answer.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I mean, that's probably true to some extent.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just feel like the whole, like, I don't want to poop near a girl.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I mean, just because I poop away from a girl doesn't mean that that girl will like me.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, no.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's not what it's about.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I just don't want to do it.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I just don't want to do it.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I mean, there's nothing more to it.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Perhaps if one dug deep down into the motivation behind that feeling,

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you'd find that it's, you know, kind of centered in these, I don't know,

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
attraction dynamics of gender associations.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, or we could just accept that I just don't want to do it.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But I'm going to take it a step further and I don't want to poop anywhere that anyone can hear me.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't want to be near anyone's vicinity at all.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That too.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But it would be way worse if it was a girl.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's just, let's just, let's just rip that band-aid off right now.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Good ol' Ben, the binary.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Good ol' Ben, cisgender, cisgender's only please.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That was in quotes.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's my middle nickname, Saint.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hey, speaking of Ben and genitals, I heard about a phenomenon recently

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
that I'm wondering if you have any experience with Ben.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It is the phenomenon known only as Keto, it's known as Keto crotch.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is the name of the phenomenon.

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, well, Nate, describe it to me and I will tell you if it speaks to my life experience.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Certainly.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So it, it's a phenomenon where the keto diet supposedly has a,

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
a onerous effect on the smell of women's crotches.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well then why the fuck would I have any experience with?

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm wondering if perhaps there's some overlap with the male experience.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I mean, we all know that Ben's odiferous lifestyle is a thing of legend.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Odiferous lifestyle.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know, it's, now of course that was established long ago,

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
but perhaps there's been some change.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Perhaps it's had some kind of total change.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Are you saying like Ben probably smells like a woman now?

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What do you say?

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Totally over, totally overblown.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Everyone agrees.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
A few, everyone took like the one time that I was at Digi's house for three days

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and didn't get so naive.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And wasn't, and wasn't there and didn't have my own deodorant and yeah,

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
didn't shower cause I was over someone else's house.

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And so I smelled kind of bad and everyone's like, uh-huh, Ben smells so bad.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, you know, fuck you.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That, that was like a one, that was like a, that was like a specific incident.

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's just that Ben, in my opinion,

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I would say every time we have met over the last several years,

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
were those all outliers?

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Cause I would say that pretty much all of those times.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If you're telling me that I smelled weird every single time we've met over the last several years,

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
then I'm just going to call you a liar right to your face.

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That could be an exaggeration, but that, that's my general impression.

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Perhaps that's, you know, not specifically correct every single instance.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's not.

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's not correct.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There you go.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But, but I mean, don't you think the fact that I have an impression says something about the situation?

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No, Nate, I think you're dumb.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And I think, and honest, I, Nate, I literally, I know this is going to be really insulting to you.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And I think honestly that the fact that it happened like the last time has like colored your, your perception.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I was saying it before that dammit.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was saying it long before that.

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I think it's also, um, that it's funny to say it, and that's what you want to believe.

174
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, there's that.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's true.

177
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This could be a biased position, but.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Nate, you're like the, you're one of like two people that say it.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And the other one is your girlfriend.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And I think, and I think the two of you just think it's funny.

181
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Honestly, I think that's it.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah.

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We plot.

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Um, she is sensitive to smell though.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I mean, you know, sure.

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
She's got quite the nose.

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, Jesse, were you, were you commenting on this?

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, I just feel celebratory like any time that anyone is told that they smell and it's not me.

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's understandable.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Smelling bad is like my worst fear in life.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's the worst thing that can happen to a person.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm so mad at the foot that this episode got off to.

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Honestly.

195
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, that's unfortunate.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's the worst thing in the world.

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Listen, my, my, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's all I have to say.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
When you're sorry, Jesse, when you're in your house and you're not planning on guests and

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you're in your own funk and you're in your own smells and you're enjoying it, you're

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
just living your smelly life as a smelly person alone and everything's fine.

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know, and then someone just barges in and says, Hey, it's me.

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're fucking friends and let's take you someplace out in public right now.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's like, no, I smell bad.

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Go away.

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But they don't listen.

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You know, they take you out.

208
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They just, they just barge in.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They throw you in a car and kidnap you and you've been sitting there.

210
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You haven't showered in like three weeks as you didn't want to see anybody.

211
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You didn't, you just wanted to be home and be smelly and be in peace.

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Just, but no one.

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So they take, you know, and then, and then it's all like, Oh man, this guy fucking smells

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
like, yeah, I was happily smelling bad alone.

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And then you took me out to a place where people will notice it.

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You scum for, you know, for, forget gender.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I would say that scent is in fact a social construct that we are being held to a

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
standard that there is no, it's all society that imposes this need to smell

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
decently or even look decent.

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
When I'm alone and there's no one around to judge me.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I love smelling bad.

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's really cool.

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

224
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The same.

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There's a certain pleasure.

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
All right.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Maybe I'm crazy.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There's a certain pleasure in hot boxing and your own farts in a small room.

229
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Am I right?

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I feel so much better about myself.

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll beg you.

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll beg you.

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll beg you.

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll beg you.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The Nate facade is beginning to crack and it rode away and realizing that he's just

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
as degenerate as the rest of us.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm able to put on a social veneer when I leave.

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So that's the difference.

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is what happens when you don't have a job.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You go from Nate to us.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The mask gets crumbled.

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Fair.

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I can't shower for even like three days.

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I get dandruff and that just ruins my life.

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I just get dandruff and I get greasy.

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And so if I do that, then my life will just be ruined.

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not even like a like, I can just like not do any, like do no hygiene thing into my

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
life will be fine.

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It just actually makes me feel like I am a gross potato.

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah.

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm the same way.

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I got like a, I got a three day window tops for him just like, nah, this is just untenable

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
even for me at this point.

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah.

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If there was like a comfortable way to wash your hair without getting the rest of you wet,

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I would like never shower again.

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Cause that's all I really care about is make sure my hair stays.

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's true.

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There's no way to do it.

260
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can't like, you can't like pull up a chair and like lean over the sink like you're

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
in a salon.

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Like that's gay.

263
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's not straight.

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I hate to bring up a, I hate to bring up a topic from last week, but, but this, you're

265
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
almost making a case for baldness right now.

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh crap.

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I am.

268
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I take it all back.

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's all just shave our heads for next episode.

270
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Let's all just embrace it.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

272
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We'll be clean shaven.

273
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You know, when you get your hair cut and you ask them to wash your hair and they like

274
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
they'd lean you back and that like sink thing and they wash their hair for you.

275
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I want, I want, I want a butler just so you knew that every day of my life.

276
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I really liked that.

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I haven't done it too many times, but it's good.

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The one time I did have it was like, um, you remember when I had like hair or like really

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,800
big fat, like too long, like Jesus times two sort of hair and a really big beard.

281
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,800
It was like uni days where I was like, I don't know what a haircut is.

282
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
I don't know how to go to a haircut.

283
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Um, yeah.

284
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
University days.

285
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
You know, what are they?

286
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
No, no, no.

287
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
I know.

288
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
I say uni over in the brick bar.

289
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,800
I'm just saying, uh, not days is in days, but as in days, like, where am I?

290
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Oh, yeah.

291
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Just stay between college and university period.

292
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
I think college implies that it's cool.

293
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Well, in America, I think you can, they grant doctorates, universities grant doctorates,

294
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
I think.

295
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Uh, is that a different distinction?

296
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
There's a slight difference.

297
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
There's some overlap in what you can get on as masters, whatever.

298
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
That's not the point.

299
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
You know, it's like a better though, right?

300
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,800
In general, the point is I had big hair and I went to like my mom said, you just gotta

301
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
go to a fucking salon or something.

302
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
And I'm like, oh, okay.

303
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
I went to a thing.

304
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,800
There was this old guy who was into Led Zeppelin.

305
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,800
So I could actually talk to him about something for once and he was like, oh my God, you got

306
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
too much hair.

307
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
We're going to have to take it off like in parts.

308
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
We're going to have to amputate.

309
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:55,800
We're going to have to take this off in parts so that you don't like overcompensate like

310
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
your neck movements.

311
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
It's going to be like a tattoo.

312
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,800
It's going to do it like a tattoo, like you got to come in for multiple visits.

313
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Yeah.

314
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
It's just like he did it slowly.

315
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,800
And I assume he's felt this before when if you take like so much weight off of your head,

316
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,800
you'll feel dazed and smash your head into the wall or something stupid.

317
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,800
But he was really, he was really good at doing the salon stuff.

318
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
And there was so much hair.

319
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
It almost couldn't fit in the sink.

320
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
But it was really nice.

321
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Dude, isn't it the fucking coolest shit when you go, especially, oh dude, I don't know.

322
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
I don't know if any of you know this.

323
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I don't know if I was seen with any of you like in real life during this time.

324
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,800
There was a brief period of time where I had hair down to like below my shoulders, like

325
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
below like, like the bottom of my shoulders.

326
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,800
It was really, really long.

327
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
And you think a munchie.

328
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
You think like, oh, you know, it's got like Steven Universe kind of poofy hair.

329
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,800
When you have ethnic wavy hair and it's long, there's no poof.

330
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,800
It just is straight fucking like nightmare fuel.

331
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
It's straight like the worst.

332
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Okay.

333
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,800
If I could give any advice to children, it's cut your hair.

334
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,800
If there's like a psychological, like you, you create a real ATV field when you have long hair.

335
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,800
And you just think, you can hide behind your hair and it won't even matter.

336
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
You know, I'm a kid, but I'm so cool.

337
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
I think he means an ATV field.

338
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Yeah.

339
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
An ATV field.

340
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
It's an altering vehicle field.

341
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Yeah.

342
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
You can go anywhere.

343
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
You can go anywhere.

344
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
You can go anywhere.

345
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Dude, you can go anywhere.

346
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Finally.

347
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
You have no hubris.

348
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
You have no humility, I mean.

349
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
So it's, it's, it's not a good thing.

350
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
So anyway, I had that and I went in for a haircut one fateful day.

351
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:47,800
And the amount of hair that was on a, just on the ground, the corpse of my, my hair.

352
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
And I was down to a small haircut.

353
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,800
It was a, it was, I can make like an entire wig out of it.

354
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I can make maybe two wigs out of it.

355
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
It was copious maths.

356
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Hey, cool.

357
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,800
I just want to say, incidentally, I'm posting a link in the, in the audio links chat.

358
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I just want to point out, I was just brought this meal by Michelle that is a poke bowl,

359
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,800
which is like cut up fish with like this weird concoction of sauce on brown rice

360
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
and a filleted fish.

361
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
And it's just stupendous.

362
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
And it's before me right now.

363
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm going to be eating it.

364
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
You think I don't know.

365
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
You're like shit.

366
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
I don't know about poke.

367
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
I know about poke.

368
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
I don't know.

369
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
It's some island shit, Michelle.

370
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,800
I thought you, I thought you were talking about like a Pokemon themed food.

371
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Like a poke bowl.

372
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
It's made of magic harps and rice chan.

373
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
That's my favorite Pokemon.

374
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
That's the result of all the magic harp jump.

375
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
You have to train the perfect magic harp and it's ripe.

376
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Every, every, every time you, every time you're, you're loses.

377
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Every time you take a magic harp to the championship league and it loses,

378
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,800
you cut it up into a poke bowl and then you feed it to your next one for a little experience.

379
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
You induce, you induce the stress by torturing it.

380
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
And if it survives, that's how do you get a Gyarados?

381
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
All the ones that die become your food.

382
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Hey, incidentally, like a few minutes ago, somebody mentioned butlers.

383
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I was just thinking about this today.

384
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Here's a real question.

385
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Life sucks because what the hell happened to like having servants?

386
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,800
You could be like middle class and have a servant back in the good old 1800s or whatever it was.

387
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
What happened to that?

388
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Why don't we have slavery mate?

389
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
No, it's literally not slavery.

390
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I'm talking about like New England servants in like...

391
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:32,800
It's that, it's that god damn, it's the god damn politicians and their god damn raise in the minimum wage agenda.

392
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I think it might be something like this.

393
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Yeah, basically.

394
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,800
I'd be happy to pay a minimum wage for a servant, but I don't think that like exists.

395
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Well, Nate, you can have like a person to come clean your house for like, you don't need to be fabulously wealthy to have someone do that.

396
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I want a live-in Alfred style butler who's fiercely loyal and will keep my secrets and sit brave with me while we conspire.

397
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
That's expensive.

398
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Nate, I think you've stumbled upon a new market.

399
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Hear me out here.

400
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Uber for servants.

401
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Ew, I don't want a gross millennial butler.

402
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
They will fuck everything up.

403
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,800
I want an old English gentleman who, you know, fought in World War II and was a fighter pilot.

404
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,800
You don't want one of these kids doing the shig economy.

405
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Butlers are, butlers are men.

406
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
You want a maid with a nice booty.

407
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Yeah, completely grits, Jesse.

408
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
And sexual fighters are definitely men.

409
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Well, okay, never mind.

410
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
That's definitely true.

411
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
That's definitely true.

412
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Cassie's dad has a maid for his apartment.

413
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Okay, there.

414
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:39,800
And it is like, from what I can understand, it's like the greatest investment that you can have just to not have your house dirty.

415
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,800
And because he cooks a lot, his kitchen's completely fucked 100% of the time.

416
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Because he's making really complex shit and just every pot and pan is all over the floor.

417
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
So she takes care of it then?

418
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Yeah, she takes care of it.

419
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Just like all the bodies and all the people you guys are to kill.

420
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
I don't even need this now.

421
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I want this like in 10 years.

422
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,800
So I want to prepare the market so I'm ready by the time I actually need a maid.

423
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:10,800
It's moments like this when you realize just like you're not living real life, you know, like, like peasant life is just so far beneath what could be.

424
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
I don't know, man.

425
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
They're pretty luxurious.

426
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,800
It's literally just like, I don't want to clean myself.

427
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Please do it for me.

428
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Right.

429
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
There are people who just like they don't drive.

430
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
They don't clean.

431
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Like all these like grindy aspects of life are just so unknown to them.

432
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,800
It seems to me like like the bar has shifted.

433
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Like obviously somebody like, I'm sure Jeff Bezos has people who like, you know, clean his house or whatever.

434
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
So obviously that's the number one guy in the world.

435
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
But like, didn't there used to be like a middle class equivalent?

436
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
And sure, we've got this literal gig economy made thing.

437
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:54,800
But like the classical person is really just a case of like the population of the middle class has just increased.

438
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Like middle class used to be more, more rare than it.

439
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Yeah, I think it's just at some point.

440
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Yeah, at some point, like what was considered middle class, like what was considered normal was like, you know, we probably think maybe we like shrink that wealth gap a little bit.

441
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
But good, but good news.

442
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Good news.

443
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
The wealth gap is widening again.

444
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,800
So soon we'll have soon we'll have a big old underclass that can be the upper class.

445
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
You know, there's been because I was actually thinking about that.

446
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
And I was, I heard that, you know, the wealth gap is the widest it's ever been.

447
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Does that mean that?

448
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Okay.

449
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
I don't know about the widest it's ever been.

450
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
But it's okay.

451
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
But it's widening.

452
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,800
I mean, you know, considering exactly how rich Bezos may be, it could well be.

453
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,800
I mean, he, you know, it's such ridiculous wealth that guy has compared to other people.

454
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Okay.

455
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Anyway, by pointing to the issue is that the people at the bottom are being a condensed group.

456
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,800
So that group doesn't have enough play between the top and the bottom to get that kind of made servant culture thing going on.

457
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Because the top people, of course, can afford this kind of a thing.

458
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
But it's not like wide.

459
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Okay.

460
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
You know what?

461
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Never mind.

462
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Never mind.

463
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:08,800
No, I think like, imagine like the middle class that like, if we're in that bracket, like the jobs we could do, we wouldn't become butlers for the super

464
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
rich above us.

465
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
But we totally could.

466
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,800
And then we would get to be like hanging out in a really cool house a lot of the time.

467
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
All that we would need to do is clean up.

468
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,800
I was a tour guide in some of the Newport mansions, which are some of the craziest, like, they're like America royalty mansions, basically.

469
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Some of the biggest spildons in America.

470
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:34,800
It's always been interesting to me the idea that, you know, the Butler is like a lower class person doing a job and stuff.

471
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:41,800
But they get to live and work in a really, really upper class amazing place.

472
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Yeah.

473
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:49,800
And if they have a nice like employer, then it seems pretty cool and pretty great in every aspect.

474
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
It could be worse for sure.

475
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I guess it's almost reminds me like the house Negro versus the field Negro and how the house one would often be fiercely loyal to Massa.

476
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Because, you know, to protect his privileged position relative to the others, despite being a literal slave.

477
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,800
As made famous by Django Unchained and nothing else.

478
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
I'm not sure what to make of this conversation.

479
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
I can't tell.

480
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Like, are you like, are you like, I can't tell if you guys are talking, are you talking about this is a good thing or a bad thing?

481
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I mean, I wasn't thinking of slavery, but now I am.

482
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
I mean, no, no, we're not.

483
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
We're that's a whole other ball game.

484
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
I mean, obviously we're all for that.

485
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:40,800
But I mean, I suppose thinking backwards, if the reason for this situation, me decrying the fact that I can't easily acquire a butler is due to a fact that the middle class has condensed and possibly like lowered relative to total wealth of the population.

486
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,800
That I suppose that is a bad thing.

487
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
No, no, here's what I think.

488
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:53,800
It's not that you at your current wealth level can't acquire a butler anymore, whereas maybe in the past you could have.

489
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:01,800
In the past, in those times, you would have just been poor and someone else would have been richer and maybe they would have hired you as a butler.

490
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Why? What do you mean?

491
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Because I would have been like, I'm not a noble or something.

492
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:17,800
You're not you're not high enough on you're not high enough on the food chain to like if the wealth gap were to widen to the point where like servants were a thing we're seen as common for like quote unquote the middle class.

493
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Or the average family.

494
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,800
You're not high enough on the totem pole that you'd be above the gap if it were to open again.

495
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
If we just take it back.

496
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,800
If that if that if that gap were to open that you would fall right into that chasm.

497
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Okay, but our dad like is a doctor when I think about like doctors in the olden days.

498
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,800
And again, maybe they're like he wouldn't have made it because doctors are not would never like rich people.

499
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,800
The richest people in all this businessmen to get a servant of some kind in like I don't agree with that.

500
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
I don't think so.

501
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,800
I think there were all like entrepreneurs and businessmen and people who were born into families who had that stuff already.

502
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,800
This is a lot of talking out of our ass.

503
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I mean, have you been on this podcast before?

504
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Munchie research informed statements.

505
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
No, no, no, no.

506
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:14,800
I want to distribute my my energy on the most efficient things possible and like do in my dishes feels like a waste of time.

507
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,800
I would be happy to pay someone to do that so I could spend that time doing other stuff and that's.

508
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
You can buy a dishwasher.

509
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm pretty sure.

510
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Nate, I'm pretty sure.

511
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I mean, like.

512
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,800
I mean, there were times like lazy, but I just want to do more work is the thing.

513
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:37,800
So, you know, there were there were times when our dad like would hire like a maid or something to come not on like a regular base.

514
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,800
But like to just come and like clean the house or whatever.

515
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,800
And and I mean, I mean, they my point is those things do exist.

516
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Those jobs do exist and people do.

517
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Of course they just seems like for the for the yes, but I want like a regular person who's there every day to do the cooking and cleaning that and I will be happy to pay.

518
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Well, that just well, that just seems inefficient because they're not going to.

519
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,800
They're not going to have to do a full house clean every single day.

520
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
You don't even need to pay for that.

521
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
That's called a wife that knows her place.

522
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Well, that's fair.

523
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,800
But like here's but I don't believe it's tough to control a wife.

524
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
It's much easier to control an employee.

525
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
So I'm happy to just use that mechanism.

526
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,800
You're just you're just not malicious enough to get the control.

527
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
That's possible.

528
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
That's possible.

529
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Why control with your wallet when you control with fear?

530
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Fair, fair.

531
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Ben, I know I know this episode start.

532
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Oh, you want to finish this conversation?

533
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I just going to say, yeah, you want someone to do your dishes.

534
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
You can hire someone to do your dishes.

535
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Wait, have a son.

536
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Have a son.

537
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I guess that's the way to do it.

538
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
I think unironically having children seems like the American way.

539
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
You can never have a son.

540
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
In time.

541
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Well, it never works for our dad.

542
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
We never did our fucking dishes.

543
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,800
He will use dishes and he will not wash them up and then you'll have to wash them.

544
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Well, that's unfortunate too, I guess.

545
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Okay.

546
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Ben, you didn't like the way this podcast started out, but I've got a segue for you.

547
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Free of charge, although you do owe me interest.

548
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,800
I heard that you ripped me off and I heard that you followed my footsteps

549
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,800
trying to eat some of the same glory that I achieved in the procrastiners' pockets

550
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,800
and you went to a political rally.

551
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Oh, God.

552
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Oh, yeah.

553
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
That's right.

554
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I did.

555
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Yeah, I went to a Yang rally.

556
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
That's boyish.

557
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Yeah.

558
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,800
You know, a lot happened this week, like way more than usually happens in a week for me.

559
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,800
So like, I'm like forgetting some details, but yeah, I went to a Yang rally.

560
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Thursday, I think.

561
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,800
And I just barely missed the chance to get a photo with the guy.

562
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,800
I'm so pissed because I didn't think he was doing that.

563
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I didn't think I could shake hands and take a photo with him and I really had to pee,

564
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
so I went to go find a bathroom and I came back and I saw,

565
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,800
no, he was fucking taking photos with people and shaking their hands.

566
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Not wearing a diaper to the rally.

567
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
So I got in line, but it was too late.

568
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
It was too fucking late.

569
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
He was sick of us, I know.

570
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Ben, Ben, did you see the article that I tweeted like two days ago?

571
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
The hologram.

572
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Yes.

573
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,800
How he wants to have used like the hologram technology to have rallies at multiple locations.

574
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Oh, like the Miku technology.

575
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Yeah.

576
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
That's pretty funny.

577
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm not sure that's real.

578
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Like that he's really going to do that, but it would be really funny if he did.

579
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
As long as it was marketed as like, it's not really me guys, it's a hologram.

580
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
That sounds great.

581
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
That sounds fine.

582
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
That's really going to appeal to the Midwestern truckers,

583
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
whose jobs he's out to protect.

584
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
That's how you get through to those people.

585
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
I have to ask you Ben, because I want to know how similar it was to the Bernie rally.

586
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Because Bernie was, there was a lot of build up to Bernie.

587
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,800
There was like hours of just like, you know, people warming us up with the crowd.

588
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
And then Bernie came on and he just said,

589
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
I'm Bernie Sanders.

590
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Here's what I've said.

591
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Here it is again.

592
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Goodbye America.

593
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
And then he left.

594
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
How old was Yang?

595
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Did he have any personality?

596
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,800
And then he left America and pledges loyalty to Putin for once and all.

597
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Okay.

598
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,800
So the Yang rally was basically like, I got there a little bit early.

599
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
I was just going to hang in it.

600
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,800
We were just going to hang it out around sort of a pagoda munchie.

601
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Actually, do you remember the place in Boston?

602
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Of course.

603
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
I know exactly the way.

604
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,800
I saw one, I saw like, like just the zoomed in shot of Yang talking.

605
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
I could tell exactly where it was.

606
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
I know exactly where.

607
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,800
We made our slime court pact that we've never acknowledged what the logo looks like.

608
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Yeah, that's right.

609
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
It's the, yep, that exact one.

610
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
He was, he was, well, okay.

611
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,800
So I got there and at some point they like got like a group of like tastefully ethnically

612
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:45,800
diverse, like you young people to get up there with Yang signs and like sort of stand as

613
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,800
like a backdrop sort of up on the podium, just sort of looking nice.

614
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Was the crowd just a few too many white faces out there to make everybody comfortable?

615
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
A lot of Asians actually.

616
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
A lot of Asians in whites in Boston.

617
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,800
There was like, the crowd was like almost half Asian, I think.

618
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Yeah, okay.

619
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
But anyway.

620
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Is that how I take people to the fast one?

621
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Yeah, yeah, true, but he doesn't push that.

622
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Like he almost like, he almost like deliberately backs off from like that.

623
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Like whenever, when anyone ever asks, when anyone asks him about like, you know, being

624
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,800
an Asian American running for president, he, he, he's like, you know, I'm not really,

625
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
you know, like that's not really.

626
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Well, everybody knows the identity politics stack Asians do not fare well because they're

627
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
doing so well in America.

628
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
So, but okay, fair enough, fair enough.

629
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Yeah, whatever.

630
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,800
But anyway, so he's, so there's a bunch of people up there and then this like young,

631
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
it's like maybe like 25.

632
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,800
So like girl is like, she's like, she's like out, she's asking people like, you know,

633
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,800
crowd in around the podium, crowd in around the, the pagoda or whatever, like getting

634
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
closer.

635
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
And so we do that.

636
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,800
And then we wait a little while and then she gets up there and she's, I don't know,

637
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
she's tired.

638
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Oh, there was one like troll guy walking around with a Keckistan flag.

639
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
But he didn't.

640
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Yeah, but he didn't do anything.

641
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
That was, that was me.

642
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,800
I don't know if I mentioned this, but at the, at the brand rally, there, there were some,

643
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,800
there were some, uh, maybe make America great again, had men.

644
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
They were reasonably well behaved or something.

645
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
So like, what's their game?

646
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Like, okay, I understand you might want to just be informed or something.

647
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,800
And you want to show up and just hang out and see what the opposition has to say.

648
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,800
But like, then you, then you dress up in the cosplay and I'm like, well, you don't do anything.

649
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I literally heard some people like pointing out the Keckistan flag guy and be, and like

650
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
talking about him.

651
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
And like they knew who he was.

652
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,800
He like went to their school and he was just like a troll or something.

653
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Apparently he like goes to like left wing shit, uh, around like just to troll people.

654
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:51,800
So like pretty lame to just like be, uh, the object of like the opposition, but to not

655
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
be doing anything.

656
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Just be like, I'm here to remind you.

657
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
What should he do?

658
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Firebomb the stage?

659
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,800
No, I mean, it's just people are empty.

660
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
That's, people have no souls.

661
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
All they want to do is just be a nuisance.

662
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
It's the same argument about everybody going to support Yang.

663
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
They're just going like the hell.

664
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,800
I was annoyed when I saw him, but he didn't do anything.

665
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
So in the end I was like, well, whatever.

666
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
It's fine.

667
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:23,800
What I'm thinking is like, it's equivalent to like putting on a specific like anime or

668
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,800
like pop culture t-shirt and walking around and hoping somebody will talk about it.

669
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Okay.

670
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,800
The thing is though, that literally defines my entire adult life.

671
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,800
I get that they like people do these kinds of things because they think that they're

672
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,800
trolling, but it's like if you're just going to a place where you know you're not wanted

673
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,800
and dressing in the cosplay specifically just to make people mad at you, then you're not

674
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
really trolling.

675
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
You're just a faggot.

676
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Well, you know what it was.

677
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,800
The reason he did it, the reason he did it is because of any kind.

678
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
You're totally inside.

679
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Sure.

680
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Because those guys knew who he was, right?

681
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
They're like, oh, it's that guy.

682
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,800
It's that guy who shows up to the damn rallies with the Kekistan flag.

683
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,800
So like, you know, yeah, yeah, it was, you know, I've got a reputation now.

684
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
He's that guy.

685
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Everyone knows him as that guy.

686
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Everyone knows him as having like a reputation of like, oh, that famous guy who, you know,

687
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
doesn't-

688
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Oh, yeah.

689
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Everyone knows that guy.

690
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
The Kekistan guy?

691
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
We all sure hate that guy.

693
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,800
We all sure hate that guy, but damn if we don't respect that guy.

694
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,800
The way to steal that, the most charitable interpretation is maybe he is here to like,

695
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,800
literally in his own way, politically advocate for whatever he, you know, the, I don't know,

696
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
the left or something.

697
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
I don't know.

698
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,800
I guess maybe, you know, I don't, I mean, it's fine.

699
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
I'm sure that's fine.

700
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Either way, it's fine.

701
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
It's all fine.

702
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Yeah, okay.

703
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
It's all good.

704
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
There's a guy.

705
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Maybe they'll see the Kekistan flag.

706
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Maybe they'll realize that their policies are stupid.

707
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Maybe if they see this funny meme, then they'll not see it.

708
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
They'll not see it.

709
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,800
You could argue that about every individual action anyone takes in a political space.

710
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
So, you know.

711
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
But it's about the...

712
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
So, the way that, the way the rally went, right?

713
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Like that, that like young woman talked for a little while.

714
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
She just, I don't even remember what she said.

715
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
It was like inconsequential.

716
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
She was like sort of hyping the crowd up a little bit.

717
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Then like this, I'll just, I'm just going to say it.

718
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
I'm just going to say the F word.

719
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Fat woman.

720
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
This fat woman.

721
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
This fat woman.

722
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
This, this, this.

723
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
She came up on the podium and she...

724
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
She's still fat, Ben.

725
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
She's still fat.

726
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Okay, whatever.

727
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
She, whatever.

728
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,800
She was like, she runs like the local like Yang gang, like, like chapter meetups or something.

729
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,800
And she was like, she's, you know, she sort of introduced that and her organization.

730
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Oh, and they were hyping up them.

731
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,800
They were hyping up that Yang was going to be on like a CNN thing.

732
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Like right before Game of Thrones.

733
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
So, they were...

734
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
We're just tonight, by the way.

735
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Oh, shit.

736
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Okay.

737
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Well, so, okay.

738
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Then maybe before Game of Thrones, tune in an hour early and see Yang on CNN or something.

739
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Tune in like five days ago.

740
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,800
They were, they were pushing, they were pushing a thing like, like share the Yang CNN thing

741
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,800
and like organize Game of Thrones watch parties, but like start them an hour early and like

742
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,800
get people to like, or like have a, have a sort of a combined, have a Yang little like

743
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Yang viewing, combine it with your game.

744
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Combine it with your Game of Thrones.

745
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Gang of Thrones.

746
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,800
And then, and then hashtag it, tweet about it, you know, invite everyone.

747
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
You know, that, that was so part of how they were promoting it.

748
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Is, is being, is being a fat woman and being in political like actions like that.

749
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Is that the left-wing equivalent of running around with the Kekestan flag?

750
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Like, it seems like the same thing.

751
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,800
To take the most possible interpretation of politically active fat people, they were

752
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,800
not able to master their own like physical self.

753
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,800
And so they're like, ah, we'll fix society, that will fix my life for me.

754
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,800
You could say that about anything a fat person does.

755
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,800
You could say that about anything a fat person does.

756
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Totally uncharitable, totally unfair.

757
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Very mean.

758
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
It was, it was all for the games.

759
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,800
But, but anyway, so she talked and then she introduced some guy who I had never heard of,

760
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,800
but who was a business guy, question mark, question mark.

761
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Donald Trump?

762
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Don't know that guy.

763
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,800
He like, he, he had like known Yang for a while and he got up there and he was like,

764
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,800
yeah, we met at a wedding, a mutual friend a while ago.

765
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
He got married.

766
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,800
He told me he was running for president and I said, you're crazy man, better you than

767
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
me.

768
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Haha, that's my anecdote.

769
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
All right.

770
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Anyway, give it up for Andrew Yang.

771
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
What is this shit?

772
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
And Andrew Yang comes out.

773
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Hey, so I know Andrew Yang.

774
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
He says he's running for president.

775
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
You know, that's cool.

776
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Anyway, see you later guys.

777
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Nice to see you.

778
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Follow me on Instagram.

779
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,800
So, so, so here's Andrew and then it was really funny.

780
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Yang comes out and he is sort of like, he sort of has maybe a little bit of like a rockstar

781
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
affectation about him.

782
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
I know.

783
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
I saw a clip.

784
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,800
He's like, okay, Bernie's behind a podium pound, pounding the podium, acting like a politician

785
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,800
and then Yang's like destroying podiums that bring out new podiums one after another.

786
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Yeah, exactly.

787
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Yang like jumps out.

788
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
He's where he like kind of runs out on those.

789
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,800
He's like, hey, and he's wearing like this big like American flag like scarf around his

790
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,800
neck and it's sort of hanging and it's like, you know, it's, it's, it's kind of, it's

791
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
a little bit cool.

792
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Open mic night.

793
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
It was really weird.

794
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
He has, he's okay.

795
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,800
I mean, he mostly just sort of repeated his normal talking points.

796
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,800
So yeah, like he didn't say anything new, but like he, he, he, I mean, he wasn't all

797
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
stuff I heard before.

798
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Like he did a bunch of like, I mean, I can't.

799
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
I mean, I can't remember him on the spot.

800
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
He's basically a single issue guy.

801
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
So like it's fair.

802
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Well, not, not, not really actually.

803
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I mean, he's got the, he didn't, he actually didn't emphasize the UBI that much.

804
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Like he, he mentioned it sort of in passing, but like that wasn't like his focus, his focus

805
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,800
on like, you know, technology and, and fucking, you know, job security and speaking to the

806
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Asian crowd.

807
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
So he knows they're fine for money.

808
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Don't need to emphasize.

809
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,800
He talked about, you know, like student loan forgiveness and Medicare for all, Medicare

810
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
for all.

811
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,800
And you know, he mentioned the UBI, but it wasn't like the thing he focused on.

812
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
And he said shit at one point.

813
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Oh, he dropped, he dropped an S-bow.

814
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Holy.

815
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Uh-huh.

816
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,800
And he was just kind of like jokie and like sort of casual about it.

817
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Did he come off as natural and cool or was he sticking the mud?

818
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
He was pretty dumb and drool.

819
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I guess he was pretty natural.

820
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
No, no, no.

821
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
This is what happened.

822
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
He was just hanging around doing this thing, being, being cool.

823
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
And then all of a sudden-

824
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
He's just being cool.

825
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
He pulls out his just being cool.

826
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,800
I was going to say he unbuttons his blazer and under there is his, I'm just being cool

827
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
T-shirt.

828
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Be like Yang, everyone.

829
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Is that Ben Satan the crowd?

830
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Let's get him up here, ladies and gentlemen.

831
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
He's just being cool.

832
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
So am I.

833
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,800
By the way, I want to say I was wearing my homemade or my self-made purple like Yang 2020

834
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,800
like, like sunset pattern like T-shirt to the rail.

835
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Yeah.

836
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Right.

837
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
And uh, wait there.

838
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
Okay.

839
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Okay.

840
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
I, I like him a lot.

841
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,560
I like all his policies, but there are a couple of things that he does that I kind of wish

842
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,640
he wouldn't and kind of wish think are hurting him like he has this line that he says all

843
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
the time.

844
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Okay.

845
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,960
First of all, him, him leaning on the math thing, like I don't get the sense that he's

846
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,240
like a real like, okay, he's an entrepreneur and a businessman.

847
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,720
I'm sure he knows math.

848
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,800
I'm sure he's good at math.

849
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,840
But all right, I was, I was talking to some of my other friends were there at the rally

850
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,800
with me and, um, we were talking about it and one of them said like, you know, I get

851
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,800
the feeling like from his college photos that Yang's not like a nerdy Asian.

852
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,720
Like he's like presenting himself that he's more of like a cool Asian who wore like leather

853
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,240
jackets and like looked good and was crazy rich Asian, one of that crap.

854
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,480
And I, and I, it kind of seems like maybe the whole math thing is just sort of playing

855
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,920
into maybe a stereotype that he thinks would play better.

856
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,440
And I don't, I don't, I don't really get the sense that he's as much of a nerd as he's

857
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,000
like making himself out to be.

858
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,840
And the one thing that I wish he would please stop is at the end, like this is sort of his

859
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
line.

860
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
He says it at the end of everything.

861
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:15,840
He says the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian guy who likes math.

862
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,040
And I think that is like the cringiest, stupidest line.

863
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
That's really awful.

864
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
It's really dumb.

865
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
I get it.

866
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
I've never heard him say that.

867
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,920
I've watched a couple of things that he's done.

868
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,320
He said, he said it in a couple interviews and he said it at the end of this speech.

869
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,440
And every time he says it, I'm like, please stop leaning on that.

870
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,720
I know it's like, ha, ha.

871
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,720
It's a joke about my ethnicity.

872
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,080
What happened to his other catch for the catch phrase I've heard him say a lot is like, it's

873
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
not left or right.

874
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
It's forward.

875
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
And I thought that was.

876
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Oh, sure.

877
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Well, he, he says that too.

878
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,040
Something that he just said once and then some campaign manager was like, yes, keep

879
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
saying that.

880
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,120
Say that over and over again.

881
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
People will love it.

882
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,600
Which the Asian thing or the left, right thing?

883
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
The Donald.

884
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
The Asian thing.

885
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Probably both.

886
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
The opposite of Donald Trump.

887
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,120
He plays well with a certain crowd, but I hate that crowd and I don't want to be a part

888
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
of it.

889
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,120
Agreed.

890
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
You know, again, so not.

891
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,480
I kind of like, I think his whole math thing probably plays well with like a nerdy, like

892
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,720
Reddit, like a self-proclaimed nerdy, like Reddit browsing, like, fuck yeah, science

893
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
kind of crowd.

894
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
I hate him too.

895
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:24,400
I will want to say that through watching the bachelor and the bachelor, I've concluded

896
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,520
that every single normal person on earth would describe themselves as a nerd.

897
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
I don't know.

898
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Not me.

899
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Deliciously.

900
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,520
I'm post that.

901
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,520
I'm post.

902
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
I'm post.

903
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,520
Nerds are cool.

904
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
You're an actual nerd.

905
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
He's older than you.

906
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
You're an actual nerd.

907
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,240
Is what I'm saying that normies think being a nerd is like quirky and cute and they'll

908
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
describe.

909
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Yeah.

910
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
Such given.

911
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Yeah.

912
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
Opportunity to do so.

913
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
You ask anyone off the street.

914
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
They'll say, yeah, I'm a nerd.

915
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
I've like read a book.

916
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
Yeah.

917
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
No, I know.

918
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
I know.

919
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
I know that you're right.

920
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,560
I am so anti the watering down of the word nerd.

921
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Like nerd.

922
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
I agree.

923
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
Should be an insult.

924
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
It should be an insult.

925
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
It should be the worst insult ever.

926
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,240
If I see someone who's just totally socially incompetent, just a slobbering, like more

927
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:15,440
chins than they have like follicles of hair, fucking, you know, stomping down the boulevard,

928
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,440
you know, a person who's on 4chan all day, you know, who's just shit.

929
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
That's a nerd.

930
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,160
You should be able to say, hey, you're a fucking nerd without people co-op.

931
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Yeah.

932
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,960
I'm a nerd because I watch Game of Thrones.

933
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,960
No, you're not.

934
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,960
Yeah, exactly.

935
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,120
You're just normal.

936
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
The words are evolving.

937
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
They're just changing.

938
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
They're shifting under our feet.

939
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
Can you believe?

940
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Can you believe?

941
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
Press B.

942
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Press B to go back.

943
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Oh, man.

944
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Press B to stop the evolution.

945
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,560
You see, you see, dude, I'm so, dude, I'm so hype for a, I'm so hype for Shazam.

946
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,560
Yeah, I'm such a nerd.

947
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
Yeah.

948
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,560
Yeah.

949
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,560
That's my whole thing.

950
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,560
That's like my whole thing basically.

951
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
I don't want to see that movie.

952
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,680
It looks pretty good.

953
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,840
Hey, so I went, I've done a little further research since we last spoke about Yang and

954
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,960
it was just that all I did, nothing incredible was I watched like the Ben Shapiro versus Yang

955
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
debate.

956
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Yeah.

957
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
I haven't seen that.

958
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,160
That was, that was, I liked that one in particular because it was definitely adversarial.

959
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,400
And so that was like good to see someone on the opposite side debating him.

960
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,440
Yang came away looking pretty good overall in that.

961
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,120
I think I'd probably like him more than before I watched that.

962
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,120
I agree.

963
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,160
He really does lean into his business side in a way that is comforting for someone like

964
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,920
me who is my alarm bells of just like, oh, we're just trying to like, you know, siphon

965
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,200
money away from people who are, you know, whatever, doing better to people who will

966
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,360
just fuck it up anyway, which I mean, still could happen.

967
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
But I don't know.

968
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,280
There's lots of questions about if this would work anyway.

969
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
But yeah, I don't know.

970
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,720
So the thing about Yang and really all politicians, and I don't say this to really shit on Yang,

971
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,600
but your, your description of him coming out like a rock star really makes me think about

972
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,600
how like, God, I hate the reality that we have like, it's the cool kids.

973
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:03,080
It is now officially the cool kids who become our leaders and politicians when God, I yearn

974
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,440
for the Nixon era.

975
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:11,680
I want a curmudgeonly weird, slobbery old nerd, a fucking weirdo freak asshole.

976
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,560
And sure, maybe Nixon was a bad guy, whatever.

977
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
But I want a freak.

978
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Sure, you had some faults.

979
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
You know what?

980
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
You're over that.

981
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,560
Yeah.

982
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
Nate, have you seen that movie?

983
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,560
Oh God, I think it's called Frost Nixon or a little, hold on, hold on, that's the interview.

984
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,560
It's the interview, right?

985
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,240
It's a, it's a, yeah, it's called Frost Nixon and it is a, it's a movie that is like based

986
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
on the interviews.

987
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
I saw much of it.

988
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
Yes.

989
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
I watched it.

990
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,960
I think YMS recommended it and that's why I watched it.

991
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,480
Okay.

992
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,080
All I want to say about that is that, yeah, in that movie, they like, like Nixon is a

993
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,080
pretty old man.

994
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:51,440
Like he's got to be like 60, but like, they pushed the idea that Nixon is like really

995
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,440
sexy.

996
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,360
Like they say he's sexy.

997
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:59,160
Like, no, like, like, yeah, like, like before, well, it's just funny because like, like he's

998
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,320
still old, but like they, like, I think before Nixon ever, it's like before anyone sees him

999
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,760
before he appears on screen, like the love interests, I remember, she says like a sultry

1000
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
way.

1001
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,160
They're talking about, like, wait, we're gonna be, we're gonna go meet Richard Nixon.

1002
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,040
You mean president Richard Nixon?

1003
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,080
You know, I hear he has the sexiest voice.

1004
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,440
I am not a fucking...

1005
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,480
Well, and then in the movie, he is played by someone with like an extremely dulcet,

1006
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
like baritone.

1007
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,480
Well, that's a little odd.

1008
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
I mean, power is sexy.

1009
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,200
But it doesn't, but it doesn't sound completely unlike him.

1010
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,920
So like, it doesn't, it sort of works.

1011
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,760
They sort of pull it off, but like in hindsight, you're like, boy, that was really weird.

1012
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,520
They sold me on this idea that Nixon was like the sexy guy.

1013
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,600
And you know what, maybe I'm a little, I didn't live through the Nixon era, obviously, but

1014
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,000
like maybe I'm being sold in a completely opposite direction that he is in fact, like

1015
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,440
a weird old troll, but that's, that's what I've come to understand.

1016
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,800
But my point is like, I want academics and like scientists and like smart people like

1017
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
that.

1018
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,000
It's just that those people are doing things.

1019
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,440
I don't think a scientist has ever been the president.

1020
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,120
I don't think like, like a real academic has never been the president.

1021
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,520
I think like Eisenhower made a lot of sense.

1022
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,400
Like World War II, you know, leader or whatever.

1023
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,960
And I think he went on to become president.

1024
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,320
That seemed like a pretty good choice to me.

1025
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,120
That guy knows what's up on like the world stage and whatnot.

1026
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,360
This like, I don't know, businessman like Wall Street stuff.

1027
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,360
I don't know.

1028
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,360
Obama was okay, I guess, is like a pick.

1029
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,360
But I don't know.

1030
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,040
I want someone who's like a real old fuck.

1031
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,040
Who just knows shit.

1032
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,120
I want an old, I liked an old fuck for president.

1033
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,120
Yeah.

1034
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,120
Make that a shirt.

1035
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,920
Make that a shirt just like the American flag in the background and like an old 2020

1036
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,480
and an old fuck for specifically not one who's been in nothing but Pollock.

1037
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
I want like a general.

1038
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,960
I feel like generals are a good choice.

1039
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,160
I don't want a fuck.

1040
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,960
I don't want a military guy liked by anyone because as soon as a candidate is like, then

1041
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,160
they have a group.

1042
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,640
And once they have a group, that's when, you know, groups breed stupidity.

1043
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,240
I want a president to get in somehow with no votes.

1044
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,640
I want them to just take over.

1045
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,240
I want to say, Justin, you seem to be an object of democracy as a group.

1046
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:13,320
I want Ebenezer Scrooge to rise from the grave on a pale horse and take America by force.

1047
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,720
Ebenezer.

1048
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,480
King George III needs to arise from the grave and be like, look what you fucking retards

1049
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,480
did.

1050
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,320
It took a while, but the whole system broke down.

1051
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,880
You know, the reason why Eisenhower comes to my mind is like a good, it's because like

1052
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,240
he was like a World War II general that like everyone in the world is like, oh, those were

1053
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
the good guys.

1054
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,600
But like now what we have is like, I mean, to a degree, it's like, oh, let's go invade

1055
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,200
some more Middle Eastern countries to acquire more resources.

1056
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,640
I don't want one of those guys.

1057
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,040
This is why I'm kind of, I don't know.

1058
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,560
You know, I've only seen a little bit of, oh God, is it Kamala Harris?

1059
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,560
Yeah.

1060
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,120
Kamala Harris, she's a veteran, right?

1061
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,600
No, you're thinking of Tulsi Gabbard, I think.

1062
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,600
Tulsi Gabbard.

1063
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
Yeah, Tulsi Gabbard.

1064
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Gabbard.

1065
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,720
I don't know if it's just that everyone, whatever, I've heard it both ways.

1066
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,240
Well, I don't know if it's maybe just that people ask her about her like, like, like

1067
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,720
foreign policy opinions more often, so she ends up talking about it.

1068
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,720
But every time, every time I hear her talking, she's talking about like some fucking foreign

1069
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,600
policy, like military shit and like, I don't care about that.

1070
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,920
I don't want to lean into that.

1071
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,920
I kind of think maybe we should not have a veteran for president.

1072
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
But Ben, but Ben.

1073
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,920
I don't want a military guy.

1074
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,040
I don't want to fucking care about that.

1075
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,480
We got to pull out of foreign entanglements, please.

1076
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,920
That she wants to do less of it is her whole point.

1077
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,440
That's why she's talking about it.

1078
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
That's like her main.

1079
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
Is that her main thing?

1080
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,440
Yeah.

1081
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,440
Absolutely.

1082
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,440
Absolutely.

1083
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
Oh, God.

1084
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Oh, God, I spoke out of turn.

1085
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,440
I spoke out of turn and I made an ass of myself.

1086
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,440
Oh, God.

1087
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,440
Okay.

1088
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,640
Well, I want to say Buttigieg is also a veteran, but I've heard him say, like, we need to like,

1089
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,560
you know, end foreign entanglements and like do less of that whole like foreign fucking.

1090
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Yeah.

1091
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,400
I mean, obviously, I think we've most of us are here, but.

1092
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Okay.

1093
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,400
Nah, I'm for war.

1094
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
More war, please.

1095
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
Yes.

1096
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,640
The ever popular for war position.

1097
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,360
I need four wars per year.

1098
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,360
Yeah.

1099
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,360
I'm four, four wars.

1100
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
Four wars.

1101
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,360
Year.

1102
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:09,240
You can make like a Japanese haiku that's like, ah, yes, in the fall, I commit, I commit

1103
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,600
war in the winter.

1104
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,760
I commit second war in the spring.

1105
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,160
It is time for more war.

1106
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,640
And in the summer, I settle down to yet another war and life goes on.

1107
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:22,560
It's like the hobbit and Lord of the Rings, like, yes, but what about second war?

1108
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:36,520
We defeated so about second war, we need to fight again that literally happens in the

1109
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,520
books, too.

1110
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,800
After they have second war and they fight Saruman.

1111
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,800
That's true.

1112
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,600
They just can't get enough of those greedy fucks.

1113
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,320
Well, we blend a lot here today.

1114
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,560
Did you include everything about the Yang Gang rally, Ben?

1115
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,560
Oh, yeah.

1116
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
Any closing thoughts on that?

1117
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,080
Oh, I mean, that was pretty much it.

1118
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,080
That was what happened.

1119
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,080
That was what the speech was like.

1120
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,080
Was it fun?

1121
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Did it not make you want to die?

1122
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,880
Like how the burning rally made me want to die?

1123
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,880
That's a fair question.

1124
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,200
No, it was fine.

1125
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,480
The only thing that made me want to die is that I missed my chance to get a picture

1126
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,480
with them.

1127
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,480
Yeah, fair enough.

1128
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,840
And you know, I don't know, like, I'm not even with, I don't know, I don't even feel

1129
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,560
like I came across particularly anti-Yang here or anything like it's just like political

1130
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,800
the political arena is so inherently, I don't know, like it's all it's very unfortunate

1131
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,960
that it is like, like it is.

1132
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,000
If you know what I mean, ladies, people don't think it'd be like it is, but it do, but it

1133
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
absolutely do.

1134
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,320
And no one can argue that fucking try and prove me wrong.

1135
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,040
Stephen Crowder sign.

1136
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,280
Some don't think it'd be like it is, but it do change my mind.

1137
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,280
Yeah.

1138
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,280
Okay.

1139
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,880
Anyway, I knew what else is going on ladies and gentlemen.

1140
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,600
So yeah, that's it.

1141
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:55,800
Yang Gang, pretty good, better than Bernie, I would say, by a narrow margin, but a narrow

1142
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,200
but undeniable margin.

1143
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,200
Yeah.

1144
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Okay.

1145
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
All right.

1146
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Hey, I went to that.

1147
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,680
Oh, well, I can let someone else talk.

1148
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,680
I've been going for a while.

1149
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,400
I know what you're going to talk about and I do want to circle back to that.

1150
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400
Okay.

1151
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Yeah.

1152
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,400
Hey, last point on this like, I don't know, political tinged discussion here is I was

1153
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,360
Ben, I realized there's one area of this whole communist ideology that you 100% are for and

1154
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,360
back.

1155
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,360
Yeah, that's right.

1156
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:25,560
And I realized that the prospect that you are always on about about state mandated GFs

1157
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,480
and equal distribution of sex.

1158
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,480
I'm all for.

1159
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,480
Wait, hold on.

1160
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,640
And you might say, but how are you going to handle like what about the consent issue

1161
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,160
of state mandated GFs?

1162
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,160
Well, that's exactly why we need equal distribution of consent as well that I'm all for.

1163
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,160
Spread it thin.

1164
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,160
So like everyone's sort of okay, you know, you know, in this country, but Ben St. doesn't

1165
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,160
consent.

1166
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,160
Well, is it not rape?

1167
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,240
You know, the gulf, the gulf is white.

1168
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:59,280
The consent gulf is widening in this country, you know, 1% of the people receive 99% of

1169
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
the consent.

1170
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,280
It's not fair.

1171
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,280
It's not fair.

1172
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,280
And what is that?

1173
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,280
It's literally true.

1174
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,280
Nothing at all.

1175
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,280
We have to fix it.

1176
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,280
Yeah.

1177
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,120
And I mean, you know, when you, when you got your state mandated GF, she'll be thanking

1178
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,360
you for impregnating her so that her state imposed explosive collar does not detonate

1179
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,120
because it detects the pregnancy.

1180
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,880
So really you'll be doing her a favor in the end of the day.

1181
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,880
Wow.

1182
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,880
You thought of everything.

1183
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,200
It's a brave new future that I'm looking forward to.

1184
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,200
But that's all.

1185
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,200
That's all.

1186
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,200
So you got my vote, Yang.

1187
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,200
Yeah.

1188
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,120
Man, I'm going to vote for him twice now.

1189
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,120
Okay.

1190
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,120
Yeah.

1191
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,120
All right.

1192
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,120
Oh, what do you got?

1193
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,120
What do you got?

1194
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,120
Oh, what do you got?

1195
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,120
What do you got?

1196
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:43,120
I was going to talk to you about something hippo and you too Nate, because as we, as we

1197
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,120
know, something happened yesterday, yesterday, what happened?

1198
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,120
Oh, yeah.

1199
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,120
Oh, yeah.

1200
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,120
Oh, of course.

1201
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,120
Now I remember.

1202
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,120
Yep.

1203
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,120
Okay.

1204
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,120
I'm with you.

1205
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,120
Oh, yeah.

1206
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,120
It's sort of unfortunate that we titled the last episode Homestuck because truly this

1207
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,120
is the Homestuck episode because the first Homestuck epilogue came out.

1208
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,120
Now I was a vocal.

1209
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,120
I did not think this would happen on 4.30.

1210
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,120
I did not think that it would ever happen if I'm honest with you.

1211
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,120
I gave up.

1212
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,120
But it did.

1213
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,120
The first thing came out and we have some thoughts on it.

1214
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,120
Wait.

1215
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,120
It's the 10-year anniversary of Homestuck.

1216
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,120
Yeah.

1217
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,120
4.13 yesterday was 10 years from the release date.

1218
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,120
Wait.

1219
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
And what happened?

1220
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,120
Basically nothing.

1221
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,120
Basically.

1222
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,120
All right.

1223
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,120
I wouldn't worry about it.

1224
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,120
Yeah.

1225
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,120
Well, I'm just going to tune out for this part then.

1226
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,120
Yeah.

1227
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,120
Yeah.

1228
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:38,120
It was the beginning of a series of epilogues to Homestuck, the prologue of the epilogues.

1229
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,120
And by the way, it's only written word, no images.

1230
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,120
Yeah.

1231
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,120
Written word.

1232
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:49,120
It's a sort of like written as if it were a fanfic about Homestuck but written by Andrew

1233
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:55,120
Hussey and two other people, one of which is also an actual like Homestuck fanfic guy.

1234
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,120
I learned.

1235
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:03,120
So he teamed up with a Homestuck fanfic guy and someone else to write a post-canon but

1236
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,120
still actually canon epilogue to Homestuck.

1237
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:15,560
And it details a little bit of information about like John and Rose talking about John

1238
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:21,240
doing a thing that happens in the comic that we didn't get to see in detail before.

1239
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:31,120
So you know, it was an interesting like jokey sort of, what's the word, display, like in

1240
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:38,120
the form of a fanfiction, having all this stuff, he had a whole like first page with

1241
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:45,240
a bunch of like tags, like Archive of our Own, which was a nice touch.

1242
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,240
Yeah.

1243
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,440
And I read it and I kind of liked it, but a lot of people are just mad because it's they

1244
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,440
hate Homestuck now.

1245
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,440
That's me, baby.

1246
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,440
Right over here.

1247
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:00,440
It is exactly what it may sound like and that's weird, flowery fanfic tier writing.

1248
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,440
Absolutely.

1249
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,440
But it's on purpose.

1250
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,440
It's a big brain intellectual that's like, well, you're the idiot for not getting it.

1251
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,440
I mean, it wasn't like written as if it was a bad fanfic.

1252
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,440
Like it's still like competent.

1253
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,440
Yeah.

1254
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,440
Well, okay.

1255
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,840
They're trying to like, I don't think, okay, it only comes across in the, in like the format

1256
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,360
of it where there's pros and then there's dialogue sections and, you know, obviously

1257
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,040
the whole like aesthetic way it's presented.

1258
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,040
But I don't know.

1259
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,080
I don't really get the sense they're trying to make it like a fanfiction, though I guess

1260
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:33,160
I could be wrong in the sense of like writing because it doesn't, they don't lean into it.

1261
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,160
I wouldn't say it.

1262
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,160
I think you just presented it that way.

1263
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,160
What do you mean they?

1264
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,160
Wasn't it written by Andrew Hussey?

1265
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
No.

1266
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,160
I said two people.

1267
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,660
Andrew Hussey and two other people.

1268
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,660
Oh God.

1269
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,600
See, this is what I hate about Homestuck because it's not written by Hussey anymore.

1270
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:53,480
Well, the parts he did write are like maybe the worst parts of it possibly.

1271
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,480
He wrote the title.

1272
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
Wait.

1273
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,480
You know what?

1274
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,480
I think Homestuck's dead.

1275
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,480
I actually don't know who reward I assume he wrote the title.

1276
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,480
I said, you know what?

1277
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,480
I think Homestuck's dead to me.

1278
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,000
I mean, that's how it feels.

1279
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:10,840
I mean, I was, I was thinking about like how this feels like I would be mad if I thought

1280
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,440
Homestuck was still alive, but it feels more like an autopsy, but not even like in a bad

1281
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
way.

1282
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,840
I'm just interested to see what, what comes from this.

1283
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,840
That's, that's fair.

1284
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,600
I wasn't really, I wasn't really waiting for the epilogue.

1285
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,000
I wasn't really like, oh, I really want the epilogue.

1286
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It will fix everything.

1287
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,240
I'm just like, well, now it's here and I'm reading it and it's like, yeah, all right.

1288
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,960
People who say like they were waiting for the epilogue to fix things have a completely

1289
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,600
like a different understanding of what made Homestuck bad than I do.

1290
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,600
There's nothing to fix.

1291
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,040
I don't give a shit if you like, oh, they go by and they'll go, they go back and fight

1292
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,680
Lord English, which is what's happening in this epilogue, like, like we have, like we

1293
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,400
just literally see the fight.

1294
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,520
Oh, don't, Homestuck's fixed now.

1295
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,680
That's completely separate from the issues.

1296
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:01,200
You can't like, the only way to fix Homestuck is to literally just rewrite it.

1297
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,960
I don't care the structural plot.

1298
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,200
I care at the moment to moment dialogue that just tanked and went to shit and is still

1299
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,200
bad now.

1300
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
That's fair.

1301
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:16,800
I mean, so there's a lot of meta things going on with it that I don't even hate it.

1302
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,320
It just was boring to me.

1303
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,960
This epilogue, like, it does not enrage me in the same way an axis thing was where I

1304
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,200
feel like I'm just completely wasting my time.

1305
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,200
It's so short and just boring.

1306
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,880
It's just boring and I don't, I don't care.

1307
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,720
And I wasn't expecting the same way.

1308
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,720
It doesn't matter.

1309
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,960
I give it a little more criticism specifically because what is attempted, like, okay, there

1310
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,160
are specific, in the dialogue, they talk about like, okay, the first thing is when John talks

1311
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,760
to Rose, I guess spoilers, go read it's like three, it's several pages long or whatever.

1312
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,760
It's like three pages.

1313
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,760
It's nothing.

1314
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,760
But they're really long pages.

1315
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,760
But whatever, take a couple minutes.

1316
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,280
Like, so when, when John talks to Rose, they are discussing like how there's a danger happening

1317
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:01,480
and the way that it's introduced is like in the lore of this new Homestuck epilogue thing.

1318
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,920
They're like, we exist outside of cannon out.

1319
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,920
That's what the character say.

1320
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,480
This is a real tangible concept.

1321
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,540
We are outside cannon, which you can think of as the story of Homestuck.

1322
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,280
That was a thing released on this website.

1323
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,560
They are outside that now it's a, it's a joke.

1324
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,720
It's like real to them, whatever.

1325
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:22,760
They're talking about John needs to go back and go in there and several things are discussed.

1326
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,440
One is that like the danger they face now is that their current existence faces the danger

1327
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,760
of like, they say, I forget the exact words they use, but like fading from effectively

1328
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,840
relevance, which I understand we talked about this to me and Gabe.

1329
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:41,400
I get the idea that it's that, that the audience will stop caring and that we won't think

1330
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,400
about them.

1331
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,680
And so like they won't exist to us.

1332
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:50,140
This is the meta point being made that like, oh no, if we don't make more Homestuck content,

1333
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,640
we will be forgotten about.

1334
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,640
We like extended universe.

1335
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,640
I don't know whether that was, I don't know whether that was literally the point.

1336
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,640
Oh, that was absolutely intentional.

1337
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,640
No, no, no.

1338
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,640
Yeah.

1339
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:03,040
Well, that, that wasn't, I guess, an intentional, I don't, hmm, I'm not sure that was like the

1340
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,240
message they were trying to get across with that.

1341
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:11,200
I think it was just sort of like, in an epilogue, the idea that if these characters who are

1342
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:18,400
in an epilogue, which is not part of the story, and, and John has retcom powers, and is like

1343
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:25,480
shown to go in back into the comic after he completes it to do something, then like, what

1344
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,120
would the character, why would he do that?

1345
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:32,920
Why would the characters, like these characters who are no longer part of the comic, who are,

1346
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,320
you know, effectively happy and fine, and nothing will, you know, bother them.

1347
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,320
It was like an exploration of what if the characters in the epilogue knew that they were

1348
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,120
not part of the story anymore, and I was just sort of like a thing.

1349
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,120
I mean, that's exactly right.

1350
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,760
But Hussie has chosen to make it a thing for these new characters that, I mean, we know

1351
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,960
as readers that these are the same character.

1352
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,520
This is canon in real life to us.

1353
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:00,960
He has chosen to make it a problem for us by continuing the story that we, the audience,

1354
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,120
will forget about them.

1355
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,440
That is the problem they made into a tangible danger for the characters.

1356
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,440
That's the way it was described.

1357
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,440
It's definitely intentional.

1358
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,040
I can't, I don't know how, like, you, okay.

1359
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,040
Maybe I just didn't realize.

1360
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:19,000
I mean, the solution to this problem, the solution to the danger is to not write this story.

1361
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,640
That makes it not a danger.

1362
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,320
And then in our minds, the characters just quote unquote live happily ever after in whatever

1363
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,280
way anyone chooses to think about it.

1364
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,520
He's choosing to make this an issue and he doesn't need to.

1365
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,560
So cynically into that thing.

1366
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,520
It's a really honestly interesting thing.

1367
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,520
But it's true.

1368
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,520
That's so clear.

1369
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,520
No, no, no, no.

1370
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,520
I'm saying we can take it like one step farther than that.

1371
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,520
Okay.

1372
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,520
Okay.

1373
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,820
This, okay.

1374
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:48,780
This could be like almost like, you can read into this a lot of things, one of which could

1375
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:55,640
be like, it sort of factors into this media in a way where it's like Andrew, Buddy, people

1376
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,640
are losing Homestuck.

1377
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,640
They don't care about Homestuck anymore.

1378
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,200
You don't see that many cosplayers at Anime Expo anymore.

1379
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,960
They're losing relevance.

1380
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,960
You got to bring them back.

1381
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,920
You got to do the epilogue that you tease that one time in one sentence like two years

1382
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
ago.

1383
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
You got to do that.

1384
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,880
It's been three years, by the way, since it ended.

1385
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,880
Okay.

1386
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,880
Three years.

1387
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,160
So you could read like, you know, John's being forced into this scenario just sort of out

1388
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,160
of the blue.

1389
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,080
He doesn't like, he is not.

1390
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,080
John's being forced to dance for his money like a painted up horse, draw it out across

1391
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,800
our computer screens again.

1392
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,800
Yeah.

1393
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,280
You could read that maybe Hussie's doing something similar.

1394
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,720
And John is, John like Hussie is so cucked of a character.

1395
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,920
He is alone.

1396
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,920
He is sad.

1397
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,760
He's let his relationships dwindle in the 10 years since Homestuck ended.

1398
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,080
It is, it's every nightmare I ever have about a character and the way to fix this is to

1399
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,280
just not write the story and let me imagine the happy ever after.

1400
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,280
That's the solution.

1401
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,280
Okay.

1402
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,280
But he's choosing not to.

1403
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,560
I want to know what the like, the intention, like what is Hussie trying to convey?

1404
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,280
Make more money, please, Viz Media.

1405
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,280
Capitalize on the brand.

1406
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,280
Hold on.

1407
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,880
I just mean like, John was like this, he was like a weird sadistic, obviously not as pronounced

1408
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,080
or like explicit, but he was like this in the, the Snapchat stuff.

1409
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,200
He was like a weird loner that no one talked to.

1410
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,920
And like, I just want to know because I'm genuinely interested, like, why?

1411
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,640
This was never a thing about John before.

1412
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,640
Why is he sad or depressed?

1413
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,320
Maybe it represents Hussie's feelings about his own life.

1414
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,320
I don't know.

1415
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:40,480
I mean, there's no like contradiction with that because John didn't have like nearby

1416
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,480
friends.

1417
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,480
He only knew people online.

1418
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,800
But he talked to them.

1419
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,800
What do you mean?

1420
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,800
He talked to them.

1421
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,800
No, I know that.

1422
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,720
I mean, ten years is a long time.

1423
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:55,960
There's been parts of like John's like sort of like repressing of emotions.

1424
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:00,640
Like he doesn't let himself feel a lot of things or like, he doesn't say things when

1425
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:06,560
he feel, when he's thinking things like, the time where he sees his dad, dead, killed in

1426
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,440
front of him and he barely even reacts at all.

1427
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,600
He does talk about moping about how his dad's been dead in the ten years since the end.

1428
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,480
Is it explicitly said that he represses it?

1429
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,640
Because I believe there is dialogue that said that he just doesn't feel the way that other

1430
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,640
people do.

1431
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,840
I believe that was explicitly said.

1432
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,200
Well, the thing is, kids say that they don't feel emotions, but they do.

1433
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:34,320
I feel like that would have been, there was that time on the meteor when he like thought

1434
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,120
the corner was shit and he sort of had a breakdown and went insane.

1435
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,120
Yeah, yeah.

1436
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,520
It's just like, he's a teenager and a lot of homestuck is about growing up.

1437
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,920
And John is just sort of like things about things that he just didn't, didn't have like

1438
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:55,120
the, the emotional capacity to, to react to properly, just sort of made him, I don't know.

1439
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:01,240
Hey, but how about the section of the epilogue though, where John is, is understandably questioning

1440
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:07,000
what exactly is the nature of the relationship between Roxy and the Calliope.

1441
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,240
And I mean, I've been wondering that all along too.

1442
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,440
And I mean, it clearly establishes John and Roxy, despite the obvious intention for them

1443
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,360
to be an item, did not get together.

1444
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,360
And you know, that's okay.

1445
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,360
That doesn't violate anything.

1446
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,360
It's just unsatisfying for me, but that can be intentional.

1447
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,520
I mean, yeah, John, John is like a real fuck.

1448
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,520
Like it is.

1449
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,880
I don't feel like it's too, I mean, it's very sad.

1450
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:36,120
It's very sad and like upsetting that John, our good blue boy has, has been like having

1451
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:41,920
had this realistic, upsetting, unsatisfying, like growing ups period of his life.

1452
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,920
I mean, he's a guy.

1453
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,920
How much of his life has to be realistic?

1454
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,420
Oh, okay.

1455
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:52,000
It's weird that John and Roxy were even implied to be a thing and then not followed through.

1456
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,520
John and Roxy did not have like an organic like, like romance blossom between them.

1457
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:03,680
The first conversation, John talks to Roxy, there's immediately like the boy for material

1458
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,680
joke.

1459
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:10,320
They want to bone in their first month, does not develop whatsoever and then they are implied

1460
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:15,600
to be a, they're implied to get closer and closer over their thing through the retcon.

1461
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,360
And then it does not pan out for no reason.

1462
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,600
It's not like they have a conversation where they decide they're not going to be together

1463
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,440
or where Roxy decides that she will be with Cliope or not.

1464
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,920
It just is built up out of nowhere and then dropped out of nowhere.

1465
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,920
That's acknowledged.

1466
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,120
And the only comment on it is like, John's like, yeah, that was a thing.

1467
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,880
It's acknowledged that happened and it's really sad that it didn't work out for whatever

1468
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,880
in canon reasons.

1469
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,880
Well, hold on.

1470
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,880
I think that's bullshit that you're just like, well, it didn't work out.

1471
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,120
And then like, no reason given.

1472
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,800
Like it's like, I think it is weird, I don't know.

1473
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:54,480
I think what the reason for it is that why is it so fucking bad?

1474
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,240
John, there's nothing, there was nothing fucked up about John.

1475
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,240
Like he was fine.

1476
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,240
Yeah.

1477
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,240
I don't know.

1478
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,240
Like what, what, what is this?

1479
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,240
Well, he was fucked up after the time skip.

1480
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,520
He was just kind of a weirdo.

1481
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,120
Uh, I don't know.

1482
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,960
John's always been a bit of a goober.

1483
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,160
He's not been like the most normal person of all time.

1484
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,760
A goober is not like an anti-social loner weirdo.

1485
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,760
No, he's not.

1486
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,520
He's never been like that ever.

1487
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,520
I don't know why any of you are saying no.

1488
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:20,720
What about, what about the fact that his friends only existed on the internet at the beginning

1489
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,720
of Homestuck.

1490
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,720
And he was perfectly sociable.

1491
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,720
He was perfectly sociable.

1492
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:30,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, for fuck's sake, John has been, he's not an outgoing

1493
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,480
social dynamo.

1494
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,720
He is very chill and relaxed and people come to him.

1495
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:41,280
And I'm just saying, like Roxy is more of an outgoing person and John, John wouldn't

1496
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,280
initiate things.

1497
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,200
She would probably be waiting for him to, because she's a girl and that's what girls

1498
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,200
do.

1499
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,200
And he just didn't do it.

1500
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,560
Like, I don't, I don't see, I don't see John being a loner as like, I don't see John

1501
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,560
being a loner as completely out of character for John Egbert.

1502
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,560
I mean, I agree.

1503
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,560
I agree with that.

1504
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,800
I think, I think it's something that can happen and probably happen to Hussie and that's

1505
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,800
why he's written it like that.

1506
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:05,920
I don't think that, like, like, like in theory, it makes absolutely no sense and is a betrayal

1507
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,280
of John's character.

1508
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,600
I feel like it came out of nowhere, it was not probably set up and goes against what

1509
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,880
I perceived the character to be like, I think, pretty rational.

1510
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,520
I mean, and it also, it also just sucks.

1511
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,520
It also just sucks.

1512
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,520
It also just sucks.

1513
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,520
That's a perfectly reasonable point.

1514
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:26,520
In Homestuck, yeah, you're right, John is not the most popular kid in school.

1515
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,640
He's not a social dynamo.

1516
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,080
That's not what I'm saying.

1517
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:35,520
I'm saying that John was already, like, let's say that like, even the physical distance

1518
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,880
was greater, like it was pre the game and he could not fly to people whenever he wanted

1519
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,080
to.

1520
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,320
He would still talk to people because that's what he did in Homestuck.

1521
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,320
You're right.

1522
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:51,800
He waited for his friends to initiate the conversations, all, but not like exclusively.

1523
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,400
He talked to people, he responded and was completely agreeable.

1524
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,280
I feel like this conversation is honestly pointless because we could speculate all day

1525
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,480
about whether or not it was characterized correctly of John, that he would react this

1526
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,480
way.

1527
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,240
But the fact is he did and you can either like that or not, I just don't think, you

1528
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,240
know, I don't know.

1529
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,320
I have one nugget of info from the, the, the, the author notes of act five, act two that

1530
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,320
I read.

1531
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,320
Okay.

1532
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:20,000
Um, where Hussie was talking about how the romance that, uh, was set up immediately

1533
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,360
between Karkat and Terezi and how that didn't go anywhere.

1534
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:30,480
And the reason he put, he said that he, uh, that it didn't go anywhere in the end was

1535
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,960
because the fact that it was obvious from the start made it kind of less interesting.

1536
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,960
And so he didn't want to follow through with it.

1537
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,520
That sounds rather capricious as an author to just not follow through because things

1538
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,520
are too obvious.

1539
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:47,640
Well, well, I mean, he explained in why it being too obvious just wasn't very interesting

1540
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:54,320
to him and he was like, you know, I mean, it works about the things he likes to write.

1541
01:07:54,320 --> 01:08:00,880
And I think certain realistic, like unsatisfying real life things, he likes to add into things

1542
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,880
like this.

1543
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:08,320
A lot of acts six is about, you know, whether you like it or not, he likes to make things

1544
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:13,040
that just don't have payoffs in the way that you want, want them to like roses, like play

1545
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,000
the rain sort of thing.

1546
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,440
He deliberately threw that under the bus because people were expecting it and he's just kind

1547
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,440
of an asshole.

1548
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:25,960
I mean, I would make a distinction between satisfying character arcs and like adventure

1549
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,120
potential threats that are not significantly built up that don't ultimately get finished.

1550
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,640
Well, it's just, it's just a quirk about Hussie as a writer is what it was just a quirk that

1551
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,640
he intentionally writes bad, badly.

1552
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,160
No, it's not that he does.

1553
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:42,080
Well, I mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not defending it.

1554
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,240
I'm just explaining that this is why this thing with John is probably happening in this

1555
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,240
way.

1556
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,240
People like to build up.

1557
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,600
To make John have like a realistically upsetting, unsatisfying real life.

1558
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,000
But hang on, that word realistic, I feel that you might be using to say that reflects more

1559
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,960
accurately your depiction of how life might go for him versus like if he just like got

1560
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,960
the girl.

1561
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,960
No, I don't mean that.

1562
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:04,960
I don't mean that.

1563
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:10,800
I mean, like in real life, character arcs don't necessarily complete and happy endings

1564
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,720
don't necessarily happen.

1565
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,440
You know, the road, the girl doesn't necessarily get the, the guy doesn't necessarily get the

1566
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,440
girl at the end.

1567
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:23,080
You know, it's just like, um, you know, real life is not like a fiction and Hussie likes

1568
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,520
to put that in fiction.

1569
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
Yeah, man.

1570
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
We're not, we don't have arcs.

1571
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
We're people.

1572
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,520
We're not characters.

1573
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,520
Yeah.

1574
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,720
That, that, that literally that right there is like a very obvious, you know, I don't know

1575
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:39,080
what I don't really like it, but that's just how I understand Hussie.

1576
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:43,600
I mean, I'm absolutely in the camp of it totally sucks that John and Roxie didn't get together.

1577
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,960
So that, I mean, that's just ultimately, it just sucks.

1578
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:46,960
That's all.

1579
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,160
Well, but why?

1580
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,800
I don't think they necessarily had that much chemistry together.

1581
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,320
And again, I think it came out of nowhere.

1582
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,800
But what they just met, they met for the first time.

1583
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,800
Why?

1584
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,200
I know why do they instantly want to have, okay, I guess they didn't even, they just

1585
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
worked together.

1586
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,880
It's, it's not even weird.

1587
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,880
Well, like, what's the point of that whole, like part of the story then, like the whole

1588
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:13,920
thing is that like John and Roxie are having like this, this, this romance or whatever building

1589
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,560
up during the thing.

1590
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,680
And like to have that come to nothing, it's like, well, why did I even fucking bother reading

1591
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,680
it?

1592
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,680
Why don't we just skip to the end?

1593
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,520
Hussie, does Hussie plan out every little thing about like how a character, you know,

1594
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,520
the relationship will progress?

1595
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,520
He used to.

1596
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,520
Yeah.

1597
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,520
I mean, things kind of spiralized.

1598
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,520
It's funny.

1599
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,560
It's funny because it was satisfying when he didn't plan things.

1600
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,880
And then by act six, he probably was planning out everything.

1601
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,400
And so like act five, act five.

1602
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,720
I mean, frankly, I think to say that he planned out everything and then have this Roxy thing

1603
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,360
aside from some world building things he had in mind, like a lot of act five or the troll

1604
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:50,840
like, you know, he didn't have it all mapped out in his head and it was really, really

1605
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,840
funny.

1606
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,840
And it was really good.

1607
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:58,400
What's striking about this Homestuck epilogue is how played straight it is.

1608
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,400
It just is like, okay, two things.

1609
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,960
First of all, there are jokes, quote unquote.

1610
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:10,920
And I said this in a text chat with Hippo where, but they operate at such a low like

1611
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:17,200
frequency and such like a low, like, like they were like three, I could just even think

1612
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:23,200
of and they were so, I don't know what the word is, but just like non-infectual whatsoever.

1613
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,480
It was a depressing thing.

1614
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:30,840
So I could be like, like a, um, like a Twitter joke on your timeline or she's like, you know,

1615
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,800
I guess it's a joke, you know, I read your story as it's intended to provoke humor and

1616
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,520
then you scroll past it immediately.

1617
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:46,160
It definitely feels like a dilution of hussy humor with a fanfic Homestuck author put in

1618
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:50,120
there and someone else like it definitely feels like a three person thing.

1619
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:56,040
Um, I, if I was being extremely generous, which generally I didn't, you know, I like

1620
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:00,120
to be generous, but I don't actually think this is the case in this, but this is an idea

1621
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:07,120
I had is that, um, the fact of it being a fanfiction, uh, is part of the reason why

1622
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:15,000
it sort of isn't that funny, uh, like Homestuck because fanfiction writers often don't stick

1623
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
with the tone of the original work.

1624
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,280
Like if they take like a happy thing, they write a gore fanfic, like everyone's dead,

1625
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,280
like cupcakes.

1626
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,280
Yeah.

1627
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,280
Stuff like that.

1628
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:30,400
They go completely off the wall, crazy or super dramatic and it's like not in line with

1629
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,160
the way the characters are and it's, you know, just because a lot of fanfics are written

1630
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:39,120
by teenagers who are just, um, moody and depressed and horny and that's all they're thinking

1631
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,120
about.

1632
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,800
So they just take the characters that they like and make them do things that they wouldn't

1633
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,800
otherwise do.

1634
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,320
When you're dealing with a, if I'm being extremely generous, fanfiction, you're saying that fanfiction,

1635
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:54,800
you're saying that fanfiction writers don't think that it'd be like it is, and this,

1636
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:01,320
this, this thing that's happening in this fanfiction is like, um, you know, roses on

1637
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:08,960
drugs and like having visions and John has like a choice to make and his emotional, his

1638
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:15,000
relationships have all fucked off and he's really depressed and he maybe will go somewhere

1639
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,960
and never come back and never see his friends again and it's all like kind of depressing

1640
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,360
and dramatic, which is like a fanfiction would be, but I don't know whether that was deliberate

1641
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,920
or not.

1642
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,760
Okay. I haven't read it. I'm just going off of what you guys are saying. Is this a cry

1643
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,760
for help from Hussie?

1644
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,760
I don't think so.

1645
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,760
It's hard to tell, but I don't think so.

1646
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,760
Yeah. I mean, I'd say that's unlikely, but maybe. I mean, who knows? Uh, maybe all the

1647
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,760
homesick.

1648
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,360
I mean, Hussie's probably been crying for help ever since, uh, in his life.

1649
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,760
Yeah. Ever since, uh, the, what is it, the odd hat man?

1650
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,760
The odd gentleman.

1651
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:49,760
The odd gentleman.

1652
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,760
Yeah.

1653
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,760
Ever since then.

1654
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,160
Shout out to, shout out to Hiveswap Quest by Shaddock.

1655
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,760
Yes. Quite good. I'm going to go link that and chat right now. Hold on.

1656
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:05,760
Okay. Good. Hey, it details the, the tremendous, um, fuckery that is the, the release of Hiveswap

1657
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,760
act one and the fact that it's completely delayed and everything sucks, but it's, it's

1658
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,360
funny. It's a funny little animation.

1659
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,360
Poor Hussie.

1660
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,360
Uh, hey.

1661
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:20,960
Shout out to the odd gentlemen for their great work on King's Quest five spectacular as known

1662
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,360
on a steam train, Game Grumps.

1663
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,360
Oh yeah.

1664
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:29,560
Um, I did want to just shit on this epilogue in one other way, uh, which we a little bit

1665
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,960
got passed or, I don't know, maybe people were trying to excuse a little bit, which

1666
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:39,400
was just that like there is specific mention made of how, uh, like one of the things that

1667
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:44,800
John needs to do is go back to like what's described in Canon, I think by Rose or maybe

1668
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:50,080
Calliope, I can't remember. It's like they need to like, quote, fill in the gaps like

1669
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,240
in Canon.

1670
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:56,000
So we're just literally talking about like answering questions that were not addressed

1671
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,400
like that. And I know like, yes, doesn't like ruin or fix home stuck to do this. I could

1672
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,840
put that aside. It's just that like, this just reminds me of, oh, it sure sucked that

1673
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,720
like the whole way that Lord English was defeated, I barely understood it all. And now we're

1674
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,520
going to go answer that question, I guess.

1675
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,520
Uh, cool.

1676
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,720
Just in time.

1677
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:20,280
Why totally still can't word English and homestuck, like fucking Ultima.

1678
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,400
Yeah. Oh yeah.

1679
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,000
Just like, just like Ultima.

1680
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Yep. Yeah.

1681
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,400
Maybe it's it's deliberate.

1682
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,400
I don't understand.

1683
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,880
I've been sitting here for the last like 45 minutes.

1684
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,880
Yeah.

1685
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:32,880
Yeah.

1686
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,320
I wouldn't expect anything less.

1687
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:40,760
Um, so I just want to say that like sure is embarrassing that home stuck didn't like

1688
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,800
write itself well the first time and now needs to go back and like fix things in

1689
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,720
actually even worse if this is what is to be the standard.

1690
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,720
Yeah.

1691
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,200
Like, so this, this is what I'm supposed to call genius of 4D writing to just like

1692
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:57,520
not make it satisfying the first time and go back years later after it's done and try

1693
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,720
to fix it.

1694
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:04,720
I would never like, I like to understand why things are the way they are. I don't like

1695
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:10,160
defend anything that I've been explaining. I don't think Hussie is a genius for writing

1696
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,200
some ways.

1697
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,640
I would say he is. It's just that he's made mistakes.

1698
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,000
Hippo said he doesn't think this is a genius move.

1699
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Okay.

1700
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Okay.

1701
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,400
I think is in the chess game.

1702
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:23,800
I mean, the past is the past. He can't like fix home stuck even though he tried to with

1703
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,600
John's retcon powers, which sucked and I hate, um, and he changed the whole website.

1704
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,600
I think that was a change like tried to fix home stuck. I think it was just like a narrative.

1705
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,560
Well, you're right. He didn't try to fix home stuck. He in fact fucked up home stuck by

1706
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:42,640
changing old panels with his epic 4D retcon panels thing, which I don't even dislike. What

1707
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,640
I just don't like is that the experience of reading the comic will never be replicated

1708
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,380
again because it's been changed due to narrative things later.

1709
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:54,120
And now the books are printing with those retcons in.

1710
01:16:54,120 --> 01:17:00,400
I think that's fine. Like that with the hand, the hands, that doesn't, that doesn't take

1711
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,400
anything away.

1712
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,560
The armors are your hand.

1713
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,440
I'm totally okay with the arm retrieval.

1714
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:10,080
Well, okay. The one thing that it takes away is the, the, the change that you would experience

1715
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:14,280
if you were a current reader reading along, I'm going to argue against that. I actually

1716
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:19,080
think it's better to print with it because now you probably won't notice them on your

1717
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
first pass through.

1718
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,560
Or even if you do, you will just, you probably will just like dismiss it and not know what

1719
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,560
it is.

1720
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,560
You might be right about that.

1721
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,520
And then when you get to that part and you're like, wait a minute, and you might flip back

1722
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,720
in the book and be like, whoa, it was there all along.

1723
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,720
I didn't even know.

1724
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,720
I agree.

1725
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,720
I'll agree.

1726
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:40,360
The story is probably better for that. And I don't mind it. But the thing I do mind about

1727
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:46,800
that is I don't like the potential credit that Hussie will receive for people thinking

1728
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:52,640
that he thought about that ahead of time when he did not and does not deserve to, you know,

1729
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,640
be rewarded.

1730
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,640
All right.

1731
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,640
That's my issue.

1732
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,640
You put a lot of,

1733
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,640
That's dumb.

1734
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:58,640
If you're writing a narrative,

1735
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,640
Because it wasn't in the comic.

1736
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,040
That's how you think ahead of time.

1737
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,040
People lack like it.

1738
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:08,320
Jesse, this is this is one of the things that we know anything like it's never happened

1739
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,320
before.

1740
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:18,480
No, because Jesse, we read the comic and the comic itself changed as part of the Lord.

1741
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,400
He could have planned to not write it in the panels ahead of time.

1742
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:27,360
Nate, you have, I don't know whether this is like smart or not, because I just generally

1743
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:35,200
don't agree with it. But like you put a lot of like emphasis or like cloud on somebody

1744
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:40,320
planning something ahead of time or not. Like if you can't prove that you planned it ahead

1745
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:46,440
of time, then, you know, they don't, they're not allowed to get like credit or like artist

1746
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,440
credit.

1747
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,440
What can I say?

1748
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,440
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1749
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:54,360
I just I just generally don't think that that really matters because it's like how much

1750
01:18:54,360 --> 01:19:01,360
you care about like how much how many good boy points you give to the author.

1751
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,360
I don't know.

1752
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,360
I don't know.

1753
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,360
There's a kind of social currency and narrative intelligence currency that people care.

1754
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:13,160
Well, Nate, if he had written the whole book on his own without putting it online, right?

1755
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:18,880
If he'd just written Homestuck by himself and then released it all at once, then he could

1756
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,840
have like thought of the arm thing later on as he was writing and gone back and added

1757
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,840
it in.

1758
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:30,560
And it would be normal. So like why is it not fine for him to think of something to

1759
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:35,520
add to the comic later on and go back, add it in and then print it as though it was there

1760
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,680
all because like that's just what writing a book is like.

1761
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,680
I mean, you don't have to, you don't have to think of everything in order.

1762
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:45,400
I mean, that's totally fair. But for one, it's simply the fact that like any number

1763
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:49,920
of things or people or ideas could have influenced his process since it was released piece by

1764
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,960
piece as it went through. So, you know, and I'm aware of this like boiled down to like

1765
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,200
how much money the person deserves to make.

1766
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,360
No, it's actually not about money at all. It's about it's about like social cred or

1767
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,280
intellectual cred. That's that's a personal thing.

1768
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,800
I care immensely.

1769
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,960
I understand that you care immensely about it, but like you bring it up in arguments

1770
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,680
with other people who may not have, who may not give a shit about like that amount of

1771
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,920
maybe the audience level.

1772
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,880
It's like, it's like, it's like, well, wait, hold on, we got to make absolutely sure not

1773
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,520
to let this author get more credit for this thing.

1774
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,800
Like we got like, we can call this thing good, but we got to qualify that like this was good

1775
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,800
by accident.

1776
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,120
So we shouldn't we shouldn't give the author credit for it.

1777
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:32,920
Yeah, yeah.

1778
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,320
No, God, stop. Don't be with me. What are you talking about?

1779
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:41,760
It's not like it's not it shouldn't be regarded as even impressive to foreshadow, which should

1780
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,800
just be a given. And if you can't do it and you have to retroactively put foreshadowing

1781
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:51,040
in that wasn't there before, then you failed as a writer and you shouldn't be praised.

1782
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,840
That's so stupid.

1783
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,480
You know what? I don't know.

1784
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:02,520
There's like, when you're when you're writing a book, like the web comic format, the format

1785
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,880
that Homestuck came out and did not allow for that, people write big ass novels, they

1786
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:09,920
spend a year and they still don't just shut up, shut up, they spend years writing a novel.

1787
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,400
They have all that time to go back and rework and re-edit youth like people don't just people

1788
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,400
it's like you're expecting him to get it right on the first try. Nothing's ever right on

1789
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,400
the first try.

1790
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:23,360
Movies go through drafts movies go movies go through fucking a thousand drafts before

1791
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:27,880
they release novels get rewritten and rewritten and rewritten and like it's fine.

1792
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,880
I get it.

1793
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,240
I don't think you do get it because if you did get it, you wouldn't you wouldn't think

1794
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:36,320
this weird thing that you think it doesn't make any fucking sense for some reason, Ben.

1795
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,880
You are equivocating between two very different mediums and assuming that the like everything

1796
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,440
that's involved in one needs to be applied to the other when they're completely different

1797
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,440
and not.

1798
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,520
Isn't that what you're doing?

1799
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,320
Why would you judge them differently?

1800
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,800
Because they're different mediums. Why don't you judge a painting and a song the same?

1801
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,320
They're basically the same thing, right?

1802
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,720
Because it's an internet thing that came out weekly and he didn't have as much time to

1803
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:03,600
maybe edit it for years and years each time that he couldn't have properly foreshadowed

1804
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,360
the first time because it was coming out weekly.

1805
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,360
Right.

1806
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,360
Listen, listen.

1807
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,360
The nature of this foreshadowing thing.

1808
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,640
The hippo let me fucking talk.

1809
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:17,960
If that were a requirement, then if that were a requirement, then what you'd be saying is

1810
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:24,440
it's not okay that he decided on something later to go back and add in because it's like

1811
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,680
what?

1812
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,760
Because like he didn't think of it soon enough and like once and once and once and once you

1813
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,760
and once.

1814
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,080
I think it would be impressive if he had.

1815
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,080
Okay, okay.

1816
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,960
Well, I'll agree that it's not as impressive that he didn't have it all planned out for

1817
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,960
the start.

1818
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:39,960
I think he was agreeing.

1819
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:44,160
I did it.

1820
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:49,400
I mean, yeah, you did it with some of the aspects of the horseshoe stuff.

1821
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,640
I'm better than Hussie is my point.

1822
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,600
That's the whole thing I was getting at this whole time.

1823
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,600
I figured.

1824
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,480
I figured as much.

1825
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:02,840
But okay, just to put a final point at it, the reason why it actually ties back to Digi

1826
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:12,720
and Destiny's debate they had the other day, which is like imagine you've got two Manga,

1827
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:15,680
I'm thinking of Manga right now for whatever reason, but like you've got two Manga because

1828
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,640
like Oda supposedly will find out when one piece is done.

1829
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,360
I don't take this on faith, but he says he had the ending planned all along and when

1830
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,960
it comes out, we'll see if it's good or not.

1831
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,440
And we'll be able to judge it until then.

1832
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,920
I remain agnostic as to how good it was.

1833
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:32,360
Whereas like let's say like something like Naruto, the way Naruto ended was clearly

1834
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,520
not the way things like were intended all along.

1835
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,680
A lot of stuff was kind of made up as a way like the importance of Sasuke was conflated

1836
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,920
to be like the rival of Naruto.

1837
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,640
That became the focus and like what we can learn from this, I think and again, we'll

1838
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:48,800
judge Oda after it's all done is like what we can expect from the quality of the writing

1839
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,840
of the person when they write their next thing.

1840
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,200
It's how impressive do we expect it to be or like someone who's a game developer who

1841
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:01,000
makes a game that's like broken, but then when they make DLC, oh, like that fixes it.

1842
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,320
Well, okay, great.

1843
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,960
But now when you make your new project and maybe that doesn't have DLC, we can possibly

1844
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:10,600
expect it to have some holes or not be fucked up or that stuff.

1845
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:15,440
I think this like leads into like just managing hype, right?

1846
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:24,200
So like George Lucas, he made Star Wars, but like a lot of the good decisions weren't

1847
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,200
entirely his.

1848
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:29,560
So when he had complete creative control, people thought because George Lucas made Star

1849
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:34,320
Wars that the prequels would be really good, they weren't because Georgia is like kind

1850
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:39,120
of not that good at writing as it turns out.

1851
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:44,160
So like what you would like is for people to be more skeptical about giving certain

1852
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:50,960
creatives very much high amounts of praise when they may not actually deserve the praise

1853
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,200
so as to mitigate hype in the future so that people don't get burned.

1854
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,200
More or less.

1855
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,320
Yes, it's about managing consumer choices in terms of what you want to invest your money

1856
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,080
and expectations for personal enjoyment.

1857
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,480
Okay, I mean, a lot of the time where I don't agree with you on things like that, it's really

1858
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:11,200
just because whether or not they deserve the credit, they're basically the same level

1859
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,200
of artist.

1860
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:20,360
I don't think Oda will be a complete hack if something about one piece is not good when

1861
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,360
so much of it is brilliant.

1862
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,480
Well, sure, but that's not really what I mean.

1863
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,400
I mean, maybe it is in the sense that you're talking about things that aren't planned,

1864
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,400
like hockey.

1865
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,680
All the time hockey was not planned and there are some like some holes that I feel hockey

1866
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,680
creates a minor issue.

1867
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,680
The sport hockey?

1868
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,680
Sorry?

1869
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,680
What?

1870
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,680
No, I'm not the sport.

1871
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,680
Conquerors hockey.

1872
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,680
Well, hockey.

1873
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:40,680
H-A-K-I.

1874
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:41,680
So it's an anime thing.

1875
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,680
It's an anime thing.

1876
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,680
Okay, well, you know what?

1877
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,080
I think the people have heard enough on this.

1878
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,080
I think they get our sides.

1879
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,080
Well, there was one point that I wanted to say before we move on about it.

1880
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,640
I just want to say that this entire thing seems like the bane of my existence and this

1881
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,880
is metanarrative at any cost.

1882
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,240
We will do anything as long as it's metanarrative.

1883
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,240
You're talking about Homestuck.

1884
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,240
Yeah, I'm talking about Homestuck right now.

1885
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,240
Okay.

1886
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,240
The Homestuck epilogue.

1887
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,400
Sacrifice everything for the sake of a meta, whatever it takes.

1888
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,400
Yeah.

1889
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,680
Homestuck in the beginning was not like, okay, it was meta in a few ways, but like it's not,

1890
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:19,000
its goal was not to be as like meta as humanly possible, which is what everyone latched onto

1891
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
by the end.

1892
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,080
Just like the only reason to read Homestuck is that it was so fucking crazy, it plays

1893
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,080
with narrative structures.

1894
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,280
I mean, just to put one point on there.

1895
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:31,920
I would argue that Homestuck has done the best job of thoroughly exploring the fictional,

1896
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,120
not meta, real concept of time travel.

1897
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:40,320
It has done a far better job than any other story I've ever read and like that's not

1898
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,320
a meta concept.

1899
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,280
That's just great storytelling and it was sick and dope.

1900
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,280
Agreed.

1901
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,280
Salute that.

1902
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,280
Salute that.

1903
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:53,080
Like I would say like meta can like can enhance a story, obviously.

1904
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:59,640
I'm not saying that being meta is bad, but I'm saying that it was just used sparingly

1905
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:04,880
in the beginning and then ballooned into a larger portion of what the story was about

1906
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,600
than I wanted.

1907
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,160
And now it feels like it's consumed like this entire thing is just one Rose and John text

1908
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:16,440
up about, you know, philosophical, philosophical quandaries, you know, are we canon, we're

1909
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,800
forgetting, we're fading, da, da, da, da, da.

1910
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,720
Whereas I would like to have just heard some of the funny rich dialogue that was in the

1911
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:23,720
beginning.

1912
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,720
I just miss that.

1913
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,720
I don't like that.

1914
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:31,080
Seemingly, the Husseys just now played into the fact that Homestuck is a meta thing and

1915
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,080
that's all that we must pay attention to.

1916
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:41,320
Yeah, it's like it started off as a comic about four kids stuck in their homes and their

1917
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:46,840
quest that is like metaphorically about growing up and then meta stuff also was there and

1918
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,880
now it's completely shifted that's mostly meta stuff and there is no character back

1919
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:51,880
and forth at all.

1920
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,560
I mean, I think that because Husseys talked about many times about or like we've speculated

1921
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:59,760
on arm retrieval famously and elsewhere that like, Husseys doesn't care anymore.

1922
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,560
Like the thing he does care about is I think Husseys is interested in telling meta stories.

1923
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:07,880
I don't think he's particularly interested in these characters and, you know, their stories

1924
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,880
are done.

1925
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:13,880
And so I like maybe he really has been or like encouraged heavily by his media to go

1926
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,880
back and like make more and he's turning it into a meta thing that he does find interesting

1927
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:21,360
with this whole fading from relevance, you know, plot line.

1928
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,360
I don't know.

1929
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,480
And that's not even uninteresting.

1930
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:29,240
But I think as much as saying when you intentionally or not, because you want to or not, when you

1931
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:33,480
sacrifice the things that guys like me and Munchy and Gib and Ben and everybody fell

1932
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:38,960
in love with, which is like the witty snarkiness to like for the sake of getting more meta

1933
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,600
stuff out of there, I just think it's natural to lose some excitement and some of your fans

1934
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,040
in that process.

1935
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,080
So yeah, that's where I'm at.

1936
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,480
I also want to say that no one agrees with me.

1937
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,720
No one, no one, no one in this call.

1938
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:59,000
No one agrees with me in the world that the homesick art was good and then it became bad

1939
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,360
and that's a problem.

1940
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,360
Everyone's like, oh, fucking, you know, whatever.

1941
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,360
No one even read.

1942
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,360
No one even looked at the drawings anyway.

1943
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:05,960
Do you?

1944
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,160
Well, thank fucking God.

1945
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:12,080
So I don't I don't I don't shit on me.

1946
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:17,760
I think, you know, you tried to point out some like sloppy panels in like the later acts

1947
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,640
and like, yeah, they're there.

1948
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,680
But like, there were always some sloppy panels.

1949
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,320
It's not like there were some bad in axis.

1950
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:30,320
It means the overwhelming majority of them were terrible, especially towards the end.

1951
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,240
I assume you mean aesthetically, right?

1952
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,400
Yeah, I mean, in terms of like skill.

1953
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,040
Yeah. OK.

1954
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:39,160
Aesthetically, I think we can that that could be a serious and skill and as well.

1955
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,320
And with that, you might see some pushback on.

1956
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:42,720
Yeah, I don't know.

1957
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,320
I don't I don't I mean, I don't know.

1958
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,360
There's always had it's always had its wonky art.

1959
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,520
Homesick always had its wonky art moments.

1960
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,360
No, it wasn't.

1961
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,120
It wasn't wonky.

1962
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,080
It was just like unkempt and rushed and sort of like slapdash.

1963
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,760
Like he drew a really good drawing, but he left in like little mistakes.

1964
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:07,680
Like when he raised things, he would leave like little like stray pixels around.

1965
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,000
And that was just like part of the look.

1966
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,240
There later, everything's like actually a little cleaner.

1967
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:17,840
But it's just like the the the the the structure of like like the poses

1968
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,440
and the gifts and like the layout.

1969
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,480
So just boring and uninteresting to look at.

1970
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,120
Exactly. Overall.

1971
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:30,240
There is no shortage of iconic panels from mid homestuck.

1972
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,440
That is of course.

1973
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,960
Yeah, of course, there are. Of course, there are.

1974
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,960
But the the completely.

1975
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:42,160
That's a fair point, Munchy, but you know, let's leave it there.

1976
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:43,880
I think the people can can judge that one.

1977
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,920
And OK, I don't know if we get anywhere.

1978
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,600
I mean, I mean, I don't know.

1979
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,400
Munchy, I'm going to say I think that maybe if there's fewer iconic visuals,

1980
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,360
if there's fewer iconic moments in X6, it's probably just because the story

1981
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,200
sucks and not because the art like took a huge downhill.

1982
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,040
It took a downhill.

1983
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,200
Maybe not the hugest that we're exaggerating it.

1984
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,400
Not as huge as the writing.

1985
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,840
Well, sure. Yeah, definitely, but it's 100 percent palpable.

1986
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,560
Definitely, Palpatine, speaking of which,

1987
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,360
Star Wars, Episode nine is coming.

1988
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,760
Well, I can't wait.

1989
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,400
Well, no, no.

1990
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:21,440
Oh, yes, Episode nine is the most disappointing thing.

1991
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,640
I was just saying my car here.

1992
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,480
It's me, obviously.

1993
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,080
But I'll tell you an opinion.

1994
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:31,840
I'll give you a fucking spicy opinion right here.

1995
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,320
Please. I just I want it to be over.

1996
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,840
I don't like Star Wars, and I hate it.

1997
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,000
And that's it.

1998
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,640
It's not that. I think that's so spicy.

1999
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,240
I'm here.

2000
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,760
I don't know how spicy it is.

2001
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,680
No, you're right.

2002
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:43,600
It's not.

2003
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,200
I didn't see solo.

2004
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,000
I haven't seen anyone else.

2005
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,080
I just like like when I saw it when I woke up and I saw that there was

2006
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,480
a new Star Wars trailer, I just felt angry.

2007
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:57,040
Just like, yeah, no, not again, no more.

2008
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,320
I mean, you knew it was coming.

2009
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,280
I knew it was coming.

2010
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,240
But like, I wasn't ready.

2011
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,600
I wasn't ready for the discourse.

2012
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,040
That's what I was not ready.

2013
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,440
It's not it's not it's not even the movies themselves that bothers me.

2014
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:11,080
It's that I know there's going to be a new wave of Star Wars discourse,

2015
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,560
and I'm not fucking ready.

2016
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,040
That's true. That is true.

2017
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:17,720
I can't I can't wait for the hundreds upon thousands of thumbnails of

2018
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:18,680
reviews. Yeah.

2019
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,160
Hey, hey, just a question.

2020
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,640
Whether the media did not make a last Jedi review, right?

2021
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,560
The last one, the last they did.

2022
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,360
They did.

2023
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,760
It was OK.

2024
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,680
Wait, wait, they made a flinket of that.

2025
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:33,120
Played. Yeah, Mr. Plinkett did a completely

2026
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,400
straightforward review of the last Jedi.

2027
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,760
And it was weird that it was not at all.

2028
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:43,040
Yeah, it was not like it was not because like the old Plinkett's when they first

2029
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,360
came out, they had a purpose because nobody had gone that in depth before

2030
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,200
about these Star Wars prequels.

2031
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,920
Like now it's just another fucking YouTube video.

2032
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:55,440
It's this video, the YouTube algorithm.

2033
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,920
It was called the last Plinkett review because at the end,

2034
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,520
I think he goes on about like how there's no reason I did this because

2035
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,600
everyone else has done it.

2036
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,880
Oh, but I did it anywhere.

2037
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,120
Oh, that's a that's a rough.

2038
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:11,080
He said he suggests he says something about a boycott, but it's like it's

2039
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:14,480
obviously not because clearly he's been swallowed by the YouTube algorithm

2040
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,240
and he's going to really make another one.

2041
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,960
I mean, I don't mind having the bags on on the Star Wars because I like

2042
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:20,960
it just feels different.

2043
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,840
It's appropriate. Plinkett should be.

2044
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,680
Videos, not stars.

2045
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,280
That's honestly the thing about boycotting.

2046
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,680
I mean, fucking what's his face?

2047
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,320
James Rolfe with this is what is it?

2048
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,440
Like he's Ghostbusters, boycott, little carnivores.

2049
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:32,960
That's fine.

2050
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:38,160
But boycott, the real big boy thing to do is indeed boycott like any social

2051
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,800
media discussion or interaction with the thing that you're boycotting.

2052
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:46,720
And you can't like hashtag stay away from the Jedi or because all you're

2053
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,440
doing is drumming more attention.

2054
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,320
It's almost at political levels.

2055
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,960
Like I hate Star Wars talk almost as much as I hate hearing people talk about

2056
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:54,560
politics.

2057
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,760
It's that saturated that it's getting to that point in my brain.

2058
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,880
We're like, I hear it and I just want to know what the weird thing is, dude,

2059
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,920
even Democrats and Republicans like red lights, say, but blue lights.

2060
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,920
Wow, you got it, dude.

2061
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:10,600
The thing about Star Wars is, and this is the thing that really pisses

2062
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:15,840
me off about it, it feels like there's the most rage and anger about it.

2063
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,480
And the most like waste of everyone's in the time world for the least

2064
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,160
amount of content that has been generated.

2065
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:27,200
It's like one movie, like at least with Marvel, there's like a movie

2066
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,320
every six months or whatever.

2067
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,080
So like, I get it why that keeps coming up.

2068
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:34,800
But Star Wars is so, there's so little substance in Star Wars.

2069
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:41,040
It's every one episode of Star Trek has more intellectual content than

2070
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,360
any individual Star Wars movie.

2071
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:47,600
There's like, there's like, there's like, there's like, there's like, there's

2072
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,880
got to be 12 Star Wars movies at least.

2073
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,200
And there's like two good ones.

2074
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,320
Two of them are good, only two.

2075
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,160
That sounds about right.

2076
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,920
Episode one, Phantom Menace, episode three.

2077
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:04,600
No, I mean, episode two is the best memes, sand, it's coarse and gay.

2078
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,440
I like Empire and I like Revenge of the Sith, and that's it.

2079
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,920
That's, you don't even like a new hope.

2080
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,640
You don't like episode four or whatever.

2081
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,600
A new hope is boring as fuck.

2082
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,120
That is a boring fucking movie.

2083
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:13,920
What?

2084
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,800
No, there's a spicy take.

2085
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,640
That is a spicy take.

2086
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,000
That's the take we were looking for.

2087
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,800
Yeah, I'm surprised.

2088
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,400
A boomer such as yourself would.

2089
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,200
Star Wars is the most boomer shit.

2090
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,440
It's the most boomer core shit in the world.

2091
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,840
Everyone even talking about Star Wars is a boomer.

2092
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,080
Wait, wait, there's two things.

2093
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:35,040
I can think of two things more boomer and that is Gremlins and Back to the Future.

2094
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,240
I guess that's fair.

2095
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:39,160
I guess they're a little more, more boomer than Star Wars.

2096
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,160
Nate, you mentioned Star Trek.

2097
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,120
Yeah, let's let's diverge immediately away from Star Wars.

2098
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,840
Talk about Star Trek a bit.

2099
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:54,840
I saw a clip on YouTube of Data and Klingon Man, a dwarf, whatever his name is, Wharf.

2100
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,640
I don't know anything about Star Trek,

2101
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:04,680
but it was a scene in which Wharf sort of dismissed like Data is acting captain

2102
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:10,720
and Wharf like was first mate and he sort of dismissed him in front of the crew

2103
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:13,840
and Data pulled him into another room to explain to him how you're not

2104
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:20,240
supposed to do that as acting as his first mate and you know it was like Data is a robot

2105
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:24,880
and you know he said it in a very robotic way but it was sort of you know just

2106
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:30,640
explaining what his role is and then Wharf like oh I'm sorry captain like he just took

2107
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:37,600
took the criticism like a man like an alien man and then they parted on good terms even though

2108
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:43,120
it was just like really interesting a clip and then in the comments everyone was like

2109
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:48,720
I ah I remember this scene I learned so much about honor from you and you know if it was

2110
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:53,920
spooty old Star Wars then that conversation would go with Wharf being like I'm falling

2111
01:36:53,920 --> 01:37:00,720
to the dark side I'm gonna become evil the rage is building inside me one of the things one of

2112
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:06,320
the things I love about Star Trek so much and at least of the two of the three seasons I've seen

2113
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:10,640
of the original of next generation and I mean I've seen some of Voyager not counting that

2114
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:15,680
but uh fucking Deep Space Nine is the insane actually this is a little bit less in Deep Space

2115
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:20,720
Nine because that takes place during like a war but especially in the next generation the consummate

2116
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:26,800
professionalism of every member of the crew they know their duty they do their job they are these

2117
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:32,960
are military scientist people they are there they do not defy orders unless there's some like really

2118
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,680
good reason to do it it's not about being like a rogue it's about being a member of a fucking team

2119
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:44,480
and it feels like there's something so refreshing to just be like ah like there can be order there

2120
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:50,000
can be like a social cohesion between people and people can just be nice and do good things to each

2121
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,800
other and like fulfill their responsibilities watch the next generation and just feel the

2122
01:37:54,800 --> 01:38:00,000
historic feeling that society is worth fighting for and it can feel so good sometimes that's always

2123
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,360
been the point of Star Trek especially TNG it was like showing humanity in the best way and being

2124
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:10,160
like look look what can happen if we aspire to greatness and like commit to it exactly and that

2125
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:14,720
moment you said right there like that literally could be a moment I'm just saying like data was

2126
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:19,760
acting captain against Klingon Klingon alien uh uh androids with data is technically two different

2127
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:25,040
species uh like this could be like a like a racist moment I guess it'd be a speciesist moment or

2128
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:30,240
whatever and like sure you could go to HR or whatever and you could like complain to someone

2129
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:35,200
but instead of doing that he takes them aside they just discuss this as professionals

2130
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:40,560
wharf has a bias as many people do in the next generation against data but the thing is for

2131
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,280
people who don't know so a lot of people know about Star Trek and and data and there's an

2132
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:52,080
android just so people know data was not constructed by anyone to be a star fleet officer data was

2133
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:58,560
constructed as an android with free will who independently just lived his life and decided

2134
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:04,080
yeah is he is he x is he just x basically he's basically x he just like is the maverick hunters

2135
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:08,240
and then uh were founded and then x decided to join them because he wanted to do that data just

2136
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:14,480
decided the best thing he could do with his life to fulfill his own personal goals was to go through

2137
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:20,720
the the academy the star fleet academy as every other student did he was just a student work hard

2138
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:26,240
and earn his commission as an officer and then he became a second officer on the flagship through

2139
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:31,600
his pure merit through no like being like built for the purpose he just decided to it has inherent

2140
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:36,000
gifts and that's and that's why when he talks to wharf in that scene and wharf says like hey

2141
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,920
fuck you man i'm not gonna work some fucking machine data says you don't understand wharf

2142
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:45,680
i earned this position i am the captain we have a machine there's an order exactly well i'm paraphrasing

2143
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:51,440
uh he asserts that he's the captain and that war like they need to abide by the roles of this like

2144
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:55,600
military order of star fleet in order to make sure that everything runs efficiently

2145
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,280
and if this is going to be a problem like i think he says like let me know like i'll have you step

2146
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:03,440
down and i'll put someone else you know in first officer positioner i think that was implied at

2147
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:10,000
least so i'm just saying uh so it's the best so it's the best well you know uh uh basically it's

2148
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:17,040
that scene in uh game of thrones when uh janice slent when uh uh john john snow gets elected lord

2149
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:23,040
commander of the night's watch and janice slents like fuck you and john is like i'm commander and if

2150
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:27,600
you know it's the death sentence to fucking defy the lord commander and janice is like yeah well

2151
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:32,160
fuck you anyway he's like well i'm gonna i'm gonna behead you then and then he does that it's basically

2152
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:36,800
like that only i think this is so it's pretty much i think they've outlawed the death penalty in

2153
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:41,120
star trek little known i will maybe people know this uh people who are criminals are treated as

2154
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:47,280
mental health cases and are like treated to like fix their broken brains and uh that's what they do

2155
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:51,760
my favorite thing about uh star trek yeah i really should watch it i didn't know that i did not know

2156
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,240
that about star flea it's true and i there's just so you know there's a couple cases of people who

2157
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:00,960
brains they can't fix and like those people are the ones they keep in jail but it's very very rare

2158
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:07,440
those kind of people but yeah sure my my favorite thing about star trek uh every time i see uh you

2159
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:11,840
know a clip of like the bridge and them just walking around you won't believe how much you love

2160
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:16,800
star trek when you watch it i'm just saying but anyway well it's it's the fucking carpet it's the

2161
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:22,960
fucking carpet and the lighting and it feels so it feels like a really nice comfy like friends house

2162
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:29,200
bridge enterprise is home i want to live there every day yeah it's got it's so it's so it's so

2163
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:36,240
nice to see like the ideal like the idea of like a spaceship but built to be furnished so that people

2164
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:42,000
are relaxed and calm and it's nice yeah oh and which will hold up more sense than than just like uh

2165
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:48,000
we're in space so you know dude really really cold blue lighting and stuff the thing about that is

2166
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,960
you know that very ship like when they make star trek movies they they redo the lighting to make

2167
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:57,440
everything look like professional and like movie-esque and fancy they just completely fuck up the

2168
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:02,960
lighting on the bridge to like be like weird spooky like mood lighting because it's a movie now

2169
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,600
we need to look cool we can't look like flat even comfy lighting like on the movie and everything

2170
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:13,280
about first of all it's not canon second of all it sucks and it's try hard bullshit so uh star trek

2171
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:19,520
is just so thoroughly patrician and star wars absolutely literal baby shit like i know you

2172
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:23,840
can like both it doesn't have to be comparing the two it's just a nerd thing to compare the two but

2173
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:30,240
god star wars is such baby shit it's just like why does when when sparta when the star star trek

2174
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:36,560
star trek being patrician doesn't like it doesn't exclude star wars from being baby shit you know

2175
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,640
it would be baby shit if star trek didn't exist that's true but you know when when sparta from

2176
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:45,600
devil may cry was young he fought with the demon king mundus he was his right hand man but then

2177
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:51,360
quote he woke up to justice when i was young i was a big fan of star wars you know i fought on the

2178
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:56,000
side of star wars then i woke up to star trek that's what happened to me and now i'm on the right

2179
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,800
side of history god when i when i put on any episode of star trek any series whether it's the

2180
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:05,440
original or next generation whether it's deep space nine you know i put on any episode of star trek

2181
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:10,160
and i just feel like i'm in a in a good place i feel like i'm in a company and i just wake up to

2182
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:16,880
justice i wake up to justice let's have a shirt in the store that says hey i woke up today that's a

2183
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:23,920
good idea this is a fucking star fleet logo on it oh yeah we can play into the waking up to

2184
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:28,560
justice you know what you gotta do next legally distinct star fleet logo legally distinct star

2185
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:35,040
fleet yeah oh my god we should have the bottom say joined legally distinct star fleet today wake

2186
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:41,360
up to justice um the next the next thing the next thing that sparta did is he he in that in that

2187
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:46,240
passage he woke up to justice and he stood against the legion alone that means you have to go fight

2188
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:54,160
all the fucking episode nine videos now and talk about how star trek spades with us

2189
01:43:54,160 --> 01:44:00,800
like being uh uh uh uh a dis Privileged Minority in this country it's been but one non-star wars

2190
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:05,760
fan standing against the whore at every fucking couple this it's basically the cultural equivalent

2191
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:10,800
of the the oppressed gamer it's the oppressed star trek fan it's like the new crusades like they're

2192
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:15,120
just going in slaughtering everyone who doesn't adhere to the church of star wars and corporate

2193
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:22,440
corporate America is an in-club everyone who is a billionaire loves Star Wars

2194
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:26,000
indeed and if you don't like Star Wars you can't be their friend and they

2195
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,280
won't let you make money why that's how it is that's that's that's nepotism damn

2196
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:34,760
right it is why is no one crony capitalism why does Star Wars never

2197
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:40,800
get called out for being fucking corny cuz like you mean like the originals of

2198
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:44,880
the new ones cuz like you know like Kingdom Hearts 3 came out

2199
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:49,080
and all anyone said was how corny Kingdom Hearts is cuz oh it's oh it's

2200
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:53,880
the light and then the darkness but then the light in your heart makes you good

2201
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:58,560
but I don't want to be dark in my heart that's exactly what Star Wars is it's

2202
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:06,280
this is a fantasy for autistic people who see everything binary black

2203
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:09,080
and white you ever notice when you get those comments on your videos from

2204
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,400
someone who you can tell is really autistic and they think that you're

2205
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:15,280
just a bad person cuz you use like the word retard or or something you use

2206
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:19,280
that yes like naughty language is it you're a bad person that's the kind of

2207
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:23,200
people who see the world in totally black and white everything that is is

2208
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,480
either bad or good light or dark that's what Star Wars is that's why it's so

2209
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,880
popular it's a fantasy for autistic fucking retards who see they have a

2210
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,920
question in terms of light side and dark side oh no I'm falling to the dark side

2211
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:40,880
the space wizard is gonna make me turn to darkness in my heart shut the fuck up

2212
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:44,840
oh my god we might have got stars over here which is all this like you know the

2213
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,000
high concept actual stuff that's like a moral dilemmas that people can actually

2214
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,080
like form like arguments for and think about philosophically and then you got

2215
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,080
Star Wars over in the corner

2216
01:45:54,080 --> 01:46:03,200
yeah don't don't do that one dark sabers it's just Kingdom Hearts it's

2217
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:06,560
exactly as stupid as Kingdom Hearts I've heard the comparisons to Kingdom Hearts

2218
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:12,320
yeah yeah for sure for sure it's I mean is there any more comparison that's just

2219
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:16,320
the low IQ version of the story versus the high IQ version than Star Wars and

2220
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:21,360
Star Trek I don't know I don't know I mean like Star Wars is the low IQ in

2221
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:27,480
Kingdom Hearts Kingdom Hearts well that's what are we gonna get the

2222

2227
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:01,240
Boston going gang meeting is pretty much like going to stand up comedy if you

2228
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:03,640
know what I'm saying real clown at the podium if you know what I mean

2232
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:24,560
whole bunch about this in that episode yeah was kicked into shape in that

2233
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:29,400
episode and and force and force to walk down the royal road and try and reach

2234
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:35,120
up to his idol Tim Buckley and become the most proficient among on earth yeah

2235
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:40,080
and yeah and the night but I told him on the episode that I would remind him

2236
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:44,800
every single night to go that Thursday and I did and the night before and I

2237
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:50,040
believe the night of as well I told him today is the day and and you went and

2238
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:58,600
you and you reply to me quote it was fine so yeah we talked extensively about

2239
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:02,760
the pros and cons of the comics roundtable and about how could you you

2240
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:06,360
know can make or break things and how is pivotal that you were to go that's not I

2241
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:14,880
don't exaggerate I think yeah that's I'm saying though to have our

2242
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:20,000
incredibly long conversation of it turn out to be you know it was fine you know

2243
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,400
I'm not just I want to hear well here's the thing well here's the thing really

2244
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:28,560
that's kind of why I didn't want to go cuz I was like I'm saying that I think I

2245
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:33,600
might just go in and might just be like no there's nothing really going on in

2246
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:36,320
the episode you describe how it might be fine and there and then you would feel

2247
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,800
like you have no more options left do you feel like you have no more options

2248
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:44,960
left now yeah yeah now I'm trapped okay now I'm trapped now I'm trapped in the

2249
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:49,440
cage of my own life options for what I don't get it what's the no escape well

2250
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,960
the idea was that like I hadn't like been going out very much well there's this

2251
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:58,480
thing that I could go to I used to go to it and it was fine anyway that it's it's

2252
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:02,560
just like a club thing it's been running since like 2006 before I moved in with

2253
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:05,880
Digi when I was living here before I went for a little while and like it was

2254
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:12,280
pretty good I met some people it was fun and then you know they left and I came

2255
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:16,040
back and I just I never got around to going back to it and now it's like it's

2256
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:20,280
like every week at like I just like maybe another time maybe another time well I

2257
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:24,840
went back this week and it was like I was kind of dead and I think maybe because

2258
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:28,120
there was like there was like a gallery there was like a gallery opening like in

2259
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:31,920
the building where it was happening not sure if that had anything to do with it

2260
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:39,360
you know here's the thing right I get there and and it's a bunch of freaks and

2261
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,880
I say that in like the most yeah loving way possible I say that in the least

2262
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:49,840
judgmental way possible everyone's a fucking weirdo probably me you know

2263
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:54,720
probably me too okay I'm really surprised that you would say that as a

2264
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:58,280
majority because if there's some I would imagine that you would love to see

2265
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:01,480
freaks and geeks well there's friends that are fun to hang out with and friends

2266
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:09,600
that are you know freaks I mean freaks I don't know there's like alright there

2267
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:13,960
were a couple I get there and there's a couple of there's a couple of non-binary

2268
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:19,080
people talking about just how non-binary they are right in like they're

2269
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:23,680
they're loving it and I don't think either of them even draw or write so I

2270
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:26,200
don't know what they're doing there but they seem to be the ones in charge

2271
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:31,080
okay like right off the bat that's pretty good good start then there's this

2272
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:36,760
guy he looks maybe a bit younger than me he comes in at some point it becomes

2273
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:41,320
clear that he's on the spectrum he uses he uses the word retarded to describe

2274
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:45,680
see I start going off on a rant about spirit science and the love battleship

2275
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:51,240
right of course I start I start talking about aligning my Kundalini and he's and

2276
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:55,240
he is like you know amused by this and says like you know oh that's you know

2277
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:59,960
that's retarded and one of these one of these non-binary people who seem to be

2278
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:05,720
in charge of everything says like well she softballs him right yeah they saw

2279
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:09,680
they softball him right and and they're like well you know I'm not gonna go full

2280
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:13,720
SJW on you but you know don't use that word it's offensive and he is like he

2281
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:16,920
tries to argue it and it's really uncomfortable so I leave for a while

2282
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:20,780
and they go to the gallery opening and I steal and I steal some of their free

2283
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:26,560
cheese platters that they have out okay they have so much cheese I eat so much

2284
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:31,160
free cheese at that gallery oh bent that was the best part about caramel apples

2285
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:35,720
do you remember the caramel I remember I remember I remember the caramel caramel

2286
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:42,720
flowed like water that night yeah a good thing was before I went keto but but

2287
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:48,800
um so there's a you know there's a couple of like older guys and girls who are

2288
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,400
like you know like 50s 40s and 50s there maybe they seem to be a little more

2289
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:57,320
serious about it you know they're fine they're fine there's like one other

2290
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:02,400
like non-binary person question mark who seems like kind of less grating and

2291
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:06,440
obnoxious than the other two she seemed fine but they seem fine but they didn't

2292
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:11,880
say much they they were like new and then this guy who's next to me though he's it

2293
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:15,320
comes out that he's on the spectrum at some point he says that and then he tells

2294
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:19,160
me literally tells me about how his thing that he's been working on for years

2295
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:25,080
is that he's just rewriting Naruto he's just rewriting Naruto and do I want to

2296
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:29,960
read his manuscript and I say I'm sorry but I gotta go I really you know it's

2297
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:35,760
time I think it's about time I should be hitting the old dusty you know I hate to

2298
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:40,760
say it but in the real life a lot of people just suck and are very unimpressive

2299
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,040
out the world sure it's unfortunate you know that's true listen listen listen

2300
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:48,480
like when I used to go there were these people right there were these same

2301
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:54,000
people like these guys who was just rewriting Naruto like this is not this

2302
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,840
ain't my first rodeo yeah alright like it that doesn't bother me it did bother

2303
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:04,120
me I don't know like before it seemed like they were more like mid-range age

2304
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:09,720
people like 20s early 30s now it was like there was like this one one or two

2305
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:13,960
like college kids and then like a bunch of like 40 somethings and I'm like I'm

2306
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:17,600
gonna maybe I won't give up just yet maybe this is just a slow day or something

2307
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:20,360
yeah yeah like it's possible because they were a cut I remember there were a

2308
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:23,000
couple people that used to go that were pretty cool and I was kind of

2309
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,440
disappointed that they weren't there anymore but whatever I'll stick it out

2310
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:32,480
um so you're going you're going again yeah yeah I'll be going back okay I'm

2311
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:36,960
looking forward there we wait there was shit there was one other thing that I

2312
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:43,080
wanted to touch oh okay interesting thing it's it seems to me for my like

2313
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:49,040
appraisal that the only person there who is accomplished at all right the only

2314
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:53,200
person there who has like any sort of a presence or any sort of like a like a

2315
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:58,400
thing going yeah is this person is this person I I don't know if I should say

2316
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:05,280
their name I guess you're on the side of caution I suppose if you know you're

2317
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:09,920
praising them aren't you I suppose well kind of well I don't know I just it's

2318
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:14,720
just weird I don't know you dogged all right whatever their name is LB right

2319
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:21,520
they go by LB they are non-bind right now this this is a different LB the LB

2320
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:26,400
stands for Looney Brain and okay this person like wrote a book right it's like

2321
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,360
a prose book but it has like illustrations in it right so it's like an

2322
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:32,920
illustrated word like whatever so they made this book I don't know if they

2323
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:36,520
kickstarted it or whatever but like they published it I looked it up there on

2324
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:40,360
they're not they're not on Twitter but they're on itch.io is where their work

2325
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:44,440
is or something yeah that's that's strange that's strange but whatever

2326
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:48,600
that's fine but they were talking about an article that someone had written

2327
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:52,720
about this person and in the meeting they were say yeah they did this great

2328
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:56,440
article right up on you it was like yeah about like the best comic artist you've

2329
01:54:56,440 --> 01:55:01,880
never heard of right that's what they said sure and and I'm like okay so I go

2330
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:05,000
online and I look up the name of the magazine that wrote this article up and

2331
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,440
I look up the name of this person and I find the article but the full article is

2332
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:16,600
titled the best comic artist you've never heard of is eight people and I read it

2333
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:21,600
and it turns out that this person shtick or their deal or their thing is that

2334
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:26,880
they have headmates or dissociative identity disorder okay I think the

2335
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:33,000
article mentions dissociative identity disorder and they I think their work is

2336
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,240
about living with headmates and that's okay so headmates is like the fake

2337
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:43,960
version of actual dissociative identity disorder I don't know I don't know okay

2338
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:48,600
I don't know what's fake and what's real anymore I'm happy to believe someone

2339
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:52,040
has this but but this person this person's like got a patreon and stuff

2340
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:55,320
okay and and like they're caught they're comparable to me they're making like

2341
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:58,600
comparable amounts to me they're my only competition so I gotta kill them I gotta

2342
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:03,280
you gotta you gotta use eight bullets to take this guy out cuz I gotta be the

2343
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:07,120
biggest fish in this tiny pond or else of or else what do I have to live I know

2344
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:12,800
the feeling well mm-hmm well that's interesting so so that's so that was my

2345
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:17,960
that's my fucking Boston Comics roundtable story if you live hey if you

2346
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:23,120
live in the Boston area the listener stay the hell away from me don't don't

2347
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:27,320
fucking show up at these things in the show to be able to read a page of this

2348
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:32,480
LB person and I want to say before I post it it looks like it's also ugly

2349
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:39,160
art no it does no it looks like it looks like Erica moans art is what it

2350
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:43,320
looks like it reminds me of you don't even know you don't even know who that

2351
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:50,960
is I don't is that is that an actor on the room um yeah you got me ways is this

2352
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:55,960
engrossed is this in the audio yeah yeah I don't mean to be money I fucking hate

2353
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:01,960
you this does not look like my art at all I'm legitimately insulted I'm

2354
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:05,960
legitimately insulted listen hold on I'm gonna get some it's okay this is not

2355
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:09,240
a gem of your current or even to say that this is like only did you say it's

2356
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:15,160
did you say it's also ugly yes well it's better than that it is better okay

2357
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:23,640
no I'm not okay okay yeah you know what you did you did and I misheard

2358
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:30,840
however no Erica moan is the Ojoi sex toy girl and this looks exact this looks

2359
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:35,120
exactly like that yeah you're kind of right but not even that much worse it's

2360
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:38,800
just very very simple you know there's like you know how like DC and Marvel

2361
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,040
have like their house style there's like a house indie style which is this yeah

2362
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:47,200
like there's a ton of artists who do this kind of like work it's very weird

2363
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:51,440
yeah how that kind of just happens well maybe Erica moans not the only I just

2364
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:54,680
have a quick question about am I supposed to I'm just wondering like am I to

2365
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:58,400
believe from reading of like this comic that this is the the actual author of

2366
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:02,320
this is does indeed have a split personality and eight people live inside

2367
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:06,280
of them and this is a picture at least some of them is this the idea of like

2368
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:10,280
that the comic I'm reading the comic not necessarily just for the quality of it

2369
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:14,040
but because it's being written by a person with a split personality or the

2370
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:18,200
dissociative identity Nate you know your guess is as good as mine on that okay

2371
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:23,520
okay just wondering you know Ben much much like much like much like Sparta

2372
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:30,320
himself you must stand against this Legion alone look good luck man you know

2373
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:37,960
you know I don't know I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to be all like look at this

2374
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:41,680
fucking look at this look at this shit look at like everyone's all like it's

2375
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:45,680
all pandering it's all pandering to like queer identities and like it's all

2376
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:49,680
identity politics it's all like a mental illness it's all like pandering to

2377
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:55,560
like some weird thing I don't care right like if people like the stuff then

2378
01:58:55,560 --> 01:59:00,160
it's fine right nothing no there's no such thing as art that's not valid sure

2379
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:07,720
right it's it's all it's all cool it's all good but it's very it's just very

2380
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:14,800
perhaps it's it's kind of like Tom was saying like it's just it's just I wonder

2381
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:20,000
if comics are even for like can I can I dang sis white guy can I can I under a

2382
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,840
kind of white guy wake up in here in a downtrodden sis white guy even make it

2383
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:28,200
in this comics world or is it just for is it just for people well you know Ben

2384
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:31,720
I honestly like I look I look at it more and more and more it seems like this is

2385
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:35,360
this is how you make it as comics it's like is when you're too fucking

2386
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:40,120
disenfranchised and too much of a fucking weirdo no no offense for like

2387
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:46,440
traditional or traditional or traditional publishing then like this is

2388
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:50,040
what you get and this is where you find your audience you know they know where

2389
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:53,040
you'll be they know where you'll be flushed out of the mainstream system and

2390
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:57,520
where you'll fucking come out the drain here to making sequential art like a

2391
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:01,480
fucking like a fucking peasants it's definitely become like a selling

2392
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:07,280
that's all you deserve trans and I have people living in my brain you know to

2393
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:12,080
like preface your art with that it gives you a kind of a built-in audience

2394
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:19,080
it's stacking the deck with like social conditions yeah it's like yeah I mean

2395
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:25,520
you know when you're a when you're a when you feel like you're a fucking freak

2396
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:29,960
that no one understands yeah and then you see someone writing and they're

2397
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:36,200
writing it's like hey me too you know I get it that makes sense yeah but I feel

2398
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:41,760
like like Ben to correct me if I'm wrong but don't you feel like socially

2399
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:46,880
different from the normal people like you're an outcast is there's no label

2400
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:52,680
for what Ben is because he's just there's no label that's so yeah I was like

2401
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:59,680
but the there's no there's no there's no adjective there's no there's no there's

2402
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:05,520
no well-defined like category or group or like or like mass noun for the way

2403
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:10,760
that I feel that I am I'm just gonna put on the Star Wars fan in my Patriot

2404
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:15,720
you know what actually that's it that's it you saw you solve the riddle you see

2405
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:21,040
that on someone's resume hire this genius immediately we need him on staff we

2406
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:25,520
need this diversity of thought everyone else here's a damn Star Wars fan this is

2407
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:31,440
a truly oppressed minority one one day I'll find one day I'll find some sort of

2408
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:35,160
label to apply to myself that other people have already claimed so I can be

2409
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:39,080
a part of a group identity follow this logic and have a built-in audience

2410
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:44,320
follow this logic with me real quick I do believe that just for example like

2411
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:49,120
every sexuality is on a spectrum and so one could relatively accurately assess

2412
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:53,880
that there's no such thing probably as like purely straight or purely gay or

2413
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:57,800
like anything like it's probably all in the spectrum including me so is it such

2414
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:02,960
a stretch for me to like on my college application or job thing or whatever it

2415
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:07,360
says like choose sexuality for me to just check bisexual or pansexual like

2416
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:11,080
I'll take that I'll take that wider categorization is that such a crazy

2417
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:15,640
thing to do can I get the ladies and gentlemen I don't think I don't think

2418
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:20,360
you can argue against yeah do you really get cred for being right now I think

2419
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:24,440
there's really hate the bias your softball and with that one there's no

2420
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:28,960
downside to just telling people that you're bi yeah there is yeah well the

2421
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:32,960
only thing that I know is that I know people who are gay don't like bi people

2422
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:37,200
because they can pass as normative and so you're actually you actually kind of

2423
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:41,960
go lower if you're bi cuz like even the minorities don't like you because you

2424
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:47,760
can pass as a majority so you kind of get fucked from both ends you might come

2425
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:52,200
off as a little you might come off as a little exotic to some extra straight some

2426
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:56,000
extra extra square straight that's true I mean that's how many people like are

2427
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:59,920
but about the fetishization of you know your girlfriend being a little bit

2428
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:04,560
girls as well you know whatever yeah that's a thing you can you can you can

2429
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:08,080
you can benefit you can there's there's some cred there's some cred to be at

2430
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:12,280
least for some social capital to be a crude a little bit and why and I mean

2431
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:16,400
just I'm just saying why not a crew as much as possible every little bit you

2432
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:20,280
can get why not zoom it up like a classic yeah tactic you know I'm just

2433
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:29,280
saying well I don't know if you get not not I say anyway so so the point is

2434
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:34,760
that I go you know it's not even that I felt alienated or anything I didn't

2435
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:41,160
feel weird like being surrounded by by you know by these by the drinks of

2436
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:46,920
society I mean they weren't all that there were a lot of them but they weren't

2437
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:51,200
all that or anything and you know I didn't feel like I didn't I did not

2438
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:55,920
feel like I don't belong here I'm a cis white guy like it wasn't like that no

2439
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:00,960
one was like making me you know cuz like I mean frankly that comment about don't

2440
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:06,120
say retarded that's what makes me feel uncomfortable in a you know you know I'm

2441
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:11,400
get why people don't like when you use that word I get it I get it that's don't

2442
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:15,280
like it so like and you know she wasn't even that aggressive about it and like

2443
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:20,240
the guy the guy should have just said sorry and not argued it you know I think

2444
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:24,160
because he said he was I mean I think the reason he didn't do that cuz cuz he's

2445
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:27,840
was on the spectrum and that's why you don't you don't always know how to

2446
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:32,040
deal with a social situation that's takes a little bit of finesse and you don't

2447
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:35,840
have that finesse you know who get a real pass on these issues just for

2448
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:40,800
interest people with Tourette's people with Tourette's got a complete blank slate

2449
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:45,640
pass they get the password pass they get the you know the f-ball pass they get it

2450
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:49,920
all hey funny thing I was just like looking at twitch the other are you

2451
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:53,920
talking about sweet Anita the girl with with with crazy Tourette's who will say

2452
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:58,920
fuck my cunt muffin you know all kinds of things just I don't remember her name

2453
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:03,600
but yeah she would she would say stuff like that probably sweet yeah but but

2454
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:07,280
she would just I mean that wasn't really that weird cuz she would just say that

2455
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:11,840
stuff like when she lost she was playing um you know Bennett Foddy getting

2456
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:15,080
over yeah yeah and you know just like when she lost progress she would just say

2457
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:18,960
these really weird swears and like you know that's not weird to swear when

2458
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:22,800
you're losing at a game but the thing is she would make like she would like

2459
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:26,360
click her tongue she would like she would like click her tongue and then she

2460
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:30,680
would do like sort of a bird whistle like like I can't whistle but you know

2461
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:33,640
you know what I mean like that she would she would do a little like bird like

2462
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:36,680
tweet tweet like sort of whistle yeah thanks yep that's her she would just sort

2463
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:42,880
of do yeah yeah and I was I was like that's that's funny I'm laughing you

2464
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:47,680
know I'm laughing all the way to the bank you know it's it's well I mean she she

2465
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:51,920
was like making a thing out of it right like it's like I guess it's kind of nice

2466
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:57,160
in a way that you have like a disability but you like turned it into like a cute

2467
02:05:57,160 --> 02:06:01,600
gimmick that well her story popular on twitch you know it's really bad of me

2468
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:06,520
but I don't know when I when I watch people with Tourette's I think that's

2469
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:11,840
fucking annoying like well sure from me Tourette's person you're annoying you know

2470
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:15,640
it might be cute to like watch a YouTube clip that's haha so funny imagine I'm

2471
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:18,840
nothing against her anybody with it but like imagine living with that it's gonna

2472
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:23,000
get annoying and I know it's bad cuz they can't help it obviously yeah I would

2473
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:27,120
not want to be around that person for five minutes and that probably is why

2474
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:31,240
they I mean for her she like couldn't get a job cuz like her Tourette's is like I

2475
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:34,000
mean I don't know how advances but like she'll like slap people's asses when

2476
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,960
they bend over and apparently she can't wait wait what I mean that's what she

2477
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:42,320
said she'll like hump people's ass she will hump them if they like that sounds

2478
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:47,560
like she's just using her disability to her advantage I mean I don't know I

2479
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:54,360
assume I don't okay well maybe that sounds like she was okay if I have to

2480
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:57,760
live with this like I can't stop swearing thing then I'm at least it's an

2481
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:03,800
oh oh I also can't help touching asses and humping people that's part of it too

2482
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:08,240
guys well like if this was like a man and like an ugly man I mean she's a cute

2483
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:12,720
girl basically so I feel like it feels far less if this were a man if this were

2484
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:16,520
a man he'd probably be locked up let's just be I mean maybe certainly likely but

2485
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:20,160
I mean I mean he would be he would probably be like I don't know they true

2486
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:23,880
people treated I'm just saying like what if she I actually have not heard her

2487
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:26,800
make any like like racial epithets or anything like that but like what if it

2488
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:30,560
was just to say like the end word or something with like Tourette's if a man

2489
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:34,480
just streamed with all he would get is like you're an autistic piece of shit you

2490
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:39,960
suck you're retarded go die probably I mean maybe we was really put together I

2491
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:43,200
mean she's a cute girl you know she's got her she's you know that does looks

2492
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:47,640
nice yeah skin yeah no looks normal and then just she has like a thing white

2493
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:53,920
white as can be oh thank God you know so that's I mean imagine no like for real

2494
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:57,240
like I'd probably be a lot harder it'd be it'd be a lot harder on her if she

2495
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:01,800
wasn't white I mean I suppose I suppose I imagine so but I mean in the capacity

2496
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:05,280
of like judging how like what like dangerous she is like why would that

2497
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:08,720
matter on Twitch because that's what she's doing maybe if you're in general in

2498
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:13,200
like her life you just you just get more shit you just get more shit and people

2499
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:17,400
are like people like use it as an excuse to like fuck with you I mean that I'm

2500
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:20,760
sure that's if they want to yeah that's probably that's probably fair to say

2501
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:24,840
okay but the point is well I don't know what the point is fine her story oh you

2502
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:27,520
know what I heard one thing that she said though that was like the reason she

2503
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:31,120
she twitches streams is because like it's hard for someone with Tourette's to get a

2504
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:34,800
job and like when she was younger because like she has all these impulses she

2505
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:37,880
can't control she would have to do jobs that like allow her to be alone so she

2506
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:42,040
would like walk down by the beach and like gather sea glass and then would go

2507
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:45,120
to like the road or something and would sell seashells by the sea show that's

2508
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:49,080
exactly correct that's exactly correct and I was just thinking to myself like

2509
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:53,080
wow what a what an entrepreneurial spirit what I just found a place where

2510
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:58,080
her disability was celebrated instead of shot oh yeah yeah I mean it's like if

2511
02:08:58,080 --> 02:09:01,920
you're a woman if you're a woman with a beard you don't get to go work at like

2512
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:06,440
a regular people place you got to go to the circus where they want a bearded

2513
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:12,200
lady they need yeah yeah sometimes you gotta go where everybody

2514
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:18,680
streaming the circus also known as twitch yeah that's the circus of the

2515
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:22,280
modern age that's that's I wonder if there are like bearded lady twitch

2516
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:26,880
streamers oh but there are bearded ladies that stream on twitch probably you

2517
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:30,320
know what I mean I mean I suppose with the rise of the the trans you know

2518
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:33,600
awareness there's probably quite a few I'm not talking about a trans thing you

2519
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:38,920
know you had they had bearded ladies in them in the in the circus no I'm with

2520
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:42,000
you I'm with you I'm just saying how they probably migrated to twitch probably

2521
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,160
more common than ever considering that's where people go to get their

2522
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:48,920
entertainment now you ain't wrong you ain't wrong I feel like I feel like we

2523
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:55,320
just accidentally created a dug standout bit wait a minute wait a minute now now

2524
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:59,080
I'm wondering though yeah try it like trans culture like gender culture being

2525
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:02,480
what it is I wonder if I wonder if bearded ladies are just have like a whole

2526
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:06,960
different like outlook now I wonder if that's I wonder if I wonder if they

2527
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:12,160
would probably just maybe just go ahead and identify as a man certainly pop I

2528
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:16,720
mean who like do we know the specific like gender characteristics of the

2529
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:20,760
bearded ladies I'll bet some do I'll bet some do but I bet not all of them do in

2530
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:23,800
fact guarantee it guarantee not all of them do some people are probably just

2531
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:27,120
like I'm yep I'm a woman and I got a beard and it happens and don't even

2532
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:30,120
worry about it and follow me on twitch.tv

2533
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:38,000
Ben saying all right well whatever enough of this bullshit we can go on

2534
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,040
forever why don't we get to the voicemails already

2535
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:52,740
unless somebody else got on top of it I wanted to bring up there's one time I wanted to bring up that I want to ask Tom because me and Ben on the endless war anniversary stream we played a

2536
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:58,140
zoomie game oh yeah you know about that yeah yeah yeah we played we played a

2537
02:10:58,140 --> 02:11:03,100
zoomie so it was really cool been sucked at it been it wasn't hey Tom no I don't

2538
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:08,380
suck your fucking controls are fucking sloppy it's fucking floaty it feels

2539
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:13,140
like I'm walking on ice all the time and had to get back to fix it to play the

2540
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:19,460
game okay slippery controls that's all I have to say where is a zoomie game going

2541
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:23,660
from here what's the future of it look like it like I know you talked to me I

2542
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:28,100
don't know if you said it on anywhere probably not in games but you said you

2543
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:32,060
you've thought about making like a 3d game do you have any plans for that now

2544
02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:35,540
this is like a proof-of-concept way do you want to you want to work in the same

2545
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:39,220
like you just like build levels on the same like engine all with all the assets

2546
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:43,580
you've made just can have a sequel or what are you what are you thinking um yeah

2547
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:48,020
I mean it really it really depends on like the reception of the game cuz like

2548
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:51,500
it's only been out for a couple days I think like maybe a little less than a

2549
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:55,420
week at this point and I'm still doing like a little bit of updates and shit

2550
02:11:55,420 --> 02:12:02,220
that like I increased the I increased the reach of the sword due to feedback

2551
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:04,620
from the voicemail in the last episode and things like that so I did a little

2552
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:09,300
bit of tweaking here and there but I mean if it gets like big and people are

2553
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:11,900
really into it I'll probably start building it out and adding more levels

2554
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:16,100
but like the end goal has always been to make a 3d character action game with

2555
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:20,420
Izumi and like get the knowledge to do all that which is like insanely

2556
02:12:20,420 --> 02:12:24,020
complicated and over-the-top and will take years and years and years to develop

2557
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:28,220
if the people I'm looking at who are doing things like that is any

2558
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:34,620
indication to go by so I got to learn more about 3d like modeling to make

2559
02:12:34,620 --> 02:12:37,420
like better models that'll animate and deform better and then you got to learn

2560
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:41,300
like animation and rigging and how to get the skeletons and stuff and then you

2561
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:46,220
got to learn like all the coding that's and then it's just a huge fucking

2562
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:50,780
process to do like a full 3d game like the engine I did Izumi in was not real

2563
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:54,140
programming so you can do it really quickly that's why I was able to do it

2564
02:12:54,140 --> 02:12:58,260
like you know two or three months to get it like builds like the groundwork of

2565
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:03,820
it so like at this point like I could go on to build a full game with it because

2566
02:13:03,820 --> 02:13:07,420
the majority of like the foundations there like it just matter building more

2567
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:13,060
enemies and building more levels so I could probably do a game in a full game

2568
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:17,700
with that style not super quickly but it would most of it would just be like

2569
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:21,300
conceptual work of just like how do I want the levels to be as opposed like

2570
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:26,700
having to learn more things to make it happen yeah so yeah I don't really know

2571
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:31,820
so obviously okay so the end goal is a 3d game but obviously there's a there needs

2572
02:13:31,820 --> 02:13:36,780
to be a big leap in your ability wait wait wait the end goal is a 3d game not

2573
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:40,900
a 2d platformer yeah I mean like like obviously this project was just like a

2574
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:46,140
learning a learning experience but like I have like a whole big design document

2575
02:13:46,140 --> 02:13:49,420
for the final 3d game and I know the entire story and all the characters and

2576
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:54,980
all that shit so the question is and I doubt it's the case but is this the last

2577
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:59,060
we'll see Izumi before you just go away into a cave and like read a bunch of 3d

2578
02:13:59,060 --> 02:14:03,700
modeling textbooks and how to pull it pull a diva pull it I don't think I can

2579
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:22,460
pull a diva just because I would go I would go full diva if I had money but

2580
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:27,620
I don't so like to go to do would mean work a full-time 40-hour job and then

2581
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:31,540
just not talk to anybody and do game stuff on the side I make no money it's a

2582
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:38,420
solid plan to do such a thing so I don't know I just feel like like

2583
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:43,700
DeVu made this fucking amazingly sick game and it's great and everyone should

2584
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:48,940
play Automatus if they haven't already um yeah but agreed the problem with the

2585
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:53,860
the going full DeVu is that like you have no base to be your evangelist to kind

2586
02:14:53,860 --> 02:14:57,220
of get it out there do you have a gay working for Digi of course that he does

2587
02:14:57,580 --> 02:15:03,660
the whole time right but what I mean is that like DeVu because DeVu doesn't

2588
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:08,020
have a sweetheart deal and it is a good deal but like because DeVu has no

2589
02:15:08,020 --> 02:15:12,460
online presence really anymore like by his own design like when Automatus

2590
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:17,900
dropped it was basically up to us to let people know it existed that and and like

2591
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:22,740
I would want any like project that I do to have some semblance of success so like

2592
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:27,100
it's not a matter of just building a big 3d game it's also like building a

2593
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:30,580
brand around that game so like when it happens people give a fuck and that

2594
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:34,580
requires constantly sucking the social cock and like making sure people don't

2595
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:40,100
forget about you so like you can't just do one thing really unless you're

2596
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:44,020
super god-tier talented which I don't think I'm at that skill level you know

2597
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:49,100
what Tom I think I'm gonna argue with you on this because I think that's

2598
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:55,660
something that a trap that I fall into is spending too much time on you know

2599
02:15:55,660 --> 02:16:00,100
sort of like ancillary side things you know just trying to like you know keep

2600
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:04,100
keep keep up to date with people keep in the public eye you know be be streaming

2601
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:07,660
on Twitch be like you know tweeting on Twitter liking people's liking people's

2602
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:14,420
tweets you know being on this fucking show or whatever you know and like I

2603
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:20,500
don't I don't know I'm like I've done a lot of it and I wonder like how much does

2604
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:25,540
it like past a certain point how much does it really well do you think

2605
02:16:25,540 --> 02:16:28,940
like I don't think I don't think that being on the show anymore is getting my

2606
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:33,100
name anymore out there than like it already is you know I mean it's both

2607
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:36,620
theoretically if you dropped off perhaps that number would recede somewhat I mean

2608
02:16:36,620 --> 02:16:40,580
I just wonder like if I think I don't think if you just worked on the vapors

2609
02:16:40,580 --> 02:16:44,580
and that like and didn't talk to us and didn't do any of that shit and just

2610
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:47,940
worked on the comic I don't think if you did a Kickstarter probably would have

2611
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:51,740
succeeded as quickly as it did or if at all well you know your audience would

2612
02:16:51,740 --> 02:16:54,940
have been much smaller I mean what I would do I think there's a third path

2613
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:58,340
here I like theoretically of you know ghosting and then just releasing it or

2614
02:16:58,340 --> 02:17:01,580
you know constantly maybe hyping it up or just keeping people like I'm a big

2615
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:07,180
believer in like basically like release parties like a pomp and circumstance I

2616
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:11,500
mean this is kind of what like like we Agua one sorry I mean sorry like like when

2617
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:16,900
I did me a math I mean like that like I prepared media to come to make it an

2618
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:20,900
event and I think people you know like I prepared a theme song ahead of time and

2619
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:23,900
I prepared like you know art for obviously you've done that already but

2620
02:17:23,900 --> 02:17:26,820
like something and I am aware that's totally different from like a comic

2621
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:29,860
release like a game release a totally different thing but I like I would do

2622
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:34,380
something along those lines maybe like construct a website for it and to like

2623
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:37,980
not even when the game releases but like to let people know the game will release

2624
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:42,620
on this day like maybe it's already ready maybe it's and I this is why you

2625
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:47,300
know they announced you know Final Fantasy 15 like eight ten billion years

2626
02:17:47,300 --> 02:17:50,660
before it actually comes out or whatever and then you know they keep you

2627
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:54,140
interested with trailers a good strategy for working on a big project's gonna take

2628
02:17:54,140 --> 02:17:57,260
years and years because I watched I followed tons of indie game devs and

2629
02:17:57,260 --> 02:18:00,740
obviously we don't have the resources for all that jazz it's just documenting

2630
02:18:00,740 --> 02:18:04,740
your progress you know and like yeah like that becomes your content like if

2631
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:08,700
you just let everybody know what you're working on daily you know there's like

2632
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:12,140
there's an artist minions art she's working on a game called Astro cat I've

2633
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:15,260
been following her for like two years and like I don't even know how much

2634
02:18:15,300 --> 02:18:18,900
progress if any has been made I just know that it's being worked on okay they

2635
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:22,500
do they do that in tutorials and make thousands of dollars on patreon or how

2636
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:28,780
about how about our beloved our beloved yandere dev right oh I don't like seems

2637
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:32,420
to have fallen into a bit of a trap of yeah yeah actual game design development

2638
02:18:32,420 --> 02:18:35,980
someone someone who decided to not learn about proper programming is well you

2639
02:18:35,980 --> 02:18:40,500
know he is among other things I'll take his word for it wait who's yandere he's

2640
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:46,540
yandere simulator yandere simulator it's like a question I don't know it's a

2641
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:50,180
game that people liked and streamed on twitch and on YouTube it actually got

2642
02:18:50,180 --> 02:18:54,660
banned from twitch because it's too too edgy too saucy that's correct really

2643
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:59,100
there's like there I guess maybe I don't think he appealed but they said no they

2644
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:03,140
don't want it on twitch so I mean he's been through some issues but I'm gonna

2645
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:06,780
get on D live not you know not even to shit on the model but like it does seem

2646
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:09,380
like a potential trap like I don't know when you're a pull up when you're a

2647
02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:13,180
politician the trap is to like be corrupt or whatever when you are a game

2648
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:17,060
developer using crowdfunding to support ongoing development of your game

2649
02:19:17,060 --> 02:19:21,180
there's probably gonna be some pressures to like you know why why rush it you know

2650
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:24,660
this is going pretty well I'll just sit here and you know maybe goof off a little

2651
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:28,220
bit not work as hard but to the contrary that point there also is gonna be

2652
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:32,220
unbelievable pressure on you all the time to get it done and that's also I'm

2653
02:19:32,220 --> 02:19:36,700
just saying that for me that far outweighs yeah yeah yeah oh I got

2654
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:40,580
because like for me my brain works like if I'm not releasing something I am a

2655
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:44,860
failure once you said that there will be a game my only question for the

2656
02:19:44,860 --> 02:19:48,340
developer from that moment on is when do I get to play it I don't care about

2657
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:52,540
anything else I want to play this game that's been prophesied and promised to

2658
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:56,860
me so yeah it's gonna be a tricky spot same like a movie I guess or anime when

2659
02:19:56,860 --> 02:20:00,820
can I watch it it's tough cuz like you're doing like I if I could I would

2660
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:04,820
love cuz like there's a couple options I could go full divu and just make a big

2661
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:08,900
3d game and just like drop off the face of the earth and just do nothing but

2662
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:13,580
CG cookie tutorials for the next like year and a half yeah get become God and

2663
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:17,140
just start building this huge game cuz that's like what m.strange it is right

2664
02:20:17,140 --> 02:20:20,740
and he's like my big like inspiration artist guy he's been working on this

2665
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:24,220
big platformer game for years and like every like seven or eight months he'll

2666
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:27,900
resurface and be like here's a vlog k bye and and that's it and like I don't

2667
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:31,260
know what he does I don't know how he makes money time job he must I don't know

2668
02:20:31,260 --> 02:20:34,740
he doesn't he's never talked about finances even when I press him because

2669
02:20:34,740 --> 02:20:37,940
I've talked to him you know one-on-one for it and he refuses to answer that

2670
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:41,100
question about how he makes money crowdfund development of his games no

2671
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:46,020
he's never crowdfunded ever so he must so he must in some he there there has to

2672
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:49,940
be something right but he just refuses to like you know let anybody know how

2673
02:20:49,940 --> 02:20:54,420
it's done probably to like keep his air of mystique up because he just seems like

2674
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:58,020
this guy who like fishes doll heads out of gutters and makes movies about them

2675
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:02,300
because that's what literally happened with his first movie but um like that's

2676
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:05,940
one option another option would be to keep making smaller projects build up

2677
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:09,580
the brand and get it to a point where like if I asked for like hey I want a

2678
02:21:09,580 --> 02:21:13,540
programmer and a you know a soundtrack designer and like work on a team with a

2679
02:21:13,540 --> 02:21:16,860
bunch of people to make a big game and I have the cloud to actually attract people

2680
02:21:16,860 --> 02:21:21,180
to do that then I could offload a lot of that work right and focus on like the

2681
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:24,660
creative part that I'd like actually enjoy the most which is like that's a

2682
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:29,100
long game so right but it's I mean it's all a long game like to make a full

2683
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:33,700
3d action game even if it's just like at ps2 level like a ps2 game still costs

2684
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:37,820
millions of dollars back in the day you know full development teams make so

2685
02:21:37,820 --> 02:21:41,580
yeah and now you're doing it by yourself so you're like it's probably like a five

2686
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:46,180
plus to your project easy and that's after I've learned everything so like it's

2687
02:21:46,180 --> 02:21:49,700
just like such a moonshot project I don't even I don't even have enough skills

2688
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:54,100
to know to quantify it yeah I know what I'm a boy with a dream you know that's

2689
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:58,300
that's it I know what I would do and it's because what I did do it's like I'd

2690
02:21:58,300 --> 02:22:03,940
work a full-time job or whatever and just like do it on the side I that's just

2691
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:08,100
me that's just me I would prioritize like my financial stability with the goal

2692
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:12,940
of eventually being at once like I've I've checked my boxes oh Nate you and

2693
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:17,500
your ridiculous dreams about financial stability you and your crazy

2694
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:21,740
seems like more of a moonshot than making a video game to me at this point yeah

2695
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:28,340
I can't even I'm just saying it seems like our generation has just said like you

2696
02:22:28,340 --> 02:22:34,060
know fuck life I'm just gonna make art and if I die or I don't know like you

2697
02:22:34,060 --> 02:22:38,620
guys are literally what I said I think I've literally in the mirror like

2698
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:43,180
looking at like looking at myself like like like like peel like peeling down my

2699
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:47,620
eyelids to look at like and like my red eyes and stuff yeah and like shaking

2700
02:22:47,620 --> 02:22:51,580
dandruff out of my hair I've been like fuck life I'm just gonna make art and

2701
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:58,020
if I die from some like sociologist guy and I don't remember the specifics I'm

2702
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:02,860
probably gonna mangle this but he had this theory that like the the last four

2703
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:07,540
generations have perfectly mirror the four generations before them and how it

2704
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:12,100
sort of goes in cycles how like you have a generation who's all like who's all

2705
02:23:12,140 --> 02:23:15,460
entrepreneurial and then a generation that's all political and then a generation

2706
02:23:15,460 --> 02:23:18,820
that sort of detaches and becomes artists and then a generation after that

2707
02:23:18,820 --> 02:23:24,140
that sort of does whatever the fuck and how it mirrors so and like the I think

2708
02:23:24,140 --> 02:23:29,660
like the millennials were like compared to like sort of like I don't fuck it

2709
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:33,940
remember like the lost generation from like the 30s like before yeah okay and

2710
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:40,220
and the zoomers the new silent generation that's fucking fake news I

2711
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:46,740
mean I think the greatest generation it was an interesting thing so whatever I

2712
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:52,380
mean I mean I mean I would read I would read that article I would read that

2713
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:57,260
article because that doesn't surprise me that like it seems like a that you

2714
02:23:57,260 --> 02:24:01,180
know yeah cuz like each generation is a response to the last yeah yeah in a way

2715
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:07,660
so yeah I mean because everybody everybody says that like to go on the

2716
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:11,500
the social media thing I had a thing I wanted to say that oh it's right here I

2717
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:16,300
found it sorry okay link it like in the in the link link link that show while I

2718
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:22,060
speak Strauss how a generational theory and I'll link it word cool the social

2719
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:28,380
media general like a presence thing and and like either social media or like

2720
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:31,660
working full-time on the thing going a full devout which I like this phrase I

2721
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:49,900
don't know how he will feel about death of the victim I feel like so much like

2722
02:24:49,900 --> 02:24:58,500
having a social media presence is it's like the more you put into it with the

2723
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:03,380
less you have to show while you're into it the less effective it will be like if

2724
02:25:03,380 --> 02:25:08,220
you have one game and you build your social media presence it making a brand

2725
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:13,340
will be so much easier than if you have a game in development or no game and you

2726
02:25:13,340 --> 02:25:16,860
try to build a social media presence because people will want to follow you

2727
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:20,260
but you'll need to have something and so you'll have to create something for them

2728
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:26,420
to gather around even if that is just like you as a like a personality or a

2729
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:31,100
vlog or whatever so but then they will become accustomed to knowing that thing

2730
02:25:31,100 --> 02:25:34,700
rather than what you actually want them to like in the future which is your

2731
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:38,540
products your games your art your webcomics and stuff so the more stuff

2732
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:41,780
you already have doesn't matter whether it's like the best thing you'll ever

2733
02:25:41,780 --> 02:25:48,500
make or your magnum opus the more stuff that you can link to them when you do

2734
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:52,100
the social media or like like a press tour you know like how people go on to

2735
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:56,620
to talk shows and say yeah I got a book out you know that that's the sort of thing

2736
02:25:56,620 --> 02:26:00,700
I think is the best way to do it is to only be social when you have something

2737
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:05,020
to tell everyone you know and if you you know is the perfect example like the

2738
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:09,020
on that far side of the spectrum who gravitated from content less social

2739
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:12,620
media and then just completely flipped Spoonie of course is drifted over time

2740
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:18,020
and just flipped those two to being zero content 100% social media interaction

2741
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:22,940
that is the most taxing on the viewer's patience I mean that's kind of

2742
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:26,420
different because I don't know what Spoonie wants I assume he just wants to

2743
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:30,820
kill Donald Trump as I understand it and God bless him in his quest like he

2744
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:33,900
clearly doesn't want to make videos anymore but he's an internet person

2745
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:38,980
now so it's kind of difficult for him to leave that but like it I feel like it

2746
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:45,500
would be worse to have build a following that likes you for certain things and

2747
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:49,300
then when you release the you finally have you know you've spent half your

2748
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:53,260
time social media half your time on the thing so it's taken twice as long and

2749
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:59,060
now you finally released it and your audience they're not not necessarily

2750
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:02,700
going to care about the thing because they know you for something else yeah

2751
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:07,180
you know perfectly real on the subject like I'm perfectly aware of kind of how

2752
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:11,460
I'm taxing the patience of my audience many of whom have expressed in no one

2753
02:27:11,460 --> 02:27:15,980
certain terms like okay Nate Gurren Lagann reviews are really good when's

2754
02:27:15,980 --> 02:27:20,020
the next like good project coming we're all we patiently waiting Ghost in the

2755
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:24,940
Shell was how many years ago that was announced any day now would be real nice

2756
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:30,140
Nate so I mean I feel I feel this tension as well yeah I mean in the few

2757
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:35,980
in like if it continues in whatever fashion your audience will be comprised

2758
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:40,460
primarily of people who care about we Agua and when you drop a big video they're

2759
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:44,580
gonna be they're gonna watch it a little bit but it's not gonna be the thing they

2760
02:27:44,580 --> 02:27:48,300
were craving so you gotta think smartly about like what kind of audience you

2761
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:52,140
want to build and are you doing that yeah with your shit so yeah it's a good

2762
02:27:52,140 --> 02:27:56,980
point yeah I mean the issue like I think I mean Nate I mean you you can

2763
02:27:56,980 --> 02:28:00,820
probably relate on this cuz of what you started doing with those big reviews is

2764
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:06,140
that like in a perfect world you could do that and be fine you know but like if

2765
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:10,300
you're trying to like build an audience online like everybody now with social

2766
02:28:10,300 --> 02:28:14,580
has like the attention span of like a goldfish like if you're not like throwing

2767
02:28:14,580 --> 02:28:18,020
your face in their face and like letting them remember that you exist

2768
02:28:18,020 --> 02:28:20,860
they'll just move on to something else because like no one's starved for

2769
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:25,620
content you know so like unless you're at like the super high top tier like top

2770
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:29,660
5% of just like raw ability that every time you do something it's like a

2771
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:33,540
fucking bomb going off in the social media landscape yeah like you can't

2772
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:38,260
really just like disappear and only come back like every year or so with

2773
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:42,540
not good enough you will be forgotten I've been working full-time the entire

2774
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:45,780
time I've been doing it now but like maybe not the very beginning but close

2775
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:49,940
to it and yeah like those original projects while I was working like took

2776
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:53,540
six months to make so like yeah that's totally unsustainable for that although

2777
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:57,820
I mean I still believe that like those guys like like John Tron's videos I know

2778
02:28:57,820 --> 02:29:00,380
he's already got a big following but like they get kind of an unbelievable

2779
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:04,180
amount of views when one drops and I think people just love the production

2780
02:29:04,180 --> 02:29:07,220
value but you know what never mind he's a terrible example because like he's

2781
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:10,660
already basically made it and people already love I mean there was there was

2782
02:29:10,660 --> 02:29:13,940
a time when you could do that and get away with it I just think yeah starting

2783
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:18,540
now like it's impossible I still I don't think it's impossible but I think the

2784
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:23,900
bar is significantly high yeah it's yeah it's it's very very very difficult and

2785
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:27,660
like so I'm just like being realistic with myself is like I don't have that

2786
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:33,580
kind of ability you know I'm not that good yet so I would have to either you

2787
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:39,860
know get a job which is not as cut and dry as it sounds just because the way my

2788
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:43,780
student loans are when I get a job I'll automatically lose over half my paycheck

2789
02:29:43,780 --> 02:29:47,820
just to increased bills so like I have to juggle the fact of like and then my

2790
02:29:47,820 --> 02:29:52,300
my tax return I start owing way more my taxes because like there's just the way

2791
02:29:52,300 --> 02:29:55,620
taxes work with like some self-employed income on top of like working a job

2792
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:59,620
because like when I did nothing but do patreon and made like no money I got

2793
02:29:59,620 --> 02:30:03,180
money back but the next year when I worked full-time for like two-thirds of

2794
02:30:03,180 --> 02:30:06,500
the year I owed like three grand so like doing all that math out it's like

2795
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:11,220
getting a job might actually make me poorer and not richer as fucking weird

2796
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:15,420
as that sounds yeah so like like it's it's and you're not gonna figure it out

2797
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:19,540
for like a year until you get fucked on that so it's just it's a cluster fuck it's

2798
02:30:19,540 --> 02:30:24,380
really real at the bottom of the like the income tiers there like I just

2799
02:30:24,380 --> 02:30:27,580
actually yesterday have like this huge list of like all this different like

2800
02:30:27,580 --> 02:30:31,780
content I would have to make like like podcasts and videos and like a YouTube

2801
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:35,660
channel and like all this stuff on top of making the game just to like be

2802
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:40,700
relevant and like have people not forget and it's just like a huge it's a huge

2803
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:44,860
undertaking like you have to be a brand today you know I'll just come out and

2804
02:30:44,860 --> 02:30:48,620
say it Tom I mean I I think you should stay on the podcast here I think that's

2805
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:52,700
going great I'm happy to have you as all that big most of us are like if I had a

2806
02:30:52,700 --> 02:30:58,900
personally give you my recommendation I would say find some decent job and do it

2807
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:03,420
on the side and like and then you have total freedom like I think the podcast

2808
02:31:03,420 --> 02:31:07,820
keeps you relatively in the public eye you know hopefully you can earn enough to

2809
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:11,900
escape that trap again I have no idea maybe I'm talking out of my ass oh he

2810
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:15,460
was just talking about getting a job making right but like I don't like he's

2811
02:31:15,460 --> 02:31:18,780
got a degree in graphic design or something there's probably something out

2812
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:22,900
there that's pays well I don't know maybe I'm totally wrong and there is no

2813
02:31:22,900 --> 02:31:27,060
opportunity for it I keep I keep thinking about I keep thinking about what

2814
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:31,220
if I what if I tried to land a job doing something that like a studio or

2815
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:36,100
something or what if I what if I could like storyboard something that'd be

2816
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:39,580
cool I have no idea where to even begin yeah I mean I've been thinking about

2817
02:31:39,580 --> 02:31:42,460
because like I have to learn programming anyway and I was like I actually asked on

2818
02:31:42,460 --> 02:31:46,300
Twitter yesterday like because I know Python is a really in degree in demand

2819
02:31:46,300 --> 02:31:51,220
language I get a programming job like I'd probably be able to like escape the

2820
02:31:51,220 --> 02:31:54,540
bell curve and actually like get a net positive I was doing something beyond

2821
02:31:54,580 --> 02:31:59,700
like flipping burgers or whatever yeah that's oh my god oh my god as as a as

2822
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:05,860
opposed to you know escaping the bell curve what you want to do as it says

2823
02:32:05,860 --> 02:32:09,780
now you're begging people to ring that bell you the bell is omnipresent in your

2824
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:12,820
life but just depends on how you you know you treat it if you want to skip the

2825
02:32:12,820 --> 02:32:16,500
curve then you got a job but if you want to stay in presence ring that fucking

2826
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:21,540
bell below his video right damn now everyone we're all we're all trapped

2827
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:27,060
under that bell ain't that the truth bring that came crashing down well I

2828
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:31,300
don't know Tom I I hope I didn't sound like I don't know I don't know I mean I

2829
02:32:31,300 --> 02:32:35,340
think about all this all the time yeah it's always like juggling

2830
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:39,300
different calculation is it would be great to have a job if it would make

2831
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:44,260
things better right that's pretty much my point yeah well if it would make things

2832
02:32:44,260 --> 02:32:50,540
better right right now well I don't know life's hard we're all gonna die hey

2833
02:32:50,540 --> 02:32:54,380
viewer hey viewers tell me tell me where I should tell me where I should

2834
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:57,980
apply to be like a storyboard or something yeah what do you got people dude

2835
02:32:57,980 --> 02:33:03,820
fucking do something universe dot com do something useful you know this this goes

2836
02:33:03,820 --> 02:33:10,660
against a lot it's been built up in the PCP well maybe not I'm sure I'll be

2837
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:15,380
guys like it but I'm like excited to have like a normal job I think that will be

2838
02:33:15,380 --> 02:33:19,940
cool at least to do for a while that like pertains to art in some way I think

2839
02:33:19,980 --> 02:33:24,020
I'll be really nice and I'm just looking forward to it is all I gotta say I I get

2840
02:33:24,020 --> 02:33:27,260
I get excited thinking about the prospect of being like a storyboarder I

2841
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:31,300
think if I could I think if I could have a job for like a studio I would like or

2842
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:34,780
like a real job like that's what I would want to do I think that sounds great and

2843
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:39,940
I know people do it but like you know I think those jobs are really in demand yeah

2844
02:33:39,940 --> 02:33:45,020
despite like for like a real lot of Cal Art graduates out there looking to draw

2845
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:50,460
a whole bunch a whole bunch of people with more art with more art art you know

2846
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:54,860
education with more degree you know then the degree the degree might be to

2847
02:33:54,860 --> 02:33:59,260
somebody's edge but a website that hosts one's body of work could I don't know

2848
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:04,380
perhaps that's even an evening factor if you've got actual I mean it can't hurt

2849
02:34:04,380 --> 02:34:08,420
right it can't hurt certainly not of course not anything I mean I don't know

2850
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:12,140
if I was hiring I would just want to see that they like had like I don't know

2851
02:34:12,140 --> 02:34:15,060
who's better that that's what they say that's what they say like a degree

2852
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:18,820
doesn't mean anything if your portfolio isn't impressive like it's all about the

2853
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:22,860
part yeah yeah all of it when it comes to the art I hear that it's all about the

2854
02:34:22,860 --> 02:34:28,100
portfolio it's all about the portfolio and it's also not in like the like

2855
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:32,140
interview since like whether you're my job but in order to get into interview

2856
02:34:32,140 --> 02:34:35,980
it's more important to have like connections you know I wouldn't want

2857
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:40,760
the degree itself does not help you I mean I'm just having the people like know

2858
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:45,080
like where to go and what to do my only connect too bad my only connections are

2859
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:48,880
you free that's fair although I mean like theoretically if I was like applying

2860
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:54,080
for like a managerial position somewhere you know what I do I would cite my

2861
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:58,920
experience like not running purely but like doing the account like they quote

2862
02:34:58,920 --> 02:35:02,960
unquote running the PCP like I get everybody together for calls you know

2863
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:06,560
doing all the account work distributing pay like on a relatively

2864
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:10,600
consistent basis of a couple days here and there but you know and I'd like to

2865
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:14,000
think that people would like I would show them the income like this been

2866
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,080
generated and then when people like whoa there's actually like some decent money

2867
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:21,280
here this isn't like a little bullshit baby diaper poo poo pee pee adventure

2868
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:25,680
you're having on the internet here well I wouldn't go I wouldn't say that it is

2869
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:34,720
bad let's not go over for it that's fair but it's just classic instant laughter

2870
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:37,840
that's all you got to do ladies and gentlemen put that down in your comedy

2871
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:42,600
portfolio put that on your resume I mean so I just my point is like for your

2872
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:46,520
application to clown college yeah like all the stuff that we're filling out

2873
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:50,000
right now right in the show for years and like running our own YouTube channels

2874
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:54,640
and all that stuff I like to think that it could all be leveraged as to show that

2875
02:35:54,640 --> 02:36:00,560
at the very least that we're go getters in various capacities so I often sell

2876
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:05,720
myself short when like explaining to people what I've done like I brush over

2877
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:10,360
the internet stuff when I really shouldn't I should think of like a way to

2878
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:14,200
say it more normally I think that's the struggle because the amount of work I

2879
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:19,200
have put into my YouTubeing stuff is so disproportionately high compared to

2880
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:23,720
every other pursuit I pursued in my life that like an employer should know

2881
02:36:23,720 --> 02:36:27,600
that like you have that kind of I mean you just have to be honest yourself and

2882
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:31,280
just like yeah I'm running a business yeah I'm an entrepreneur and like you

2883
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:34,920
always you always see like that guy who like talks himself up all the time and

2884
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:38,200
like you kind of think he's a cock and he's annoying like oh I did this and I

2885
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:41,840
did that like I was watching an interview with Enzo Amore who's like a wrestler

2886
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:46,240
yeah and he was just talking about like everything he's got going on like super

2887
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:49,600
positive about everything like I'm the coolest guy in the world man I can do

2888
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:53,800
this and I like like well that's a lot of accolades he's building himself up as

2889
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:57,560
having but then like when I think about it I'm like wait a minute who's to say I

2890
02:36:57,560 --> 02:37:02,040
couldn't just say that about myself and say get myself all those accolades that

2891
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:06,480
I do have I have done a lot of cool stuff I just never say cuz I I never

2892
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:12,080
like act proud of it cuz it's yeah that's that's that's the way you sell it

2893
02:37:12,080 --> 02:37:18,280
shameful but if I wanted to I could just as easily go around and just like you

2894
02:37:18,280 --> 02:37:23,840
know like train my brain to be more of like a go around every day like hey it's

2895
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:28,040
me I'm this guy and I do this thing it isn't that fucking cool and said I'm

2896
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:31,040
just I go around every day I'm like don't fucking talk to me leave me the fuck

2897
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:35,760
alone who the fuck are you get out of my fucking way I mean it reminds me of a

2898
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:39,200
little bit thing I've heard Tim Poole say a few times which is like just when

2899
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:41,960
comes to selling like here I got something to sell you guys

2900
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:46,880
Hydric acid please sign my petition Hydric acid has been known to kill

2901
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:52,800
millions over countless lives it has it poisons of people have been known to

2902
02:37:52,800 --> 02:37:58,960
ingest it and die over a certain amount you know it's ruining environments in

2903
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:03,200
certain locations it's displacing entire populations and Hydric acid is

2904
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:07,880
water so let's ban water let's ban Hydric acid boom I got you all to sign

2905
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:14,040
the position you've been finessed and outgenious by me cuz I'm just is it the

2906
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:18,360
dihydrogen monoxide that's the one that's the one yeah it's no good it's no

2907
02:38:18,360 --> 02:38:21,880
good for anybody but it sounds scary cuz it's got the word acid in it and all

2908
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:26,160
those things are generally true so yeah I mean salesmanship is everything for

2909
02:38:26,160 --> 02:38:29,880
something like that I think our whole generation needs to talk itself up more

2910
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:35,000
and like there's a lot of like I want to die jokes about millennials and stuff

2911
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:40,520
and this is why I roast I feel such strong contempt for every Twitter user

2912
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:45,120
with a self-depreciating Twitter bio I when I see that they're like I want to

2913
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:50,120
die I have no skills it's that the funny have to like there's a self-deprecation

2914
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:53,760
economy you have to put yourself down or else people say that you're an ego

2915
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:58,720
you know I mean people like that claim about me too I am called the best guy ever

2916
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:02,840
but I don't know I hate you talk yourself up and talk proudly about

2917
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:06,720
yourself at all the only people who hate that I call myself and so amore yeah

2918
02:39:06,720 --> 02:39:09,400
while I was watching his interview being like man this guy's really he's done a

2919
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:13,400
lot of cool shit people hate him because he has the nerve to say yeah I'm great I

2920
02:39:13,400 --> 02:39:17,640
do great shit what you can't you know who you know but you know who hates them

2921
02:39:17,640 --> 02:39:22,200
yeah fucking losers if you're hated by losers who fucking cares I mean that's

2922
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:25,600
there you should care because there are more losers than there are now there's

2923
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:29,640
can still be customers made of losers losers are the majority vote what they

2924
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:33,200
think about you is all that fucking matters in life because they can and

2925
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:37,360
will destroy you all you have to do is get to agree with you I mean as soon as

2926
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:40,600
the internet was created as soon as social media became a thing the world

2927
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:45,880
was irreparably taken over and co-opted by losers losers are the driving force of

2928
02:39:45,880 --> 02:39:49,840
all society the driving force of your life they will destroy you if they deem

2929
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:54,560
that you're not as much as this guy is successful right like he's clear he's

2930
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:58,080
got all this shit going on and it is working so like how how effective is

2931
02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:03,120
the cries of the loser masses other than like a smear campaign before they like

2932
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:06,840
oh but this guy we got to take down next you know like again attention span is

2933
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:10,560
like not because everybody hates him I mean yeah but like if enough people hate

2934
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:13,720
you then they can just fucking lie about you and then that's it doesn't matter

2935
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:17,560
what you've done your career is enough people enough people yes but I mean if

2936
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:20,840
you are able to build yourself enough of a shield to avoid that that's one thing I

2937
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:26,480
mean for me the biggest hate I feel like I've ever gotten was on my fairy tale is

2938
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:30,440
dead time to dance on the grave that's the only time I really remember when

2939
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:35,000
people to this day still get mad at me for shitting on fairy tale and being so

2940
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:38,840
excited that it is dead and this thrills me and they're like best guy ever more

2941
02:40:38,840 --> 02:40:42,320
like worst guy ever am I right ladies and gentlemen of the jury you should you

2942
02:40:42,320 --> 02:40:46,320
should be proud you should be proud of shadow I feel proud I feel very much

2943
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:50,760
proud but no don't let don't let anyone take that away certainly not certainly

2944
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:54,760
but like but that's the if I just I don't know let's say I made a video saying I

2945
02:40:54,760 --> 02:40:59,360
love Star Wars the last Jedi it's my favorite movie and that makes me feel

2946
02:40:59,360 --> 02:41:04,600
good that the things of this movie happened these events transpired then

2947
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:09,840
you know like yeah good man you are the best you can be like that kind of guy

2948
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:13,960
who you can just be like oh I don't mind the haters I don't pay attention to them

2949
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:17,880
they don't matter yeah you can tell yourself that and you can even believe

2950
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:23,880
that but it's not true the haters do matter if they matter something about you

2951
02:41:23,880 --> 02:41:29,120
then that's you that the haters matter but like I mean I object I feel this

2952
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:34,160
about myself I just don't feel I generate enough haters for it to be a

2953
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:38,640
problem and that's that's at least partially by design like I do try to not

2954
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:42,880
come off like an asshole all the time so you know that that's a tactic one can

2955
02:41:42,880 --> 02:41:46,440
take it might perhaps it's inauthentic to some people though and like they just

2956
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:49,760
are more acrid in there in their day-to-day so maybe that doesn't work

2957
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:53,440
for everybody to still feel like they're really being themselves but I mean I

2958
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:57,440
just don't feel like I get that much hatred or anger on the internet because

2959
02:41:57,440 --> 02:42:02,200
I'm relatively easy to talk to or get along with I don't know tapping you know

2960
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:07,400
I was so I was at this thing I was at this this comics thing and you know they

2961
02:42:07,400 --> 02:42:10,960
were like you know new people introduce yourselves and you know he got to me and

2962
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:15,880
I'm like you know I could like what do I say like I say like you know you know I

2963
02:42:15,880 --> 02:42:20,000
should say I'm on a podcast so I should I say like I got like I'm on Twitter I

2964
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:23,280
got like oh I got like thousands of Twitter followers like should I say I

2965
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:29,120
got a comic at well I could say I had a website or say you know I was thinking

2966
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:32,440
maybe I should mention that like I did the successful Kickstarter last year like

2967
02:42:32,440 --> 02:42:35,880
that's a thing like that'd probably be around and finally I was just like I don't

2968
02:42:35,880 --> 02:42:40,800
want to as like as like you know if you know they'll find you know you know what

2969
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:44,480
maybe they'll find out about this later you know better better to undersell now

2970
02:42:44,480 --> 02:42:48,800
and have them like learn impressive stuff later that might there's stuff that

2971
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:53,360
might impress them later so I was just like yeah my name is Ben Saint I make

2972
02:42:53,360 --> 02:42:56,760
comics on the internet I draw and I write and make comics on the internet I think

2973
02:42:56,760 --> 02:43:01,040
that was my whole thing I was like you know what the line between more can more

2974
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:04,560
can come out later more more info can can come to light at a future date

2975
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:09,440
where is the line perhaps being proud of yourself and if I didn't work it like

2976
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:13,440
it's in the mind of the moment I guess yeah and everyone's different and

2977
02:43:13,440 --> 02:43:17,600
everyone's stupid yeah well that's you're not allowed to be proud of yourself

2978
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:21,640
as my point you're just not allowed to have any pride in anything you do at all

2979
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:24,840
or else you're an egomaniac and you're an asshole and your piece of shit and

2980
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:30,560
you're I definitely feel this a lot because like like I I find like I do

2981
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:34,680
this to myself like I always my brain just kind of mentally downplays

2982
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:39,720
everything I do as a defense mechanism because like like raw like gross

2983
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:44,400
egotism revolves me so much and so I overcompensate to make sure I don't come

2984
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:48,120
off as that but then I just come off as pathetic so it's like you got to find

2985
02:43:48,120 --> 02:43:53,560
that balance yeah I mean that's the true your own self if nothing else I feel

2986
02:43:53,560 --> 02:43:57,480
the opposite I want everyone to be an egomaniac I want people to just be I

2987
02:43:57,480 --> 02:44:01,840
want everyone to just be like I'm great I like I want to be confident I want to

2988
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:06,280
have pride why won't you fucking lose right it's the most powerful thing

2989
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:14,400
everybody down to your fucking level you were like fucking crabs if you can

2990
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:19,440
give me like a choice between like do you want skill or do you want confidence I

2991
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:23,040
would absolutely take confidence because I was confident I can I would believe

2992
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:26,680
that I could like build my skills and I wouldn't follow through and actually do

2993
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:31,820
it confidence is the most powerful weapon in the entire world and it sucks

2994
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:36,060
that mine's not up to par yeah I suppose I feel like I feel like an APS

2995
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:41,140
adventures dot site to read a really good webcomic bail Jake with a fucking

2996
02:44:41,140 --> 02:44:46,220
animation coming out very soon I've been and it's really good and I like a dangerous

2997
02:44:46,220 --> 02:44:51,380
game to be saying stuff like that why I need I don't know I mean well all right

2998
02:44:51,380 --> 02:44:57,980
the animation coming out soon dangerous understandable but it is like it's not

2999
02:44:58,020 --> 02:45:02,260
going to take I mean I've been saying oh spelljeeps nearly had done for a long

3000
02:45:02,260 --> 02:45:05,700
time but I didn't realize what I was going to do at the end when I first

3001
02:45:05,700 --> 02:45:09,620
started saying that and it has changed but now it has got to the point where

3002
02:45:09,620 --> 02:45:13,980
half the line art half the keyframes and in-betweens are done and it will take

3003
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:17,620
relatively less time to finish the second half of it and then color it in all

3004
02:45:17,620 --> 02:45:22,460
right well cool I'm thinking I'm thinking like you know a month and maybe maybe a

3005
02:45:22,460 --> 02:45:27,900
month from when I say this and it'll be I just I just like to keep mentioning

3006
02:45:27,900 --> 02:45:32,740
that I have a webcomic because I feel like people like I appear on podcasts

3007
02:45:32,740 --> 02:45:38,620
and people just don't really know it's good yeah it definitely feels like

3008
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:43,860
obscure hippo it's it's that I don't know I feel like it goes back to sort of the

3009
02:45:43,860 --> 02:45:47,180
thing with the website where it's like APS adventure that just sounds like oh

3010
02:45:47,180 --> 02:45:51,620
hippo one day decided to do it for fun and he made it like a homestuck clone

3011
02:45:51,620 --> 02:45:55,340
because it would be funny to do on stream and people don't like take it

3012
02:45:55,340 --> 02:46:00,180
seriously I feel like you got to push it more for people to and try to make it

3013
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:02,860
more interesting they'll take it they'll take it seriously when they see the

3014
02:46:02,860 --> 02:46:05,980
animation because it is sick and a lot of the shots I've already finished are

3015
02:46:05,980 --> 02:46:10,860
like oh that's so good I will talk about talking about that's the good thing

3016
02:46:10,860 --> 02:46:13,700
right there yeah talking up good stuff you've done I mean it's not done yet

3017
02:46:13,700 --> 02:46:16,940
obviously but now we will be he's working out right now I mean I derive

3018
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:22,260
almost all of my confidence in life from the fact that I have done the things I

3019
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:25,020
just think back to like I don't know I don't know like when I was younger it's

3020
02:46:25,020 --> 02:46:29,340
like man like I don't know talk to this girl I don't know what she's gonna like

3021
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:32,340
me and then I'm like oh yeah remember that time I fucked that bitch I could do

3022
02:46:32,340 --> 02:46:35,820
that again let's just talk to this girl no problem and then I do and you know

3023
02:46:35,820 --> 02:46:39,060
it's okay and I'm not saying that makes it super easy or anything but it just like

3024
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:42,900
it's like I just think back to when I did the thing that I'm about to do before

3025
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:46,380
when I think back the things I've done I think oh god I'll never be able to do

3026
02:46:46,380 --> 02:46:49,740
that again maybe that's the difference right there it's like it's the focus on

3027
02:46:49,740 --> 02:46:53,340
the positive or the negative I don't know I feel like I was just like I was

3028
02:46:53,340 --> 02:46:57,220
born with like a natural confidence like I think I've always just naturally been

3029
02:46:57,220 --> 02:47:03,380
confident but like my entire life all anyone's ever wanted to do is just crush

3030
02:47:03,380 --> 02:47:07,060
that confidence out of me and my whole life I've had to stifle myself and

3031
02:47:07,060 --> 02:47:10,980
stifle my true potential and my true greatness to try and fit in with the

3032
02:47:10,980 --> 02:47:14,740
rest of the fucking meat sacks walking around here who just can't handle anyone

3033
02:47:14,740 --> 02:47:20,100
being proud of themselves for anything I just want all human beings to die all

3034
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:23,820
everything's got confidence because I'm sick of them I'm sick of them holding me

3035
02:47:23,820 --> 02:47:29,140
back holding each other back it's all they're good for every once in a while

3036
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:33,660
beings are just worthless and should all die fair enough but you know who's got

3037
02:47:33,660 --> 02:47:38,980
comments and doesn't deserve to die commenters on my galco video such as

3038
02:47:38,980 --> 02:47:43,300
the one who just commented who left this comment galco Chan who I praise endlessly

3039
02:47:43,300 --> 02:47:47,380
in the video galco Chan is literally me just in blonde it makes me happy to

3040
02:47:47,380 --> 02:47:51,340
finally have an anime representation this person has the right kind of

3041
02:47:51,340 --> 02:47:55,980
confidence to make in this world they see themselves as a shining god all I do

3042
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:59,620
is endlessly talk up how wonderful galco is and here's a person like it's

3043
02:47:59,620 --> 02:48:08,380

3044
02:48:08,380 --> 02:48:19,020

3045
02:48:19,020 --> 02:48:24,420

3046
02:48:24,420 --> 02:48:27,220
this question but I didn't get I didn't get an answer so are you continuing to

3047

3048
02:48:32,500 --> 02:48:41,860

3049
02:48:41,860 --> 02:48:47,020
minute Tom just oh he said BRB came another person yeah yeah it's not it

3050
02:48:47,020 --> 02:48:50,220
sounds like a weird like I think I think he took off his headphones unlike it was

3051
02:48:50,220 --> 02:48:53,320
the playback coming through his audio or something I think he's gone full the

3052
02:48:53,320 --> 02:49:04,120
right I just got hold on is there isn't I'm confused is Tom maybe not

3053
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:09,120
continuing 2d is zooming wait yeah I'm asking Tom are you can I listen all I

3054
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:12,880

3055
02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:16,200
are you just gonna stop a zoom me until 3d happens or you're gonna continue it

3056
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:19,080
just kind of keep the consciousness away the public consciousness aware of a

3057
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:23,880
side a little 2d thing and I will I will be continuing it if for no other

3058
02:49:23,880 --> 02:49:27,560
reason than to continue using it as an exercise to get better programming and

3059
02:49:27,560 --> 02:49:31,880
stuff God bless voicemails okay there you go all right first let's check in with

3060

our quest as ever to find the pizza party podcast let's see what we've got

3061
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:40,840
message from I I don't know I just I think it might be a fool's errand but

3062
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:43,600
now it may be let's check in with I don't know if it'll ever happen

3064
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:57,560
fucking stomach although I actually have sick for unrelated reasons you people

3065
02:49:57,560 --> 02:50:03,000
are actually going to waste innocent lives on this stupid little quest to find

3066
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:09,560
this supposed podcast sacrifice everyone you're the only person who's

3067
02:50:09,640 --> 02:50:15,080
aware that this thing even exists but since you don't know where it is how do

3068
02:50:15,080 --> 02:50:24,160
you even know it's real to begin with now since you have faith real you have to

3069
02:50:24,160 --> 02:50:30,720
become the pizza party podcast Ben think about this way I can't I don't have the

3070
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:36,520
glory than the real podcast don't have a pizza and try to stop you oh that's

3071
02:50:36,520 --> 02:50:42,000
true they'll have to expose themselves to you and you'll find them that way

3072
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:55,560
huh fair hey you know what this reminds me of Tim Poole just is filing like a

3073
02:50:55,560 --> 02:50:59,480
lawsuit or something because he's got like a he's like his branded content

3074
02:50:59,480 --> 02:51:04,400
it was under like the heading subverse and like a week ago or two weeks ago a

3075
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:11,000
porn like website group of developers launched a Kickstarter for a porn game

3076
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:15,920
called subverse and who knows if it's like intentional to like fuck with this

3077
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:19,280
guy I mean I don't know if they've had like some interaction in the past or is

3078
02:51:19,280 --> 02:51:23,080
it just a complete coincidence and like the result the search results have

3079
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:27,280
completely crowded out Tim Poole it smashed like a bunch of records on

3080
02:51:27,280 --> 02:51:30,800
Kickstarter it's got like six hundred thousand dollars right now or something

3081
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:35,080
and the term subverse has been completely co-opted by this point what's the

3082
02:51:35,080 --> 02:51:39,480
original it's it's like the the website that Tim Poole does like for news or

3083
02:51:39,480 --> 02:51:45,880
something don't yeah that's like the gist of it it's like it's okay like this

3084
02:51:45,880 --> 02:51:49,080
guy Tim Poole is like an independent journalist it's like his news YouTube

3085
02:51:49,080 --> 02:51:55,040
basically that's it so I don't know like so that it did trigger a response from

3086
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:59,360
from Tim when this person made this other thing so if we just go create

3087
02:51:59,640 --> 02:52:03,920
okay so I will so I will I'll just have to start you know I'll just have to start

3088
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:08,400
doing a segment that is the pizza party podcast the only podcast called the

3089
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:13,720
pizza party podcast on the internet that's the selling point and I mean I

3090
02:52:13,720 --> 02:52:18,240
got I don't know what it'll be about like pizzas I don't fucking know like your

3091
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:23,000
review types of that's gonna be dude oh you know what first episode of the new

3092
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:28,080
and improved one and only pizza party podcast I will review Arlo's low-carb

3093
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:33,000
pizza crust recipe that's a good idea and if that falls through I'm uniquely

3094
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:38,600
qualified if that falls through you can always do like train like railroad

3095
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:43,200
track reviews and go click-and-clack down the track okay next up we've got

3096

3100
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:12,200
team of automatons will stop at nothing to obscure the location boss I found

3106
02:53:47,840 --> 02:53:52,880
it's gonna be an absence of spines in the man maybe I don't know I find the

3107
02:53:52,880 --> 02:53:56,760
part yeah that's true we've got actual enemies to fight against now and our

3108
02:53:56,760 --> 02:54:00,800
ongoing I don't I love my spine well I wouldn't say you might say I'm kind of

3109

attached where I keep all my spine goo they can take my spine my spine's been

3110

3113
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:27,080
fair and then I'll be on Scott let's do it okay we got another one this is from

3114
02:54:27,080 --> 02:54:33,680
proud the greats the great spine okay so here's our first real voicemail it's

3115
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:41,200
proud echo quotes Jew ham boy so proud ham boy let's let's see what this is

3116
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:45,200
about I thought it was odd that Ben was so focused in the plight of the Jewish

3117
02:54:45,200 --> 02:54:49,360
people a few episodes ago so I decided to do some investigative journalism I

3118
02:54:49,360 --> 02:54:55,440
hacked into patreon.com flash Ben St. found a list of his top patrons Gal Gadot

3119
02:54:55,440 --> 02:55:02,960
Jerry Seinfeld Woody Allen the list goes on it's just as expected by God Ben's gay

3120
02:55:02,960 --> 02:55:12,480
liberal outrage actually just a Zionist dog whistling we also see it I

3121
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:20,840
could have told you that all you had to do is okay that's some good that's some

3122
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:24,880
good what happens we don't brag about your people get confused to what your

3123
02:55:24,880 --> 02:55:31,680
true motives are okay we've got another mail from some engineer hope they

3124
02:55:31,680 --> 02:55:38,880
engineered a good mail hey members of the PCP cheers from Columbia I wanted to

3125
02:55:38,880 --> 02:55:45,080
develop a actual PCP bot that will be able to take some scripts and convert it

3126
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:52,120
into an actual audiophile with your generated voices during to sit you can

3127
02:55:52,120 --> 02:55:57,520
share it some of your clean audio with me or maybe I could take it from some of

3128
02:55:57,520 --> 02:56:02,640
your videos but it will be ten times easier if you could give me some of

3129
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:08,520
your I do folks I will leave my mail or additionally I could message you on

3130
02:56:08,520 --> 02:56:14,120
this court although I don't use it that much additionally I hope you're doing

3131
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:26,860
well and I hope man the best for your family I'm not used to a genuine

3132
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:32,460
there's no ridicule there's no there's no joke it's just like hey so this guy

3133
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:36,100
normally it's exactly the sort of thing I hate which is him asking me to do

3134
02:56:36,100 --> 02:56:41,660
anything but luckily we've got a solution which is the editor contest like

3135
02:56:41,660 --> 02:56:45,700
files that we produced you know several episodes I don't like two months ago now

3136
02:56:45,700 --> 02:56:50,220
or something that were in those episodes you can just use those files and that

3137
02:56:50,220 --> 02:56:52,780
doesn't have every single member but there's like six or seven of us in those

3138
02:56:52,780 --> 02:56:56,700
so go grab those from a couple episodes ago this requires no effort from us and

3139
02:56:56,700 --> 02:57:03,380
all on you which is exactly how I like it would that be any or with which I

3140
02:57:03,380 --> 02:57:07,060
mean which episode with it's in the description there's links to the editor

3141
02:57:07,060 --> 02:57:10,660
contest stuff so if he looks back at the lat like go like five or six episodes

3142
02:57:10,660 --> 02:57:13,420
ago and then maybe go back one or two you'll find it quickly it's there

3143
02:57:13,420 --> 02:57:16,020
somewhere maybe if I'm smart I'll remember to put the link in the

3144
02:57:16,020 --> 02:57:21,180
description but probably not by the way the editor contest is a thing that is

3145
02:57:21,340 --> 02:57:26,060
yes that that's true votes have been tallied and we are in the process of

3146
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:30,740
talking to yep that's correct everything's going swimmingly it is

3147
02:57:30,740 --> 02:57:37,300
progressing smoothly we have actual ranks of people and stuff now so expect to

3148
02:57:37,300 --> 02:57:42,780
hear updates very soon everybody keep your ears peeled okay next one is from

3149
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:49,380
fat fuck faggot let's hear what this guy has for us

3150
02:58:12,780 --> 02:58:21,060
I have been destroyed it's in the line it's in the it's in the works please you

3151
02:58:21,060 --> 02:58:25,020
call you called it though you you meant you called it earlier but I bet you

3152
02:58:25,020 --> 02:58:29,820
never expected to be asked by this no by this towering but this towering model

3153
02:58:29,820 --> 02:58:36,340
of a highly unprecedented to be asked about that yeah one of these days just

3154
02:58:36,340 --> 02:58:41,900
just one of those days okay I just put it I had a sick you did I respect him

3155
02:58:42,060 --> 02:58:49,580
yeah I also just really love digitally altered low-pitched voices they're

3156
02:58:49,580 --> 02:58:54,100
really funny I agree completely it's different it's different it's different

3157
02:58:54,100 --> 02:58:57,260
it's different from having like an actual baritone yeah sounds like deep

3158
02:58:57,260 --> 02:59:08,660
throat or you know the only thing you have to do to get on the voicemail seat

3159
02:59:08,980 --> 02:59:12,980

3199
03:02:45,620 --> 03:02:53,140

3200
03:02:53,140 --> 03:02:57,860
when you play like a ds emulator you can turn on like a setting that will like smooth out the

3201
03:02:57,860 --> 03:03:03,380
pixel edges and it looks really weird it'll look it'll just be that yeah okay next voicemail is from

3202
03:03:03,380 --> 03:03:12,020
what do go hey pcp yo i've been trying to make content for years but i delete everything right

3203
03:03:12,020 --> 03:03:21,140
before it's finished out of sheer hatred from my own work what do i know that you have to stop

3204
03:03:21,140 --> 03:03:23,140
you have to stop making these

3205
03:03:25,220 --> 03:03:34,260
uh i think we all have an idea yeah i have an idea stop deleting it okay what you should do yeah

3206
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:38,660
when you find yourself in this situation okay like i know the feeling of like completing a project

3207
03:03:38,660 --> 03:03:43,780
like 90 percent and then that last 10 percent you know generally like takes 90 percent of the effort

3208
03:03:43,780 --> 03:03:49,780
or whatever like just for the sake of the exercise forget the quality forget the art you're making

3209
03:03:49,780 --> 03:03:55,460
you all you have to learn this skill just finish it because you like swore on your father's grave

3210
03:03:55,460 --> 03:04:00,900
with his samurai sword clenched in your hand that you would finish this project and then release it

3211
03:04:00,900 --> 03:04:07,300
and just detach yourself from it being good or not finish it specifically to grind the skill

3212
03:04:07,300 --> 03:04:14,020
of finishing something let that be your motivation exactly exactly nate uh ghost in the shell best

3213
03:04:14,100 --> 03:04:22,340
anime ever best one correct that's it yeah that's that's the thing yeah literally do that uh it is

3214
03:04:22,340 --> 03:04:28,580
it is definitely a skill to finish it is you are in you are in the you are in the bad mental habit

3215
03:04:28,580 --> 03:04:33,860
of deleting stuff of working on stuff not finishing it and then deleting it and you gotta you gotta

3216
03:04:33,860 --> 03:04:38,660
break that you gotta break that habit in your behavior so like if you're you gotta practice

3217
03:04:38,660 --> 03:04:42,740
you gotta practice a better way some people worry that like their projects maybe they're like a

3218
03:04:42,740 --> 03:04:46,020
little bit older than other people or something they're like oh man like people younger than me

3219
03:04:46,020 --> 03:04:50,660
by contemporaries are already so good like if i start just for example like drawing now it'll

3220
03:04:50,660 --> 03:04:55,220
just be like embarrassing to release any of this like stuff now you gotta get over that you have

3221
03:04:55,220 --> 03:05:00,260
to get over that because if you're serious about it you will improve rapidly and uh you know it's

3222
03:05:00,260 --> 03:05:05,860
like the you gotta generate the first thing the first thing that you put out will be bad no matter

3223
03:05:05,860 --> 03:05:12,340
what yes but the 50th thing you put out might be good and the 50 so get there as fast as possible

3224
03:05:12,340 --> 03:05:17,540
unless you put out the first thing exactly that's a great way it's like our boy jake said sucking

3225
03:05:17,540 --> 03:05:22,980
it sums the first step to being sort of good at something yep exactly uh yeah that's that's the

3226
03:05:22,980 --> 03:05:28,660
way you gotta break that mentality uh okay that's those that that's what do thanks for the call next
