1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,620
And a one, and a two, and a baby on board, how I've adored, and a sign on my car's window

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,120
pad.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
You guys like The Simpsons?

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,120
Not enough to get that reference, I guess.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Yeah, baby, yeah.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,120
Okay.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Alright.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,120
You guys ever watch, you ever see The Real Jims on YouTube?

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
No.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Oh, I do.

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
The Conspiracy Man?

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Well, not Conspiracy Man, but like, that series of Who Killed Mr. Burns, all the possible.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Is that the guy?

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
That's his best.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
Yeah, he did, though.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,240
He has a series of Simpsons Mysteries, but he's pretty much stopped doing those because

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,840
he kind of like ran through them all.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,720
He hasn't done one of those in a while.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,800
Now he just does like, now mainly he does like, classic episode analyses of like, you

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,480
know, one like, um, um, I don't know, someone with a-

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,480
Simpsons Well-known Facts.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
Yeah.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,120
107 Facts You Didn't Care to Know.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,880
No, no, he doesn't do those, but he'll do like a character breakdown, like he'll like,

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,600
give you the whole history of like, Barney Gumbel or Edna Krabapal, which is interesting

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,720
because like, you know, I stopped watching when I was like, you know, 18 or so.

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,480
Did you know that Edna Krabapal went on to fucking marry Ned Flanders?

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,760
Ah, well, wow, wow, he's out.

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
And then die?

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,680
Wait, Edna died?

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,160
Yes, because her actress died in real life.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,360
So they sort of imply that the character died, too.

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
Oh.

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,000
So Ned Flanders, so yes, which sucks.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,160
So Ned Flanders has had, his two of his wives have died.

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,680
Oh boy, oh boy.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Well, what do you know?

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
And I thought coronavirus was sad.

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Oh.

40
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
But the Simpsons is even sad.

41
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Welcome to the Procrastinators podcast.

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,560
Welcome to the Procrastinators podcast.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,240
It's 8, 9, 2020 and we are feeling, we are feeling fine this morning.

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Um, uh, how's everyone, how's everyone doing?

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
How's it hanging?

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Doing all right.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,920
I have an announcement to make before I forget, because I just, I just checked and it says

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,000
nothing to, does not be plugging anything, anything for me.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
It's for, it's for the podcast itself.

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,760
I would like to announce that the Procrastinators podcast, we have all our videos back as, as

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,400
has been well stated, but because of that, the migration is complete.

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,960
All of the Procrastinators channel is mirrored on library.tv.

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,800
So if there's ever any problems like that again, every video now and in the future will

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,280
be automatically mirrored at this link as I forget to go and show it on, show it on

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
the screen.

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Eleazar.

57
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Eleazar.

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Put it on screen.

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Go up on the screen.

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Eleazar.

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Eleazar, please.

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Thank you.

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
It's all there.

64
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
It's all delicious.

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,320
It even, it even took our, our channel banner and everything in the, I could mirror it all

66
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
that too.

67
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,240
We didn't have to set any of it up at just one click.

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,840
You can import your entire YouTube channel.

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
It just does it.

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,760
I, wait, I, I have not actually, why is it Procrastinators colon eight?

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,200
That's just a thing for the, the, the URL.

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
You can take that out of the store.

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,840
Can I, can I take that out of the store works?

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Okay.

75
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,600
Library.tv slash at the Procrastinator.

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,040
How does this work then?

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,360
Cause all of this video stuff has to be stored somewhere.

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,680
Uh, well, what I did is that library is like this decentralized, you know, it's even got

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
the tags.

80
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Yeah.

81
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
It's got everything.

82
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,200
And so you just log in with your, your Google account, you pick the channel and it'll just

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,960
automatically import everything on the channel and going forward, it automatically mirrors

84
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,200
everything uploaded to YouTube.

85
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,680
Well it lasts forever.

86
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,600
Uh, there's only one way to find out.

87
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Yeah.

88
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,280
Just be alive forever.

89
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,920
Live forever and wait and see, I guess.

90
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,960
So they haven't, they haven't suffered the, uh, the other YouTube alternative fates yet.

91
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,080
So we'll see how long they last, but when the channel went down and then when all the

92
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,160
videos were down, you like the, you immediately were like, God, we should have archived it

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
on library.

94
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Yeah.

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,680
I was like, what's, what's that?

96
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,480
Now you know, it's just, it's just a, it's a YouTube, an open YouTube site.

97
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,040
They have like a desktop app and everything and we have to open it up on the web.

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,160
It's crazy.

99
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
It's crazy stuff.

100
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Yeah.

101
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm watching episode 150, 185, Pokemon sucks right now from, from back in the day.

102
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,160
Forget that classic episode.

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Yeah.

104
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,800
We were talking about, uh, Pokemon that sun and moon and or Pokemon go and or sword and

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:02,600
shield, you know, one of the many times we have said Pokemon sucks, who knows, who knows.

106
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,960
It's, it's pretty cool.

107
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,160
And if you have a YouTube channel and you're always worried about your shit getting bloated

108
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,400
up, uh, maybe something to worth doing, it's, it's one click pretty much.

109
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,520
Just make an account and click a button and then it'll do all the work for you.

110
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,800
And who can complain about that?

111
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Sounds good to me.

112
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Sounds good to me.

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,760
Uh, we have a, we have a couple of episodes that have been like a handful of episodes

114
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,120
have been like restricted or removed.

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,040
You might, might re upload those at some point, like, um, and the end of end of YouTube

116
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,760
one was taken down, I think.

117
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,160
And, uh, what was the other one that was just, it was just like taken down like two days

118
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
ago.

119
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
Do you guys remember?

120
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,360
I, I said in the chat, was it a Ghibli cast or was it, yes, yes, it was the get one of

121
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,920
the Ghibli cast, the Ghibli cast got taken down for who'd fucking knows why.

122
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Well, it was copyright, but like, yeah, yeah, whatever, but I feel like years.

123
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,080
It annoys me just sort of like when YouTube was young and it was like, wow, you can upload

124
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
video.

125
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Wow.

126
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,640
You can upload so much video and, and it's for free.

127
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,240
And it's like, this is a whole 10 minute video on the internet.

128
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Yeah.

129
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,040
And I was like, this would be a really handy way to archive video footage of things.

130
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,920
If you ever wanted to do that, if you needed to place to store lots of video, YouTube is

131
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
the place.

132
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,720
It is absolutely the, like the rickety bridge, like the wood is rotten, the rope is like

133
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,840
about to snap.

134
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
There's no safety.

135
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,160
You can't ever consider putting anything on YouTube and expecting it to stick around.

136
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,440
It may as well be a Snapchat video.

137
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,720
It's so temporary feeling.

138
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
Does it, Tom, does it mirror, does it mirror our streams?

139
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,920
Um, I'm not sure.

140
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,800
I can see the Radcon 4 Royal Rumble.

141
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
So that was a stream that turned into a video.

142
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,880
As long as they turned into a video, I think they get mirrored.

143
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:03,640
Oh no, but like, what about like, what about like, uh, uh, what was the, like, cozy, cozy

144
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,720
late night stream or whatever it was called?

145
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,480
They all still get married?

146
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,280
The late night casual stream.

147
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Yeah.

148
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Late night.

149
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Yeah.

150
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
For instance, one like that.

151
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
It's right here.

152
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
It's right here.

153
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Well that was only 33 minutes.

154
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,080
I didn't think I was awake for that one.

155
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
That was ghosting.

156
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,240
Maybe, maybe that's because that was one of the ones we re-uploaded because we had, because

157
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
they all died.

158
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
I don't know.

159
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
I'm not sure.

160
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,680
I'm not sure about the, uh, the fucking, I mean, you can manually upload everything

161
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,240
that doesn't automatically give me.

162
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,120
What about the, what about, for instance, the, uh, the, the, the checkers for charity?

163
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,920
I think that's here.

164
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,560
If that's there, because that one is definitely a stream and not a, not re-uploaded a video.

165
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
I don't see it.

166
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Oh, the mavericks are not here.

167
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Hmm.

168
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
No.

169
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Oh, no.

170
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Well.

171
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Fringe.

172
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Well, okay, nothing's perfect.

173
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,960
No, nothing is perfect.

174
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:06,280
I, I personally, uh, uh, saved like every one of those streams that got deleted to a,

175
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,360
uh, I don't know if I have all of them like ever, but I have like all of those ones saved

176
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,800
to a, actually, I think it's to the same external hard drive that Vic gave me with the, um, the

177
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,920
radcon footage on it because it had a lot of extra space on it.

178
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:29,600
Uh, it's just so like, you couldn't really sell like a physical media print of the procrastinators

179
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,280
for post, posterity.

180
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,960
You couldn't like sell a Blu-ray disc with all of the content.

181
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,840
I mean, maybe you could fit it all on there if you had the podcast as audio only, but

182
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,320
like, there's, there's lots of the podcasts that have editing in them and there's, there's

183
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,520
you couldn't, you can't save like that much stuff, uh, in physical media.

184
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,880
It has to be digital somewhere and everywhere it feels so trepidatious.

185
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:07,560
What, what if we release the pro, the PCP, the PCP DVD box PCP DVD, that name alone is

186
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
pretty good.

187
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
I know, right?

188
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,800
Oh, that alone makes me want to do it.

189
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,880
Well, that on the fact that we could sell it for money, the PCP CD DVD.

190
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
I think it's time.

191
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,800
I think it's time we get started.

192
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,960
I want, I want, what about PCP VHS, VCR, please?

193
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
PCP 64.

194
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,280
Uh, thousands and thousands of cassettes.

195
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,680
Uh, I want it on laser disc.

196
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,320
Remember laser disc?

197
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
I remember from that, that one.

198
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,240
Yeah, that one, angry video game nerd video.

199
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,400
I had, Tom, you're not, you're only a year younger than me.

200
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,080
So I'm surprised you don't remember, but like my school had a couple of like fucking

201
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,080
videos on laser disc and they would, yeah, they had like fucking schoolhouse rock or

202
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,280
whatever on laser disc or like some like science documentary.

203
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,560
And they were just, well, I mean, does having laser disc means you're not shitty?

204
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,080
I mean, laser discs, when they came out were pretty dope.

205
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,000
This was, I mean, they just, they, this was like, it was like a CD, but like the size

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
of a record.

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Right.

208
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Every time I saw it, I was like, I can't believe.

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They were powerful.

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
They, they were imposing.

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They still are imposing.

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,720
You look at them now, you get pretty fucking scared, like, oh, yeah, they'll fuck, they'll

213
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
fucking kill you.

214
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Yeah.

215
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
You'll die.

216
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,440
If you, if you even fucking think about laser in the title, you could discuss them through

217
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,280
someone's entire head.

218
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,680
Yeah, I think, I think so.

219
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,680
If you were, if you were committed, if you were really committed to the bit, right, I

220
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,040
want to talk about the last week, uh, last week I, I announced that I would be streaming

221
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,080
some draw streams on twitch.tv slash Gibb and take.

222
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,240
And I have been doing that the past week, every day for like eight hours each time.

223
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,520
Uh, I did it.

224
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,400
I did a bunch of that and I drew 53 pages worth of sketches.

225
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,680
53 pages in a week, even just sketches.

226
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
That's a power.

227
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Is a lot.

228
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
That's incredible.

229
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Is a lot and I'm very impressed.

230
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Yeah, same.

231
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,040
I don't want to say, because I have, I have tuned in to see here and there, uh, what you've

232
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
been working on.

233
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,320
And, uh, I said in the, in the chat, but I'll say it again, your poses are getting really

234
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
good.

235
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,680
You're, you're, you're, I'll see you drawing like something and I'm always like, oh wow,

236
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,280
like, um, the fit, like I can really feel like the way the figure is moving in space.

237
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,840
And I'm like, good, I like it.

238
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,880
It's like the trickiest thing to do in drawing.

239
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
So.

240
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Yeah.

241
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,400
I, I feel like that was, uh, I feel like that's something that I, that I picked up at some

242
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:57,520
point and, and like it was, I think I remember Digi being impressed at like at Bronycon, like

243
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,680
the first Bronycon that we all went to when we all did the, the comics jam.

244
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,280
I think I remember Digi being like, whoa, like there's like whole comic panels and like

245
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,320
there you can, you know, there's a sense of motion.

246
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
I was like, yeah, I have captured a sense of motion here.

247
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Yeah.

248
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,680
That is an important thing to do, uh, when, uh, creating graven images.

249
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Uh, uh, so I don't know.

250
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Yeah.

251
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
It's like, yeah.

252
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Yeah.

253
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Yeah.

254
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Yeah.

255
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Dude.

256
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,280
Not only to do the draw, you know, do the drawings and occasionally be like, oh, I'm so fucking

257
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
based.

258
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,120
I drew that in like two minutes.

259
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Oh yeah.

260
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,640
Uh, but also that I get to celebrate live and have people in the chat.

261
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,360
So I say yes, and I nod to myself.

262
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,680
Um, and it's like, I can go through like if there's a bit that I'm stuck on, like I'm

263
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,920
not sure how to get from panel A to panel B in the amount of space I have left in the

264
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,720
page or something.

265
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:02,080
And, uh, you know, I explain out loud what I'm thinking, what my, uh, my thought process

266
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,800
is, and it's good just for me to say that out loud so that I can, cause it just sort

267
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,640
of makes it easier to figure out the solutions.

268
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,320
And other people sometimes they, they give suggestions and I'm like, oh, that's a good

269
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
idea.

270
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,800
So it's like, it's, it's, it's great.

271
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,560
I, I feel accomplished having done that, um, the, the, the idea of it being for the

272
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,760
Tezuka manga competition, uh, I'm not sure still whether I'd be able to get it done in

273
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,240
time, especially now that it seems to be too many pages long, the story I have, I would

274
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,360
need to like cut out a lot of what I've done, uh, or like completely rewrite the story such

275
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,360
that it doesn't have as much stuff in it.

276
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
And I'm like, that's going to take its, that's going to take time in itself.

277
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,720
If I take the time to rewrite it so that it fits in 55 pages, I probably won't also have

278
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,880
time to finish it, uh, so that it looks good because the, the, uh, thing is like not accepting

279
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,160
unfinished works or drafts, so it has to look finished.

280
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,360
So I'm like, I don't know quite what to do at the moment.

281
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,320
I'm definitely going to finish whatever this is, but whether or not it goes into the contest

282
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,160
I'm not sure.

283
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,400
Part of me is like, I really want to submit something just so that I can say I entered

284
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:32,000
and, and whatever, but I don't know how, whether I'd be okay with like changing the nature

285
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,400
of things in order to make it happen.

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,720
Hmm.

287
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:46,080
Um, do you think what if you, you would, you would have to make like a Clarissa abridged

288
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,720
in which you kind of just go in and then like, just look kind of selectively pick like the

289
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,360
least important pages and like pull them out and like, I don't know.

290
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,960
Maybe that wouldn't work.

291
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,160
Maybe that wouldn't work at all.

292
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,760
I looked through it and maybe it would kind of work and you could kind of get the story

293
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,520
across.

294
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,800
I mean, I've looked through it and it seems like the biggest save would be like speed

295
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,160
running save is, is to change the size of some of the panels so that more of them can

296
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,480
fit on a single page.

297
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,200
That's a whole lot of like re, like, like moving everything around.

298
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,960
And yeah, every time you make it in adjustment, everything else would move backwards.

299
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,480
No, all you've solved it.

300
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,440
All you do is you just take, you just take the whole page and shrink it down to one

301
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,360
fourth size and just put four pages on one page.

302
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,560
And then 80 pages becomes 20 pages.

303
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,200
Of course.

304
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,880
Incredible.

305
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,560
That's, that's so stupid.

306
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,320
It might work.

307
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,880
Thank you.

308
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,920
I mean, it technically would definitely work.

309
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,720
Yeah, I guess for this next week, I'm going to see if I can finish all the

310
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,080
sketches for the thing.

311
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,200
I'm thinking it's, you know, the, the rate I'm going, it's going to be like 80,

312
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:05,200
maybe a hundred pages and then I'll be like, okay, I have all of the story.

313
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,600
I'll try and chop and change it.

314
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,400
And if I can, if I can do like squishing all of the panels to be.

315
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,040
That's just the thing though, I think what I'm going to do is if I, if I go down

316
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,800
that road and I try to make it fit in the right amount, it's going to be worse.

317
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,200
It's just going to be bad because of a lot of things just, they work like I

318
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,120
considered what happens when you turn the page and you see something for the first

319
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,840
time and what pages are seen next to each other.

320
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,520
And so if I move everything around, that's going to be lost.

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,400
And there's also some panels that cross over other panels.

322
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,240
So I can't move everything around.

323
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,320
So it's like, it's going to be like a shittier version, but a contest approved

324
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,680
version, maybe.

325
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,120
And then later I can make the real version, which is good.

326
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,400
And, and, and that'll be that.

327
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,280
Yeah.

328
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,560
Yeah.

329
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,240
I think I can do it.

330
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,040
Just, just cut it in half and just give him half of it and then just put it to

331
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,720
be continued.

332
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,840
I mean, I was thinking about that because like at 50 page 52 or 53, everything's

333
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,520
going well, you know, confrontations happen, but then Clarissa gets captured

334
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,680
and she's in prison.

335
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,040
There's like a shot of her in prison.

336
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,960
She thinks about where her horse was and it's outside like mingling with the goats.

337
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,240
And then it's the panel of her just saying, hmm, I want my hat.

338
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,040
I could cut it off there and that'd be the end like a comedy.

339
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,160
Like she just fails and she's in prison the end and I could submit that.

340
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,560
If you just put it, if you just put it to be continued, like, like, uh, I mean,

341
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,600
I think it's, I don't think it's allowed, but I'd probably do it.

342
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,640
I mean, it's not allowed because it's supposed to be a complete, they say in

343
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,160
the, in the rules, a complete story within certain amount of pages.

344
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,200
So it implied that it's, I don't think, I don't think you'd get disqualified or

345
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,040
anything for that.

346
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,280
How, how, how hypocritical of them, their entire business model revolves around

347
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,000
throwing could be to be continues at you.

348
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,960
I know it's week by week, but it's strange because like have to make a complete story.

349
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,600
I read, I was a few months ago, I was reading Tezuka submissions.

350
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,800
Um, the one I knew about was odors wanted, which was, or no, romance dawn,

351
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,600
which is a version of, um, one piece before one piece.

352
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,640
And that has a complete story in it.

353
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,400
But, uh, you know, it ends in a satisfying way with the, the, the villain

354
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,120
that was introduced is defeated.

355
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,800
And then they, you know, Luffy and Nami go, oh, her name was something else,

356
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,880
Ruby or something.

357
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,440
They go their separate ways and that's the end.

358
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,280
So it's like implied that there could be more.

359
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,360
So that, I think that's what they mean is that whatever is set up gets resolved.

360
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,800
But in this, the villain gets set up and, um, it ends with Clarissa in jail and

361
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,680
presumably nothing changes and she fails and it's a bad ending.

362
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,480
If I, if it ends there.

363
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,480
What about, what if he's the second half?

364
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,480
No beginning.

365
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,880
It starts in medius res.

366
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,840
Um, I mean, I guess you haven't drawn the second half yet.

367
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,360
Yeah.

368
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,280
I don't even know whether I'm, I'm probably more than halfway at this point.

369
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,600
There's like a fucking, what's the deadline?

370
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,920
Deadline is the first of September at 12 PM or AM, Japan time.

371
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,240
So, you know, none of this will matter.

372
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,240
None of this deliberation will matter if I can't ink 50 or so pages within the

373
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,000
three weeks or two weeks I would have, which is a lot.

374
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,440
Yeah.

375
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,440
Although an awful lot.

376
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,520
It is an awful lot.

377
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,080
I, I don't think I have the, the power in me to do, to go that quick.

378
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,880
How long, how long does it take you to, how long does it take you to ink a page?

379
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,200
Um, well, a lot of ghosts, what was I doing?

380
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,040
I was like 20 pages per week, a day per week.

381
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,600
Okay.

382
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:14,880
Yeah.

383
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,760
It's about that.

384
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,440
I was going really, really hard on, on, on that.

385
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,680
Um, the first, in January, actually.

386
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,360
Started the year, started a brand new world where I'm drawing so hard that my

387
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,280
hand breaks off and it's, I got a new hand now as a robot hand.

388
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,360
What's sick.

389
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,400
Teach me jelly, jealous.

390
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,520
Okay.

391
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,960
So yeah, I don't know.

392
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,160
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm thinking, I'm thinking I'll see what I can do in this next week.

393
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,240
If I finish the sketches real early, I'll think about rearranging them and then

394
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,360
go straight into inking and, uh, see if two weeks, two and a half weeks or

395
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,720
whatever is enough to, to ink and, and do all of the final finishing touches on a

396
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,640
bunch of pages.

397
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
I'm definitely more productive on stream.

398
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,920
It helps a lot.

399
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:18,880
I, I found that streaming, it does keep me generally more focused on the task at

400
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,120
hand, but it also sort of gives me an out to not work.

401
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,200
Like, like the chat distracts me a little bit.

402
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,920
Same.

403
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,200
Yeah.

404
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,720
It's sort of, it's sort of a trade off for me.

405
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,600
I would say that at my, at my best and most focus, the stream is a distraction and

406
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,560
I'm less productive, but if I'm like struggling to focus on working on it,

407
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,320
then it makes me more productive.

408
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:47,600
I mean, I think the distraction is really just when I am like needing a break anyway.

409
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,000
And I just sort of glance over like, what are people saying?

410
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,240
And I see the same stuff.

411
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,960
And, you know, occasionally it can feel distraction, but like compared to if I

412
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,640
was just at, you know, at my own devices, I would be doing nothing.

413
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,400
I know this for a fact based on the like June and July is I would be doing

414
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,200
absolutely nothing and or playing a video game.

415
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,680
If not for this, for this, uh, these watchful viewers, these attentive viewers.

416
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:24,120
And people, people, people have like gotten a lot out of knowing that I'm working.

417
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,720
Some people come in and they say, oh, you're working and that's cool.

418
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,440
It makes me feel like I should be working like inspiring.

419
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,600
So I'm providing a service.

420
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,960
So basically I'm saying subscribe to twitch.tv slash give and take.

421
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,160
And you're, you're basically running a charity here.

422
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,560
Yeah.

423
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,080
Yeah.

424
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:46,120
Yeah, you know, I saw you, um, I saw you get raided.

425
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,880
I did.

426
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,920
I got raided by, um, the hiding.

427
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,760
I think it was his name.

428
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,200
I don't know who that is.

429
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,800
The height.

430
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,600
I, I forget his name too.

431
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,520
Was it the hiding?

432
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:57,840
Yeah.

433
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,280
Well, I recall that name.

434
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,320
Well, um, I went whoever it was, I went and I looked at their twitch and I

435
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,720
watched the very tail end of the last video they had been doing before they had

436
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,920
raided you and I, and I, and I listened to him as he was like picking who he was

437
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,720
going to raid and I, and I heard him be like, um, he was like, no, not him.

438
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,520
No, not him.

439
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,840
No, that guy's an asshole.

440
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,360
Uh, oh, you know who's streaming right now.

441
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,560
Gibb and take.

442
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,200
I love that guy.

443
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,480
I used to watch his videos when I was like 15.

444
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,400
So I want, so I'm going to raid his stream and I want you all to

445
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,160
tell him that I love him.

446
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,720
Yeah, they, they were all very nice.

447
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,000
I, so wait, does he know, like what I was doing?

448
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,680
I guess not.

449
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,280
It just sort of remembers the channel name.

450
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,800
I think he, yeah, he didn't say anything about what you were currently doing

451
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,360
just that he knew you from your videos.

452
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,320
Man, what a fake fan.

453
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,160
That's really cool though, because it means like he's probably just remembers,

454
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,160
like, I don't know, the pony videos or something.

455
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,160
Yeah.

456
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,560
Potentially also the hypocrite stuff.

457
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,000
One, one or the other.

458
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,480
That's cool.

459
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,680
Was it for, for, for a brief tiny fraction of a moment there.

460
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,480
I had 90 viewers or 93 viewers.

461
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Oh, no, no, hiding, hiding, hiding Kuhn.

462
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,240
That's his name.

463
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,680
I looked it up.

464
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,520
It's hiding Kuhn.

465
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,960
Yeah.

466
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,280
93 years is really fucking good.

467
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,320
I, I, I was in there and it stayed, it was still like,

468
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,160
stayed about 30 and then 20 and then 10, like, but slowly diminished.

469
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,560
So people stuck around for a while.

470
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,080
I was, I was in there and I was, you know, I think I had just, I had just subbed.

471
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,040
I had just, I like, I've like, I don't think I've ever subbed to any channel before,

472
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,960
but I was just, I was in the spirit and I had, and I had, and I had, and I had

473
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,200
filled up the cup with, with little unicorn hearts and I was waiting for someone

474
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
to, to drop something in and make them splash out.

475
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,320
And someone had dropped like a hundred bit in there and it had kind of worked.

476
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,040
I was like, this isn't good enough.

477
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,520
So I was like, okay, fuck it.

478
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,720
I'll sub and I dropped the one and it went and I was like, yeah, cool.

479
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,600
All right, I'm out.

480
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:14,960
Peace.

481
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,120
And then I left and I, but then, then I came back like a, like a little bit

482
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,120
later, just to kind of look and like it had gone from, you'd gone from like

483
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,760
somewhere in the tens of viewers to like, you know, you had like 90.

484
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,640
I was like, oh my God.

485
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,600
And the chat was going crazy and I was, I was curious.

486
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,320
So I, I looked up, uh, I looked up the guy who had sent them there to, to

487
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,160
try and get some backstory of how did this happen?

488
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,480
Yeah.

489
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,040
It was complete.

490
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,600
And then I found out it's a whole narrative tapestry.

491
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:40,960
There you go.

492
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,040
Uh, that's the thing.

493
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,440
Hey, I always meant to do this when I was streaming and I would usually

494
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,080
forget, but I would recommend, uh, I would recommend, uh, yeah.

495
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,360
At the end of your stream, just read somebody, uh, like just go to, go to

496
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,080
like the streaming tab, pick anyone and just, no, I only occasionally remembered,

497
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:04,840
but it's great.

498
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,200
It's a really good to do.

499
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,320
Everybody loves it.

500
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,560
It's fun for the viewers because they get to jump into some chat and go,

501
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,920
ah, spam, spam, spam, dab, dab, dab.

502
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,440
For instance, um, you know, the, the, the streamer, the streamer is

503
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,280
appreciated too.

504
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,120
And somebody, you get to follow each other back and then you get, oh, join

505
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,000
each other's communities.

506
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,640
Oh, join, join my web ring.

507
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,600
Oh, put your link on my fucking website or whatever.

508
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,040
Uh, that's called, that's called networking.

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,480
Add to my blog's Rolodex.

510
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,320
Go, go, go.

511
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,480
Oh, oh, uh, friend me on Facebook, uh, I'll be on my space.

512
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,800
Here's my link to my Friendster by my, by my, uh, by my mixtape.

513
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,160
I'll have to hire me on Fiverr.

514
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,280
Yeah, squirt me some of your favorite music on my zoom.

515
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,240
Uh, let, let me, let me read the, the quote from, uh, Das Kapital in

516
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
your, in your next bread tube video for you.

517
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,840
That's what they do.

518
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,440
That's what they, that's what they fucking do.

519
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,680
They all read, they all read quotes for each other.

520
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,720
Dude, speaking of Das Kapital as in capitalism, uh, I need one more

521
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:21,120
sub in my Twitch subscriber points to get a new emote slot for the tier one

522
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,600
subs.

523
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,040
The moment I only have one, it's just me, like smiling sideways.

524
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,280
You need one more sub.

525
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,800
Will it be unlocked permanently?

526
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,120
Yes.

527
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,120
I looked into it as like you, you get the extra emote slot.

528
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,840
And even if your subs go down afterwards, you have it forever.

529
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,440
So I need this to happen this month.

530
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,800
One more sub.

531
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,960
That's what I'm going to go for.

532
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,360
And then I'm probably going to put like the red man face or like the, the

533
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,280
Gibb and take, Rob, like face.

534
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,640
I would, yeah, I was in there and I was, uh, I was there and I, and I

535
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,120
bullied you into, uh, into giving us the, uh, the loyalty badge, the subscriber

536
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,880
badge, you had the, uh, you had the default star.

537
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,960
And I was like, what the fuck this shit?

538
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,480
And you, uh, you, uh, you gave us the, the, the red man.

539
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,280
So now every, every, every sub has the little red man face.

540
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,320
And I'm like, yes, yes, I love that.

541
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,760
Or is it every sub or every?

542
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,400
Yeah.

543
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,640
It's a sub, it's a sub thing.

544
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,880
It's a, it's a subby thing for my Dom, Gibb and take.

545
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,880
Um, excellent.

546
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,600
Delicious.

547
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,480
Yum.

548
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,960
Uh, um, yeah.

549
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,040
So twitch.tv slash Gibb and take go.

550
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,920
Actually, I think, um, by the time this is out, I'll be like wrapping up the last

551
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,720
stream of the week.

552
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,800
So you missed out.

553
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,960
You fucking idiot.

554
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,000
You should have already been there, but you can, you can follow right now.

555
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,120
Should have listened to the jack of all trades episode.

556
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,920
You would have known this was happening last week's episode.

557
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,240
But it's got like no views.

558
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,800
Fuck you.

559
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,120
Fuck everybody.

560
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,560
All the, all the crop of, of like 80 videos that came out this week have like

561
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,480
less than half their normal views.

562
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,240
It's a bit of a bummer.

563
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,520
I guess that's what happens when you have, when your subscriber's attention is now

564
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,400
divided between like 10 episodes instead of just one.

565
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,800
I hope, I hope they appreciate, I hope anyone who's exclusively a YouTube viewer

566
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,400
appreciates like the sudden glut of content.

567
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,680
Yeah.

568
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,760
Um, so they can.

569
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,080
Imagine like, imagine not having followed along at theprocrastinators.com.

570
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,080
For shame.

571
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,880
It would, yeah.

572
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,440
It's, it's funny because it's like, nowadays you don't, you assume websites

573
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,360
don't exist, nobody will ever think to Google theprocrastinators.com to find

574
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,440
out if there was a website that really exists.

575
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,040
So it serves, it serves its function perfectly adequately.

576
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,560
Uh, yeah, that's one word for it.

577
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,200
No frills, no bells and whistles, just, just straightforward content, you know,

578
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,880
the, could the content you crave at an affordable price, the placeholder graphics,

579
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,240
just nothing, nothing altered from the default WordPress template.

580
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,360
We should, we should replace the banner now that you mentioned it.

581
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
This is just a picture of a potted plant.

582
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:00,680
I don't know.

583
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,680
I feel like it's become a character in and of itself at this point.

584
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,920
We should just take that image and then like Photoshop us into, into it.

585
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,680
Like in, in like a, oh yes, we're going to add the potted plant to the group piss.

586
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,880
We are the leaves of the plant.

587
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,680
Like we're in the, each of us a branch, we've got like, we're in the

588
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,160
background, we're in the background and we're like, like, uh, fuzz out.

589
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,920
What's the word?

590
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,160
Like out of focus.

591
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah.

592
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,240
It's just kind of in the back, like looking through the plant, like, what's the

593
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,480
plant going to do next?

594
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,920
And the plant is weed.

595
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,520
The plant, the plant was a metaphor for weed.

596
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,920
Oh, beautiful.

597
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:46,960
Okay.

598
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,960
Wait, speaking, speaking of jack of all trades, guys, guys, I'm so angry at you.

599
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:54,680
That's fair.

600
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,880
I can't, I can't, thank you.

601
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,240
I can't believe, I can't believe how few voicemails you listen to.

602
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,680
Yeah.

603
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,840
That was weak.

604
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,760
It was weak.

605
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,440
You had like so many and you listened to, you listened to like six of them.

606
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,520
And, and you know what, and you know what, I don't know if you saw the, I don't

607
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,520
know if you saw the comment from crack, I had made, he made a couple of voicemails

608
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,920
and you listened to like one of them that doesn't make sense without the other

609
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,280
ones.

610
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,920
Well, that's his fault.

611
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,760
They weren't making it clear.

612
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,800
I let him down.

613
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,680
I let him down by not being on the episode.

614
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,160
And by the way, you were absolutely right.

615
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,120
The reason I wasn't on last week was because I was so hung over that I couldn't

616
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,880
function and I woke up and then couldn't, couldn't do anything and had to just go

617
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,320
sleep on my, take a nap on my couch until it was over.

618
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,840
It was, it was literally the worst hangover I've ever had in my entire life.

619
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,520
So much that I was puking just from how, I was nauseous and puking just from how

620
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,320
hung over I was.

621
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,480
Oh my God.

622
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,960
It's never happened before.

623
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,840
Ben, what is, what is beyond twisted?

624
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,000
Cause you've clearly hit it.

625
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,280
I, I got, I was, I was shwaisted.

626
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,680
I was, I was, I was, I was, I was.

627
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,200
That's it.

628
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,760
That's the only word to describe it.

629
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,680
But why?

630
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,920
I don't know because I'm stupid.

631
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,920
You're, you're always, you're all, I'm, I'm always hearing stories.

632
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,360
I'm always hearing stories of Ben being unbelievably

633
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,120
shwaisted and ordering chicken nuggets delivery.

634
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,520
And then you wake up the next day and you're like, huh, what?

635
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,560
I don't remember that.

636
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,960
Why did I do this?

637
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,400
Yeah.

638
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,640
Yeah.

639
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,360
That's how it goes.

640
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,760
I have like, I don't want to say you can't keep getting away with this, but

641
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,920
you're not getting away with it.

642
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,320
You're getting your due diligence, your comeuppance, but you just don't learn the

643
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:34,800
lesson.

644
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,720
Absolutely.

645
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,800
Absolutely.

646
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,720
Um, no, no, yeah, you're, it's not like, it's not like this is consequence free.

647
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,880
Um, I'm finding that like, I'm very, okay.

648
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,000
I don't know if I'm just like, I've said this before.

649
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,360
I don't know if I'm just very good at not appearing drunk.

650
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,840
Thus, so that I can drink a, a lot before like, I become unable to drink anymore.

651
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,600
And therefore I end up with a lot of alcohol in my system, which impedes my

652
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,920
memory a lot, or if I just like, am very quick to reach the point where I don't

653
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,720
remember anything.

654
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,640
But it's, I've only, I've only seen you twisted a few times, but in those times,

655
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,360
what will happen is you will start drinking a lot quickly and we will all be

656
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,360
like, then stop and you're like, no, fuck you in the middle of taking another drink.

657
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,520
You're belligerent to the point of just like aggressive.

658
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,680
You, you're determined to die the only way I can describe it.

659
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,680
They're, they're definitely, they're definitely comes a point where in I get a

660
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,520
little, I reach a point of drunkenness at which I'm like, yeah, drinking is great.

661
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,960
I should do it much faster.

662
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,120
Well, that's the whole thing, the switch is so quick.

663
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,000
It goes from like Ben having a good time, having a drink to Ben being

664
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,800
belligerently like drunk and that sucks and telling everyone to try and help him

665
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,760
to fuck off and not metaphorically, literally fuck off and continue to drink.

666
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Were you like that at Recon four?

667
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,920
Cause like, I don't know whether you were actually there was the one.

668
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
There was the first one.

669
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,600
The first night we all got pretty fucked up.

670
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,560
The first we streamed it, right?

671
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,600
Yeah, the first night we streamed.

672
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,480
I got really drunk and I threw up, but you know, I remember.

673
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,800
I remember all that, all that.

674
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,080
I didn't black out for any of that.

675
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,360
Yeah, you weren't that, which is you seemed quite amenable.

676
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:36,000
I think, I think, I think, I think because we were on stream, I had a certain, I had,

677
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,880
there was a certain like, I had a certain presence of mind about me.

678
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,160
Well, I'm like, even if I'm drunk, I got to behave myself.

679
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,840
I honestly think you probably drank less than, than usual because like when we hang

680
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,600
out and it's just drinking, like you don't stop, like there's always a drink going.

681
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,880
And on the stream, we could only drink when shots were purchased.

682
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,400
So that kind of like put a hot cap on you.

683
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,520
Because I knew that I could be forced to drink at any time.

684
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,080
So I was like, I better not.

685
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,520
I was like, this is work right now.

686
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,760
I'm on the, I'm on the clock.

687
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,840
You did tear through those beers, though.

688
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,960
When I, when I, when I'm getting, when I'm drinking.

689
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,800
Yeah, I get, I get belligerent, but, but, but, but I'm like, but I'm like funny

690
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,520
belligerent, right? Like it's belligerent in like a cool way though, right?

691
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,160
Like in, in an epic way.

692
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,920
We're laughing with like an undertone of concern, you know?

693
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,880
Oh, no. Oh, no.

694
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,960
That's hilarious.

695
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,080
But like, we know how this is going to end.

696
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,800
We know how this is going to end.

697
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,440
That sucks. That sucks.

698
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,880
I'm sorry. No, I'm like, I remember.

699
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,520
I remember how I feel when I'm like, when I'm, when I'm drunk and I'm like yelling

700
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,600
and I'm sitting like, ah, fuck you guys, like what I'm thinking is that

701
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,120
like I'm being funny and like it's funny for me to say these things

702
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,040
and to be like an asshole and belligerent.

703
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,120
It is in the beginning, but then we see you like actually dead and we're like,

704
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,360
oh, no, we can't stop you.

705
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,400
But your, but your concern is for my safety.

706
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,680
Oh, absolutely.

707
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,280
OK, OK, OK.

708
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,720
Well, that's better than. OK.

709
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah. It's not like every time you black out, you become a beast and you start punching.

710
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,240
He just starts punching and he just won't stop.

711
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,360
Oh, God. Oh, God.

712
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,080
Good times. Good times.

713
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:30,000
So anyway, but but now look what I've did because of my indiscretion.

714
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,240
I let our viewers down.

715
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,680
The voicemails went on. Listen to, I don't know.

716
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,120
There needs to be.

717
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,720
We need to reinforce a meritocracy in the voicemails, you know,

718
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,640
there's too much of a communal thing going on.

719
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,640
Wasn't this was inspiring bad behavior.

720
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,000
We got to we got to have a strict policy of screening the voicemails.

721
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,520
So these people bring their aid game.

722
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,320
But that was gay.

723
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,680
Oh, it was. I was feeling very lazy.

724
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,720
But I'm going to cover that laziness up with an appeal to meritocracy screening.

725
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,520
Well, who's going to do it?

726
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,280
Who's going to do it?

727
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,120
None of us used to do it.

728
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,400
Nate used to do it and none of nobody else wants to do it.

729
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,080
And I think Anarchy is cool.

730
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,280
Yeah. Well, you weren't here.

731
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,920
So I know I was shamed.

732
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,120
I fucked up, you know, I fucked up, everyone.

733
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,000
When when Nate is here, meritocracy reigns.

734
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,760
When Ben is here, Anarchy reigns.

735
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,080
When when you are both absent, Malaise sets in.

736
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,880
It's it's like it's like Twitch.

737
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,640
It's like Twitch plays Pokemon.

738
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,600
Was it Anarchy versus democracy?

739
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,960
I think Nate's not democracy, but instead of democracy, it's like

740
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,720
monarchy or feudalism.

741
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,000
It's like feudalism, basically.

742
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,520
Was it order versus anarchy?

743
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,560
I can't remember what the fuck.

744
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,720
I think it was democracy because people were voting.

745
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,320
It was just democracy straight up.

746
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,800
All right.

747
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,640
All right. Yeah, they voted on which one.

748
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,800
And because Anarchy was just like every command goes through.

749
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,760
Democracy was like every so often.

750
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,320
There's a command every so often a poll is done.

751
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,160
Yeah, I just don't remember being called democracy,

752
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,880
but I guess I didn't pay much attention to it.

753
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,120
I do remember it being called that, I believe you.

754
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,600
What about Twitch plays Haven't Take?

755
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,680
Like to draw a line like up at a nine degree angle.

756
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,720
No, no, no, draw the left like down at like forty eight.

757
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,520
Has anyone has anyone tried to make like a drawing program on Twitch?

758
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,560
I bet you could. Yeah, it's like up up, down down.

759
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,800
It's like itch a sketch. Oh, God.

760
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,000
Communal itch, yes.

761
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,160
Yeah, that would be terrible.

762
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,400
Anarchy anarchy.

763
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,200
It just be scribble, scribble stream.

764
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,720
It would probably just be shit.

765
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,160
Yeah. You there would be no.

766
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
No, there'd be no saving it.

767
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
There'd be all noise, no signal.

768
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,160
There's some structure to a video game that helps contain the chaos.

769
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Yeah, it's only because, yeah, there's like so few commands you can do at any given time.

770
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,160
There's only so many states that can occupy it.

771
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Dude, do you remember that big reddit image thing?

772
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Which one?

773
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,160
It's like a giant pixel art thing and each user can decide a color for a square.

774
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:18,160
And multiple communities of people, like you can only do it once every so often.

775
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
And people try to draw things.

776
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:28,160
And communities would come together to draw like the logo of their community on this massive communal pixel art something or other.

777
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
It sounds familiar.

778
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,160
I can't remember what it was called, but it was similar sort of like...

779
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Like there was this cult that formed of like the abyss that started to draw black encroaching on everything.

780
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:50,160
And people were fighting against the abyss and like rebuilding their lost, you know, their destroyed stuff.

781
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
It was cool.

782
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,160
I remember that happening for a little while and then it stopped.

783
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
Hmm.

784
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
Hmm.

785
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Based.

786
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,160
I never did it, so I don't remember.

787
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I don't remember.

788
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm sorry.

789
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm sorry.

790
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Anyway, Clarissa's cool.

791
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I like Clarissa.

792
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
She's a cowgirl.

793
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,160
You know, that's nice and all.

794
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
But you know what's really cool?

795
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
No.

796
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Personal finances.

797
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Oh, I know where this is going.

798
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Do you know?

799
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Yeah.

800
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Oh, I know.

801
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,160
I posted a big spiel about it in the cultural Marxism channel.

802
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:48,160
And then I, because it was on my mind, in my discord, I started a new channel that's called Mutual Financial Aid where we talk about how to get free money.

803
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,160
I applied for a credit card.

804
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
I've never had a credit card before.

805
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,160
I've always used a debit card, which when I tell people that, they're like horrified.

806
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
They're like, what?

807
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
What?

808
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
You haven't been building equity?

809
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
I'm like, I'm sorry.

810
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,160
You haven't been playing the video game?

811
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
My parents didn't trust me enough.

812
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,160
They were like, if you have a credit card, you'll build up debt and then you'll die.

813
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
And I was like, yeah, that's probably true.

814
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,160
So then for another like 30 years, I was like, nah.

815
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:25,160
But I just, okay, because I have an incredible credit score, I applied for the, I applied for the best credit card I could find.

816
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
All right.

817
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,160
How do you have a great credit score when you haven't had a credit card?

818
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:38,160
Well, I have, I've made, I think the major thing is that I've made all my student loan payments.

819
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,160
That's like been my major, the major debt that I've paid off and I've paid off every payment on time.

820
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
So that's probably why.

821
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,160
It's like, isn't it like you have a, you have good, you have a good credit score because you haven't done anything to fuck up your credit.

822
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,160
But you don't have a lot of like a volume of credit.

823
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,160
So you're not going to get approved for like any like crazy loans right out the gate because you don't have a proven track record of like handling credit well.

824
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,160
But your raw score, just based on the, the information that's there is still good.

825
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Is that how that works?

826
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
I think so.

827
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,160
I think you have to have a credit history as well for like higher end, crazy loans and shit.

828
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Hmm.

829
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
I don't know.

830
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,160
It's funny, like the one negative mark I have on my, actually, I could, I could talk about that.

831
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,160
I could, I could talk about my credit score for an hour and I will.

832
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:33,160
The one, the one negative mark on my credit score is like a couple of years ago when I moved away from Boston to move in with Digi.

833
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:45,160
No, was it for the, it was at some point, I had a subscription to Workout World, the gym, and I had signed up for like a year of, of access to it.

834
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:54,160
I had paid like, I had agreed to like $10 a month or like $20 a month or whatever for a year, but then a couple months into that, I didn't want to do it anymore.

835
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,160
So I canceled my credit card and they couldn't, they couldn't keep paying.

836
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,160
They couldn't keep accepting payments.

837
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:09,160
So I have like $140 that I owe to Workout World that made a little like five point dip in my credit score, which has like completely gone away now.

838
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
And it doesn't matter.

839
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
So I'm scot-free.

840
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
Fuck you, Workout World.

841
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Workout World.

842
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
You'll never get my $140.

843
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Hell yeah.

844
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
Doesn't even matter.

845
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,160
And then this is a, okay.

846
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Do you want, do you want to know about this mysterious, this mysterious thing?

847
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
There was a, an account.

848
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
All right.

849
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,160
You go to credit karma and you see two different credit scores, one from Equifax, one from TransUnion.

850
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,160
They were both amazing.

851
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,160
800 plus.

852
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
I am, I'm a miracle.

853
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
I'm a wizard.

854
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,160
I'm like, fuck yeah.

855
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
But there's an account.

856
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Like one of them, one day my, my, my account dips like, like a couple points, like three or four points.

857
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's almost good.

858
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
I can't let it go under 800.

859
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
Like that's bullshit.

860
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
I'll die.

861
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:03,160
So I, so I look and I see that it's this Bank of America checking account in my name.

862
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,160
And I'm like, I don't have a Bank of America, sorry, not check credit card.

863
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
I'm like, I don't have a credit card.

864
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,160
I don't have any credit card, let alone a Bank of America one.

865
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,160
So like, I file a dispute and I say like, hey, uh, this is not my, this is not my account.

866
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
Remove this from my report, please.

867
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:27,160
And they do, but when they do, my score drops 80 points.

868
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:33,160
I'm down to a pathetic, I'm down to a pathetic 725.

869
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,160
I might as well be living on the street.

870
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,160
Um, but it's only with, it's only with TransUnion.

871
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,160
Equifax still thinks that my account, that that's my account.

872
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,160
And I still have an 800 with them.

873
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:51,160
And I'm like, and I'm like, and so I'm like, I need to get that back.

874
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
I need my points back.

875
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,160
So I tried to file another dispute with TransUnionist.

876
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
Like, no, I didn't mean to.

877
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,160
That actually was my account, please put it back, but they won't let me because I guess

878
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,160
because of COVID or whatever, they like stopped accepting disputes.

879
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,160
They were like, when our office is not running, like we're not accepting disputes right now.

880
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
We will, when we're back.

881
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,160
And so for months, I'm like, ah, like, what am I going to do?

882
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:21,160
So finally, like the other day, like this week, I think they opened up their dispute center again.

883
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
So I filed a dispute and I'm like, please give me the account back.

884
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,160
And they're like, we can't do that.

885
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,160
You're going to have to contact Bank of America.

886
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,160
And I'm like, no, just, you had to just put it back.

887
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
And they're like, no, can do.

888
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,160
I'm like, ah, but it's not even my account.

889
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,160
It's a, it's a fake account.

890
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,160
It's, it's fraud.

891
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,160
It's literal fraud that I don't know how it got on there.

892
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,160
And I will just want it back.

893
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,160
So I don't know, please, please defraud me.

894
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:51,160
So I guess tomorrow what I'm going to have is I'm going to have to call Bank of America and and ask them like, why is there a credit card account under my name?

895
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,160
Is this real?

896
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Did like one of my parents like get drunk and black out and start me a credit card account somewhere in El Paso, Texas when I was a little baby?

897
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
Or, or, or what is this?

898
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,160
And probably they'll be like, yeah, that's fake.

899
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:17,160
So I'm probably going to have to resign myself to a pathetic 725 credit score for the rest of my life.

900
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,160
The struggle.

901
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,160
But it's okay.

902
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,160
Because while I've got good, while, while I've got good, or maybe 725 would have been fine for this anyway.

903
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:32,160
Or maybe they checked Equifax and, and they use, and they use the 800 and that's why I qualified.

904
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
But I got, I got the best credit card.

905
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,160
I got a credit card, 2% cashback on everything.

906
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
2%.

907
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Is it real cashback?

908
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
What's, what's real?

909
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,160
What's, what do you mean?

910
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Because like my, I have a, I've had a credit card.

911
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,160
They don't, they don't, they don't say points.

912
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,160
They don't say points or anything.

913
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,160
They say cashback.

914
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:57,160
Cause like my card said cashback and I just have like points to use in like their proprietary storefront.

915
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,160
And I'm like, this sucks.

916
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
I hate it.

917
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,160
I don't think so.

918
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,160
Cause I've been, cause like, I was using a debit card forever cause I'm like, I don't understand credit.

919
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,160
I'm too dumb.

920
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
That was me.

922
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
And my bank was just like, you should get a credit card.

923
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,160
And I'm like, fine, just shut up.

924
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,160
I'm never going to use it.

925
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,160
I think I got it literally just because it was like, if you spend X a hundred dollars, you get money back.

926
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
I'm like, I'm already going to buy something that that much.

927
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,160
I'll just do it for that.

928
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,160
And that was my plan.

929
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Yeah.

930
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,160
Then my debit card expired and they've sent me five and none of them have made it to my house.

931
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,160
Even though the bank is literally right up the street.

932
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,160
So I've just been forced to use my credit card for everything for the last two years.

933
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,160
So I have no idea what my credit is, but I pay off my statement entirely every month.

934
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,160
So I must just be a God at this point because I've made every payment.

935
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:52,160
I've made every payment flawlessly without, even though, even though the last batch of shipping was put on my credit card and Nate sells and pay me back because he's literally dead.

936
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,160
And I'm mad.

937
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,160
I want that back so I can pay off my credit card in two weeks.

938
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,160
Nate has, Nate has not, has Nate paid back any of the Radcon expenses?

939
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,160
Like, are we still, are we still all due like for groceries and shit?

940
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:12,160
The only thing he's paid back that I know of is the shipping costs that I've paid the last like month because I was like, I need that back because that's like two and a half thousand dollars.

941
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
On my credit card that needs to be paid off like now.

942
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,160
And he was like, okay.

943
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Okay.

944
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
But other than that.

945
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,160
So, so, so like, did you, did you buy any like food for the house?

946
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,160
I think I did, but I don't know if I even bother.

947
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,160
Yeah, I think what we were doing expenses tab.

948
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:35,160
What we were going to do is we were tallying up personal expenses of like, you know, anything that could be related to Radcon.

949
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:43,160
And then we were going to go through it after we had done all of the things that require money.

950
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,160
So like,

951
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,160
Well, here, here's the thing that nobody's been reimbursed for anything yet.

952
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,160
We're going to do everything.

953
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
That's what I wanted to know.

954
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,160
That's what I wanted to know.

955
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,160
It's been reimbursed because like I asked Nate, like, when are we going to get, when can I get reimbursed for everything?

956
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:00,160
Cause like I wanted, I got reimbursed for all the costs I did for making all the rewards, but he did not.

957
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,160
I assume.

958
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,160
He did not pay me for the labor.

959
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,160
I have not been.

960
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:10,160
I paid for any of the labor and he was like, well, we're just going to wait until literally everything is done before I pay any of you back.

961
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,160
I'm like, but that's going to take like at least another year.

962
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,160
But okay.

963
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
I mean, yeah.

964
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,160
Do I trust Nate for another 12 months sitting on all that money?

965
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,160
I don't know.

966
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,160
I mean, I trust him not to fuck with it.

967
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,160
I don't, but I don't know.

968
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:28,160
Like something bad could happen and he could be in a situation where he needs to like blow all that money.

969
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,160
I don't fucking know.

970
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,160
I mean, it's, I mean, it's a dangerous economy out there right now.

971
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,160
I guess seems unlikely.

972
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,160
It's unlikely, but anything's possible.

973
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,160
Um, yeah, I, but okay.

974
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,160
But like, I think the real question is when are we going to open up a business account for the PCP?

975
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Why are we letting him have all of this?

976
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,160
It's clearly an idiotic idea.

977
00:49:52,160 --> 00:50:02,160
But if he paid it, but if he paid it out now, then what would happen if like, you know, the, the, the, the OVA or something ended up costing more than then we expect, you know?

978
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,160
Yeah, that's, that's why we need to do like all of the big expenses.

979
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,160
Well, okay.

980
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:16,160
Well, I guess, I guess if we, if we were just paying back like, like house expenses and like, you know, production labor, I mean, that's all stuff that needs to be paid out anyway.

981
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,160
I was only talking about the labor costs for the things I've already done.

982
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,160
Like that's set at stone.

983
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,160
Like I'm not, you know.

984
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,160
Yeah, I would support, well, but he already paid you the shipping cost, right?

985
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,160
Right, but none of the labor costs for doing all the work.

986
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:37,160
Okay, well, I would, I would support a motion to get you that because I mean, that's, that's a set in stone cost that is, that is non-negotiable.

987
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,160
So like it has to be paid out eventually anyway.

988
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,160
It just, just as much as like, you know, the dojin or the OVA expenses or anything.

989
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,160
Right, exactly.

990
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,160
So I would be in favor of that.

991
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:55,160
And maybe groceries and shit too, just like get that out of the way because like, why not?

992
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:02,160
Yeah, there's, there's a lot of stuff to, to hash out still, but like there are things that could probably just be taken care of.

993
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,160
I feel a good deal right off of everybody's mind just to be like, okay, that's settled.

994
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,160
And then we only have the costs that are still forward facing to worry about.

995
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,160
I'm still waiting for my, I'm still waiting for that.

996
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:22,160
And the charity stream raised $702 in donations and I pledged 50 of my own.

997
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:31,160
So I went, so after the stream, I went and just out of my own pocket donated the $752 to bail funds.

998
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:40,160
So I am waiting, I'm still waiting for 702, that's 752 minus my 50, 702 dollars from that.

999
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,160
But it had to come, it had to come out of AdSense, right?

1000
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,160
So like it took like a month for it to go through.

1001
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,160
So I think it probably would have paid out about two or three weeks ago.

1002
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:56,160
So this, it should, it's, I should get that with this next round, which Nate is laid on by the way, but it's okay.

1003
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,160
Cause I don't care that much.

1004
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,160
Right, right.

1005
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:04,160
Um, but, um, but, um, I, I just,

1006
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
You were talking about the credit card.

1007
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,160
I was talking, yes, I was talking about the credit card.

1008
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,160
I feel like I made this analogy in the chat and I deliberately didn't explain it.

1009
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,160
But so in, in, in, uh, Oolulilia, right?

1010
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,160
Everyone knows his book, Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters.

1011
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:29,160
Fewer people have read his other book, Secret in the Basement, but I have read Secret in the Basement.

1012
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Have I, have I talked about this book before?

1013
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,160
No, I don't.

1014
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,160
Do you guys remember?

1015
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,160
I don't remember.

1016
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,160
Maybe had, but I don't remember.

1017
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,160
Well, Secret in the Basement, it's, it's pretty long.

1018
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,160
Like it's a pretty thick book.

1019
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:46,160
Um, and it is about this kid, teenager, Richard, who basically he has dreams and in his dreams,

1020
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,160
he goes into his basement and this magical door opens and there's this wizard here who

1021
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,160
sends him on this quest through all these video game worlds.

1022
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:59,160
And the, but the funny thing about it is that like a lot of the book is spent like grinding

1023
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,160
monsters and like going back to the wizard and like shopping for his equipment and like

1024
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:10,160
spending his like in-game currency to buy like, to like, to min-max his stats and stuff.

1025
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:16,160
And the big like items that he saves up for like, basically the items that mark like his

1026
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,160
next step on the tier that's like, okay, I can kind of like sell back all these other things

1027
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,160
to buy this one thing that will replace them almost.

1028
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,160
And then I can start collecting like the next sort of tier of gear are these universal rings

1029
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,160
that just like increase all his stats across the board.

1030
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,160
So they'll be like the first universal ring gives all his stats like plus 10.

1031
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,160
Second universal ring gives all his stats like plus 50 or whatever.

1032
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:43,160
Anyway, getting, getting this credit card that's going to give me 2% cashback on everything I buy with it

1033
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,160
makes me feel like Richard buying his next universal ring.

1034
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,160
All my stats have been increased across the board.

1035
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,160
My buying powers is universally increased.

1036
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,160
I am a god now.

1037
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,160
I can, I can kill, I can kill blue jellies with lightning too.

1038
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,160
Like even without, in one shot, even without a critical hit.

1039
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,160
Like that's how empowered I am by this.

1040
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,160
Incredible.

1041
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,160
I know.

1042
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,160
It's, it's pretty cool.

1043
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,160
It's pretty cool guys.

1044
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,160
I've yet to use my credit card for evil.

1045
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,160
I just use it as cash.

1046
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,160
What do you mean by evil?

1047
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,160
I don't know.

1048
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,160
Like doing any crazy fucking Machiavellian schemes.

1049
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,160
It's, it's not called evil.

1050
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
It's called smart.

1051
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,160
Yeah.

1052
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,160
What do you mean?

1053
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,160
What do you mean?

1054
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
What do you mean?

1055
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,160
What do you mean?

1056
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,160
Um, like, like,

1057
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,160
What are you talking about?

1058
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:34,160
Like people use credit cards to like make like crazy upfront purchases or like they

1059
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,160
do what was, what was the term you said that they were doing with credit cards if they

1060
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,160
had a whole subreddit for?

1061
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
Oh, oh, churning.

1062
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,160
Churning.

1063
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,160
I've not tried any churning power things.

1064
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,160
I'm so fascinated.

1065
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,160
I'm so fascinated by the concept of churning.

1066
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:53,160
It seems like, I guess like if you're living a certain like level of lifestyle that's totally

1067
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,160
feasible, it definitely wouldn't be for me because I would just be losing money.

1068
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,160
The, the, okay.

1069
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,160
Let's explain churning before we go any further.

1070
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,160
Yeah.

1071
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,160
Okay.

1072
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,160
So the concept of churning is that certain, um, certain credit cards will offer you a sign-up

1073
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,160
bonus.

1074
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,160
That's like if you sign up for the card and you spend a certain amount within a certain

1075
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,160
period of signing up, they will give you basically reward money.

1076
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,160
And, you know, sometimes that's in like credit or sometimes it's in cashback or maybe sometimes

1077
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,160
it's in points.

1078
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
Okay.

1079
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,160
A lot of them are in like miles.

1080
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,160
I think a lot of the best credit cards in terms of pure value are the ones that give

1081
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,160
you like frequent flyer miles or like airline travel points.

1082
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Um, like super useful now, but yeah, like I, even before like I didn't travel that much.

1083
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,160
So like I'm not interested in that, but there's ones that just give you like straight up like

1084
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,160
cash credit.

1085
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,160
Um, and the idea of churning is like you go through, it's like you're churning through

1086
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,160
credit cards, like one after the other, you get one, you earn the reward, you get the

1087
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,160
cashback, you, you, you, you close the account, you move on to the next one.

1088
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,160
And you just go through them and go through them and go through them.

1089
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:03,160
Um, and, um, a lot of them are like, there's one, the seemingly the best and easiest one,

1090
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:08,160
there's one that is, if you sign up and you spend $500, you just get $200.

1091
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,160
Like that's the easiest one, but there's others that are like, if you sign up and you spend

1092
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,160
$5,000, you get $500.

1093
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,160
You sign up, you spend $4,000, you get, you get $400.

1094
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,160
Like that seems to be like the ratio.

1095
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,160
It's about one to 10, um, on a lot of these other ones.

1096
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:31,160
So like you, I mean, if you're doing it successfully in theory, it seems like you can kind of just

1097
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:36,160
sort of be getting like 15 to 10% of your money just back for free.

1098
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,160
Right.

1099
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,160
If you're already spending that much money in that, a lot of time.

1100
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Yeah.

1101
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,160
The idea is that you do this on purchases you would have made anyway.

1102
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,160
So it's just becomes free money.

1103
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:53,160
Your net goes down like 10, 10% or so in terms of just like cost of everything you're buying.

1104
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,160
Yeah.

1105
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,160
Would you run out of banks at some point?

1106
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,160
There is a, okay, apparently in the churning community, cause I was, I was reading through

1107
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,160
the subreddit and I picked up some of the lingo.

1108
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:10,160
In the churning community, there was a concept known as being under five 24, which means

1109
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:16,160
that you have applied for fewer than five new credit cards in the last 24 months, which

1110
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,160
seems to be the cutoff point.

1111
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:23,160
And a lot of banks will, like that's when, that's when banks start to be like, I don't

1112
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,160
know if I want this guy signing up for credit.

1113
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,160
Like certain banks are more sensitive to churning than others.

1114
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,160
Like a Chase bank, Chase bank, I get, or it's either chase or capital one.

1115
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,160
It's like, if you're under 20, if you're, if you're not under five 24, don't even bother

1116
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
churning capital one or chase.

1117
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,160
But if you're under 24, if you're under five 24, you're golden.

1118
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,160
You know, you can go right for the, for the AmEx Platinum.

1119
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,160
You know, it's like, you're the sky's the limit.

1120
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,160
I just, I came up with this idea.

1121
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,160
I was like, wait a minute, cards give bonuses.

1122
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,160
What if I just signed up for one, got the bonus, moved on to the next one and just kept it going.

1123
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
This is, this is brilliant.

1124
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:05,160
I'm a genius only to find that there's this entire subreddit dedicated to this exact thing

1125
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,160
that I have, that I have.

1126
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,160
I think there's a small victory in coming up with a established idea on your own

1127
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,160
without outside influence.

1128
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,160
I think that just,

1129
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,160
That, that, that means it works because people do it.

1130
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,160
And it means that you're clever because you didn't have to have someone tell you it.

1131
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,160
You came up with it literally by yourself.

1132
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,160
Yeah.

1133
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,160
There's a moral victory there.

1134
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,160
I think so.

1135
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,160
Yeah, I think so.

1136
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,160
Definitely.

1137
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
Things like,

1138
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,160
I think that when, yeah, go on.

1139
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:36,160
Things like that sort of, I mean, obviously it is a loophole, you know,

1140
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:44,160
sort of finding ways to get by and get money that were not intended, you know,

1141
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,160
breaking the video game of life.

1142
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:56,160
And like the necessity for stuff like that and normal people having access to cheat codes

1143
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,160
is because the money is not, you know, easy to get a hold of the normal way.

1144
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:10,160
It just makes me upset that all of these workarounds are even necessary.

1145
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,160
I mean, if you're saying capitalism bad, I'm right there with you, my dude.

1146
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:20,160
It's interesting how the banks are like, you got to be under the 524 rule in order to churn

1147
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,160
cards, but if you're Jeff Bezos, you can put all your money into offshore accounts and

1148
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,160
be totally okay with it.

1149
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,160
Yes.

1150
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,160
Okay.

1151
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,160
This is the thing.

1152
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,160
This is a perfect example.

1153
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,160
To do, to successfully churn, you have to have good credit.

1154
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,560
So like if you don't have good credit, like a lot of these cards that give like these

1155
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,840
lucrative rewards, they just won't accept you.

1156
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,400
So like if you're already in debt or something, like if you're not already sort of ahead of

1157
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,160
the game, you're fucked, right?

1158
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:50,160
So there's one example of how, you know, capitalism bad, inherently unfair, meritocracy is a lie.

1159
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:57,160
And second example is that you basically, you know, like one of them is like, you have

1160
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:05,400
to spend, you know, $7,500 in, you know, four or five months or whatever to get $750 back.

1161
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,880
If you're going to spend $7 and a half thousand dollars over the course of four to five months,

1162
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,960
then that's $750 of free money that you can get.

1163
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,760
But if you are not someone that would be spending that much, if you don't have those

1164
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,200
money or you're more frugal or you have to be or whatever, then that this option is simply

1165
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,440
not available to you.

1166
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,760
And again, you know, if you're not already ahead of the game, you know, then you fall,

1167
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,480
then you're even further behind, meritocracy is a lie.

1168
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,400
So yeah, I agree.

1169
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:39,440
The reason why this works, it's the same concept as like, you know, in like a store, sometimes

1170
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,920
they'll be selling an item and it'll come with like a cashback code or a coupon or something

1171
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,680
and like you can buy it and then you can go home with it.

1172
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,680
Yeah.

1173
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,680
Yes.

1174
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,680
That's it.

1175
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,680
A mail-in rebate.

1176
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,680
It's the same concept as a mail-in rebate.

1177
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,720
Theoretically, if everyone were a perfectly rational actor, they would be giving this

1178
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,320
item away for free and everyone would get their money back and the company, it could

1179
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,680
not possibly be profitable, but it works because people like are not rational.

1180
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,000
They will simply forget or not care or not, or not do it.

1181
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,040
That's why mail-in rebates are mail-in and not instant because as a kid, I was like,

1182
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,040
why isn't it just instant?

1183
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,160
Why are they making mail it in?

1184
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,320
Not realizing that mailing it in and having to do that hoop is entirely the point.

1185
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,320
Yeah.

1186
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:24,000
If everyone were a rational actor and worked on their own best interest all the time, these

1187
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,360
cash rewards through credit cards would be completely untenable because everyone would

1188
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,560
be churning them and everyone would just be squeezing free money out of the bank all

1189
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,560
the time.

1190
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,920
But people don't do that and people fuck it up and people rack up credit card debt and

1191
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,520
get in debt and that's what they're hoping you do.

1192
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,840
They put that cashback thing on there to make you sign up for it under the impression

1193
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,840
that most people, and then they've crunched the numbers, that most people will either

1194
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,920
fail to beat that or forget and therefore they're using the card now, they're making

1195
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,040
their interest money and they've lost nothing.

1196
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,040
Yes.

1197
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,040
Yeah.

1198
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,240
So that's why it works.

1199
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,240
Yeah.

1200
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:06,480
There's things like that, all of the, like when you're a little boy and you hear about

1201
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,480
purchasing things with money and you're like, oh, I got pocket money, you think of it in

1202
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:16,120
terms of you get a number of money and you can use it to get a thing and it's just never

1203
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,160
that simple.

1204
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,000
To do money correctly, you need to live money.

1205
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,040
You can't just have it as a thing you do.

1206
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,640
You can't have it as a currency that's in the back of your mind.

1207
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:32,360
You have to be actively doing, you have to research money, like you would research fucking

1208
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:37,000
how to make a computer or run a, you know, understand a car.

1209
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,040
It's an extremely, like, I hate it.

1210
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,960
I just want to, something's like cost one pound, I pay for one pound with one pound.

1211
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,480
I have, on the one hand, I get it.

1212
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:59,240
On the other hand, I have sort of found looking into this stuff to be sort of fun in kind

1213
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,880
of the same way that like, I don't know, it's in the same way that I would, that like reading

1214
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,560
into like, yeah, in the same way that reading into like a hobby or how to, how to maximize

1215
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,720
your stats in some video game is sort of fascinating.

1216
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,520
I mean, it's good for people that it works for.

1217
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,840
It's just like, I really wish this video game was not tied to my personal well-being and

1218
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,200
ability to live, you know?

1219
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,480
Like not that I'm currently like actually struggling, but like, I don't like the idea

1220
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:34,880
that money is so important and yet it's, you know, it's also a video game.

1221
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,080
It's like, it's like learning how to parry in Dark Souls, but if you can't learn how

1222
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,120
to parry in Dark Souls, you die in real life.

1223
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,400
Have you seen, have you seen the Twitter account called accidentally left?

1224
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,400
Yes.

1225
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,400
Yes.

1226
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,400
From you.

1227
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,400
From me?

1228
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,400
I've probably retweeted.

1229
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,400
Yeah.

1230
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,400
Yeah.

1231
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,040
The one for viewers, it's basically like people making, people making bad right wing

1232
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:02,120
arguments in a way that accidentally like proves the left is best, Lamal.

1233
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,880
And the one that's reminds me of is like, I don't know, it's someone says something

1234
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,720
about like, but you know, housing, you know, housing is a human right.

1235
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,880
Like people shouldn't have to pay just to have somewhere to live.

1236
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,640
And someone answers like, oh, what about food and healthcare?

1237
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,760
Should we decommodify all of those things too?

1238
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Lamal.

1239
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,760
Uh, uh, yeah.

1240
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,760
It's like.

1241
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,760
Yes.

1242
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,760
Yep.

1243
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,760
Capitalism bet.

1244
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,280
Capitalism bet.

1245
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:32,560
You know, for, for, for things that are necessary for human survival, um, uh, yeah, this would

1246
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,560
all be fun.

1247
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,680
Thought, thought slime, thought slime has a video about Minecraft where he's talking

1248
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:43,320
about like the Minecraft market for like diamonds or something or some other, I don't know.

1249
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,800
Um, and he's like, yeah, you know, people are in there, they're trading, you know, they're,

1250
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,280
they're doing work, you know, they're, they're, they're trading their labor to create value

1251
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,320
in order to trade for these other commodities.

1252
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,160
And he's like, this is, this is what I think that like people that love capitalism think

1253
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:04,360
that capitalism is really like, like people making like, you know, logical choices in

1254
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:09,440
order to, you know, satisfy demands in like a low stakes environment, right?

1255
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:15,000
Where nobody's like, like very life is tied to, to what's to this game that's being played.

1256
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,960
And like, that's what people think it is.

1257
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,480
Well, the people at the top of the top of the fucking thing, because you can't, you

1258
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,880
know, like the, that's what it is for rich people.

1259
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,080
They have no risk of like going bust unless they super fuck up.

1260
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,120
So it is just a game.

1261
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,960
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1262
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,000
And money, when you're, when you're, that's why these fucking billionaires don't

1263
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,600
ever do anything and except sit on it.

1264
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,960
It's like, this is my high score.

1265
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,800
I don't want to fucking lower my high score.

1266
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,240
I got to keep it on an offshore bank account because it's my score in this game.

1267
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,040
It just keeps, it just keeps getting higher the less they do with it.

1268
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1269
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,280
It's, it's, it's bad.

1270
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,680
It's bad, it's bad that this, this stupid game that I have been playing,

1271
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,280
that I've been looking into, into strats for recently, you know,

1272
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,520
is someone's bad at it.

1273
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,720
You know, maybe they'll die or maybe they'll just be fucks.

1274
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,520
Maybe, maybe even if they don't die, you know,

1275
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,840
they'll just be like a perpetual debt cycle or whatever.

1276
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,080
And once they're in, like it's super hard to get at.

1277
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,280
It's like, you know, once, once you're in the debt spiral, you know,

1278
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,000
it's like, you know, you're getting, you're getting camped, right?

1279
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,320
And, you know, campers are the billionaires.

1280
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,120
They're, they're camping your spawn point, right?

1281
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,200
And you, and you can't even, it's literally, it's like playing Counter-Strike.

1282
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,280
It's like, it's like in 2020, if you decide I'm going to learn to play Counter-Strike

1283
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,560
and you get in there and everyone who's in there has been playing Counter-Strike

1284
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,000
for 35 years and like, they're all pros.

1285
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,800
You can't, you can't fucking play Counter-Strike.

1286
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,600
It's impossible.

1287
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,680
There's no sense that you can't get good at Counter-Strike

1288
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,600
because you literally cannot play the game

1289
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,440
because everyone in there is so clutch, so pro, so ahead of the curve

1290
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,120
that it's simply impossible to catch up.

1291
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,000
You'll never do it.

1292
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,240
Right.

1293
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,080
I tried once.

1294
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,240
I died every time.

1295
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,120
And then I was like, I don't like it.

1296
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,240
But I, but I had the luxury of switching to TF2.

1297
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,680
You can't do that in the real world.

1298
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,680
No, if only.

1299
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,960
The TF2 is the, is the revolution that's coming.

1300
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,520
Don't worry.

1301
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,520
Don't worry, comrades.

1302
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,080
We'll get them.

1303
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,840
I can't wait to bonk those billionaires.

1304
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,760
I can't wait to bonk them.

1305
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,400
I can't wait to go up and poke them in the eyes like the three Stooges.

1306
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,840
Can't wait to bake-stay them.

1307
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,560
I feel like I was going somewhere else with that.

1308
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:37,520
I don't know.

1309
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,920
I feel like I had something I was building to on the subject of

1310
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,920
churning and credit.

1311
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,640
I don't know.

1312
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,400
I think you were just introducing the idea.

1313
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,320
Are you going to be churning?

1314
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,160
Are you going to be personally churning in your life?

1315
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,080
Oh, I know.

1316
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,040
Wait, I remember.

1317
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,800
I was going to say, I think maybe next year,

1318
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:01,280
like maybe after maybe once the whole like COVID like pandemic

1319
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,120
unemployment thing blows over.

1320
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,720
And, and, and, and, you know, I got to look for some new,

1321
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,000
I got to think of some new scam.

1322
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,400
Maybe I'll start churning.

1323
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,040
By the way, is there anything, did anything end up happening with that?

1324
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,880
Did you, did you see what I said in the chat?

1325
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,360
And should I?

1326
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:20,800
I know Trump's saying he wanted to make it be 400 and then the Dems versus

1327
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,360
conservatives.

1328
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,840
This is six versus two or some shit.

1329
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,280
So I follow this channel called Clear Value Tax,

1330
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,920
who have like literally every single day,

1331
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,080
they put out a video explaining like what is the status of the next stimulus bill.

1332
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,800
Oh, I think I know who that is, but I haven't watched them in a while.

1333
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,120
The Asian guy in the suit, in the suit and tie.

1334
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,240
He's like, he's very, he has like, he's completely dry.

1335
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,600
He doesn't like, he's like, this is your stimulus report.

1336
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,920
This is your stimulus package update report.

1337
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,000
This is your second stimulus check update.

1338
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,200
This is your unemployment update.

1339
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:56,240
This is your PPP loan status update.

1340
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,280
I hope you're having a great day and happy Thursday.

1341
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,840
So, and then it'll just like flip through his, his shit.

1342
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,440
He's funny.

1343
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:09,600
And he'll, he'll occasionally, the only emotion he ever shows is that he will

1344
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,840
occasionally like, he'll say like the politicians say that they will be going on a

1345
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:20,160
recess this Friday, whether or not they reach an agreement on the next stimulus

1346
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:20,560
package.

1347
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,360
And then he'll like kind of just look down at his notes and like shake his head like

1348
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,520
and then he'll just keep going.

1349
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,640
The only emotion he ever shows is dismay at the politicians.

1350
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,400
Dismay and from my recall, certain moments of fatigue where he's just like,

1351
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,920
there's just so much to go over right now.

1352
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,560
Oh my God.

1353
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,480
Sometimes he'll get a little bit exasperated.

1354
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,800
Like, I'm trying to explain all this, like, if you really should know this already.

1355
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,440
But so yeah, I keep up with that.

1356
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:54,320
And all right, so the unemployment boost from the, from the last like stimulus package

1357
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,120
ended like two or three weeks ago.

1358
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,800
It was two, I think it was two weeks ago.

1359
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:05,440
And the new, and like, so Congress was supposed to, for the next stimulus package,

1360
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,440
they were going to argue about whether to extend it or cut it or reduce it.

1361
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,560
And the Democrats wanted to extend it, same as it was.

1362
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,520
Republicans wanted either to reduce it or cut it.

1363
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,160
Generally, they were more in favor of just, just reducing it.

1364
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,160
And Democrats were like, like, we, like, we want these things.

1365
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,520
We won't budge on these things.

1366
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,680
Republicans were like, we don't want to give you anything.

1367
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:28,960
We hate you.

1368
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:36,080
And Trump, Trump was just like, okay, they were supposed to decide, and they were supposed

1369
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:40,640
to go on recess this Friday before, and hopefully they were going to settle on the bill before

1370
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,760
then they didn't settle on the bill, but they decided, okay, we're not going to go on recess.

1371
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,600
We're going to keep debating this next week.

1372
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,080
But on Friday, because they didn't reach the, Trump was like, okay, I've decided.

1373
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,480
Executive order, we're going to, we're going to go exactly in the middle.

1374
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,920
We're going to do like, between what the Democrats and Republicans want,

1375
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:03,360
which like, I guess as a compromise makes some sense, but it's not clear that he actually

1376
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,640
has the authority to do that.

1377
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,200
Right.

1378
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:10,880
Like he's, like he's not really, the president is not really allowed to decide how money gets

1379
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:17,520
spent. That's Congress's job. The like, quote unquote loophole that may or may not be valid

1380
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:23,200
is that it's, this is supposed to be paid not with new funds, but with the leftover funds

1381
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,840
that have not yet been spent from the old stimulus package.

1382
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:33,760
So maybe it'll happen. But I think that they are, I think that this is just like a temporary order,

1383
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,280
or it's only going to be an effect for, so like obviously it can only continue until

1384
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:43,840
that money runs out. So I think Congress is going to continue to debate over it over,

1385
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:49,920
like whether like a permanent bill for another more money in a real stimulus package next week.

1386
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,880
So yeah, I don't know. This, this is it. This is,

1387
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,280
I don't know. What do you think about that?

1388
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,280
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see. I guess, so nothing's in effect yet then.

1389
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,720
It's still kind of up in the air.

1390
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:14,960
I don't know. I think so. I think, I think it's still kind of up in the air at the moment.

1391
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,800
Like whether, like whether this will even go into effect.

1392
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,720
And whether this will affect like the stimulus package that is not past it.

1393
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:30,400
There were, there were some other things that he included in his executive order, like student loan,

1394
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,000
student loan debt, it will, the suspension will continue until the end of the year.

1395
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:39,200
There was another thing I'm forgetting, something about the PPP loan, which does not affect me,

1396
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,760
so I didn't pay attention. I don't know. There were, there were some other stuff.

1397
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,920
Oh, the, oh, the payroll tax. Payroll taxes are suspended.

1398
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:57,120
And I have no idea what I think about that. I think payroll taxes seem bad,

1399
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,200
but they fund things that I think are good. Like payroll taxes would fund social security.

1400
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:08,880
So I don't, I think I don't like what a payroll tax is, but I do like what they are used for.

1401
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,920
So them being suspended, I'm not sure how I feel about it.

1402
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:21,520
Yeah. So that, so that was the executive order. By the way, I looked into it and it seems like

1403
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:27,680
if the, if the stimulus package is passed and like the benefits are extended,

1404
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:33,920
it will probably be applied retroactively. So like if you're, if, so if people are applying for

1405
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,240
a unemployment like this week or last week or next week, right before anything gets passed

1406
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:47,040
or anything is done, probably if a package is passed and like a pandemic boost is applied,

1407
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:53,040
it will be retroactively that most sources that I found that had any sort of stipulation on the

1408
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:59,040
subject said, yeah, that's usually how it's done. Interesting. So I don't know. So I don't know.

1409
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,640
Um, wouldn't it be cool if we weren't in America and this wasn't nearly as big of a problem? Because

1410
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:13,840
like we'd be on the tail end of this shit. Yeah. Didn't, didn't all Canadians just get like 2000

1411
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,960
Canadian dollars like a month for a while? I think that's how that went. So that would have been

1412
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:24,800
way simpler. Well, you know, America is just obsessed with means testing. They just up like,

1413
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,600
oh, we have to have, we want to need paperwork to make sure that like you're, you have to be this

1414
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:36,800
poor to qualify for something, which is like really reinforcing that whole like the, the mean,

1415
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:43,680
means testing is supposed to prevent people who like don't, who have too much from like

1416
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:48,720
qualifying for benefits they don't quote unquote deserve, but it really reinforces that whole

1417
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:54,080
like welfare queen stereotype that conservatives like hate so much. That's like, it really, it,

1418
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,880
like, well, like welfare really does not incentivize laziness so much as like

1419
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,880
gatekeeping welfare behind like you must make this little money in order to get it.

1420
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,200
Like that's what really incentivizes not working. Yeah, it's weird as well. Cause like

1421
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:14,720
extremely rich people were also getting subsidies anyway, and in much larger amounts.

1422
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:21,440
Right. But it's in like a different, it's a different way. Just if you're, you know,

1423
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:27,440
if you're reasonable, but not like wealthy, then you can't have it. You have to be

1424
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:35,040
bumfuck poor loser going to die soon in order to get it. It's almost like they're incentivizing

1425
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,200
you to either be extremely wealthy or extremely poor that like there's some sort of neo feudalism

1426
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:46,080
starting to take form or something. It's like, I mean, it's like, like those examples I gave

1427
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,880
with the churning, like you need good credit and you need to be able to, you need to command a

1428
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,120
certain amount of spending power or else it doesn't work and that free money is cut off from you.

1429
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:00,400
But if you have those things, you just could just get free money. Like things like that abound,

1430
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:05,840
right? In government and in business and in like every aspect of life, like the system of wealth,

1431
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:13,120
the capitalist system of wealth just reinforces itself, you know, in all these different ways.

1432
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:18,960
I uncovered two of them this week. And there's plenty more where that came from. You know,

1433
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:24,480
everyone says like Amazon Amazon gets like, you know, Elon Musk is like, huh, Bernie wants to

1434
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:29,760
give everyone shit for free. Elon Musk gets $4.9 billion in taxpayer money and subsidies,

1435
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:34,320
just just for being him, just for owning Amazon. We just gave that to him, our money. He has it.

1436
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:41,840
Elon Musk. You mean Jeff Bezos? No, Elon Musk. He said Amazon. Did I say Amazon? I'm sorry. No,

1437
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:52,000
I meant Tesla and Elon Musk. But he gets that. And, you know, his defenders will say, oh, yeah,

1438
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,480
but he gets that because like he cut a deal with, you know, whoever, like, you know,

1439
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,360
oh, the California like, you know, gave him the subsidies because they wanted him,

1440
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,240
his factory there, you know, because it would create jobs or whatever. And like, yeah, it's,

1441
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:12,480
it's not these subsidies are not for no reason. Like he's not just getting them

1442
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,720
for literally no reason. Just like if you're getting this free money from churning credit cards,

1443
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:23,120
you're not getting it for no reason. You're doing it via a system. But like at the end of the day,

1444
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,440
you know, it's still it's free money that you're getting just for being rich that only like only

1445
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:33,840
a fabulously wealthy person like Elon Musk could could get access to. Sure. You know, or Bobby

1446
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:44,560
Kotick, you know, you hear about, I love Bobby Kotick, the CEO of Activision. He also gets like

1447
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:50,560
taxpayer money for Activision that he just pockets himself. I was listening to Jim Sterling this week

1448
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:57,760
and I think I heard him talk about that guy. Yes. Yes, I know. Is he's like, he's like one of like,

1449
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:03,600
he's like really rich, right? He's like very rich 1010 guys in America or something like that.

1450
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:10,480
Some crazy shit. He's like a 10 like a 10s of billions there. Yeah, probably. Maybe hundreds.

1451
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,880
I'd deck a billionaire if you will. I mean, probably probably not hundreds. Yeah.

1452
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:22,560
Like a like a like a real Bloomberg level kind of guy. Like a just a real fucking piece of

1453
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:27,680
shit if you know what I'm saying. Yeah. He definitely has a lot to do with making call of duty.

1454
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:35,120
Well, what would we do without his expertise? I know all that incredible coding and art direction

1455
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:42,560
skills he has. A visionary. A visionary. Really? What if we did the shooting but again? Oh, such a

1456
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:49,040
great idea. That's literally where his input ends. Have you have you seen that? Have you seen that

1457
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:55,120
meme that's like, I want I want shorter games with worse graphics made by people paid less paid more

1458
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:00,800
to work less. And no, I'm not kidding. Yeah, I saw that quote. Yeah, I retweeted that yesterday.

1459
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:11,360
I was like, yeah, yeah. You want the end market? AOC tweeted the other day. The billionaires need

1460
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:16,160
the working class with the working class do not need billionaires. And I saw this. I think it was

1461
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:22,400
an accidentally left retweet or someone else. And someone replied like isn't thinking they're

1462
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:29,680
making an amazing rebuttal thinking this is an epic clapback. They're like, isn't Oprah a billionaire?

1463
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:35,440
So basically you're saying Oprah needs the working class, but the working class doesn't need Oprah.

1464
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:44,160
Think about it. Yes. Think about that for a second. Yes. I think I think that's true.

1465
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:48,800
I think that's probably that probably holds water if you examined it seems cogent to me.

1466
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:54,560
I it seems both sound and valid in my in my in my estimation.

1467
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:06,800
Boy, oh, fucking boy. I I feel a little embarrassed to be to to have like that I that I find like

1468
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:14,080
money talk interesting now, but I do. I've become I've become old. I think I think this is how you

1469
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:22,320
know know your enemy, right? Right. It's like, I mean, it has the same appeal as a video game

1470
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:29,680
of watching numbers go up. It does. And it's it and I the universal ring comparison is like,

1471
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:34,240
yeah, I feel like I unlocked a new perk or a feat or gained an achievement or something.

1472
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:38,320
I wonder if it's embarrassing to say because I know most people use credit cards and here I am

1473
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:42,880
like, oh, my God, I got my first one, lol. But I got a good one. I got the best one. Hey, viewer,

1474
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,880
I bet my credit cards better than yours. Do you get 2% cashback? Didn't think so.

1475
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,280
The thing is, like so many people use credit cards wrong, right? Like you live off that.

1476
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,600
That's that's what I was afraid of. That's what I was afraid of. It's like, yeah, like I grew up in

1477
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,240
fear and it ruined their lives. So for for the longest time, I did not get a credit card because I

1478
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,720
saw the damage they could. That's what everyone says. I was retarded. And I mean, I was right,

1479
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:08,640
but not this way, apparently. That's what everyone says. You get a credit card, you'll run up your

1480
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,760
credit card debt. You don't know, though, you'll have to pay interest. You'll you'll you'll fall

1481
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:17,200
into a mountain of debt. Just don't buy things you don't have money for. Just just don't buy

1482
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:22,000
things you don't have money for and just don't forget to pay your balance. How the only the

1483
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,240
only two things are an easy way to keep track of the money you have before you make a purchase.

1484
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:34,240
Do they make it easy or do they make it difficult? The reason why I was inspired to buy this to get

1485
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:39,680
this card was because I was my friend, a doub, was telling me that he had just gotten a new one

1486
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:44,160
and he was telling me about his, you know, perks and I was like, oh my god, there's perks.

1487
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:50,400
And he was like, yeah, there's an app like like the credit card can just you can just get an app

1488
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,800
for your card and you can just like make payments through the app on your phone. Yeah, that's what

1489
01:21:54,800 --> 01:22:00,880
I do. I just have a Google reminders that every on the three days before my payment date, it just

1490
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,440
has a little notification like pay your credit card, you dummy. And I'll just do it right through

1491
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,400
the app and then you're done. And like the way you do it is like you just, I mean, I know what

1492
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:15,120
how much money I have in my account. And I just don't spend more than I normally would because I

1493
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,840
just use it like cash and I already live very frugally to begin with. So instead of like pulling

1494
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,080
a $5 bill out of my pocket or like throwing my debit card on there, I just use the credit card.

1495
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:29,120
And then on the 20th of the month, I just pay off whatever it was, because it doesn't charge you

1496
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:33,440
up front, like that's the whole point, you just have to make the payment. And you just wait,

1497
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:37,440
you basically just pay your entire month's worth of payments in one fell swoop instead of doing it

1498
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:44,320
as you go. I am, I am waiting for this is this is actually delaying the vapors a little bit

1499
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:49,280
because I am waiting a couple of days for my card to arrive in the mail so that when I because I

1500
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:54,800
because I ordered the books to be printed and shipped to me the 500 the final the final printing

1501
01:22:54,800 --> 01:23:01,360
vapors to his fucking coming. And but it's going to cost me $2,000. So I'm waiting for the card

1502
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:06,400
so that I can use the card to pay for it. So I can get the 2% cash back because 2% of $2,000

1503
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:12,160
is $40. So that's 43 bucks. You know, I'm not I'm not wasting that I'm not wasting $40.

1504
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:16,240
Sure, sure. Fuck it, you can all wait another like three days put all the shipping for the

1505
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:20,080
radcon stuff on my card. So hopefully that'll amount to something I've even looked into it.

1506
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,640
But yeah, that was like almost three grand and shipping costs and material costs and all that

1507
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:31,120
shit. So you still you still waiting for that? I'm still waiting for the last chunk of $462.

1508
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:37,600
Okay, the rest the rest has been squared up. Thank God because that was a huge fucking thing

1509
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,320
because I had to put like all the posters and all the all the packaging materials and all the

1510
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:47,120
shipping. So like, there was like almost four grand worth of stuff on my card and I'd like max

1511
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:54,080
it out and I'm like, Oh, no, this is bad. So you got a higher limit than I do.

1512
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:59,520
Um, maybe my limits, my limits 3000.

1513
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,320
You know, I think I think mine is as well. I think some of that I think some of that stuff

1514
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,840
went through eBay. So that was just put directly to my bank and it's on all of it when I'm on the

1515
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:13,280
card. I was I was thinking about right. Okay, I was thinking like, Oh, maybe maybe that's because

1516
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:18,080
maybe that is because what you were saying before, like I have a high score, but my history is like

1517
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:23,120
small or whatever my my or whatever you were saying before about like amounts. I still have

1518
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,640
baby's first credit card. I think I don't think it's anything like fancy yours probably

1519
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:30,080
smacks mine. I just got the one through my bank because I wasn't thinking of using it at the time.

1520
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:38,400
Tom, you got to get you got to get everybody's got to get the city bank double cash card.

1521
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:44,080
Yeah, I've heard that recommended. There's some guys I went on Forbes.com. I went on

1522
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,320
Forbes.com and I read their article about the best credit cards in 2020 and this was the top

1523
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,760
of the list, but they were like, Oh, you got to have good credit to get it. And I went and applied.

1524
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,000
Got it. No problem. I couldn't even get the Amazon credit card. I was mad about that. Oh my

1525
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:03,120
God. Oh my God. It's good. It's not bad. So I was very surprised because it's like, Oh,

1526
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:11,280
that sucks. But whatever, I didn't save my $100 off my Amazon card, give you Amazon credit.

1527
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,560
Yeah, it gives you like, I think like three or 4% back on Amazon.

1528
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:21,840
Oh, yeah, something stupid like that. Okay, maybe I should maybe fuck the city bank double

1529
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,480
cash. Maybe you should get that instead. I'm sure that the fucking interest rates are through the

1530
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:32,000
roof. But I mean, I just just just don't have a problem with interest. So I just don't worry about

1531
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,960
that. Don't accrue interest and you'll be just pay your balance and it's fine. I mean, yeah,

1532
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:42,720
that's what I do. I don't I've never had any even not even the slightest tiniest temptation to ever

1533
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:48,160
attempt making a payment and not paying off the entire balance never never even entered my mind.

1534
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:56,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, like maybe if I was a kid, maybe if I was a kid, I had no and I had no money

1535
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:02,400
and I had gotten a credit card with like a $3,000, you know, credit credit limit as soon as you hit

1536
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,480
18 you start getting bombarded with those things they want you as soon as you're in college just

1537
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:10,400
like start partying off your credit card and then they fuck you literally for life. Yeah,

1538
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:15,360
because between like imagine racking up like 10 grand worth of credit card debt at 19 plus

1539
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:19,680
you're already like 30 to 40 grand in the whole for college like that's how you get wage slaves.

1540
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:26,400
God, I'll fucking mighty. God, I'll fucking mighty. Yeah, for sure. No, prop probably good.

1541
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:32,000
Probably good that I never got one when I was like, well, I don't know. I mean, I was never I was

1542
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,720
I was always pretty frugal. I would have looked at that $2,500 MacBook Pro maxed out and been like,

1543
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:47,280
yeah, it's for school. It's for school. Maybe, maybe based. But you know what?

1544
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:54,880
It's all good now. Now I got I got my new universal ring. I'm going to make it. I'm going to make it,

1545
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:05,200
baby. So I don't know anything else to say about that. No, money's gay, but find your money's gay,

1546
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:10,240
but I guess but I guess so am I. I guess I'll look into a credit card. I tried to do it before,

1547
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:15,040
but I was overwhelmed and I, are you are you also a debit card card? Yeah.

1548
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,080
Oh, don't be don't be like me. Don't wait until you're fucking one foot in the grave

1549
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:28,400
to start to start building credit. I told I told my I was talking to my other friend

1550
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:33,040
that I live with about this and he was like, yeah, yeah. No, when I was a kid,

1551
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,520
uh, me and my friend, he told a story. He said me and my friend, when we were kids,

1552
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,360
when we were in high school, we decided we wanted to start building credit.

1553
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:48,320
So we both got credit cards and we would buy one Twix bar a week with our credit cards.

1554
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:58,480
It's like 99 cents. I couldn't, I couldn't believe it. I, well, he doesn't, his credit

1555
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:03,760
card is not as good as well. No, he has, he, I mean, he has a pretty good card. So I guess it

1556
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,400
worked as fine. He's got one of the ones that's like, one of the ones that's got these weird

1557
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:13,440
thing that's like the year is divided into quarters and each quarter, a different like

1558
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:18,720
segment of things gives like a 5% cashback rate on, but everything else is like 1%. So it's like

1559
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:25,680
during January to March, it's like, you know, a theater and entertainment. And then the March

1560
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:31,840
to July, it's like, oh, travel and transit and gas and, and you know, whatever. So he's got one

1561
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:38,000
of those things. So yeah, I guess it worked out. Lemau. Churning. Try it out, kids. The younger

1562
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:44,640
you are, the sooner you should start churning. Are you paid for by JPMorgan Chase right now?

1563
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:51,680
Because that sounds like terrible advice. I'm paid for, I'm, I'm, I will be paid by JPMorgan

1564
01:28:51,680 --> 01:29:00,320
Chase when I fucking, when I churn their asses. Fuck yeah. It's like, yeah, I'll fucking, yeah,

1565
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:05,280
I'll fucking steal money from a bank. Like yeah, I'll fucking churn a bank and not feel bad about it.

1566
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,920
I mean, that's the game, that's the game that everybody's playing. You're just below the income

1567
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:16,560
threshold. You're not supposed to be letting the door. It's bullshit. Yeah. I don't know about,

1568
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:20,480
I don't know about like seven, I don't know about like seven grand in four months. I don't know if

1569
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:27,920
I can swing that one. No lower one. 500 in two months? Yeah, I think I can swing that.

1570
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:34,560
I can get that free $200. No problem. No problem at all, sir.

1571
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:44,080
Dab. Well, I want to keep talking about, I want to keep talking about credit cards because now

1572
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,360
they're my new thing this week, but we can, we can move on.

1573
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:54,880
Yeah. I don't even know. You can go to voicemails if, if, I mean, if we're all, if we're all ready.

1574
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:01,920
Yeah. I got a topic, but I don't know what it's the right thing to talk about.

1575
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,040
Bring it up. Bring it up. Bring it up. Bring it up. Bring it up. Bring it up. Bring it up. Bring it up.

1576
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:17,200
Come on, please. Come on. You can't just say that. Yeah. Well, I was thinking about like gender,

1577
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:25,440
right? It's, it's a thing that is. It's true. Debate. Debate. I was thinking about how gender is

1578
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:35,360
similar to language in that words can be lost to time and new words can come into the common

1579
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:43,840
vernacular and, you know, definitions of words can change in the same way that gendered things,

1580
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,400
things that are associated with being masculine or feminine can also change over time and be

1581
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:55,200
forgotten or rediscovered or new things can crop up. And I was just, yeah, I didn't really have much

1582
01:30:55,200 --> 01:31:00,800
else to say about it. I was just like, huh, you know, it is a language and that's, that's, that's

1583
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:06,240
interesting. I mean, you know, you know, the pink used to be a baby boy color. You know that?

1584
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:13,600
Listen, listen, as a cis male, nobody is more qualified to speak on the topic

1585
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:20,160
of gender than I am. So my, so let me, so my spicy take, my spicy take about gender,

1586
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,240
I don't even think it's that spicy. I've said it on Twitter and it didn't, didn't get a lot of push

1587
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:34,720
back is that that's what, what gender, gender is language, like to me, like what gender is,

1588
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:41,040
like gender just like being female, being female gendered to me does not then imply, oh,

1589
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:50,080
in that case, she her pronouns, please, to me, the pronouns are the gender, like that's what it means.

1590
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:56,400
So like it is a linguistic construct. It's not like, you know, it's associated with these things

1591
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:01,120
that make, you know, come in and out of fashion for a gender, like wearing pink, wearing a dress,

1592
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,880
wearing pants, suit and tie, whatever, short hair, long hair, blah, blah, blah.

1593
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,880
But you boil it right down, you know, you grind, grind the universe down to dust and sift through

1594
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,480
every atom and every, you'll not, you won't find one molecule of gender, right? Because it's just

1595
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:25,120
words. It's just like, it's, it's just whether you call someone a he or she or a they and, and,

1596
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:32,000
and that's why, that's why when someone is like, oh, read a biology textbook, oh, you got a,

1597
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,200
you got a dick or a pussy, you're like, you fool, you have missed, you have missed the thread,

1598
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:42,240
you've missed the forest for the trees, we're talking about language here, you oaf, get your mind

1599
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:46,560
out of the gutter, we're simply talking about the words we refer to a person with, that's what's,

1600
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:53,040
that's what's at issue. And that's why there's no like, even if you could empirically prove someone's

1601
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:58,400
gender, which you fucking can't, or sorry, like biological sex, which you fucking can't, because

1602
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:04,960
it's like so much more complicated than you think you rube. It wouldn't matter, because at the end

1603
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:10,880
of the day, it's about the words themselves. All that other stuff is subsumed. It's under, it's,

1604
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:16,320
it's, that's all, that's all secondary. As usual, a political conversation is, breaks down immediately

1605
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:21,280
due to different, uh, uh, understandings and definitions used by both sides of the argument.

1606
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,760
And so two people in an argument are arguing two completely different things using the same words.

1607
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:31,280
Yeah. And it doesn't work. What does. Gender really confuses people. They just can't separate it from

1608
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:38,080
biological sex. And they, they, they understand it to be a rigid thing and they can't imagine

1609
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,200
the gender could be. I mean, that's what you've been taught. Yeah.

1610
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:49,120
Yeah. What, what, what bugs me, what bugs me is like someone who's like that. So they'll, they'll,

1611
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:56,800
they say that they understand. Because like in theory, even if you don't want to grant that it's

1612
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:04,960
true, in theory, it's not hard to understand how like gender and biological sex could refer to

1613
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,040
two different things. Even if you don't grant that they do, it's not a hard concept to understand

1614
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:15,840
that they could. So they'll say like, yes, I understand that gender, like gender being different

1615
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:25,280
from sex, but then like if, if you grant that, and if you accept that as, as the case, like

1616
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:31,040
there is nothing, there's nothing more to argue about. Like there's simply no, there's simply no

1617
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:35,840
case then to say like, oh, but you have a penis. I don't think people or whatever. Like you've,

1618
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:40,320
you've already given, I think they just don't get that far. Well, they claim, they claim that they,

1619
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,920
sometimes they claim that, okay, I mean, there's the people that are like, oh, this is cultural

1620
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,400
Marxism. Oh, you've, you've changed the meaning of the word. Like, no, gender is the same thing.

1621
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:52,320
Like, okay, that's one category of person. But then there's another category of person

1622
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:58,320
that does like sort of pretend to grant that point, but then continue to defend their original

1623
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:05,280
position that implicitly does not grant it, which is, which is like doubly irritating.

1624
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,120
Yeah, it's like, I see what you're saying. Like, you have to, you have to, you have to

1625
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,680
deal with the, you have to deal with these two different people and two different,

1626
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,600
in two completely different ways. It's like someone saying, you know,

1627
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,720
I see what you're saying and subtitles doesn't see what they're saying.

1628
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:24,960
It's just that you just, you're just pretending to, to, to, you know, so that you can launch

1629
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,880
into your own thing about, by the way, I'm right. I'm smart.

1630
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:36,240
It's like, you like, you like pretend, you like pretend to grant the position, but then you

1631
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:42,000
argue as though you didn't grant it. And it's like you never granted it in the first place.

1632
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,200
Because like, if you, if you, if you, if the two people talking think that they agree on that,

1633
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:55,600
but then you say like, okay, it's like, okay, we agree. Gender and sex different. However,

1634
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,280
males have, men have a penis and women have a vagina and, you know, two plus two equals four.

1635
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,720
It's like, what do you, what is the other person supposed to do? It's like, no, but

1636
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:11,200
you, you just said, you just said something that should contradict that. And nevertheless,

1637
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,760
you have said the thing. You were supposed, we were supposed to be past this,

1638
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:20,320
but actually you, you like, you just snuck under the goalposts and like just went,

1639
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:24,080
went past me when I thought we were progressing in this other direction. I don't know.

1640
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:31,680
I've seen people do this before. Bad faith, bad faith argumentators, bad faith interlocutors

1641
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:39,520
abound. Yeah. And I curse them. I curse them. There was a guy, I argued with a guy

1642
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:44,720
on Twitter the other day, a dipshit who I have been seeing, like who I've been seeing,

1643
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:52,560
a lefty Twitter, like saying has been annoying them lately, a fem, femboy lover 69, a great,

1644
01:36:52,560 --> 01:37:00,240
a great man. And he is a real piece of shit and arguing with him is so infuriating because he

1645
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:06,480
literally, he doesn't even make arguments. He will, he will occasionally say, he will occasionally

1646
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:10,320
make a statement of fact or what he thinks is that he'll, he'll say something about the

1647
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:14,480
topic again. He was talking about communism. He was like, huh, communists are hypocrites

1648
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:19,120
if they use Teespring to sell T-shirts. Right. That's, this was his argument. It was like,

1649
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:24,000
cause, cause, cause Teespring is a company, is a privately owned company and therefore they

1650
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:30,240
shouldn't do it. And his contention was that, um, it's hypocritical because it's like, yeah, yeah.

1651
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,840
Like they're not forced to use Teespring. They could, you know, have a press in their home.

1652
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,960
They could screen print themselves. And it's like, the problem with this is like, okay,

1653
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:47,280
what you're actually arguing is that like screen printing or self pressing is better,

1654
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:53,360
which is probably true. But the conclusion you're pretending is like follows from this,

1655
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:59,520
is that therefore it's hypocritical to do it, which is, which is not, is not true.

1656
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,840
I think what he's trying to argue, I think what he's trying to argue is that you're,

1657
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:09,440
you don't believe in business or capitalism there, or there, but you're using a capitalistic,

1658
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:15,520
endeavor to get your product. Therefore you're supporting something you hate.

1659
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,960
And it's like, yes. And it's just like such a tired argument. It's like,

1660
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,080
are libertarians hypocrites for paying taxes? You know, it's just like,

1661
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:28,000
yeah, you can, you can believe something while being forced to like, we're all,

1662
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,800
we're all live in the system, you know, and we can, we can, you can believe something even

1663
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:39,920
if you can't practice it. This is like common. If he had said like, it would be better and more

1664
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:46,400
in line with communistic values to, you know, self-produce, I would say, yeah, probably, but

1665
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:50,080
you know, maybe they couldn't afford to press or like, you know, maybe like the quality of screen

1666
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:53,760
printing they weren't happy with, you know, maybe market than just like your local area.

1667
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,840
It's more convenient to be able to have people be able to purchase it themselves, you know.

1668
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,440
Yeah. Like there are, there are trade-offs, like there are trade-offs for this. And like,

1669
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:05,600
yeah, is it kind of unfortunate and maybe less than optimal that this is a privately owned company?

1670
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,440
Yeah, probably, probably they would like to own the means of production in this case.

1671
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:13,840
And I would agree with that. But that's not what he said. He said like, oh, they're hypocrites for

1672
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,320
doing it, which like, you're an idiot. And you know, arguing with him about this,

1673
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:23,680
the way he would argue is I would just like get to a point and like, we would get to the end of

1674
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:28,480
like a string of like back and forth. And I would like say something. And he would just say like,

1675
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:34,960
nah. And like, that would be it. That would, that would be like the terminating. He would terminate

1676
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:39,280
the cut with just like, nah. Or he in the middle of it, he would just be like, you've already

1677
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:45,680
been proven to be a liar. And I'd be like, where did I lie? I'm like, like, there's like nowhere

1678
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:50,800
anywhere here has there been a lie. But like, that's his he would just say like, he just call

1679
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:56,800
you a liar, call you a hypocrite, not like prove it or anything. But like, because he said it,

1680
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:04,640
like, I don't know. I don't know. This guy, this guy is like, oh, he's only been on Twitter

1681
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:10,640
a couple months. But he's like, he's such a prolific and vigorous bad faith argument maker

1682
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:16,640
that he's got like 15k followers of like, yes, of like, scrambling little like knuckle

1683
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:21,200
draggers who are just like, fucking hungry, who are hungry for the taste of boot leather.

1684
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:26,800
Is it just debate people on Twitter? And he's here to provide. He's here to provide, baby.

1685
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:34,880
That's all he does. I, he, I think he runs a blog too. I mean, I don't think he's like on

1686
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:39,440
YouTube or anything. I just don't. Doesn't don't you have anything better to do?

1687
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,320
I mean, this is working for me. It is. But it's just so sad.

1688
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:49,600
It's it's sad. And it makes me mad. Like that he's making bad arguments, just the fact that like,

1689
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,360
this is what you're going to choose to spend your limited amount of time doing.

1690
01:40:54,320 --> 01:41:01,680
I mean, I would imagine he's not that. I mean, any time, any time, any time spent on Twitter,

1691
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:05,840
you know, what is wasted? That much is true. The two weeks I was off Twitter were the two

1692
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:11,760
best weeks of like the last 12 months easily, just in terms of like, just mental clarity.

1693
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:20,960
He's he's probably a teenager or whatever. He's also he's also probably he's also probably

1694
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,240
like Armenian. You think? What makes you say that? Yes. Because

1695
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:32,080
there's a there's a I'm not I'm not the only one who's noticed it. And I'm not trying to be racist

1696
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:36,320
or anything. There's actually there's actually there's anecdotes. There's actually data. I've

1697
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:41,520
seen data. I've seen charts where like, oh, I don't know. I don't know what he looks like.

1698
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:48,720
But like, he reminds me of like, Glink, right? A little bit. Oh, there's there's a certain

1699
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:55,680
trend. There's a certain trend among white people. And like Armenians are like, they are Caucasians.

1700
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:58,800
So like, they are technically white people, even though they're like, you know, they have darker

1701
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:05,440
skin. But there is a trend where in like, the more like kind of the less white a white person looks,

1702
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:13,040
like the more like socially conservative they are. This is this is like true. And I know I'm and I

1703
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:18,240
know I'm being a little racist here. But like, I'm this is this is data driven. Why Armenian though?

1704
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:24,960
What do you mean by that? Oh, well, that's just an example of like, that's like, just a group of

1705
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:29,120
people who a group of people who are Caucasian, but who are like, have like kind of darker skin

1706
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,120
and sort of have the like, kind of Mediterranean look to them. I should probably like cite my sources

1707
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:45,280
on this so I don't come off as like a fucking weirdo. Am I am I late? I feel weird. That feels

1708
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:51,760
pretty weird. Does that feel weird? Should I cut this part? I'm not weird. I'm not talking about

1709
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:58,320
just like, I wouldn't just say that I wouldn't just say this because I like met some shitty Armenians

1710
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:04,480
that were dicks. Like, I'll admit, I'm not educated enough to know if you're bullshitting

1711
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:10,160
pulling this out of your ass or not. I'm as a neophyte. It sounds kind of strange.

1712
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:16,960
Does it sound weird? Oh, fuck, I'm racist. Oh, no, I horse, horseshoe theory is real.

1713
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:23,360
Horseshoe theory is real. I've proven it. Um, um, oh, I'm, I'm googling, I'm googling.

1714
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,120
Dark skin, white.

1715
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:42,320
European. The only, the only time I've heard, it's right next to Turkey. The only time I've

1716
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:49,680
heard of Armenia was knowing that Maddox was Armenian, I think, like his family was from there.

1717
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:58,560
Okay. Well, I found one that says, this is not the same, but I found a report from the

1718
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:03,760
Washington Post that says lighter skinned minorities are more likely to support Republicans,

1719
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:09,120
which is kind of the inverse. Well, not the, it's sort of the obverse of what I was saying.

1720
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:18,160
Oh no, I can't find it. I can't, I swear to God, I saw a graph. I swear to God, I saw data. I'm not

1721
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:23,200
just making this up. I'm scared now. I'm scared to release this. Did you get the orange drunk?

1722
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:30,960
Edit me out of this entire episode. And come up with a graph in your dreams. No. No. Dude,

1723
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:38,240
Pixar didn't happen, Ben. You know what? After the episode, I'm going to go look it up. I'm going

1724
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:44,000
to, I'm going to send Eleazar the graph and be like, show this on screen. Show this on screen

1725
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:51,440
right now. Prove it. I have proved that I have data and data means you're not racist. I don't know.

1726
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:59,840
Hey guys, Ben from the future here. I went and looked and I found it. I found this post about

1727
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:05,840
the study. The post says, and I quote, darker skinned whites measured via a light reflectant

1728
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:10,400
spectrophotometer identify more strongly with their white racial identity and are more likely to hold

1729
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:15,920
conservative political views on racialized issues and support Trump. So there you go.

1730
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:22,240
I'll try and find the graph. Eleazar, show the graph. I was kind of trying to be jokey about it.

1731
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:28,240
I don't know if it came off like I was making a joke. I am sorry. I apologize for the discomfort

1732
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:33,600
that you may be feeling that you may have felt about some of my less sensitive comments. I assure

1733
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:40,000
you my discomfort was much greater as I will be flops. You will hear me flop sweating and

1734
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:46,080
trying to fucking cope for the next several minutes of the podcast. So right back to it.

1735
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:55,680
You know what? He just, this guy's just like, he's just fervent. He's just fervent in a way

1736
01:45:56,640 --> 01:46:05,760
that makes me think, I don't know. He's, you know what? Never mind. He just reminds me of

1737
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:09,120
Glink. You know, literally he just reminds me of Glink. That's why, that's probably why I think

1738
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:20,880
he's Armenian. That's probably why. Okay, cool. Is Glink Armenian? Yes. Fuck, I think so. 99%.

1739
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:26,320
I'm like sweating. I'm like sweating that I've said something that I've said something that I've

1740
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:32,560
said something nasty. How about the, I can't hear you. How about those, how about those voicemails?

1741
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:40,000
How about, how about those voicemails? Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. There's a lot. There's a lot again.

1742
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:47,120
Oh shit. Oh God, I gotta pull them off. There's like 27. Speak pipes? No, 22. I forgot there's

1743
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:56,960
20 on page, on 25. All of them are going to be mad about me and Tom not listening to a lot of them.

1744
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:06,080
What's, are they? What's the first one? The first one that I see is from Blind Gable.

1745
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:14,880
Right? That's, uh, I don't know. I mean, what was the, the last one was left is

1746
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:20,320
him in my PC. Yeah, that's the last one. Okay. Then, then we should start with Blind Gay Boy.

1747
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:26,000
All right, let's, let's, let's do it. All right. Here we go. Here we go, baby. I'm ready.

1748
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:33,920
Three, two, one, go. infamous homeless woman, did you know once wrote a song called sad gay boy

1749
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:39,280
in which the titular sad gay boy goes to sleep at sunrise because quote, his weary,

1750
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:44,240
bleary eyes can't handle all the light. Do you want to be a sad gay boy? Of course not.

1751
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:49,280
So stare right into that burning colossus. Keep your cute little eye globes on that shit and get

1752
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:54,000
right up in its business. What do you think did you wear shades? Get out there and stare down the

1753
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:02,960
sun king. Whatever. The Procrastinator's podcast is not advocate staring directly into the sun

1754
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:08,480
without protective eyewear. We did, we did though. We, we, we, we did advocate for that.

1755
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:12,560
We were all twisted now that we're sober. Clearly not a good idea.

1756
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:16,480
No, you were twisted. I was swasted. All right. All right. And I don't remember

1757
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:26,320
anything of the sort. Cool. Cool. Jilted samurai. All right. Three, two, one, go.

1758
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:38,960
Konnichiwa. I am a leader of samurai orderlyness. Benno Sento san, you bring a great dishonor

1759
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:43,600
to summer. I know. I said a racist thing. I did races. I'm sorry. Jilted samurai. Ten

1760
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:54,880
no year, Sento san, but you never return to samurai clan. Why? Why? Instead of you, Benno

1761
01:48:54,880 --> 01:49:01,760
Sento san, join the enemy, Antifa clan. I'm sorry. Fuck all you. Sorry, man.

1762
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:10,160
Retro Benno san. But until you next time, sayonara. Sayonara. I couldn't, you know,

1763
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:14,400
they just had cool looking armor. I like their color scheme better. I like the red and black.

1764
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:19,840
It was edgy, for an edgy goth like myself. Sorry. I'm sorry. I deseed for a second.

1765
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:24,880
What happened? You listen to the next one. Oh, my, my former sensei is mad at me for

1766
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:31,440
joining Antifa. Don't, don't worry about it. Okay. He'll, he'll get over it. Okay. Next one.

1767
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:38,400
My wee wee is in the blender, daddy. Oh, I can't wait. Three, two, one, go.

1768
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:45,920
Yeah. What's up, guys? I just, I got a couple of things to say. First off, thank you to Nate.

1769
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:50,880
If not for your Radcon lecture, would have never read One Piece. It's become one of my favorite

1770
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:57,840
manga of all time. It's probably second to only Gunmul. You know, being in Australia, where, you

1771
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:03,760
know, bushfires straight into COVID, shitty year, but you really help, you know, One Piece really

1772
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:07,120
helped pick me up and I wanted to thank you for encouraging me to read it. Secondly,

1773
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:12,320
hope everything's going all right with Digi. Thirdly, last time Endless Jess was on,

1774
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:17,760
he was talking about how pro wrestling shitty now without crowds. I've been a pro wrestler for

1775
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:24,080
eight years now. I've worked in about six different countries. Just got to tell you right now, Jess,

1776
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:28,480
you're a fucking idiot. What the hell did you expect? Pro wrestling plays inherently to a

1777
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:33,040
crowd. That's our job. We're working for live reactions without the live crowd. Of course,

1778
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:36,240
it's not going to be a live reaction. What the fuck were you expecting? At the same time,

1779
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:40,400
I don't know why the fuck you're watching WWE if you want good quality of pro wrestling. It's

1780
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:46,960
fucking barely pro wrestling. And fourth and most importantly, Ben, go fuck yourself, buddy.

1781
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,680
All right, bye. Cool.

1782
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:51,840
The Australian pro wrestler cold end.

1783
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:57,440
I mean, shitting on Ben, totally understandable. Shitting on Jesse for agreeing with you,

1784
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,560
kind of strange.

1785
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,200
Wait, what did he say that Jesse said was stupid?

1786
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:05,760
Jesse said that remember when he was talking about how because of COVID,

1787
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:11,280
WWE, they're doing shows without crowds. And he said it was dumb. And we watched that like one

1788
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:15,040
clip on his MacBook where they were just like wrestling in an empty arena. And it was really

1789
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:20,080
fucking weird. Yeah. This guy said like, of course, it's dumb. What did you expect? You're an idiot,

1790
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:27,520
Jess. And it's like, what do you mean? But he's, yeah, okay. That's weird. Well, I don't fuck you,

1791
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:35,280
in the blender. I don't think I don't think Jesse's saying, oh, man, it's bad now was in any way

1792
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:40,960
him expressing surprise. I was more like saying, look how bad this is. I would send you to voice

1793
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:50,320
jail, but frankly, you're not worth the paperwork. All right, next one is from sunny.

1794
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:56,320
Three, two, one, go. Hello, everybody. I just got done doing one of my first well,

1795
01:51:56,320 --> 01:52:04,800
I'm going to call 100% completion runs of the shower. So I got a minute and 54 on a

1796
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:13,760
shampoo conditioner, face wash and body soap. I got sub two minute time using the conditioner

1797
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:17,520
because I use staying conditioner after I was in the shower. So I didn't need to rinse it out

1798
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:22,640
or worry about the time it takes for the conditioner to be in. So I'm wondering if anybody

1799
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:28,960
else is any more optimization of the speed run of the shower or this is like this is the kind

1800
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:35,840
of fastest we're going to get. It's the shower speed run thing. Yeah, I haven't I haven't tried it

1801
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:44,160
myself actually. I always like like using the shower as like a fucking like waterfall meditation

1802
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:55,120
zone. I stay in there for like 20 hours. It's true. It's true. Not me. I'm just fucking I'm in

1803
01:52:55,120 --> 01:53:01,840
and out. I'm in and out, rinse off, get it get it done. It's too it's too hot. It's too fucking

1804
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:09,120
hot to be showering these days. We just make it colder showers. No, that's that's terrible.

1805
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:15,840
No, no, no gets the job done. Yeah. Yeah, it's not it's not good though. I don't like it.

1806
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:22,080
No, no, very workman like actually I should be practicing my shower speed runs.

1807
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:24,480
But I don't want to stress about it.

1808
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:32,880
Like, oh, I don't I don't freak myself out. I'm gonna slip on some soap from from from overexertion.

1809
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:36,720
I would not speed run a shower just seems not worth it.

1810
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:42,960
That's like seems to dump a bucket over your head. I feel like the shower speed runs have like caught

1811
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:49,120
on like like like we get we get like a relatively high volume of voicemails pertaining to shower

1812
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:54,000
speed runs. It seems like something just autistic enough for our audience to latch on to.

1813
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:58,800
You know, like why don't you just like get some soap and some water and like a bucket and then

1814
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,800
just dump it over your head doing any percent completion run. That seems like the most optimal

1815
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:07,440
way to do it. Hmm. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed.

1816
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,040
Is someone try that and tell us what your time is? Yeah.

1817
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,360
All right. Next one is Oh God, it's a minute 30.

1818
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,240
Now you understand why we skip some of these.

1819
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:24,800
Spit out that red pill three, two, one, go.

1820
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:31,040
We can we can stop it if it's born democratization of the voicemails by playing literally every

1821
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:35,440
message that comes into the inbox. But when you don't screen for voicemails,

1822
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:39,200
occasionally some weird stuff's going to come through. For instance, the other week when a

1823
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:45,280
young man left a voicemail asking the Jewish question. Now I appreciate everyone on the

1824
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:54,000
pod attempts to argue against this question, but it was pretty clear that y'all were not

1825
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:01,520
ready or prepared for that discussion. Why would this just leaves, you know, wide open spaces

1826
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:06,160
for these far right talking points to be planted into the minds of your young and impressionable

1827
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:11,760
listeners, which we all know that you have plenty of in the future. I would simply suggest

1828
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:18,960
that whenever far right propaganda comes into your voicemail, you simply respond with this is

1829
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:24,960
far right propaganda, not based in facts and logic. We will not justify it with discussion here.

1830
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:30,880
For those of you who would like to see why this is simply not true, I suggest that you

1831
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:38,960
go to YouTube and search Vosh answers the Jewish question, and you will find Vosh systematically

1832
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:46,480
debunk and destroy this talking point with facts, evidence and logic. Thanks for all you do boys.

1833
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:59,600
Uh, keep it up. Fuck Nazis. Okay. Yeah, I forget exactly what the thing was, but yeah, I guess I

1834
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:03,680
don't I don't remember what the I do remember us talking about a couple weeks ago. I think I do

1835
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:08,080
remember us talking about the Jewish question. I don't remember what we said. I'm pretty. Yeah,

1836
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:17,040
it's true. It's true that like, uh, it's it is it is a far right talking point. Sure. I see he's

1837
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:23,920
got a point. I don't think it's I don't want to say I don't think it's a big deal, but I think the

1838
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:30,000
way we handle it pretty downplayed it pretty effectively. I mean, my my intent, my intent

1839
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:36,160
was to to to, uh, I mean, maybe I didn't, maybe I didn't do it as thoroughly as Vosh. I don't know.

1840
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:42,560
I haven't I haven't seen Vosh's Jewish question video, but, uh, my intent was to be like, oh,

1841
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:48,800
the Jewish question, here's why here's why it doesn't make any sense. I don't know. But he's got a

1842
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:56,880
point. This is far. This is far right propaganda is a pretty reasonable response to a lot of things.

1843
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:03,920
I will I will consider that in the future. Mr. Spit out, sir. Okay, next one.

1844
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:07,760
Plan B. Three, two, one, go.

1845
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:13,520
So I haven't listened to the podcast in a long while. I haven't since I think around

1846
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:20,000
episode 101, 102. I got a job around then and, um, haven't had any time to listen to podcasts.

1847
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:27,040
But now I've been thrown back into need them because of COVID. So I figured what better way to

1848
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,160
waste time than listening to the podcast. It's the best. The only one I've listened to so far

1849
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:36,880
is Ben cast episode. Yeah, good choice. I think it's really cool that you guys have this voicemail

1850
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:43,840
thing now. But I did want to say that a lot of the people that I've heard sound like pathetic

1851
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:48,960
beta males with no girlfriend. And I just want to say, imagine how many less there would be

1852
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:56,320
if we bullied them early and often, like they kill themselves. So no, I think,

1853
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:02,400
or maybe I, what I was assuming is that if we bullied them, what he was saying,

1854
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:07,600
that they would stop being those things. What does he mean we? What does he mean we?

1855
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:14,160
Like we as a society? I guess. I feel like being bullied is where they come from.

1856
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:20,880
Yeah. I mean, I don't know how seriously, I don't know how seriously to take this question.

1857
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:28,560
Yeah, like, like, I think people, yeah, people become you, you, you, someone who is quote unquote

1858
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:36,720
a beta male feels like socially uncomfortable because they're not accepted into society.

1859
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:41,440
Right. Um, yeah, you're not, you're not conforming to a certain extent,

1860
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:47,600
yeah, certain social expectations. You're given guff for that by the people around you.

1861
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:53,760
And most people crumble under that pressure and further recede into these shadows of society.

1862
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:59,200
And don't ever develop interpersonal skills that allow them to flourish in a more, uh,

1863
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:07,840
conventional manner. So I feel like bullying people would bring the 1% 1 to 2% of people who

1864
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:13,440
kind of like take that as a challenge and rise above it and make them stronger at the extent of

1865
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:17,840
to the damage of the 98% remaining who would just be upset by it.

1866
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:25,280
Uh, I, yep. It sounded like it actually sounded like a like a comedic sort of like,

1867
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:30,320
you know, I agree. I think he was going for it, but I'm not laughing. So I have no choice,

1868
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:35,600
but to respond as though it were meant 100% sincerely. You just, you just can't tell us

1869
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:41,120
sometimes. Yeah. That's just the society we live in now. What's a joke and what isn't?

1870
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:48,000
Who knows? It's a social construct. It's hard to know what it's a joke when the entire world's

1871
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:58,000
become one. Next one is Callum. Three, two, one, go. Hey, so it doesn't seem fair to me that all

1872
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:05,040
of the PCP members get to go to this $30,000 Radcon event, even though some of these members

1873
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:10,320
only show up for like four episodes a year. It just doesn't, doesn't seem that fair to me.

1874
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:22,560
What do you think? Well, the Radcon four, I think I'm trying to think like what exactly

1875
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:30,480
he's referring to, like me, Nate, Ben, Tom are the most frequent, I think on the podcast.

1876
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:38,400
Yeah. He's probably talking, I mean, Digi is, I mean, I wouldn't say he's on, I mean, he hasn't,

1877
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:46,480
sorry, she hasn't been on in a while. But like before, like she has periods where she's on pretty

1878
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:54,720
regularly. Yeah. So maybe, I think he's talking about, maybe Digi and definitely Jesse. I mean,

1879
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:59,840
Jesse wasn't planning on being there. Yeah. That was like, that was a bonus. You know,

1880
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:03,920
he had nothing to do with like any of the money or the payments he drove up there by himself,

1881
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:09,520
completely separate from all of us. So Jesse's just a bonus. Like that was just icing on top of

1882
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:19,280
the Radcon cake. Yeah. I think the thing that's like, the podcast is, you know, the show we do

1883
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:26,000
together, but it's not the reason we have become popular enough to get a Radcon made. It's because

1884
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:30,800
individually we've done good things. So like Digi being allowed to come is like, of course,

1885
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:36,080
right. Like people were paid to see Digi hang out with us. We're doing better work outside

1886
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:41,680
of the podcast. And even in this channel itself, the Radcon content is the tentpole stuff. And

1887
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:46,880
this is just the glue sticking the Radcons together. Like, I don't think anybody would deny that.

1888
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:51,200
I would definitely like it if the others showed up more because I like talking to them.

1889
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:59,680
Yeah. Yeah, where is everybody? I don't know whether it would be like any grounds to exclude

1890
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:07,440
anyone from a new Radcon if they wanted to come. Right. I mean, if Digi did a ton of like,

1891
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:12,160
of the reward stuff leading up to Radcon and a lot of the promotion. So like, you know,

1892
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:20,880
the regard. Like, like, yeah, Jesse was only like kind of involved because he didn't really do

1893
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:27,120
any of like the prep work or like the other stuff associated. He was just kind of there for it. And

1894
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:32,400
like we, you know, took we took that into account and everything. But like, yeah, Digi like helped.

1895
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:37,600
Digi was helping with like, yeah, like, you know, looking for a house and all this stuff. And like,

1896
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:44,400
you know, we were, we were like, yeah, maybe we don't all we all show up to the podcast as much as

1897
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:49,760
one another equivalently. But like, we all we all chipped in and like, we're working on like,

1898
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:54,000
making Radcon itself happen. So like, it was it was a collaborative effort among all. I mean,

1899
02:02:54,560 --> 02:03:00,320
I feel it was pretty fair. Not only that, the episode participation is all paid separately.

1900
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:04,800
And so you're already getting paid for your appearances on the episode or lack thereof.

1901
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:09,760
If you do not come to the, the procrastinators podcast, you don't get paid for the episodes that

1902
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:17,520
are made through the Patreon. You don't get nothing. So if you use her up for zero episodes a month,

1903
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:23,520
you get $0 for that month. So I feel like that, that calculation is already taken care of

1904
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:32,880
pre Radcon itself. Agreed. We got a system. It's convoluted and dumb. It's very convoluted. I

1905
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:37,680
was looking through the spreadsheet the other day and I like could not fucking. Well, the spreadsheet

1906
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:43,360
was made by Nate and you can tell. I think it's just got some like, I think there's just kind

1907
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:47,680
of some like random crap in there that's like not even like really data. It's just sort of numbers

1908
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:52,880
in cells that don't relate to any of anything else. He has like notes for himself on the spreadsheet

1909
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:58,160
that does the calculation. So there are some like extra fields. And I know it also has to handle

1910
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:02,400
the other channels attached to that Google account. So there's some extraneous information

1911
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:08,320
besides the PCP numbers themselves, they have to be calculated. So, you know, because, because

1912
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:13,600
you're only allowed one AdSense thing per Google account. And so it's really annoying the way that

1913
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:22,720
all works. It's, it's, it's, it's YouTube being terrible as, as it is. So yeah, makes sense.

1914
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:30,560
Next one, productivity tips. All right, I'm game. Three, two, one, go.

1915
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:37,680
Okay, tips to the PCP members here on productivity. If any of you ever feel like you're not being

1916
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:42,800
productive enough, send a voicemail into this show, this PCP show, it'll really get you going.

1917
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:48,000
Trust me on that one. Okay, goodbye. No, do not listen to this man.

1918
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,440
We'll never know, though, whether he was telling the truth. He could have gone and made

1919
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,560
the Mona Lisa too, right after this.

1920
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,600
Imagine a sequel to the Mona Lisa.

1921
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:06,160
I've never made it. Never. It was made on YouTube and MS Paint.

1922
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,360
Oh yeah, we did that. Is that a reference to something?

1923
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:14,160
What? Didn't, didn't we do that for a draw cast?

1924
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:19,440
Like MS Paint drawings and some one of, I think I did MS Paint drawings.

1925
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:23,440
We did. I was talking about the guy who did like the remade the Mona Lisa in MS Paint on YouTube in

1926
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:28,720
like 2006. Is it good? It's like pixel for pixel, like exact copy.

1927
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:33,920
Wow. Yeah, it's one of those videos. Pixel for pixel isn't that interesting.

1928
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:37,600
What if he just literally took a picture of it and copied the pixels? Well, no, it's a speed

1929
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:41,280
draw of him doing it with the MS Paint tools recreating the Mona Lisa.

1930
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:46,080
Yeah, okay. It's impressive. It's impressive. It's one of those things.

1931
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:53,280
Oh God, this next, this next one. No, voice jail. Let's wait.

1932
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:58,320
He, no, that's what he wants. He wants to go to voice jail. He's, he's baiting us.

1933
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:02,320
All right, then we'll just skip it. I'm tempted to skip it. Let's yeah.

1934
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:05,600
Stop telling us, stop telling us about Persona 5.

1935
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:13,360
Okay, next one. Consume product. Here's why. HBO Max Rupa.

1936
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:18,960
Okay, I'll give this guy one more chance. Three, two, one, go.

1937
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:24,880
Tom mentioned that streaming services are like bringing back cable, but actually it's kind of

1938
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:31,760
not true. Like kind of true, but kind of not true. Here's why. Okay. So like on cable, you know,

1939
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:38,640
it's only on your TV pretty much. And you get, you like, this show is on Tuesday at whatever

1940
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:43,600
time. And this show is that, you know, you got, you got to like be at the TV at certain times.

1941
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:47,440
No more of that shit. You know, streaming services, you can just turn it on

1942
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:51,840
and watch whatever the fuck you want and watch it whenever the fuck you want, bro.

1943
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:58,720
And there's like significantly less ads, which is great, bro. Like, come on. And also they're

1944
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:04,000
like way cheaper than cable. Like isn't cable like, I don't know, like 40 or something a month

1945
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,560
or whatever. I don't even know how many, maybe I'm actually wrong about this point, but like

1946
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:13,200
streaming services are generally like, I don't think there is a streaming service that is more

1947
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:18,640
than 20 months. Like, bro, they're pretty cheap. And you get so much bang for your buck and you

1948
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:24,320
might be like, why buy things? Well, you feel better about it. You stupid dummy, bro. You know,

1949
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:30,400
like, you work to get money and then you spend the money on things and you feel better than if

1950
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:37,440
you pirated it. You feel better than if you pirated it. No, I feel better when I pirated it.

1951
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:41,920
Give me a fucking break. In any case, pirating is illegal. Don't do it,

1952
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:50,480
bros. Is this a joke? It has to be a joke. You had me go in there for a minute, buddy.

1953
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:54,800
I stopped right before the end. What did he say? He was saying piracy is bad,

1954
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:57,760
don't do it. It's illegal. And you'll feel better if you pay for the thing.

1955
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:04,800
All right. No, he had me going for the first half. No, yeah, that's definitely bait.

1956
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:13,280
Nice ruse. Nice ruse, my dude. Impossible. Hilarious. Next one is anti-piracy on streaming

1957
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:19,600
services. The next four are about streaming. Okay, whatever. Three, two, one. It's the same guy.

1958
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:25,760
Probably. Three, two, one, go. So you also mentioned ripping a show from a streaming

1959
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:30,320
service and then putting it on a torrent or pirate or whatever. I don't think it's possible to do

1960
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:36,480
that anymore because they've done this thing where if you even just take a screenshot or a screen

1961
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:41,120
record, the screen will turn black, at least for HBO Max. I don't know about other things.

1962
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:45,520
I don't care. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. I'm not reading. I don't care,

1963
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:51,680
but I'm skipping the next one too. Fuck it. We're moving on to Digibro's pretentious explanation.

1964
02:08:51,680 --> 02:09:00,720
Yes. Yes. Ready? Three, two, one, go. Let me explain to you the point of my previous voicemail.

1965
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:06,480
You see, Digi, like six years ago or some shit made a video about the wind rises and it's like

1966
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:13,280
quick analysis or whatever and it's like four or five minutes and like almost all of it is pretentious

1967
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:22,000
bullshit. And then recently, separately in the PCP, he has like said that like people are stupid

1968
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:28,640
on voicemails or whatever, but like, he's so pretentious, bro. What the fuck? That's the

1969
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:34,800
theme. That's the point of the voicemail. You just didn't connect the dots. That sucked. Fuck you.

1970
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:39,120
Fuck off, Digibro, is pretentious guy. You are a fucking mutant. Do you understand why I skip

1971
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:44,960
voicemails now? Are you getting it? Oh my god. This is just so bad. It's the same voicemail again.

1972
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:51,280
Shut the fuck up. It was entirely just as stupid as before, but I think you had a complete

1973
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:56,640
garbage. I don't know. I feel like voice jail's too good for this fucking monster. No, no, no, no, no,

1974
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:01,280
Voice jail has kind of become a meme. It's a badge of honor now. It's been undone.

1975
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:07,280
Voice jail has become a mark of privilege. Yeah, oh god, fuck. Three square meals a day,

1976
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:13,440
all your needs taken care of. I'd kill to be in voice jail right now. All right, voice bad credit,

1977
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:20,400
how about that? Yeah, they'll never be able to churn as long as they would. Voice churnless

1978
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:29,680
status churnless. Okay. Unchurnable. Okay, I've calmed down. I've calmed down. Next one is

1979
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:38,240
remember the grinding religion? I do. Three, two, one, go. That one guy mentioned getting into

1980
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:45,280
the PCP when he was 11. I just wanted to talk about how I got into the PCP. It was episode,

1981
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:50,800
I think it's 107 religion. It was really great. And you might be wondering, what is the fucking

1982
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:56,080
point of this voice? What is the point of voice? The point is grind jealousism. You got to grind,

1983
02:10:56,080 --> 02:11:00,400
and then that's the amount of time you get in the afterlife. That was the religion that you guys made

1984
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:07,760
up for that episode. And you never brought it up again. And I want you to bring it back. Grind

1985
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:14,000
jealousism is so base, bro. Grind jealousism. I don't remember this at all. Like a religion about

1986
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:21,520
grinding as it is. Like on a skateboard? Yeah. No, like grinding, like getting worked on, I thought.

1987
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:27,840
I choose to believe that it means the more time you spend grinding on rails on your fucking

1988
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:32,640
skateboard is the more time you spend in heaven. You know what? That's even better. I'll tell you.

1989
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:39,680
You got to get a streak go. It's a life as a Tony Hawk level, and there's a time limit,

1990
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:45,680
and you've got to get a certain score to get into heaven. You got to be God's gift to grind.

1991
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:54,160
You got to be chaining. Everywhere you go in life, you got to be chaining your moves,

1992
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:59,760
you got to be aerialing, you got to be manualing from rail to rail. It's the only way.

1993
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:13,360
It was the same guy that we were just saying the same thing.

1994
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:20,400
It was the same guy, I guess. I think it was. Okay, it cancels out. No,

1995
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:28,960
fuck it. Okay, okay. I feel like you're more entertained by your grinding explanation. You

1996
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:36,720
are about the voicemail itself. Yeah, you're right. Okay. Okay.

1997
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:49,920
All right, guys. Next voicemail. God, this is another, this is another sequel voicemail. It's

1998
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:53,840
the guy that said like vocals are instrumentals. No, I don't care. Yes, of course they're

1999
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:58,400
instrumental. Shut up. Yeah, thanks for your voicemail. Love you. Thanks for watching.

2000
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:05,440
Thanks for the ad revenue. Fuck off. No more. Next one. Slime Caves background music from Ben's

2001
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:11,920
Dream. Holy shit. I'm stoked for this one. I am fucking, I am ready. Are you ready?

2002
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:16,000
It's zero seconds. Do we have to copy the link? Yeah, I'm gonna copy the link. All right, just

2003
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:24,320
gonna do that. To vocaru. Oh, good old vocaru. Wait, I think he doesn't realize that the link

2004
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:32,880
he sent does not link to his recording. Oh, no, it doesn't work. Bruh. This is just that I have

2005
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:37,200
to press record and this is my own thing. This is not what he thinks it is. Oh,

2006
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:41,280
Bruh, your LinkedIn work. Bruh, you gotta send it again. I gotta know the background music to

2007
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:48,880
my slime cave dream. What if it's gone forever? Send it to Twitter? Oh, no. You must have saved

2008
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:59,200
somewhere. Well, I mean, call again, call again, try again. I want to hear it. Next one. Digimon

2009
02:13:59,200 --> 02:14:06,400
God. Sounds sick. I'm in. Three, two, one, go. Digivices are Kino and the guy that recommended

2010
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:10,320
them as a genius. I didn't know Wave 3 was out, but thanks dude for letting me know.

2011
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:15,360
You all need to get a Digivice. You all need to go to Radcon 5 and start your Digivices at the same

2012
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:19,360
time. You all get eggs at the same time. And then at the end of the week, whoever has the best

2013
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:24,720
Digimon is king. Oh my God, this thing needs to happen. This needs to be one of the main events

2014
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:29,680
of Radcon 5. I want to see a Digimon battle. The battle system is deep. It's not just, oh, it's

2015
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:35,280
a little toy. No, there's vaccine, virus, data types. There's like fucking, there's an element

2016
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:40,880
wheel. There's a fucking, how much you love your Digimon impacts its power. How much you feed your

2017
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:45,280
Digimon impacts its power. It's true. There's so much fucking strategy. There's fucking tag

2018
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:51,520
battles. There's fucking tag team 2v2 Digimon battles in this fucking little key chain toy.

2019
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:57,040
Pokemon is shit. Digimon is Kino. Do Digimon for real. Don't let this idea fade away.

2020
02:14:57,680 --> 02:15:03,280
You know what? I'm totally, I'm totally with you. I'm totally down. Yes. I'm ready to go.

2021
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:10,400
Really? Yeah. I have the first revision. I got it for my sister for Christmas and

2022
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:15,680
December. We got to get, we got to get the newest, like for the next Radcon, for this tournament,

2023
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:18,880
we got to get the new ones, right? Well, who knows what gen they'll be on by the time

2024
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:24,480
Radcon 5 rolls around, but okay. It'll be pretty funny to like have in the background of like,

2025
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:30,400
I don't know, you know, it was a live stream. We got the webcam and like four out of the five

2026
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:35,040
people on screen are like clicking their little Digimon things. No, I got to have all of my

2027
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:40,560
Kabuteremon just took a little poop and I got to clean it up. I'm sorry. I can't, I can't join you.

2028
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:44,720
Yeah. I got to feed, I got to clean it up and then feed it back to him.

2029
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:51,840
Fuck. Wasn't that a thing, wasn't that a thing you could do with the, could you like try and

2030
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:56,240
like tell it to eat its own shit or something? Am I like crazy? You're definitely make a matter.

2031
02:15:56,880 --> 02:16:02,000
Could you like, or could you like, like point to it shit or something to like shame it or

2032
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,920
something like that? I feel like there was something you could do, like when your Digimon

2033
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:10,800
had shit, when you could like do something with the shit that like the Digimon would be like

2034
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:15,840
sad. You might be thinking of like Digimon World, the PlayStation. I don't think that was on the

2035
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:22,880
pets, on the V pets. Hmm. I don't think I ever played that. I don't know. Do you? I don't know.

2036
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:26,320
I just want to play with Digimon shit. That's what I, that's what I want. I mean, it's pretty good.

2037
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:33,680
It's good time. Next one. Genderbender. Three, two, one, go.

2038
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:39,600
I thought I would change things up and actually ask a question with this, you know, voicemail.

2039
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:44,960
So stupid. If you guys turned into a hot girl tomorrow, how much of a slut would you be?

2040
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:53,840
Um, I would, uh, I mean, with girls, probably a lot. I would be, I would be a lesbian

2041
02:16:53,840 --> 02:17:00,160
and I would make out with girls. I would, I would, uh, uh, uh, yeah, I guess I would,

2042
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:04,400
I'd have the same answer. I don't know. I would probably be quite a bit. Yeah,

2043
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:07,920
I'd probably be quite a bit of a slut. I'd probably try and like find that balance where

2044
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:11,120
you're not like too much of a slut, but you're still making money. Like I'd probably be this

2045
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:18,640
Twitch streamer. Yeah, that's what I was going to say. No. No, you fools. That's not what the

2046
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:22,960
question's about. All right. Well, if I was a woman, that's what I'd probably do. I'd probably

2047
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:27,680
cash that check. He's okay. He's not asking how would you monetize it? He's asking like,

2048
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:31,440
he's asking like, would you, he's asking like, would you, okay, he wants to know if you'd

2049
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:37,360
fuck. He wants to know if you'd fuck. Well, what I'm trying to, yeah, yeah, yeah. I, like, if,

2050
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:41,200
if it suddenly happened, I don't like, I would still be the same person underneath.

2051
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:46,080
I don't know how to like immediately get laid. I would just be like, I don't know,

2052
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:51,280
I'll stay inside instantaneous thing. But if you were, if you were a hot, if you were a hot girl,

2053
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:54,960
it would be pretty easy. Well, I know it'd be pretty easy, but like, like, I don't know,

2054
02:17:54,960 --> 02:18:00,880
like what to do. The only thing I know to do is to be online. So I would start a Twitch stream

2055
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:05,680
and see what happens. I mean, well, I mean, during COVID, yeah. I mean, if I were a hot girl,

2056
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:11,120
it'd be hard for everybody at this point. Yeah. If I were a hot girl and I wanted to have some

2057
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:17,920
lesbian sex, I mean, I don't know, I would just go to like a bar or something and just like be,

2058
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:22,320
oh, but then guys would be hitting on me and I'd be close. You gotta, you gotta get on like

2059
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:28,640
Tinder girls only and then just swipe and because you're attractive, you'll, you'll get all the

2060
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:35,440
matches because it works. Yeah, maybe that would be, I mean, you're already a Tinder champion.

2061
02:18:35,440 --> 02:18:41,120
You can just use all your pro strats. This is, this is making me, this is making me understand

2062
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:45,760
even just this, this easiest, simplest little thought experiment. I feel like I understand

2063
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:49,440
the female experience a little bit better. Like, yeah, I wouldn't want to go, I wouldn't want to

2064
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:53,600
go like out to like a club or something. Cause like, yeah, I'd be guys would be hitting on me

2065
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:58,160
and I'm like, I'm not interested in them. Like I don't, I don't want them. Like they'd, like,

2066
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:03,520
there's a chance that like a girl would hit on me, but probably not because girls are not used to

2067
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:08,320
being like aggressive like that. So it would just, it would just be guys hitting. I would have to go

2068
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:13,120
out and put in the effort. I would have to go out. God, it would be, it would be the same as being

2069
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:17,440
a man. I just have to go out and hit on the girl. I'd have to take matters into my own hands and I

2070
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:21,600
hate that. I don't want to do that. That's dumb. What, what's even the point? What's even the point

2071
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:26,480
of being a girl? If I, if I have to go and fucking put the work in. Making lots of money from Beta

2072
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:29,920
Man. That's literally the point. The point of being, the point of being a girl is that you don't

2073
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:34,480
have to put the work in without that. It's worthless. That's why you got to start a Twitch stream,

2074
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:39,840
keep all of them at state or more away from you and collect all of their money. I don't care

2075
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:45,040
about money. Well, I mean, how much are we talking? Uh, hundreds of thousands of dollars, Ben, easily.

2076
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:54,640
Okay. Hundreds of thousands. Yeah. In like a year? If not millions. Yes. A lot of these streamers

2077
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:59,520
make hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, Ben. Look it up. It's really okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

2078
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:06,880
Okay. Okay. But you can't just be any hot girl and make that much. Yes, you can. No, not any hot girl

2079
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:10,640
can just make that much. Have you seen some of these people on Twitch? They have nothing going

2080
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:16,160
for them. But it's not, okay. Personality wise or, or presentation wise. I, I, I understand that you

2081
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:21,520
can be. They just sit there with a shirt unbuttoned and just read the chat. I understand. I understand

2082
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:26,800
that you can be nothing but a hot girl and make that much money. Okay. But that's not to say that

2083
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:31,680
literally any girl that is hot can just hop on Twitch. No, but make that and make that money.

2084
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:36,000
You're already, you're already making money as a man, as an entertainer. You think you put some

2085
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:40,160
tits on you and an attractive face. You're not going to like droople your income. Oh, wait, wait,

2086
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:45,280
wait, wait, wait, wait. You're not saying like start a new account or like start a new like face

2087
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:50,880
with a new name. It's like start a new identity as a female titty streamer. You're saying, hey guys,

2088
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:55,840
I'm still Tom Oliver, but now I've got tits and I want you to pay for me. No, no, no, no. I'm saying

2089
02:20:55,840 --> 02:21:01,200
you would start a new thing, but I'm saying because you're not, you're not just like an empty

2090
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:08,240
husk of a human with some tits. You're still you and like your entire job is to be an entertainer.

2091
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:12,720
So if you're an entertainer and you have all that experience being an entertainer, but now

2092
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:18,720
you have the benefit of being an attractive woman on the internet, you're now playing with a stacked

2093
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:25,600
deck. You have a huge advantage. I'm going to level with you, Tom. I don't feel like I have an

2094
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:30,880
advantage. I feel like I would, I feel like I would in fact be starting over from zero.

2095
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:35,520
You don't think that everything being equal, if you were a woman, you'd be making more money

2096
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:42,640
than you are right now? That's not, I might. No, that's, that's, that might be true. That might

2097
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:47,200
be true. That might be true. That is a fact. That is a fact. Okay. You might be right about that,

2098
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:51,760
but that's not what I'm saying. That's not one zero at least to your patron. But that's not what

2099
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:56,800
I'm saying. Yes, true. But that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that if I were to

2100
02:21:56,800 --> 02:22:02,400
be a hot girl and, but start from scratch on like a new account with no preexisting clout,

2101
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:08,400
I do not think that my experience as a podcaster or like online content creator or whatever,

2102
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:14,480
I do not think that that would factor particularly heavily into like whether or not I make it in

2103
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:20,640
like the Twitch titty streaming game, the only fans game. I think I don't think it translates.

2104
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:26,720
I think it does. But I guess one of us is going to have to take the plunge and find out.

2105
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:32,800
Okay. Yeah, that's true. Voice mail, just work your magic, gender bend one of us for science.

2106
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:38,560
I guess we'll just have to find out the hard way. Yes, please and thank you.

2107
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:48,960
Next one? Yep, I guess so. Okay. Next one is another one from Margar. More Margar please.

2108
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:59,680
Three, two, one, go. Margar here. I'm on week two in voice jail. I'm fighting for my fucking life

2109
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:08,480
in here. Ben St. I repeat Ben St. is sending swarms of fucking goons to my cell every hour

2110
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:15,600
on the hour. I'm just barely cleaning on. Luckily, all of his goons are pretty weak.

2111
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:21,120
So I'm being able to hold them off but the sheer mass of the bodies that Ben is sending

2112
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:28,240
against me is getting on my nerves and I'm pretty fucked up right now. We need to abolish the

2113
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:34,720
police state immediately. Please. Also congrats on getting the channel restored. Thanks. I don't

2114
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:40,560
know. It kind of sounds like the police state's doing its job, which is to like go in droves after

2115
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:46,640
his enemies and be defeated. Go in droves after his enemies who have already been locked up,

2116
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:52,560
just to bully him a little, to rough him up. We already won but we want to give ourselves

2117
02:23:52,560 --> 02:24:01,200
an opportunity to lose again. He's in jail and I'm just sending like platoons of soldiers

2118
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:07,280
into his cell where he is. Ben just feels so guilty. He has to send these cops in to get

2119
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:15,600
abused so he can like feel better for supporting the police state. Yeah, you run like the police

2120
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:19,520
but you make sure that they're badly trained and ill-equipped and you send them into war.

2121
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:25,040
He's like the ultimate sleeper agent. He's like in the cell but he's like,

2122
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:30,080
he still represents a threat to democracy. Like open fire. We can't let him get away.

2123
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:36,960
He's just sitting there. I don't know. I don't know how it works. I'm not sure. But I like it.

2124
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:40,640
Hey, Marguer. We're going to get you. We're going to get you one of these days.

2125
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:50,480
All right. Next one. British people talking about African drums. That's me. Three, two, one, go.

2126
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:59,760
Wait, is that a bongo in it? Quit sava and a bongo in it? That's not how we speak.

2127
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:06,400
I didn't hear it too quick. I heard bongo. I got a bongo. One more time. Well, I don't have a bongo.

2128
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:11,280
There's a bongo in my basement. It belongs to my neighbor. It's a pair of bongos.

2129
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:14,240
They always come in pairs. I'm going to listen one more time.

2130
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:24,400
I think he's saying, well, it's a bit of a bongo in it, which I don't know. That's what sounds like to

2131
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:32,960
me too. Is it a bit of a bongo? I mean, I've never heard the phrase bongo to be used as any sort of

2132
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:39,680
descriptive word. No, it just sounds like a silly, like, like a, like a little so random sort of thing.

2133
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:43,760
I don't think that's a British thing. This guy's stupid. I think I don't even think this guy's

2134
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:54,240
really British. Sad. Okay, next one. Sefirio creative shipping. Three, two, one, go.

2135
02:25:54,640 --> 02:26:04,240
All right. Favorite creative ship. So we've got like Digi Munch with stealing your dad as if it were

2136
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:12,640
easy. I like that a lot of energy there. But like, what are your favorites? Best hypotheticals?

2137
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:24,640
I know Tom and take the Gibbon take Tom Oliver combo on the PCP itself is just chef kiss.

2138
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:35,440
But what are your opinions on best creative shipping? Okay, the challenge here is in which

2139
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:46,560
one makes the funniest name. So fuck. I mean, nothing can top Digi Curious. It was the original.

2140
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:51,360
It was the best. Like, it'll never be beaten. Yeah, true.

2141
02:26:56,240 --> 02:27:05,040
What about what about endless Nate? Pretty good, right? What about what about best St.

2142
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:13,040
Ever really get some get some really good content? What about what about what about

2143
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:22,240
mage chi chi mage chi like Munchie mage. Oh, mage chi. Yeah. What about

2144
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:30,240
Gibbon? Tom, fuck, he already he already said that one, but reversed. What about Gibbon?

2145
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:41,520
Naye. Gibbon a because digi name. What about what about the let's go through every possible

2146
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:47,600
permutation. No, it's gonna make a make a spreadsheet. No, we have to go one down the list. Okay.

2147
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,360
Voice jail voice jail voice jail everything can voice jail. I don't know. I don't think it's a

2148
02:27:55,680 --> 02:28:02,480
I think it's a judge jail. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm sorry guys. Come up with good ship

2149
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:09,200
names in in the comments. Yeah, put your best comments since we have agreed. Because I feel

2150
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:13,280
like there probably are some funny ones, but I can't think about this right now. I'm working here.

2151
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:22,720
Last one, friendly friend man Liam. Let's hear what he's got to say. Three, two, one, go.

2152
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:27,760
Howdy there. Whoever may or may not be listening. It is I the mighty.

2153
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:37,920
I'm fucking tired. Very, very exhaustive. Nobody probably apologies.

2154
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:48,560
Can you wasted 20 seconds 20 seconds of our lives. I like what you are. You are a society living

2155
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:56,000
clowns are doing here this podcast thing. I like it. It's cool. We're being trolled.

2156
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,800
We're being trolled. Oh, God. Myself seems positive. Shit's bad.

2157
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:04,400
Kippo's cool. Ben's pretty cool.

2158
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:10,160
Munchie's pretty cool. You're all pretty cool. Voice jail voice jail. I don't know if Nate started

2159
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:13,760
to shove yet, but Nate's pretty cool. Or yeah, now definitely.

2160
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:23,360
You know, I can't feel my legs. Apologies. I've been up for like three days at this point.

2161
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:31,760
Nerds have a wonderful, wonderful time. That was the worst voicemail I've ever heard.

2162
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:38,320
It's as close as you can get to a drunk voicemail without him being drunk. I think he's just really

2163
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:42,560
tired. You're sleep drunk at that point. Three days and no sleep. You're fucking gone.

2164
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:51,840
I kind of like it. I kind of like there's you. I've got to remind all the listeners right now

2165
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:56,640
that Ben gave us so much shit for skipping voicemails and then he insists on playing every

2166
02:29:56,640 --> 02:30:02,320
single one and they're half garbage. You never know. You never know when you're going to find

2167
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:07,680
buried treasure. I don't know. I kind of like friendly friend manly. This is something really

2168
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:16,400
funny about the title. Yeah. The man said nothing wrong. He was just like the PCP.

2169
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:21,520
It's friendly friend man Liam, right? Yeah, I think it's Liam. He's friendly friend man Liam.

2170
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:32,640
No, I just one word. Friendly friend manly. I mean, it's a positive note to go out on.

2171
02:30:32,640 --> 02:30:39,840
It's true. So I think remember to go to sleep every day. Remember to stay hydrated.

2172
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:50,560
And remember to piss. Remember to say poggers. Remember to go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators

2174
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,320
we should talk about the newest bonus episode. What is it, Ben?

2175
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:10,320
It's the tits cast where me and Gib discuss the age old question tits versus nothing

2176
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:20,400
because there's no alternative. There's simply nothing compare. I can't think of what could

2177
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:27,920
possibly compare to a set of big old mommy milkers. So, so cool. Listen to that.

2178
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:32,640
Unironically based episode. It was very. I agree.

2179
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:38,880
Unironically think it was cool and want people to hear it. $5 a month gets you access to that

episode and a bajillion other bonus episodes. $1 a month. You get access to the discord where

02:31:50,960 --> 02:31:58,960

02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:28,000
He just made one of his PCP voicemail. Sorry. PCP dating sim songs. He ported it. He put it in

2188
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:34,000
guitar hero or some kind of guitar hero game. And that's like a free download.

2189
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:40,160
Oh, frets on fire for PC. Is that what that is? The free PC version of guitar hero.

2190
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:45,200
I think it's called frets on fire. Cool. Yes. Well, I thought that was pretty fucking neat.

2191
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:52,400
It's pretty good. Yeah. So all right. I think we've made it. We did it. We made it all the

2192
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:59,760
way to the end. We survived. Let's fucking get out of here, shall we? Indeed. Yes. Disperse.
