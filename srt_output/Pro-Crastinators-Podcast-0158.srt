00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ready Phantom? Oh my god!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We did it ladies and gentlemen. Hey it's not a T-Bap show, everybody watch Come On Let's Go Pro Crastinators.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We actually made a fucking podcast. Welcome ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And today we've got me, the best guy ever, in addition to some lower life forms including Munchy.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do these count as a map of us? I mean technically you did like release a video.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Absolutely not. It's got to be on my channel.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well it's got to be on my platform.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well I guess you guys are going to be watching this episode on a different channel.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah when Nate finally stages a violent coup it's just going to be like the channel will just vanish overnight

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and then he will have hundreds of pieces of content to just re-release on his channel and we'll all be powerless to stop him.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's the big brain play honestly.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We should definitely talk about that because that's crazy shit. I think this is the first episode.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah it definitely is since that happened so we'll get to that later but there are more people.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Tom, Tom is here of course.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I need more soul.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Where are you going to get him?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
From the shoemaker.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That sounds like a man bereft of soul poops.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're going to kill all of you fucker.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No not me.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh there it is.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I am a weak boy. I am a mere hollow sir.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What do they call a shoemaker? Not a haberdasher.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A cobbler.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
A clogmeister.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A cobbler.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Dude I straight up got my feet measured by a cobbler once.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Dude that's straight up.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Dude you get your fucking boots blacked?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah I got them fucking shine dude.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I got them shine all the way to the ideal.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You engage in some boot blacking as featured in my favorite webcomic Ojoi sax toy.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I fell apart immediately upon standing up and walking outside and you didn't give me my money back.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And of course we also have the furtive hippocrite.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The furtile hippocrite.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh yeah.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Listen I don't want to make the pockets weird or anything but like I'm just imagining my children being bred by hippo and I'm just trying to get a little bit weird right now.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Being bred? Like putting the fucking pizza oven and cooked?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm like fully breaded dude.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey you forgot me but that's okay I'll introduce myself.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I slipped it in. You had said some words.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's up guys? Best guy ever here.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No wanted sex criminal.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know about wanted.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Back at it again from the Pizza Hut where I'm laying low from the feds.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm obligated to inform you that I am a sex offender.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If I'm to be on this podcast.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I have a zero rating on the social credit score.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hey speak of that Pizza Hut Nate.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you want me to tell us what that really strange thing you said before we started recording?

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Child sucks cult underneath your pizza?

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you want to explain that on the show?

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I think we better save that for the bonus episode.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I think we better keep quiet about that and let the fans speculate.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Before we do anything I have a bone to pick with Nate.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh don't we all.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I gotta air my grievances because before this podcast started.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This guy thinks he's got the only bone with Nate to pick.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm just gonna be just trying to repeat it.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I was awake all night playing Dark Souls 3 because I have no light.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I listened to all of Matthew Muteau's Dark Souls 1 commentary.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It was pretty cool and then I needed something else to have his noise while I was playing it.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh no not the lowly Mia Mathifa.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Mia Mathifa came out and I was like I'll just start listening to that.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I got like 15 minutes into the Devil May Cry 5 Mia Mathifa.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm like this is the most retarded take I've ever heard.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not even a take.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's a deliberately incomplete take as a man struggling with the reality

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
that he has not found himself attached to the way that other people do to Devil May Cry.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I had to roll my eyes.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I audibly rolled my eyes.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll let you figure out what that means but I audibly rolled my eyes

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
when you were just like Devil May Cry 3 man I don't even understand.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's the Temina Gru? I don't even fucking get it.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I haven't seen this video.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm thinking this man, the man who sat us down for three hours

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and had to explain the difference between the Keyblade and the Keyblade

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
is complaining about the Temina Gru.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You don't have any ground to stand on sir.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's just a matter of personal commitment to like how much have I investigated one verse.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's the fucking tower. The tower is the Temina Gru.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There you go.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I haven't watched this video but I have seen multiple people in multiple discords

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
complain about your takes on Devil May Cry.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm glad I can air that publicly now.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I know you haven't played many of the games or you're not like that into it.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I actually have played all of them as a matter of fact.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's just an idiot. I don't know what to tell you.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It reminds me of the backlash I got for being like

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
for the Heroes of Might of Magic videos I made

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
where like I had no idea, I mean, you know, big mistake

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
to make a video where I wasn't like super fan of the games

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and I talked about them and people ripped me to shreds in the comments constantly

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
about my lack of knowledge on this cult classic that everybody knew about.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's kind of sad though because like the interesting thing about those videos

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
was like you were someone coming into them not having that background

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
backlash take. Here's how someone would experience them today.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And like that's cool.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's just that I didn't expect backlash because I didn't know about it

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and if I knew that there was like a big fan thing

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I probably wouldn't have put my opinion out there

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
because I don't like getting told I'm an idiot.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I probably would have waited until I had more of an understanding

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
of what I was talking about.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Frankly, like that video was designed to be kind of a parallel

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
to the Hollow Knight one I made for me a mouthful one.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And like, I mean, again, it's not like a genius take or anything.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's just like basically my first exposure to this particular game

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and looking back on that like Hollow Knight video,

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sure people, if they watched it now,

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
look, no one's a bigger Hollow Knight fan than me

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and I like barely understand what's going on in that game

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and I'm fumbling around and I'm quite critical of Hollow Knight

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and now it's like my favorite game of the...

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I mean, before Sekiro, it's definitely my favorite game

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
of the last like five, six, seven years or something.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So that's what I was kind of hoping people would take away.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We'd be able to look back at it as like a landmark

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
in Nate's journey of trying to finally understand

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
what people love so much about Devil May Cry.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know what would work about a video like that?

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If it was a video where you start the video, not getting it

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and then you...

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And then I get it at the end?

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, yeah, because like there was this...

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It only played two hours.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
James Rolfe did this thing where he was like,

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I've never got into Power Rangers before.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I want to know what it's all about.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then he basically...

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's just sort of an explanation of him beginning,

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
like not knowing anything, being an idiot,

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and then he marathons the whole thing

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and then he comes back at the end.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A lot of that kind of time.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I mean, it was James Rolfe. He's crazy.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So he marathons the whole thing and he gets it

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and then he has like a big like, oh, this is so great.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And the people who would otherwise have been annoyed at him

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
loved it because it is living proof

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that you can get into this thing.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And then they could share that to their friends like,

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
see, Power Rangers is good.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is why you should try and get into it.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So Power Rangers, American Power Rangers

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
was actually thought to be good by James.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is that accurate?

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because he's always pretty childish to me.

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I mean, I watch it when I'm a little kid.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, it's super childish.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But like, that's its charm.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Its charm is just funny, goofy.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Like, I think that's also kind of the reason

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
why Devil May Cry is great.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's because it's just like fucking stupid,

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but like in a cool way.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know, I wanted to clarify.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I just didn't have time to say everything I wanted to.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like, I wanted to say how much I love the ending

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
of Devil May Cry 3.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like, it is so good.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And I absolutely love it.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And like, the intro, like, I don't feel as much

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
of an attachment to.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So I feel like if things skewed a little more negative

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
than I wanted to in the video anyway

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
about like the whole series.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But I mean, yeah.

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Just just to be clear, just to clarify

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
before I like jump down and throw it.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I've only watched the first 15 minutes of the video

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
because then I had to come up here.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It does get more positive.

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I don't even care that you think it's that

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
that like you don't understand it because I'm not

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
going to sit here and say I understand everything either.

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I just thought it was hilarious that like

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you're the three hour Kingdom Hearts lecture man is like

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the story confuses me.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I just thought that was like saying that I because

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I did a three hour lecture on Kingdom Hearts

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
or whatever that I that I can't be critical

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
or have any concerns about any story

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that's overly complex.

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm the first one to admit Kingdom Hearts is overly

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
complicated and doesn't need to be this way.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's just that it hooked me early.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I just got dragged along for the whole ride.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But I see your point.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I certainly see the.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I will say and I agree that I think the Devil May Cry one

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
is still, I mean, I've said it before.

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's still my favorite.

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I think it's so good.

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I love it so much.

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Great.

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I actually mentioned this in the I Am Games video

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I did with DG when we were talking about our favorite

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
games is that because that one's by Hideki Kamiya,

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
it has a tone that's different from the rest.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And I kind of miss that.

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
For sure.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a little bit more grounded, but just like,

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know, just the subduedness of it is kind of cool.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But at the same time, like it soon as like crazy over the top

208
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
insanity is also cool in its own way.

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I mean, yeah, they're two different flavors.

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And I definitely feel like there could absolutely be a divide

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
about like, depending on what kind of person you are,

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
like I always like the gaming Brit.

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He, he's a guy in my eye.

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It seems like like the Itsuno Devil May Cry games,

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
like that's, he's the guy for those for sure.

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Whereas I feel like I'm more of a DMC one kind of guy,

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
but, but I want to learn about this world

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
because I do not understand it.

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Now, I mean, that's what I talk about in the video.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So people can go listen to that for more.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But by the way, you were saying about James Rolfe.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was just curious about his Power Rangers video.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Has Linkara filed litigation?

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes, because he's coaching on his turf.

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And is he shutting down this operation?

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Because as far as I know, Linkara is the only man on the world

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
who's talked about Power Rangers in any capacity.

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You shouldn't actually be telling all of it.

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You could tell you all about the, about recording

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and the production.

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Mr. Green.

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It was a pretty, pretty, pretty intense on set, you know,

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
having to just stand around and do nothing

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
because we got all the Asian actors already from five years ago

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to do all the action scenes.

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Right.

238
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know, I had to like put the helmet on sometimes

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and stand there and shake my head a little bit

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
to make it look like I was talking in the dubbed dialogue,

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
whatever it was.

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Ah, yes, classic.

243
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It was great.

244
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
10 out of 10 experience would do again.

245
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You know, this might be an embarrassing truth.

246
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This might be like a thing like,

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
uh-oh, why did you say that?

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But I have actually watched all of those

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Linkara reviews of Power Rangers.

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Uh-oh.

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You watched a YouTube video

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
that might not be considered quality.

253
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Guys, time to call out the firing squad.

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They're going to fucking tell the me that I like bad things

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and then they're going to think I'm stupid.

256
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
All right, tickle them to death, please.

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No.

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's gay.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Get out of there.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Are they good though?

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Are they enjoyable?

262
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Uh, I mean, I've marathoned a lot of

263
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
that guy with the glasses stuff just because

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and I used to like nostalgia critic.

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I guess I used to like Linkara as well.

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They were just sort of like, ah, yeah, I guess.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I mean, you know.

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The comic stuff was like,

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't care about comics and the way he does them

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is always terrible,

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
but like a video review of something

272
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
is inherently a little more interesting

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because I'm looking at the thing

274
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and it's like moving around.

275
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's certainly true.

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Certainly true.

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
When you're a kid and all you want to do is feed,

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
then watching nostalgia critic

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
isn't at all a strange thing to do.

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I used to watch it all the time.

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't even know whether I was that young.

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It was like five years ago or something.

283
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Whatever.

284
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Munchy, can you run that by me again?

285
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What do we need to do?

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, just when you need it.

287
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Feed.

288
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay, okay.

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
All right.

290
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You just need to feed.

291
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You need to consume.

292
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, all right.

293
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is a new concept to me,

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
so it's blowing my mind.

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Well, yeah, I know you're post content and post food.

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I actually, you know, looking back on it,

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
my internet search history

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and my internet history in general,

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
like I was not a YouTube kind of guy

300
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
who was like watching nostalgia critic

301
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and like I totally missed fucking

302
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the angry video game nerd completely

303
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and I'm still looking to go back to that.

304
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That shit was like old hat

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
by the time I even like was aware.

306
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean, like I had probably heard of it before.

307
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How is that possible?

308
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Because I was watching AVG.

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Well, I mean, I don't know.

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But it's due to Ben that I got into it

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
when Ben turned me on to like the pony stuff.

312
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's when I really dived into it.

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Whoa, holy shit.

314
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah.

315
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Like when did, um,

316
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
angry video game nerd probably started first, right?

317
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Before the nostalgia critic.

318
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah.

319
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He started before YouTube was a thing.

320
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He used to make home videos of that for his friends.

321
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Sure.

322
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But I'm sure no one was watching it at that point.

323
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, yeah.

324
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No, you couldn't.

325
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah.

326
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I think it was like pretty soon after YouTube got started.

327
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So it had been like around 2006

328
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
because it was originally the angry Nintendo nerd

329
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and then you'd be branded for copyright.

330
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, like I watched,

331
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
so I was in college until like 2010 or something.

332
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I was watching YouTube around them,

333
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
but I definitely was not watching, uh,

334
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
uh, yeah, it wasn't,

335
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
it wasn't until like pony stuff.

336
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Weirdly.

337
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I mean, I had in college, in college,

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
me and my friends,

339
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
okay, this, this,

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
we did delete this,

341
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
but we made a video game review,

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
um, in like a group,

343
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
attempt to be relatively comedic.

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Whoa.

345
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It was, uh, we made one on,

346
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it was, it was, I believe it was Ratchet and Clank,

347
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
uh, like it was the first one of the new PS3 games.

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I forget which one it is.

349
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But it was one that everybody loves.

350
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Tools of destruction.

351
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, that's not a good one.

352
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, it wasn't Tools of Destruction.

353
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll destroy that game.

354
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wait, was it not?

355
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You know what?

356
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll, I'll, I'll Google it while I look this up.

357
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That game, that game was a miserable experience.

358
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I played that in 2015.

359
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I, I, I can't believe,

360
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can't believe Nate showed up hippo

361
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
before hippo was even born.

362
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I know.

363
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I, I, which one was it?

364
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Was it, I guess it was,

365
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
no, it was a cracking time.

366
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm like 99% sure it was a cracking time,

367
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
which I think,

368
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Cracking my ass.

369
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The crack, cracking time wasn't too bad.

370
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The point is though that, uh, like,

371
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
so obviously I was aware.

372
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The idea was to release this on YouTube.

373
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Uh, so clearly I knew about YouTube stuff.

374
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But all the production fees and just the publishing,

375
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you know, just,

376
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh my God.

377
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I wish that still existed,

378
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
but like we finished this product.

379
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay.

380
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And then we looked it over.

381
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I think I edited it.

382
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We filmed it on like my old parents' camera or something.

383
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Uh, and then we all sat around like in a dark room

384
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
with like the glowing neon light illuminating us.

385
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We all stood and watched this like 15 minute

386
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
ratchet and client game review.

387
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We all, it finished.

388
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We looked at each other and we said,

389
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
We have to destroy this.

390
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It has to be removed from existence.

391
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And that's exactly what I did.

392
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Were there dude,

393
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
what the freak moment?

394
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Basically.

395
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can only imagine.

396
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That would be, that would be such a cursed,

397
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
that would be such a cursed artifact

398
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
if it still existed.

399
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That would be so.

400
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It doesn't though.

401
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm pretty sure we completely explained it.

402
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It would be so incredible to post now.

403
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I wish I hadn't.

404
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I wish I had kept it.

405
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh my God.

406
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It was so fucked up.

407
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Dude, what if it's on the camera?

408
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What if, what if the raw footage exists?

409
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You know,

410
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're gonna react that down.

411
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You're gonna react that down.

412
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Gonna get the VHS out of the archives.

413
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The RCA.

414
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Whatever it's called.

415
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The little tapes.

416
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I mean, I'd have to like call my parents.

417
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay.

418
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Tell you what.

419
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I will, I will do a cursory investigation

420
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to see if I could possibly unearth this thing.

421
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But, uh, but we'll see.

422
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We'll see.

423
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There's nothing more intense

424
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
than a cursory investigation by Nate.

425
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah.

426
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Honestly though,

427
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't want to get people's hopes up

428
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
because like 99.9.

429
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like even that feels like,

430
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
but there's like a 0.1% chance.

431
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Like it's not, it's basically zero.

432
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's pretty much just zero.

433
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

434
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.

435
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It would be a miracle.

436
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I remember deleting it.

437
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Barring an act of God.

438
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, we'll see.

439
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And I mean,

440
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
although God is real,

441
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
so hopefully that this is real.

442
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
No, I just,

443
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I just tweeted before we started

444
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
that I'm an atheist

445
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
that God isn't real.

446
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What?

447
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Dude, dude.

448
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I actually,

449
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's true.

450
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Represent.

451
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Tom, proud of you.

452
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm proud of someone's out there

453
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
willing to say it.

454
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Someone has the courage.

455
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I mean, to be fair,

456
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I was making a Dark Souls 3 joke,

457
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
but it stands for God.

458
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Guys, hot, hot take on God,

459
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
hot take on God,

460
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
fake.

461
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hot, not real.

462
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think he's just

463
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
a little bit fake.

464
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Hey, speaking of me

465
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
making videos though,

466
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm currently doing that.

467
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Uh, and other things,

468
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
me and Mafia 2 is on,

469
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
ladies and gentlemen,

470
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and you're probably watching it,

471
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
hopefully.

472
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Uh, so that's cool.

473
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But really,

474
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
me and Mafia 2 is,

475
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
is simply kind of just a hype engine

476
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
in order to propel

477
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
the excitement for my channel

478
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
that is going full time.

479
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I have tendered my resignation

480
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
at my job.

481
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I kept it a secret

482
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
until I announced me a Mafia.

483
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And, uh, yeah, I quit.

484
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I, I, I knew about it.

485
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I knew about it.

486
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh, did I tell you ahead of time?

487
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I couldn't remember who I told.

488
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Uh, you, you did not tell me.

489
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There have been murmurings in chat.

490
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh, did the parents spill the beans?

491
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
My dad, you're dead.

492
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Your own dad.

493
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Your own dad.

494
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Spill the beans.

495
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Spill the beans.

496
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Be solo in pregnancy with dad.

497
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Wait, hold on.

498
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why did your dad know

499
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
that you were making me a Mafia?

500
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why did you tell your father?

501
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Because he has to tell him everything.

502
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He has him under his iron foot.

503
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No, you fucking nerd.

504
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He knew, he knew that he was

505
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
tendering his, he knew that he was,

506
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
he knew that he was

507
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
tendering his resignation.

508
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah.

509
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
In fact, my dad didn't spill.

510
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He, my dad didn't call me up

511
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and say, dude, Ben,

512
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
do you hear about this new me a Mafia

513
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
that's about to happen?

514
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah.

515
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's where I was gonna add to it.

516
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You know, okay.

517
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
As, as a matter of fact,

518
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I, uh, did not tell my dad,

519
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
like about me a Mafia, frankly,

520
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
cause I, you know, like he's not

521
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
really up with the lore.

522
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah, I wouldn't imagine that you would.

523
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But, but what I did do was

524
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I called him,

525
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
when I was thinking about

526
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
leaving my job,

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I called my dad and my parents

528
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and wanted their sage advice,

529
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
which is exactly what I got.

530
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And, uh, so, you know,

531
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
it was all part of my,

532
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
my process of moving my way out.

533
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I had to talk to my parents

534
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
so I wouldn't be scared and alone.

535
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Um, but yeah.

536
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

537
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So, so I guess the good news is

538
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
they seem pretty positive

539
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
about how things are going,

540
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
so that's nice.

541
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So to be clear, this isn't

542
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
me a Mafia's building up

543
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and then like you're going to

544
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
quit on me a Mafia.

545
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Like the wheels are in motion.

546
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This shit is happening.

547
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I had, I had titted my resignation

548
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
over a month ago at my job.

549
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's just, it's like,

550
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
because of my job,

551
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
it's like a team I'm a member of

552
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and we got a lot of stuff

553
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
on the wheels.

554
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Uh, they, they asked me to stay on.

555
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
In fact, I was hoping to be gone

556
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
by the beginning of May,

557
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
a little bit unhappy

558
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
that that's not the case.

559
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But I mean, hey,

560
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
they asked me to stay.

561
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I agreed.

562
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And frankly,

563
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
this is laying the foundation

564
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
as people take, take my advice.

565
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I think this is wise.

566
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't burn bridges.

567
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Like I'm going out of my way

568
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
to do extra work for these guys

569
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
so that I have a safety net.

570
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So they already say like,

571
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
hey, Nate, if things don't work

572
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
out, give us a call.

573
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, we could probably fit you

574
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
back in here.

575
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Um, like if things don't work

576
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
out, I will be fine.

577
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Cause frankly, my job is great.

578
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Uh, it's just that you,

579
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
does that, does that mean

580
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
you're staying,

581
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you're staying in the area

582
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
or not moving anywhere.

583
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You're not,

584
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
you're not PCPH queuing it up.

585
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Well, okay.

586
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
See that that's the,

587
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
so plans have not yet been made

588
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
as to exactly where to move,

589
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
but I still think that

590
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
to exactly where to move,

591
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
but I certainly plan to move

592
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
somewhere because there's

593
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
nothing tying me here anymore.

594
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And frankly,

595
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
me and Michelle are both

596
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
looking forward to,

597
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
uh, I mean,

598
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
among other things,

599
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
seeing the ocean on a regular

600
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
basis.

601
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I just,

602
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I just crave that ocean for you

603
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
over here.

604
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That's true.

605
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's true.

606
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I mean,

607
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
okay, now to get a little bit

608
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
dark with it,

609
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I wonder if me,

610
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
my,

611
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
my, my nature to keep things

612
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
secret,

613
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
uh, is so strong,

614
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
my comp,

615
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
my compulsion to not spill the

616
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
beans and to surprise everyone

617
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
in a favorable way was so strong

618
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
that I couldn't bring myself to like

619
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
discuss any future possible plans

620
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
with like any of you guys

621
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
or Digi or anything,

622
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
even though that probably would

623
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
have been a wise idea,

624
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
uh,

625
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to see what happens.

626
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But,

627
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
uh, I mean,

628
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
so we all know Digi's

629
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
in Virginia Beach now.

630
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Right.

631
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So, uh,

632
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
he seems pretty dead set there.

633
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I mean,

634
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
that's the negative side

635
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
of your natural showmanship.

636
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Everything has to be,

637
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
has to have the,

638
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
the wow factor.

639
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So we can't ever know,

640
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
but I,

641
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
but I was,

642
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I was,

643
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I was privy for at least like a month.

644
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, of course.

645
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Because Munchy had to do

646
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
the fucking logo, of course.

647
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Uh, as,

648
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
as I,

649
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm the logo Smith

650
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
for your entire channel.

651
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Have you,

652
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
have you seen,

653
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
there's a lot of positive feedback

654
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
about the logo.

655
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Is there,

656
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
is there,

657
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
absolutely,

658
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
people are way into it.

659
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They fucking better be.

660
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And,

661
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and the fucking,

662
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
yeah,

663
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
we were,

664
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
we slaved on this logo.

665
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Uh,

666
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I forced you to be my slave.

667
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We,

668
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
we slaved,

669
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
we slaved smash cut to you

670
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You know,

671
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
it really hurts cracking

672
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
that whip after so long.

673
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh,

674
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
it's not,

675
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
it's more than zero effort

676
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
to work with Munchy on it.

677
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's true.

678
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's true.

679
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You were very involved with

680
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I got,

681
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I got fallen arches

682
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
from crushing Munchy

683
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
under my boot heel.

684
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Indeed.

685
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It turned out great though.

686
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It turned out great.

687
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
As always,

688
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
as always,

689
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
oh,

690
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
it did.

691
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And as always,

692
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I stand up for employers

693
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
who are the real heroes.

694
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You know,

695
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
they're,

696
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
you should,

697
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
you should fucking,

698
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
you should move to London

699
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
take the dogs to the park

700
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and they can play

701
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
in the park.

702
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh,

703
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Sonny and Sessho

704
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
hanging out.

705
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That would be great.

706
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'd love to do that.

707
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Maybe I'll fucking walk

708
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the dog daily.

709
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Maybe,

710
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
probably not though.

711
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah.

712
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You should,

713
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
you should,

714
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
you could unironically

715
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
make a vlog of you

716
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
with your phone out

717
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
like walking the dog every day

718
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
on a show.

719
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh dude,

720
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
straight up.

721
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay.

722
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
All right.

723
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Here's a video idea for you.

724
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You get your GoPro

725
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and put it on your dog's ass.

726
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Record a vlog

727
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
from the dog's ass

728
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh my God.

729
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So you're walking down the street

730
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and you're just like,

731
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
like the,

732
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
like the leash is going down

733
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
to the video,

734
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
like,

735
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
like from the angle

736
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
which the dog's ass is at

737
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and you talk down to it.

738
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's the,

739
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
that's the vlog.

740
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You strap an iPad

741
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
to the back of the dog's

742
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
you can see.

743
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah.

744
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh dude,

745
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
that's next level boomer shit.

746
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Like you put farms

747
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
on your iPad

748
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and put it on your dog's

749
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
ass while you're walking

750
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
your dog.

751
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I have several

752
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
good ideas for videos

753
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
that I've been cooking up

754
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
for a long time.

755
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And that's

756
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
doing things with the GoPro.

757
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Doing things with the GoPro.

758
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I have not really thought about it.

759
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We all have.

760
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I mean,

761
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
the great thing about it

762
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
is the list is totally changing

763
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
every single day.

764
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I start basically at zero

765
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and just have to come up

766
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
with something.

767
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So,

768
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I've got a few questions.

769
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So I'm going to ask these

770
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and then if they're two,

771
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
if they're two,

772
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
you know,

773
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
next level

774
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
then feel free to deny answer.

775
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
How much of this?

776
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Okay.

777
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Cause this was the same thing

778
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
for the last minute and a half.

779
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So obviously you had time

780
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
to prepare

781
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and you had thought about this

782
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
because you know,

783
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
you quit your job

784
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and I'm sure for many a few months

785
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
beforehand,

786
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
how many of these videos

787
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
were pre-made?

788
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Zero.

789
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Zero videos

790
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
have been pre-made.

791
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Really?

792
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That's correct.

793
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Every single one

794
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
was made on that day.

795
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That wasn't even

796
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
the case for the first one,

797
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
was it?

798
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah.

799
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Actually,

800
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
okay.

801
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Frankly,

802
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I was just kind of

803
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
fucking around

804
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and not getting my,

805
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
my,

806
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
my,

807
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
my,

808
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
my,

809
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
my,

810
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the end of April

811
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
when I was announcing it

812
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and I was like, well,

813
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I guess this is how much time I have.

814
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm kind of hoping to

815
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
currently

816
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
make,

817
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
like manage to make two in a day

818
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
so I can get a little bit

819
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
of a buffer back

820
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
so that I have a little more

821
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
time to relax.

822
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Cause this is a,

823
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that's crazy.

824
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm getting very little sleep.

825
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That is insane.

826
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Very, very little sleep.

827
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I mean,

828
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I can imagine you're still going

829
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
into your job.

830
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So all of these are just coming in.

831
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay.

832
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So you got your,

833
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
you got your working hours,

834
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
of course.

835
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What are your working hours?

836
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You know,

837
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
capital W,

838
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
like real work,

839
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
okay.

840
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You know what?

841
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So,

842
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
so,

843
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I don't want to give anybody too

844
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
much of a false impression.

845
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The thing is we worked

846
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
out a deal.

847
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm working a few hours

848
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
less than full time now

849
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
for the remainder

850
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
until I'm out at work.

851
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So that gives me about

852
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
like two extra hours

853
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
in a day to work on stuff,

854
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
which is not a ton,

855
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
but it is something.

856
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So things are a little bit

857
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
easier than they were

858
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
for,

859
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
for me a math of a one.

860
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Thank God.

861
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But basically I,

862
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I've committed about

863
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
six hours every

864
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
work day

865
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to my

866
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
job,

867
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
job.

868
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And I got to,

869
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
you know,

870
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
do me a math of a stuff

871
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and do everything

872
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
else I got to do in the day.

873
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So,

874
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
frankly,

875
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
it's been,

876
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I've just,

877
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
just like,

878
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm just in my office,

879
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
like all day.

880
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Can't,

881
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I want to watch the new

882
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Game of Thrones,

883
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
but I don't have time.

884
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
God damn it.

885
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You're missing nothing.

886
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's fucking shit.

887
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But that,

888
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
well,

889
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
the last episode

890
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
sounded like it was a big,

891
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
a big deal,

892
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
but I haven't seen it.

893
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So I wouldn't know.

894
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It was a spoil.

895
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Don't spoil me Tom.

896
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Don't you do it.

897
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You're in for a surprise.

898
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You're in for a surprise.

899
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm going to say the Game of Thrones

900
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
word.

901
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm going to say it.

902
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Well,

903
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
you see,

904
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
in Game of Thrones,

905
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Game of Thrones,

906
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
James,

907
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
James Game,

908
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
the main character,

909
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
found that there were six rocks

910
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
across the

911
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
world of

912
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Thronia,

913
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and that he had

914
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
to drag them down

915
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
in order to,

916
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
you know,

917
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
become more powerful.

918
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Sorry,

919
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
well,

920
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
that's pretty sick.

921
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I was enrolled.

922
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes.

923
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The last words,

924
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the final,

925
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
the ending,

926
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
you know,

927
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
shambles his broke ass in

928
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and he sees John Snow

929
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
sitting on the throne

930
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and John Snow

931
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
suddenly looks down

932
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and says,

933
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
huh,

934
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
chaos control.

935
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Cut to credits.

936
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
That's the end.

937
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
We don't even see that.

938
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
We don't even see that.

939
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We don't see what happens,

940
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
but we know,

941
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
we know what happens.

942
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Chaos has been controlled.

943
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Nate.

944
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
He goes,

945
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
he goes super,

946
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
John.

947
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Are you in

948
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
the work doghouse

949
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
right now

950
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and just fully devoting

951
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
your time

952
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
to making things?

953
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Do you have any time

954
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
or anything else?

955
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Um,

956
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
well,

957
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm trying to kind of

958
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
carve out time

959
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
to do other things,

960
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
not really,

961
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
although even,

962
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
even in the depths of

963
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
uh,

964
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
uh,

965
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Miamavva,

966
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I still find myself

967
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
like wasting time

968
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
when I need to get to

969
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
the video

970
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and still,

971
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you know,

972
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
in what way,

973
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
in what way?

974
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Well,

975
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I mean,

976
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
just for example,

977
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
the,

978
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the one I did on Sekiro,

979
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
the Sekiro video,

980
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
like I had everything

981
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I needed to get started

982
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
on that video,

983
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I can't remember exactly

984
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
what I was doing that day.

985
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's all kind of blurring together,

986
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
but like,

987
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I know that I only started

988
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
recording that

989
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
at like 10,

990
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
no,

991
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
okay,

992
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I recorded like the intro stuff,

993
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
which was way too much,

994
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
probably,

995
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and I shouldn't have done it.

996
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Uh,

997
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
but then I only started like

998
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
the main video

999
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
recording the actual

1000
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
like discussion of the game

1001
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
at like 10 p.m.

1002
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And

1003
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
like that was like,

1004
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
that was like three hours later

1005
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
than I could have been

1006
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
if I'd just been peak

1007
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
efficiency.

1008
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So I don't know why

1009
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
that happened,

1010
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
but I ended up releasing

1011
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
that video, you know,

1012
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
because I just took that long

1013
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
to get it done.

1014
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And, you know,

1015
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
that's just,

1016
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
that's just what I have to do.

1017
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I,

1018
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
now I have,

1019
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
to my credit,

1020
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I have founded myself

1021
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
the absolute iron will.

1022
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I will not stop

1023
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
until the video is done that day.

1024
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And it's nice to feel that again.

1025
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It feels good.

1026
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It feels good.

1027
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So that's cool.

1028
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I like that Sekiro video.

1029
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's very,

1030
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
very informative and fun

1031
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and epic with the sword.

1032
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah.

1033
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I like it too.

1034
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's good.

1035
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's good.

1036
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So you've been doing these

1037
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
for how many days?

1038
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Five,

1039
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
five days.

1040
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We're on day six today?

1041
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
No,

1042
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
day five today.

1043
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Although there was also day zero,

1044
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
so.

1045
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Have there been any,

1046
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
like,

1047
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
you just thought that you couldn't

1048
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
get the video out?

1049
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Or is that iron will

1050
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
just so prevalent

1051
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
that you just

1052
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
could not even imagine it?

1053
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
There have been issues.

1054
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Okay.

1055
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So one of the things that

1056
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
happened with,

1057
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I believe it was the

1058
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Sekiro video.

1059
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, no.

1060
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Okay.

1061
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I was going to say,

1062
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
there was another technique

1063
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
club.

1064
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Oh, there was another thing

1065
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
with the stream.

1066
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
There was so much stress.

1067
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Like I,

1068
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
because the aforementioned iron

1069
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
will,

1070
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
a video must come out that day

1071
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
when it seems like things are

1072
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
going horribly awry

1073
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and the video may not come out.

1074
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Like it can't not come out.

1075
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It has to come out.

1076
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What,

1077
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
if I need to scrap what I've

1078
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
done and re-record just a new

1079
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
video,

1080
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
that's what will be done.

1081
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But like,

1082
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
okay,

1083
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
so I discovered a wonderful

1084
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
feature of Sony Vegas,

1085
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
ladies and gentlemen.

1086
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And so my camera happens to

1087
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
record MOV files.

1088
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And in the past,

1089
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I've noticed sometimes,

1090
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
just when I put too many videos,

1091
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
just the whole project breaks.

1092
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And this actually happened with

1093
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
the Kingdom Hearts video.

1094
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
The way that I finished my

1095
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Kingdom Hearts,

1096
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
we Agua,

1097
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
was I actually broke that file

1098
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
into several different

1099
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Vegas files and then rendered

1100
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
the pieces together once they were

1101
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
all rendered individually.

1102
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So that shouldn't be

1103
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
necessary.

1104
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Why did that have to happen, Nate?

1105
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Well, I found the answer while

1106
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
working on the Sekiro video.

1107
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
At least I believe it was that one.

1108
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And it was that,

1109
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
did you know that Sony Vegas,

1110
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
which uses QuickTime to support

1111
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
MOV files,

1112
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
can only handle

1113
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
up to a certain amount of

1114
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
MOV files.

1115
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And when you go over that

1116
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
number,

1117
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
it doesn't give you an error.

1118
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The files simply stop

1119
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
working in Sony Vegas.

1120
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So picture me,

1121
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
it's already like 1 a.m.

1122
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I've been struggling for two

1123
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
hours to figure out

1124
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
why the fuck these perfectly

1125
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
good video files will just

1126
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
not be visible in the

1127
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Sony Vegas.

1128
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And then I,

1129
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
you know, I'm spending hours

1130
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
searching to try to find the

1131
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
answer.

1132
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And then someone in a random

1133
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
YouTube tutorial says,

1134
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
oh, by the way,

1135
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
just so you know,

1136
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Sony Vegas breaks if you have

1137
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
too many fucking MOV files,

1138
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
so make sure you don't have

1139
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
too many.

1140
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And I'm like,

1141
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
well, why the fuck didn't you

1142
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
say so?

1143
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And so that's,

1144
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
now I know.

1145
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Like, now that I knew that,

1146
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I could-

1147
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That should have just been one

1148
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
year,

1149
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
you're a mere math of a video.

1150
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's just public service

1151
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
video.

1152
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That's like the story of making

1153
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
a mere math of a-

1154
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The way-

1155
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Detail like all the issues I

1156
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
had so far.

1157
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Oh, you could set like a

1158
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
making of video,

1159
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
like a making of episode.

1160
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

1161
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Something like that.

1162
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You go to a mere math of a

1163
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
factor and just start cranking

1164
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
out the same shit over and

1165
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
over and just like,

1166
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
like just teams and teams.

1167
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah, you do a making of the

1168
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
video and then the next day

1169
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
you do a making of the

1170
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
making of.

1171
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

1172
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Forever.

1173
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And that's the rest of the

1174
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
month for you right there.

1175
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That's the rest of the month.

1176
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah.

1177
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We've got the formula down.

1178
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The way it usually goes is

1179
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
that when you learn a

1180
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
program to, you know,

1181
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
use it for whatever creative

1182
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
job, you know, you learn

1183
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Photoshop or you learn,

1184
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
you know, I don't know,

1185
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Dasty or something, you know,

1186
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
FL Studio or something.

1187
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Then you, there's a hump

1188
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
where you're getting a lot of

1189
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
errors because you don't know

1190
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
how to use the program.

1191
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Right.

1192
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And you're using it in ways

1193
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
that it doesn't intend.

1194
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It seems that Vegas,

1195
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
that initial hump is forever.

1196
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Like you never get out of

1197
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
getting errors in Vegas.

1198
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It seems like no matter what,

1199
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
even people who have been

1200
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
aiming for years seem to always

1201
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
just have problems in that

1202
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
program.

1203
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So I decided to learn it

1204
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
myself.

1205
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I would bet that there are

1206
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
peculiarities of most types of,

1207
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
of any kind of software.

1208
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You know, as a software

1209
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
developer myself,

1210
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
formally full-time, now

1211
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
part-ish time and soon to be

1212
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
not at all.

1213
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
There's always stuff that you

1214
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
discover as you're like doing

1215
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
more robust testing.

1216
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
If you're doing the same,

1217
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
like we, at my job, we have a,

1218
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
we have a software that we give

1219
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
to customers and like things

1220
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
can absolutely break.

1221
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
If you just do things in like,

1222
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
on the edge cases of like what

1223
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
you're currently working on

1224
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
or whatever.

1225
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But the thing is our customers,

1226
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
they do the same thing over

1227
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and over and over again with

1228
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
the software.

1229
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So like really for them,

1230
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
they don't need to worry about

1231
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
like these, these edge case

1232
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
issues.

1233
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But we do.

1234
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Like when customers are,

1235
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
you know, they're going to want

1236
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
to use it for something

1237
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
slightly different than,

1238
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
you know, what we've prepared

1239
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
for.

1240
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So, you know,

1241
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
always happens.

1242
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I feel like this will not be

1243
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
answered.

1244
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm not going to ask for

1245
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
specifics.

1246
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Like, you know, names,

1247
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
but can you tell us what your

1248
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
software is?

1249
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So I think I'll just forever

1250
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
not say.

1251
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Nuclear launch codes.

1252
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Because of the possibility

1253
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
that I will one day go back.

1254
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I don't want anyone to know

1255
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
where I actually work.

1256
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So, so, but I'll tell you,

1257
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
the software basically what it

1258
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
does is it's,

1259
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
it's a file transfer protocol

1260
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
specifically for CAD 3D model

1261
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
files that people use for

1262
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
engineering.

1263
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
3D printing nuclear bonds.

1264
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Indeed.

1265
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Well, like that pizza, you know,

1266
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
there's some kids down there,

1267
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and they need to be

1268
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
taught some lessons

1269
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
from your home channel.

1270
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Fucking.

1271
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That's fair.

1272
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Fair.

1273
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But one of the things that

1274
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
our software can do is like,

1275
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
it can change the file type

1276
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
as it, as it is being sent

1277
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
through the pipeline.

1278
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
As it's thrown midair to

1279
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
the next office over.

1280
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Indeed.

1281
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So if you're like an

1282
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
engineering firm and you use

1283
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
like, let me see,

1284
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
what do we got?

1285
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Use like,

1286
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
UGNX 10 files.

1287
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Like that's,

1288
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
that's a file type.

1289
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And you want,

1290
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
you want to get into a person

1291
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
who uses step files.

1292
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And you're trying to collaborate

1293
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
on like development of some

1294
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
engineering project.

1295
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Like you could use our,

1296
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
our software to like,

1297
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
you put in your file type,

1298
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
it gets piped over to them.

1299
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And on the way,

1300
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
it translates the file to the

1301
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
step type or something.

1302
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So yeah, that's,

1303
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
that's what it does.

1304
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And that's what I work on.

1305
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Just hand break it, bro.

1306
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Just hand break it pretty much.

1307
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I mean, unironically,

1308
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I mean, that's the interesting

1309
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
thing.

1310
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Everything about what our

1311
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
software does is,

1312
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and we have huge clients.

1313
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You know, like government agencies

1314
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and whatnot use the program for

1315
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
various reasons.

1316
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Oh God, the 3D models of the

1317
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
nuclear launch codes are being

1318
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
transcoded.

1319
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It all comes back to it.

1320
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The 3D models all the codes.

1321
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's like numbers.

1322
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
They're just numbers.

1323
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1324
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
No one ever looked at a 3D model

1325
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
for it.

1326
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's so ingenious.

1327
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Encrypted.

1328
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I mean, being on the development

1329
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
end, like everything we do,

1330
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
like you could replicate,

1331
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
you could just like do it on

1332
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
your own, like for every file.

1333
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But the problem is when you're

1334
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
sending like thousands of

1335
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
gigantic files, like you want

1336
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
someone to streamline the

1337
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
files.

1338
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Really, if you think about it,

1339
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
everything in life that we buy

1340
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
is kind of just a streamlining

1341
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
so that you can save your time

1342
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and not have to, you know,

1343
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
grow your own food and produce

1344
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
your own shit.

1345
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You have to buy the seeds and

1346
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
buy the stuff.

1347
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Well, that's what they say.

1348
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You spend, when you're a kid,

1349
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
you spend time to save money.

1350
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And when you're an adult,

1351
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
you spend money to save time,

1352
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
something, something.

1353
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I learned that from Hippo, I

1354
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
think.

1355
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh yeah, that's something I

1356
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
think.

1357
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's true.

1358
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, I'd never heard that

1359
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
before.

1360
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But it's true.

1361
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I always think about that

1362
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
mostly when it comes to video

1363
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
game piracy and the insane

1364
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
high-level hacking I would do

1365
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
to like my PSP to be able to

1366
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
get free games.

1367
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And it was dope as shit.

1368
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And I'd do it again in a hard

1369
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
beat.

1370
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It was super fucking dope.

1371
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I keep thinking like,

1372
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
is this going to be the day that

1373
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I finally eBay a PSP

1374
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and jump back into that?

1375
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Dude.

1376
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm going to play the Japanese

1377
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
version of the Bleach fighting

1378
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
game a year before it came out

1379
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
again.

1380
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Man, I got some of that shit on

1381
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
my fucking DS.

1382
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
There was like a DS fighting

1383
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
game.

1384
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But like, the world was my

1385
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
oyster.

1386
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Back when I first got into like

1387
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
ace cards for my DS.

1388
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Dude, this stuff is the shit.

1389
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I still stand by it.

1390
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The DS, I think, is the

1391
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
greatest, at least

1392
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
handheld device of all time.

1393
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And probably my favorite console

1394
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
literally of all time

1395
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
because of the ace card.

1396
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
There was so much good shit for

1397
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
it.

1398
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Being able to play Quake 1,

1399
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
the PC game,

1400
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
ported onto the DS,

1401
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
it was fucking the best.

1402
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It sounds like such a Wild West.

1403
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It was amazing.

1404
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I played Mother 3,

1405
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
you know, whatever it was.

1406
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Really?

1407
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like translated?

1408
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
On my PSP, actually.

1409
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It was on my PSP.

1410
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah.

1411
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Damn.

1412
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
There's a fan made dub

1413
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
of Western.

1414
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1415
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And it was dope.

1416
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It was like, it was fantastic.

1417
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It was fantastic.

1418
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I actually played it on a GBA

1419
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
emulator on my PSP.

1420
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I played Mother 3

1421
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and it was one of the best

1422
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
experiences on that thing.

1423
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You know what?

1424
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The entire time we're playing

1425
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Mother 3 on my PSP,

1426
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I was like, man, this just

1427
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
isn't the same.

1428
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I wish I could play this.

1429
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Hold it in your hands with your

1430
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
PSP, dude.

1431
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I can do it.

1432
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I can do it.

1433
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Have you ever considered?

1434
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
All right.

1435
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So you know, you remember back

1436
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
in the day with the PSP,

1437
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
you got a memory stick

1438
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
or I didn't use an SD card.

1439
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I had a memory stick.

1440
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Because Sony is all about

1441
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
making proprietary formats

1442
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
so they can get more money.

1443
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And those things are

1444
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
super fucking expensive.

1445
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Nowadays, they have

1446
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
micro SD

1447
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
to memory stick adapters.

1448
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So imagine just getting like

1449
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
128 gig fucking micro SD

1450
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
slotting into your PSP

1451
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and putting like every game

1452
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
ever on your PSP.

1453
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah.

1454
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That's the dream.

1455
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Times have changed.

1456
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
We didn't have that shit back then.

1457
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That's why I'm like, oh fuck.

1458
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because like I'd have like

1459
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
an eight gig card

1460
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and feel like a god.

1461
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Like I can have three games

1462
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
on here.

1463
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I know, right?

1464
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
God.

1465
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
PSP.

1466
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It was too early.

1467
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It was too early.

1468
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The technology now.

1469
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
We can fucking crush it.

1470
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah.

1471
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's true.

1472
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That's true.

1473
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Oh.

1474
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What warm times.

1475
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
We're going to get a cubic ninja

1476
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
port to switch.

1477
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That's what I want to know.

1478
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Speaking of Sony PlayStation,

1479
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
recently, the other day,

1480
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I replayed Ratchet and Clank 2

1481
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
because I just feel like,

1482
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I just feel like nostalgic

1483
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
playing the same five video

1484
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
games I've played my entire life

1485
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and I will never play anything new.

1486
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And I've realized that

1487
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
a lot of that game is dog shit,

1488
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
actually.

1489
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Oh no.

1490
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Like the game is fun

1491
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and it's really nice

1492
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and all that.

1493
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
But like I was paying attention

1494
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
to the story

1495
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and when you're a kid

1496
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
you don't really understand

1497
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
anything that's going on.

1498
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You see the jokes

1499
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and you go,

1500
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
but that's it.

1501
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
There's a lot of

1502
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
dead ends

1503
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and nothing character-wise.

1504
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And I was thinking back

1505
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
to the first game.

1506
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Well, like the whole thing

1507
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
is about Ratchet and Clank.

1508
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
They are characters they have.

1509
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
They start off,

1510
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
like not really,

1511
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
they're unsure about each other.

1512
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
They have a falling out

1513
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and the story is about them

1514
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
as characters having a character arc

1515
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and by the end of the game

1516
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
they're best friends

1517
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and that's that.

1518
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And they're pretty much wrapped up

1519
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
at the end of the first game.

1520
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah.

1521
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And in the second game

1522
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
there's like themes hinted at

1523
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
but nothing happens.

1524
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And it's just,

1525
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
it was just sad to think.

1526
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Like they get transported

1527
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
to another galaxy

1528
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and Ratchet is like,

1529
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
ah man, I'm not a hero.

1530
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's boring being,

1531
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
having nothing to do.

1532
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And he goes to another planet,

1533
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
another galaxy

1534
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and he gets a hero task

1535
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
and he's like, oh sick.

1536
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And then

1537
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
he does stuff,

1538
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
he gets clank,

1539
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
there's cutscenes

1540
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
with funny bits in them.

1541
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Indeed.

1542
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And there's like,

1543
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
there's like a,

1544
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
there's a female

1545
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
longbacks lady

1546
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
who's got,

1547
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
who's really hot.

1548
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Hell yeah.

1549
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Hell yeah.

1550
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Before going somehow.

1551
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
But, and there's like

1552
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
very, very, very slight hints

1553
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
that Ratchet may like her

1554
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
or like he does like her.

1555
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And it doesn't go anywhere

1556
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
and Angela never like

1557
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
reciprocates that at all

1558
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
and then it ends

1559
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and that's the end.

1560
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's just like,

1561
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
it's such a shit story.

1562
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's like,

1563
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
this is the reason

1564
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
why Ratchet and Clank

1565
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
is not really considered

1566
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
a classic.

1567
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yeah.

1568
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's like,

1569
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
it's just a,

1570
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
it's just a fun game

1571
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
from, from back in the day.

1572
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And it sucks to,

1573
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
to realize that,

1574
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
oh, I guess,

1575
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I guess it actually

1576
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
wasn't that good.

1577
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I guess this is the reason

1578
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
why this is not like

1579
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
a Metal Gear Solid 2

1580
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
or anything.

1581
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
This is,

1582
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
this Ratchet and Clank.

1583
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I've always felt,

1584
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
yeah,

1585
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I definitely,

1586
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I love Ratchet and Clank 1.

1587
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I played 1 through 3

1588
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and really enjoyed them,

1589
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
but I felt a big,

1590
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I never felt the kind of

1591
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
attachment to the game.

1592
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Like he,

1593
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
you know what he feels like?

1594
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
This is the best way I can describe it.

1595
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
He really feels

1596
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
like a PlayStation All-Stars character

1597
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
as opposed to like a Smash Bros.

1598
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
character.

1599
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
That's a,

1600
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
that really sums it up right there.

1601
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Say with like Kratos and,

1602
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
well, no, no,

1603
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Kratos has like

1604
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
loads of character

1605
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and story and stuff.

1606
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I mean, I suppose,

1607
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
but I,

1608
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Like, have you seen,

1609
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
have you seen Jesse's video about it?

1610
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I haven't even played him,

1611
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
but like,

1612
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Jesse's explanations.

1613
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Kratos is pretty cool.

1614
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
In that video he did.

1615
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But I have played them.

1616
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So here's my expert opinion.

1617
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Kratos,

1618
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
well, that's the thing.

1619
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Kratos, just like in,

1620
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
just like Ratchet and Clank,

1621
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
for their first game,

1622
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
like narrative,

1623
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'll say masterpiece.

1624
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Like it's just,

1625
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
it's great.

1626
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It's like solid and fantastic.

1627
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
We get everything we need

1628
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
out of the character.

1629
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like everything after that

1630
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
is basically wasting my time

1631
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
with the character.

1632
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Like, oh,

1633
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
he's still sad about killing his family.

1634
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
He really wants revenge on the cops now.

1635
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You have the same problem

1636
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
with the rest of the God War games

1637
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
you have with the Don't May Cry games

1638
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
because David Jaffe

1639
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
was only involved in God of War One.

1640
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You know, honestly,

1641
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
that's, I think that's part of it.

1642
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Although, I mean, to be fair,

1643
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
like Devil May Cry,

1644
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
when it changed,

1645
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
like it changed into a thing

1646
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
that a lot of people liked

1647
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
even more than the first one.

1648
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So, you know, some people are,

1649
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I really want to spend some time

1650
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
like getting deep into Devil May Cry

1651
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
technical shit.

1652
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Cause I mean,

1653
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I feel like that's

1654
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
well-loved.

1655
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You'll be a better player than me

1656
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
cause I never fucking went down

1657
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
that rabbit hole.

1658
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I have other things to do.

1659
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
That's so surprising to me

1660
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
that you're such a big fan

1661
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and yet you're not like,

1662
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't know, like,

1663
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
isn't that the main draw of the game?

1664
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Um, I guess.

1665
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But I mean,

1666
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Other things, I guess.

1667
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I mean, my whole thing with games

1668
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
that says I've never,

1669
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I've never played a hard video.

1670
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I've never played a video game

1671
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and felt accomplished doing it

1672
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
because deep down I know

1673
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
it's a waste of time.

1674
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So, I play them to have fun

1675
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
not to get any sense

1676
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
of accomplishment from it.

1677
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Maybe someone like me

1678
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
is just better at like

1679
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
ignoring that reality.

1680
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I guess.

1681
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It's very possible.

1682
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It could be.

1683
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Have you considered that

1684
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
playing video games

1685
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
is useful for making video games?

1686
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It is.

1687
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That's why I'm playing them

1688
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
way more now

1689
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
than I have been

1690
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
for the last couple of years.

1691
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I was watching,

1692
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I was compulsively re-watching

1693
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
all of Matthew Matosis's videos

1694
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
ever made.

1695
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Of course.

1696
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Naturally, the other day.

1697
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And I was on the Mario,

1698
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the first Mario 64 video.

1699
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And I was just scrolling

1700
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
through the comments

1701
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and someone was like,

1702
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I wonder, someone said,

1703
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
and I don't know,

1704
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
tell me what you think about this,

1705
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I wonder how much of Miyamoto's

1706
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
ingenuity comes from

1707
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
how much he doesn't play games.

1708
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
How much is the fact that

1709
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Mario 64 was such a

1710
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
groundbreaking title

1711
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
that basically defined

1712
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
a new way for characters

1713
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
to move in 3D?

1714
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I wonder how much of that

1715
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
came from him not being my...

1716
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I definitely feel...

1717
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I guess in that case

1718
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
there was no template

1719
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
he could have even looked at.

1720
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But it wasn't the only time

1721
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
that he did that,

1722
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
that he pretty much

1723
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
just sort of came up with

1724
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
a whole new fucking game type

1725
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
out of whole cloth.

1726
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And show me the game

1727
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
with more developed

1728
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
movement controls

1729
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
than Mario 64.

1730
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Show me the game

1731
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
with better, more fleshed out,

1732
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
interesting movement mechanics.

1733
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Mario 65.

1734
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I forgot, of course.

1735
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I definitely feel like

1736
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
there's that aspect of game developers

1737
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
who didn't play games

1738
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
when they were younger

1739
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
because they didn't really exist.

1740
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Maybe there was Pong

1741
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
or whatever, Atari stuff.

1742
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And they have an idea

1743
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and they get into programming

1744
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
and they make it.

1745
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
He's gonna be crazy.

1746
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Just throw this out there.

1747
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
My mom was alive

1748
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
when Pong, the first video game ever,

1749
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
was released when she was young.

1750
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
First video game ever.

1751
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Well, actually, the first video game ever

1752
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
was Tennis for Two on the Oscilloscope.

1753
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Okay, well, close.

1754
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Get fucking destroyed.

1755
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's crazy.

1756
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But nowadays,

1757
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
there's a lot of people in the gaming industry

1758
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
who lose stoner idiots

1759
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
who played video games

1760
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and now they're in the gaming industry

1761
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
doing a job

1762
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
in a huge company

1763
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
that is overblown and bloated

1764
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and nobody has any artistic vision

1765
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
because they're stupid.

1766
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You know what's a great comparison to this?

1767
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Like Hideo Miyazaki.

1768
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Is that right?

1769
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Ghibli guy?

1770
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Did I say his name right?

1771
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Whatever his fucking name is.

1772
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Hidetaka Miyazaki.

1773
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Hidetaka Miyazaki.

1774
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay, right.

1775
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I mean, he's very much a...

1776
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Did he actually say anime was a mistake?

1777
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Is that like an actual quote?

1778
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Is that like a joke?

1779
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
No.

1780
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Well, so that's Ghibli man.

1781
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Okay, pretty sure he did actually say that.

1782
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I mean, it was in a larger context.

1783
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Right, right.

1784
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Well, I mean, I'm trying to get to his larger context.

1785
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Okay, Miyazaki, whatever his fucking first name is,

1786
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
from Ghibli,

1787
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
he's very much a critic

1788
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
of Otaku culture in anime.

1789
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's Hideo Miyazaki.

1790
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Hideo Miyazaki.

1791
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yes, thank you.

1792
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm a fucking idiot.

1793
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Me as a...

1794
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Right, from soft game.

1795
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That's the Hidetaka.

1796
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Okay, anyway,

1797
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
like he's very much a critic of the sort of incestuous slurry

1798
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
that is like modern anime development.

1799
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And obviously not everything's that way.

1800
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Like Maiden Abyss was a real breath of fresh air and whatever.

1801
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
All this cool stuff.

1802
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
But like the kind of incestuous slurry

1803
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
that is like modern anime...

1804
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Say it one more time.

1805
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Incestuous slurry.

1806
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah.

1807
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah.

1808
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's excellent.

1809
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Homestuck.

1810
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And like this really reminds me of

1811
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
this kind of game development approach.

1812
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Because fucking Miyamoto seems to have a very similar approach.

1813
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I think I've heard him say,

1814
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
like, you know, he makes games from a life well lived

1815
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
and like experiences had.

1816
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Whereas like, I don't know,

1817
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
what do modern game makers do?

1818
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
They grew up playing video games

1819
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
and they want to make, you know...

1820
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Want to make more...

1821
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
An iteration of...

1822
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Like another video game.

1823
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It's...

1824
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's...

1825
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
What am I trying to say?

1826
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
There's this sense that if you only...

1827
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
If you don't broaden your like the input,

1828
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
like the output could only be a lesser quality of the input.

1829
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Right.

1830
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
If you know what I mean.

1831
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Like if you don't live a life in the real world,

1832
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
when you make fiction,

1833
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
it's only going to be worse than the fiction you have consumed.

1834
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And to give him a little credit,

1835
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I get that games are more like technical

1836
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
than like a movie, for example.

1837
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Like you have to, you know,

1838
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
there's a lot of just beats and bites.

1839
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You've got to crunch to get that shit all

1840
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
working the right way so it can be tough.

1841
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But I mean, I think we all,

1842
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
we're all hungry for innovation and whatnot.

1843
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Like I think that the Securo sword play,

1844
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I know it wasn't the first to do it,

1845
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
but like it was the first game that I've ever played.

1846
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm sure there's others that really made me feel like

1847
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
this is like how a sword duel like would kind of work.

1848
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And again, I know it's not a one for one perfect.

1849
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm just saying it feels like a much further step forward.

1850
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
There was some...

1851
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
There was like the PvP sword play game.

1852
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh, you're talking about For Honor?

1853
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
For Honor, I think it's a game.

1854
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Yeah.

1855
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Where they have all those,

1856
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
sort of, that was pretty cool from what I know.

1857
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
My only defense to that is that I didn't play it

1858
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
so I can't speak on it,

1859
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
but I, if that's like better than great.

1860
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
However, Securo is like the most aesthetic game of all time.

1861
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's the same, it's the same idea.

1862
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Like the idea of blocking in a specific direction.

1863
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Like back in the day,

1864
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
you couldn't account for such precision with your animations

1865
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and stuff in 3D.

1866
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You just, if you swing nearby an enemy,

1867
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
then you hit it.

1868
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That's that.

1869
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
In other words, you can get the model clanging

1870
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
with another model very accurately.

1871
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Hey, here's a transition story.

1872
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
All that new stuff is all possible.

1873
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Don't.

1874
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Because we've entered a new era of indie games that...

1875
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That's true.

1876
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Just are...

1877
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
That's the real innovation there.

1878
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Trying to correct dark magic and evil.

1879
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So you've got games like being developed by indie creators.

1880
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Like, rolled out.

1881
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And rolled out.

1882
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You want to Google it.

1883
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It is a Super Monkey Ball game

1884
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
made by fans of Super Monkey Ball

1885
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and Rom had creators of Super Monkey Ball.

1886
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So basically,

1887
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Monkey Ball stopped making good Monkey Ball.

1888
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So the fan said,

1889
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
we'll take care of this.

1890
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
We will.

1891
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Exactly.

1892
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So they're making a new IP,

1893
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
but it is exactly the same as a Monkey Ball.

1894
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Right.

1895
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I mean, that's the same with like the...

1896
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Ega made his own like Castlevania.

1897
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Because Konami just stopped making

1898
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
2D Castlevania people.

1899
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Something, something.

1900
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Mighty number nine.

1901
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Something, something.

1902
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And that story is not uncommon anymore.

1903
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
In fact, it's sort of almost common in a way.

1904
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So you've got stuff like rolled out.

1905
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You've got stuff like what you just said, Nate.

1906
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You've got stuff like that Pokemon game

1907
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that's going to be coming out.

1908
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And you've got less direct,

1909
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
but still highly influenced games.

1910
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Stuff like Shovel Knight and Herdew Valley,

1911
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
where there's no one game that it brought us up from.

1912
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But still, you know,

1913
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
heavily derivative from games that's come before.

1914
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And you know, that's obviously been the case.

1915
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's been the case and will be the case forever.

1916
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
But a lot of indie games,

1917
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
well, many games are extremely large,

1918
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
you know, subset of games.

1919
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So I will say, I would say,

1920
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I am seeing a lot of indie games

1921
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
that are simply,

1922
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
the video game companies have

1923
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
betrayed our trust.

1924
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
They've betrayed what we like about certain IPs

1925
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
and certain game genres.

1926
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And so we are just going to do it better.

1927
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So to be fair to the companies,

1928
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
it might just be that the market shifted around them

1929
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and that they're just fucked

1930
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
because the model they used to use doesn't work anymore.

1931
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And they're slowly, you know.

1932
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
What do you mean? Explain.

1933
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Well, I mean, like,

1934
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
what I think about like Square Enix, for example,

1935
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
like, I don't think they do it on purpose

1936
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
to release a Final Fantasy like every like 10 years.

1937
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And that they're like thrilled about that or anything.

1938
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But I think that they feel pressured,

1939
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
you know, rightly or wrongly,

1940
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
that like we have to make it be like the most beautiful game.

1941
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Like we have to make it be like a big,

1942
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
gigantic, you know, world-expanding 3D action.

1943
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I think that they feel, they don't have to.

1944
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I think they feel they have to.

1945
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah, I definitely think there's

1946
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
there's like a fucking AAA game development.

1947
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
You can't say that way. You have to say AAA.

1948
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You got to be Jim Stirling about it.

1949
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's the only way to say it.

1950
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah, big games, whatever.

1951
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
There used to be different types of games

1952
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and now those types of games aren't AAA big games

1953
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
like platforms, like Wretched and Clank

1954
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
was a AAA game of its time.

1955
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
But you can't make a Wretched and Clank game nowadays

1956
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
because it'd be very niche because

1957
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
that's true, the market has shifted.

1958
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So people, they want to fill as niches

1959
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
because they like those games.

1960
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
They just don't get made.

1961
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, look at this.

1962
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Look at this rolled out fucking mouse and a ball.

1963
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Yeah, it's a mouse and a ball or a hamster.

1964
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's fucking great.

1965
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's even called a love letter to Super Monkey Ball.

1966
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, there you go.

1967
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It's so fucking cool.

1968
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That's like, you know, like isn't it fucking sick

1969
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
that like technology's gotten to the point

1970
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
where just like people with a dream can make

1971
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
exactly what took like millions of dollars

1972
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
like 10 years ago?

1973
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Indeed it is, Tom. Indeed it is.

1974
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It's pretty sick.

1975
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
The barrier to entry is so much lower.

1976
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I mean, in a sense.

1977
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah, you're totally right.

1978
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Go play Run Away from Snakes.

1979
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That would have cost millions of dollars

1980
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
to make 20 years ago.

1981
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah, I ironically want to make like

1982
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
not like a giant game,

1983
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but like a wretched and clank-esque

1984
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
like run around with punk in a three year old platform.

1985
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Oh, give her like a costume change

1986
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
where like you can be like Indiana Jones cosplaying

1987
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
and you're like, oh, these fucking snakes, bro.

1988
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm running from the fucking snakes.

1989
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Hell yes.

1990
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Give her a hand.

1991
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Yes.

1992
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
For some reason it sounds like there was like an echo

1993
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
on the run away from the snakes.

1994
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And if I didn't please a villain fall.

1995
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
A little bit of oblivion.

1996
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Oh, yeah.

1997
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
How you doing, oblivion?

1998
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
This is my quick call out.

1999
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Man, fuck you.

2000
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Congrats again on winning oblivion fall.

2001
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I'm calling you out oblivion.

2002
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Man, I'm calling you out.

2003
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Fuck you.

2004
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Man, fuck you.

2005
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Man.

2006
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
What are we talking about?

2007
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Roll out?

2008
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Kill yourself.

2009
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Hey, I'm not oblivion fall.

2010
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm your only friend.

2011
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
You gotta stick with me, buddy.

2012
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Delete everyone else's audio except for Ben.

2013
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
We gotta stage a coup.

2014
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
We gotta stage a PCP coup.

2015
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I've got a hot transition ready

2016
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
and it's that, you know, modern games development

2017
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
reminds me similarly to like,

2018
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
again tied back to the whole Hideo Miyazaki thing.

2019
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It reminds me of like the big fucking Marvel movies.

2020
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Like those like the big appeal to everybody,

2021
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
but we've lost like, like why do we watch the Marvel movies?

2022
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Like, because I watched the last Marvel movie

2023
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
and I gotta know what fucking happens.

2024
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I broke the cycle.

2025
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I broke the cycle.

2026
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I'm free.

2027
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You're not watching Endgame?

2028
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
You're breaking out?

2029
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Well, I didn't watch any Marvel movies forever.

2030
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Basically.

2031
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Well, okay.

2032
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So there wasn't even a cycle to break.

2033
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I watched the Avengers assemble.

2034
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah, pretty much.

2035
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Not for a long time.

2036
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I watched Avengers assemble

2037
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
and that's basically it.

2038
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Yeah.

2039
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I didn't watch any of them

2040
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
except for fucking, you know,

2041
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Infinity War and now Endgame.

2042
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Wait, wait, wait.

2043
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
You skipped right to Infinity War?

2044
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
That damn right I did, Ben.

2045
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
What?

2046
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Damn right I did.

2047
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Because Infinity War is just the best one.

2048
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Although, to be fair,

2049
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I want to go watch Guardians of the Galaxy

2050
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
because here those are actually good.

2051
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Guardians of the Galaxy is sick.

2052
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Civil War is fucking, not Civil War.

2053
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Winter Soldier is fucking sick.

2054
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I don't believe you.

2055
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Okay, that might be fair.

2056
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
My friends are big fans of a,

2057
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
not Thor Dark World.

2058
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Ragnarok?

2059
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Ragnarok, Ragnarok.

2060
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Is that the, maybe.

2061
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I think it might be Ragnarok.

2062
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That's the third one where he gets short hair

2063
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and it's like,

2064
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I mean, Ben doesn't know.

2065
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I don't know.

2066
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I don't know.

2067
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I just, they say that it's like really weird

2068
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and like not very weird.

2069
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It's the generally consensus good one.

2070
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah.

2071
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Like they embrace the humorous aspect

2072
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
of Chris whatever the fuck

2073
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
his name's worth.

2074
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Chris Hemsworth.

2075
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

2076
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And incidentally,

2077
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
okay, let's, I guess let's get into

2078
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
a little bit of spoilers for Endgame

2079
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
if anybody cares.

2080
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Now you know.

2081
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I sure loved Fat Thor.

2082
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I thought it was, you know what,

2083
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
love way too, way too strong a word

2084
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
of how I felt about Fat Thor.

2085
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I enjoyed and got some chuckles

2086
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
out of Fat Thor.

2087
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah.

2088
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That seems fair.

2089
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And I was surprised.

2090
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So that was cool.

2091
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The forces of nature have conspired

2092
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
to make this for sure

2093
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
the last Marvel movie I will ever watch.

2094
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Now this may be,

2095
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I think a lot of people probably feel that way.

2096
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I know that they do for a lot of reasons.

2097
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Like everybody's retiring.

2098
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Like everybody's retiring.

2099
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Come on, man.

2100
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
There's two more Spider-Man movies after this.

2101
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You gotta go see Spider-Man.

2102
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Whatever, Spider-Man.

2103
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I don't even know who that is.

2104
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
That's probably good.

2105
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I like Spider-Man.

2106
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Spider-Man, the only good Spider-Man

2107
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
is the first one.

2108
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You mean with the

2109
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Sam Raimi.

2110
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
That's the first one.

2111
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm planning my flag in the sand here.

2112
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I unironically love the MCU

2113
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and I watched all of them.

2114
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Yeah.

2115
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
This may surprise some people.

2116
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I've actually like

2117
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
kept up with Marvel pretty.

2118
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I wouldn't say,

2119
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I've not seen every single movie.

2120
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I wouldn't say I've even seen half the movies.

2121
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
But from like,

2122
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
basically since the first Avengers,

2123
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I've seen the big ones.

2124
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
So like, you know,

2125
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I've seen all the Avengers.

2126
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I've seen all the group ones.

2127
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And I've seen a few,

2128
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
you know,

2129
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
a lot of the standalone ones.

2130
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Here's my thing.

2131
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I've been watching the Marvel movies

2132
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
since X-Men in 2000

2133
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
before it was full.

2134
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Because I've loved comics

2135
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
since I could read.

2136
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So this isn't like me getting on the hype train

2137
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
of like, oh man, this is the new thing.

2138
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
There's just the thing I've always loved

2139
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
since the womb just happens to be

2140
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
in the public spotlight right now.

2141
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Well, that's great.

2142
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
When everybody's shuffled away

2143
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and they don't give a shit about Marvel anymore,

2144
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I'm still going to be there with three other people

2145
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
as they ruin everything

2146
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and drive it onto the ground.

2147
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I'm going to make an angry rant about it on YouTube.

2148
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I'll still be there.

2149
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I look forward to that.

2150
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I think about there is a store in Boston

2151
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
that I always walk past and it always makes me think.

2152
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
There's a Harry Potter store

2153
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
on Newberry Street

2154
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
that is just taking you to Harry Potter

2155
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
as an IP.

2156
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It is the wizard store.

2157
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And I always walk by it and I think,

2158
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
how glorious must it be

2159
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
to have the thing that you like

2160
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
have an entire store

2161
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
dedicated to it.

2162
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That it's such a large force

2163
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
in culture that you're able

2164
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
to just go to a full store.

2165
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
That's why every day on the Harvard Square

2166
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
in that curious George store.

2167
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah.

2168
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
There's a curious George store.

2169
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
There is one curious George store in the world.

2170
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
The one and only world famous.

2171
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And I brought Munchie to it.

2172
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Holy shit.

2173
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
How curious.

2174
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I think we've gone to it like basically every single time

2175
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
we've gone to Harvard Square.

2176
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Well, where else is there even to go?

2177
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
What else is there to see?

2178
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Literally nothing.

2179
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I start typing in Boston curious

2180
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and it auto-completes Boston curious George store.

2181
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That's what I want to say.

2182
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Here's the meme bin

2183
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
hanging out in Boston Experience.

2184
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I go to Harvard Square.

2185
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
We meet in the tea station.

2186
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
We walk out.

2187
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I'm always scoping out for soccer guy.

2188
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm always looking out

2189
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
praying to God that we'll see him.

2190
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
We never do.

2191
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Soccer guy has yet to re-emerge.

2192
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
He fucking devalues.

2193
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
We walk and get Mexican food

2194
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and then we go to the curious George store.

2195
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Then we go back to his house.

2196
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's the way it goes.

2197
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Is curious George like a Boston thing?

2198
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Like a product of Boston?

2199
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Like they made it from there or something?

2200
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I think it's British, isn't it?

2201
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I thought so too.

2202
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah.

2203
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Well, it was from continental Europe.

2204
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I think it was from some fucking Belgian, I think, or something like that.

2205
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Okay, I was just wondering.

2206
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Why is there a store in Boston?

2207
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
What's the store behind the store, Monchi?

2208
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Give me the lowdown.

2209
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Wait, why are you asking him?

2210
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I read a plaque.

2211
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
This is probably a butcher.

2212
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm sorry about all the curious George fans.

2213
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
All the curious heads

2214
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
who are just going to fucking put their fingers for it.

2215
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
The huge contingent of curious heads in our audience.

2216
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Not just because it was the George heads,

2217
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
aka the last king of England.

2218
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
All the George heads out there,

2219
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
where I'm not talking about you guys, stop.

2220
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
The American colonists were not a George, let me tell you.

2221
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But anyway, from what I understand, they fled.

2222
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
By the way, curious George was created by two German-born Americans.

2223
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Okay, exactly.

2224
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
So there were some people fleeing the Nazis in Europe, two Germans,

2225
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
and then they fled to America.

2226
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And I believe they landed in Boston in the Harvard area

2227
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and distributed curious George there.

2228
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
If I recall correctly, they had ridden curious George,

2229
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
or at least a prototype beta version of curious George.

2230
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And then one of the few possessions they brought to America

2231
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
were those huns.

2232
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
It was curious huns.

2233
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It didn't catch up.

2234
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
They didn't get in touch with the youth.

2235
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Curious Hitler did not.

2236
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Curious, curious Adolf.

2237
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Oh, that Adolf was pretty curious, let me tell you.

2238
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
He had some big ideas.

2239
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
He was really curious about some questions.

2240
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Which questions?

2241
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
You want to try a few ideas out.

2242
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Let me read you some curious George facts.

2243
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
When the first story, Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys,

2244
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
was published in France in 1939, George was named Fifi.

2245
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
In the United Kingdom, George was originally called Zozo in 1941,

2246
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
apparently to avoid using the name of then-king George VI.

2247
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
No way!

2248
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Okay.

2249
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
He came out in America, I think, so they changed the name.

2250
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Okay, yeah, no, no.

2251
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I think in America he was originally George, from the very start.

2252
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Okay, okay, cool.

2253
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Oh my God.

2254
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It all comes back around like a mobious strip.

2255
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Curious George, fucks curious George,

2256
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and they come to make a new curious George over and over again.

2257
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You know those bugs in the East Coast?

2258
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
They have brooding seasons.

2259
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Their entire lives are to live and fuck for like three seconds.

2260
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
So you go to a gas station in Virginia,

2261
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and then you just covered your car,

2262
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
and everything is littered with bug corpses and bugs fucking.

2263
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
That's what curious George is like in all aspects

2264
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
that could possibly be considered.

2265
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
What are we talking about?

2266
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Marvel movies, man.

2267
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
We're talking about movies.

2268
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
She's so mean.

2269
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Hey, movies, right?

2270
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Marvel?

2271
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Sure.

2272
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I haven't been keeping up with them,

2273
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
but I realized that, you know, I liked the first Captain America.

2274
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You know, it's not like I think that they suck,

2275
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
or that I'm avoiding them deliberately.

2276
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I also like the first Captain America.

2277
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I think the reason I'm not even trying to get into it

2278
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
is because there's just not enough female representation

2279
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
in these movies.

2280
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh, that's true.

2281
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
There's this push to get more females in movies or in media,

2282
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
but there's not enough push to get females in good media,

2283
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
and Marvel movies would have been-

2284
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Dude, not enough push to get more female CEOs.

2285
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Hip-hop, you're way off base right now,

2286
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
and you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

2287
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Did you go see Captain Marvel?

2288
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Did you go see the Avengers Endgame

2289
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
where they had an all-lady scene?

2290
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I basically said that as a meme.

2291
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
The point is that there's just all big,

2292
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
mostly guys doing cool things, and that's fine.

2293
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And I'm gay, and that works for me.

2294
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
The Avengers is good.

2295
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I had my fill.

2296
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I've seen Thor and Iron Man 1 and 3,

2297
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
and it's like, yeah, this is good stuff.

2298
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Captain America, that was cool.

2299
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
But I don't need too much extra more of that.

2300
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
If there were more female superheroes that were cool

2301
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and not just supermodels with a sword,

2302
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
like actually cool, designed characters and stuff,

2303
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
imagine Gun Girl as a superhero.

2304
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Imagine Kit Kars, but with Gun Girl.

2305
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I'd watch that.

2306
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I mean, that's cool.

2307
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Isn't that like Kit Girl?

2308
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It does sound like Hit Girl a little bit.

2309
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Hit Girl from Kit Kars?

2310
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yeah, I'll watch that video game.

2311
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I mean, I guess.

2312
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I suppose my only pushback to this in any way

2313
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
is just like, okay, people go write great stories

2314
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
about female characters that I can't wait to know.

2315
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I just, ironically, would like more movies

2316
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
that feature female characters that are just written good

2317
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
because I don't see enough of those.

2318
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
They always seem to get panicked.

2319
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
The bottleneck is just that there aren't enough

2320
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
beloved female superheroes from the classic era

2321
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
to mine for modern content.

2322
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I'd recommend watching Jessica Jones

2323
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
the first season on Netflix if it's still on there

2324
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
and Disney hasn't pulled it.

2325
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That was a good Marvel show.

2326
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It was about a female private investigator

2327
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
who has superpowers.

2328
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
What's a superpower?

2329
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Just out of curiosity.

2330
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
She's just like strong and shit.

2331
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Okay.

2332
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Sick.

2333
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Strong female, you say.

2334
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Sounds like token representation to me.

2335
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Strong female characters, yes.

2336
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Wonderful.

2337
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
That was a really hilarious feminist joke the other day

2338
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
that actually made me laugh.

2339
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Feminist joke pick one, am I right?

2340
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Indeed.

2341
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yo, listen to this feminist joke.

2342
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Or is it a tautology?

2343
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Well, that'll be for you to judge.

2344
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Okay, here it is.

2345
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It was just like a tweet from a feminist.

2346
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
And it was simply this.

2347
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
It was like, man says to doctor as he hands him

2348
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
his newly born daughter.

2349
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
He says, you know, I kind of feel like this is just

2350
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
over pushing the whole female thing.

2351
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Why did we need to go with like a daughter in this?

2352
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It just feels forced and uncomfortable.

2353
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I mean, like why do we need, and I was like,

2354
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
okay, this is actually funny.

2355
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Yeah.

2356
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I laughed.

2357
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I laughed.

2358
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Insert any social minority or any group of any kind.

2359
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I mean, Nate with his non-black wife

2360
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
is handed a black child and Nate says in response,

2361
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
yeah, I just kind of feel like this is like forced,

2362
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
you know, black, like, you know, this just,

2363
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
why do we have to go with this direction?

2364
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Believe me.

2365
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It was very easy.

2366
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It's really like it's really easy to joke about all that.

2367
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Like fucking token female stuff.

2368
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And I heard that Wonder Woman was a good movie.

2369
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I might watch that.

2370
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It was.

2371
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's basically just that I like powerful female characters

2372
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
as in like good characters that are cool

2373
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and have risk and all that.

2374
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
There's just none of those in like things outside of

2375
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Undertale at the moment.

2376
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
What the fuck somewhere?

2377
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Wait, stop.

2378
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You're saying there are no strong women female characters

2379
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
outside of Delta Rune and Undertale specifically.

2380
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You got the monopoly.

2381
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
We got to break it up.

2382
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
We got to break it up.

2383
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
You know what I mean?

2384
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Like in the sphere of like big budget stuff,

2385
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
like Hollywood.

2386
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I mean, I guess there's fucking Cat Marvel.

2387
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I mean, I suppose.

2388
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I've heard that that's not a very good movie.

2389
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It wasn't great.

2390
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Wonder Woman apparently is a good movie.

2391
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Jessica Jones on Netflix is fucking lit.

2392
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
You got all those like Charlize Theron movies

2393
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
where she kicks people's asses.

2394
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Fortunately Vapors 3 is almost done.

2395
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Oh my God.

2396
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
That's a female character.

2397
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah.

2398
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Only a few more pages to go on that.

2399
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Now hang on.

2400
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And I've been cranking them out.

2401
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
If only someone would make a film adaptation of The Champion.

2402
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Well, that's great.

2403
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Then is it fair to describe Magda as a strong female character?

2404
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Because she seems to have some pretty serious anxiety.

2405
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
She's strong.

2406
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I mean, what do we mean by strength here?

2407
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
She's strong.

2408
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
You know what it means.

2409
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
You know that it doesn't mean that.

2410
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Stop.

2411
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I don't mean like powerful.

2412
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Well-realized, well-defined.

2413
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Well, okay.

2414
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Wait.

2415
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Is a character.

2416
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Not written to be merely a sex thing.

2417
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Okay.

2418
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Wait, wait, wait.

2419
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So is the question here.

2420
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Is the quandary.

2421
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Can a character be a strong female character

2422
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
if she is written to be weak?

2423
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Like emotionally and in terms of like will and stuff.

2424
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Yeah.

2425
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I mean, I would think so.

2426
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I mean, no, right?

2427
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Yes.

2428
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Maybe you just don't understand what strong means.

2429
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Of course.

2430
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I'm shocked.

2431
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Nate, I'm shocked and appalled.

2432
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Strong female character.

2433
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
This is like a whole thing that like I thought we were,

2434
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I thought we as society had understood.

2435
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Okay.

2436
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
That a strong female character doesn't mean someone

2437
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
who is a badass.

2438
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It means someone who just.

2439
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Well, yeah, yeah.

2440
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Like to me, it literally just means a well-written

2441
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
female character.

2442
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Okay.

2443
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Well, so if you've got like, for example, like a mom

2444
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
in some show who's, I don't know, whatever,

2445
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
she's like a mom and she's like really competent

2446
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
and good at stuff.

2447
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And maybe she has an interesting backstory

2448
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and whatever.

2449
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Okay.

2450
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Sure.

2451
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Strong female character.

2452
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But like, what if we just have like a biopic

2453
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
about like a, like a depressed, sad,

2454
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I don't know, like disempowered girl

2455
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
and like, sure, we get way into her backstory

2456
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and we learn all about her,

2457
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
but like everybody walks all over her

2458
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
and let's just say this is a sad movie where she has

2459
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
no arc where she gets over it.

2460
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It's just kind of a portrait into her sad life.

2461
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And she is.

2462
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That would be a tragedy.

2463
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We will describe her as like weak-willed and whatnot.

2464
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Is that a strong female character?

2465
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I think it, well, I mean, I guess it depends

2466
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
how people want to use the phrase.

2467
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
To me, the answer is yes.

2468
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Well, okay.

2469
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I guess good female character would be a better way.

2470
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I mean, I'd probably go with that.

2471
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
But I mean, whatever.

2472
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I get the idea.

2473
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Well, you know, I don't know.

2474
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Maybe when people say strong female character,

2475
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
they do mean like a fucking badass superhero

2476
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
that they can look up to.

2477
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Look, isn't the idea that otherwise,

2478
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
why wouldn't they just say good?

2479
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I think there is a contingent of people who do that

2480
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
because like, if you look at like female characters

2481
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
that have been introduced in like comic books

2482
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and like popular media as of recently,

2483
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
they're always like borderline Mary Sewish

2484
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
that like they just are invincible

2485
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and conquer everything and don't face challenges.

2486
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Isn't that just what superheroes are like?

2487
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I mean, not all.

2488
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Well, I mean, not true.

2489
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Lots.

2490
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Like most superheroes are Mary Sewish.

2491
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I think a great example of this in comic books

2492
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
was Riri Williams as the female Iron Man.

2493
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Everybody just instantly loved her.

2494
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
She was smarter than Tony Stark,

2495
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
even though she was like a little kid.

2496
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Everyone just like saying her praises.

2497
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Nobody mistrusted her.

2498
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And it was just like, it felt very artificial

2499
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
because like she's a black girl.

2500
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
So she cannot, if we say anything bad about her,

2501
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
we're racist.

2502
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
So we can't do that.

2503
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So she's definitely strong in that sense, right?

2504
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Right.

2505
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But this is like not a well-developed character.

2506
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I mean, that's what I would consider

2507
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
like a misunderstanding of the desire

2508
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
for more strong female characters.

2509
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Your character is only as strong as the adversity

2510
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
they overcome.

2511
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
And if they...

2512
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Oh yeah, that's true.

2513
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Like the reason I like characters like...

2514
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I mean, nobody knows what gun girl's personality is like.

2515
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
She shoots people and she's really angry all the time.

2516
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And she's a total badass, you know, all that stuff.

2517
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But she's like really like emotionally distraught

2518
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
and fucked up and that's what is cool about her.

2519
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Okay.

2520
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Like she has a lot of mental problems

2521
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
and she doesn't know how to love people.

2522
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
She shoots them, you know, she kills them.

2523
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
She's an RFCK character, you know?

2524
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So like a lot of superheroes that are good

2525
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
are people who are, you know, they're super powerful

2526
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
but they can't deal with their real life

2527
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
or like they have, you know, Tony Stark is a good example

2528
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
because he's such an asshole all the time.

2529
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Is he really that?

2530
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Well, he's snarky, I suppose.

2531
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
He's a snarky piece of shit and he's like...

2532
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
He finds it difficult to be genuine or to, you know...

2533
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
He gets so worked up in his work

2534
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
that he doesn't have time for social stuff

2535
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
and he feels depressed at certain times.

2536
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Like it's just more interesting, the more human.

2537
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Spider-Man is the classic example of a superhero

2538
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
who is like...

2539
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
The strong female character.

2540
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Yeah.

2541
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Who's like got all the power but his real life

2542
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
is all fucked up because of it.

2543
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Or he can't fix his real life because even the spider...

2544
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Is there any...

2545
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Spider powers.

2546
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
In the term, strong female character

2547
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
isn't part of the kind of idea behind that

2548
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
like an inspirational figure?

2549
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah, I guess.

2550
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I think so.

2551
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I guess.

2552
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
A lot of time.

2553
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
There's aspiration there.

2554
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Isn't the idea that we wanted to depict

2555
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
like strong women on screen so that little girls

2556
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
would be like, I can do that too.

2557
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Well, yeah, it's not to show...

2558
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
It's not like literally...

2559
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I mean, in my...

2560
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I'm aware it's not so direct.

2561
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It's not like they have to be physically strong

2562
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
or mentally strong.

2563
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Yeah.

2564
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
They have to have a flaw and overcome it.

2565
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
That's like a normal hero character or thing.

2566
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Let me tell you, you show me...

2567
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
You show me a quote-unquote strong female character.

2568
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I'll show you a woman I can choke out real fucking quick.

2569
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Just fucking choke her out.

2570
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Like if there was like a female character

2571
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
who was a superhero,

2572
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
she's like Captain Marvel or whatever.

2573
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And she has like a crippling social...

2574
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Oh my god, you're talking about Jessica Jones.

2575
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Just go watch Jessica Jones.

2576
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I'll go watch it.

2577
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I mean, I don't have Netflix and I never will

2578
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and just pirate it.

2579
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Since there's ambiguity,

2580
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I guess I'm gonna keep using it just to mean

2581
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
like a strong female character

2582
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
is just a well-written relatable character.

2583
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I think that's what it should be.

2584
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Okay, but that may introduce confusion.

2585
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Give, another thing you should definitely check out.

2586
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Well, I'm not introducing confusion.

2587
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
There's already confusion.

2588
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I mean, that's true.

2589
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
People are already using the word multiple different ways.

2590
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
That's true.

2591
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That's true.

2592
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Tom, yeah.

2593
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Hey, oh god.

2594
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Tom was gonna say something to me.

2595
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Before we wrap up on this topic,

2596
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I don't know if you've played it yet,

2597
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
but something that would probably hit all these notes

2598
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and also be your fucking aesthetic

2599
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
beyond good and evil for PS2,

2600
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
you should play it.

2601
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh, I've heard of that.

2602
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
She's got green lipstick.

2603
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Yeah, her name's Jade.

2604
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I almost keep saying Jade Empire,

2605
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
but her name is Jade.

2606
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It's fucking sick.

2607
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
It's got like this hand-painted,

2608
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
low-poly, PS2, gorgeous aesthetic,

2609
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
and the main character is a chick,

2610
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
and she's cool,

2611
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
and she's like a journalist-photographer kind of thing,

2612
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
but she also has this cool staff.

2613
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You beat the shit out of stuff.

2614
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
You try to unlock undercover, conspiracy shit.

2615
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
It's fucking lit.

2616
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You should play it.

2617
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You play as Anita Sarkeesian.

2618
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah.

2619
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
That's correct, Ben.

2620
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
That's correct.

2621
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Right.

2622
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I should make clear that this is not because

2623
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I have high moral standards.

2624
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It's literally just because I see a lot of characters,

2625
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
and sometimes I also like to see a sexy one also.

2626
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Right.

2627
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I like girls.

2628
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Women are just sex objects to hypocrite.

2629
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
You heard it here, folks.

2630
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
That's all he wants.

2631
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'd like to see boobs on the screen,

2632
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
as well as a relatable character.

2633
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You know, is that so much to us?

2634
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It's great when you can have both, I suppose.

2635
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It's the standard meme.

2636
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
It's like if you're going to be staring at someone's ass

2637
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
for like 10 plus hours,

2638
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
and I also would be one you like to have.

2639
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I reject that framing.

2640
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
No, this is a nightmare.

2641
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
This is a fucking...

2642
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
This is a patriarch we've done.

2643
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Hey, I'm just being real.

2644
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
We were doing so well,

2645
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and then we became a patriarchal nightmare

2646
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
in the snap of the finger.

2647
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Look, I'm a proud member of the patriarch,

2648
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
a card carrying to my grave.

2649
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Patriarch?

2650
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Hey.

2651
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I feel like it would be disingenuous of me

2652
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
to not mention that that is part of it.

2653
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Sure.

2654
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That's fair.

2655
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
That's fair.

2656
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Thanos is so dumb now.

2657
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
He's like so mean.

2658
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Dumb and thick is what he is, my dude.

2659
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Support our regressive politics.

2660
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Dude, straight up when Thanos was farming

2661
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
in his fucking white t-shirt and ripped jeans,

2662
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I straight up got hard and pre-compromise.

2663
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I'm just going to say, I orgasm to the theater.

2664
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I'm not joking.

2665
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Support our regressive politics at patreon.com

2666
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
slash the pro-crastinators patriarch.

2667
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
The pro-women-crastinators?

2668
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
That's what I have to say.

2669
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
The pro-LGBTQ-crastinators?

2670
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
That was a good cap to the ad.

2671
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Was me coming to Thanos.

2672
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Dude, okay.

2673
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It's not weird.

2674
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
He just was in like relatable clothing.

2675
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
You mean like when he was at his farm?

2676
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Yeah.

2677
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
He was wearing his fucking...

2678
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
He was wearing his pure cotton,

2679
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
like, you know, marbled, gray and white t-shirt.

2680
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
His ripped jeans.

2681
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Always his heather gray, heather gray.

2682
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
He was old and greasy.

2683
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
He just, he was eating.

2684
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Listen, it's not weird.

2685
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
He wasn't wearing his space farmers.

2686
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Wait, was Thanos in jeans and a t-shirt?

2687
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yes.

2688
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
That's what we're saying, yes.

2689
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It was not jeans, goddammit.

2690
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Yes, it was.

2691
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
It totally fucking was.

2692
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It was skinny jeans.

2693
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Nice.

2694
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I don't think he could wear skinny jeans.

2695
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
He's too dummy.

2696
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Oh, he made it work.

2697
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh, yeah.

2698
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Thick jeans.

2699
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Well, this has been thoroughly unpleasant.

2700
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Hey, guys.

2701
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Let's, let me just fuck it.

2702
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I'm gonna fuck it right up.

2703
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Okay.

2704
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Let's just fucking, let's fucking go.

2705
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Hey, trans athletes, trans women in female athletics, acceptable?

2706
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Probably not, no.

2707
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Discuss.

2708
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Okay, considering the fact that we have, in terms of our leagues, we've made a distinction

2709
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,000
between men and women's, like, leagues, that having people who, let's just, I mean, they're

2710
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
somewhere on the border between, in some capacity.

2711
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I'm just saying it adds complexity, and I don't know.

2712
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I've heard some people suggest a trans league, because it just, I mean, I don't know.

2713
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
That seems kind of, you know, shitty as well.

2714
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I mean, that would just end up being a trans woman league.

2715
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And the other option, considering that men outperform women in base, in almost every

2716
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
athletic capacity.

2717
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
There's no solution that makes everybody happy, because like, if you just say, oh, let's have

2718
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
everybody compete together, then I'm sorry, but women are just gonna lose.

2719
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You know, okay, here's what I find, here's what I find interesting about this.

2720
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I watched a YouTube video about it the other day, and I was like, hmm.

2721
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
What I find interesting about this question is, one of the arguments for it, right, some

2722
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
of the people that are like, no, we should let them compete, is like, well, people already

2723
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
have natural advantage, right?

2724
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Like, some people have longer legs than others, and those people are just natural.

2725
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Like, should we say, oh, well, people whose legs are too long shouldn't be able to compete?

2726
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Why, then we say, oh, well, if you were born a man, then you shouldn't be allowed to play,

2727
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
just because that gives you, like, you know, a statistical advantage.

2728
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
More testosterone, bigger hands, whatever the fuck.

2729
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Imagine me competing in basketball versus, like, Michael Jordan, like, you know, if that's

2730
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
quote-unquote unfair, you know?

2731
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I have a solution in my head.

2732
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I don't agree with that line of thought that leads to, therefore, we should allow trans

2733
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
women to dominate the, wait, let me finish, to dominate the female, like, sports leagues,

2734
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
but I do think that it kind of highlights just the inherent unfairness of the entire,

2735
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
you know, just the entire enterprise.

2736
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
There's something of a naturalistic, I guess, fallacy when it comes to this stuff, but yeah.

2737
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Maybe this is like, it couldn't be put into practice for most things.

2738
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:44,000
But, like, surely if there are, like, you know, some people are naturally more gifted than

2739
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
others, and it's like, gender is becoming less of a thing.

2740
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Men and females, like, if you're a man or a woman, go here or there.

2741
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Really, what separates the top from, you know, the women from the men, generally, is that

2742
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
the men are usually stronger, more athletic.

2743
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:07,000
What if, instead of separating them at the start by male or female, you separate them

2744
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
by their performance?

2745
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
So, like, there's, like, a bracket, like, a heavyweight or a, you know, whatever.

2746
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Well, it's then, like, in, like, 99% of cases, then the top bracket will just be men, and

2747
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
maybe trans women.

2748
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Yeah, like, that's, that would be how it would usually go.

2749
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
But that would make it so that trans people could just go to wherever they, like, physically

2750
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
are capable, regardless of what gender they, you know, ascribe themselves.

2751
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
They can just be in, like, somewhere on the list.

2752
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
The problem with that is that then, you know, the category to watch is the top category

2753
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
of performance, and that's men.

2754
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I'm not sure it is.

2755
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Isn't that already a problem, though?

2756
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Like, men's sports already supremely outperform women's sports across the board.

2757
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And I mean, you know, that's no, that's no grand conspiracy.

2758
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It's just that, you know, the men just do better.

2759
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Nobody said it was a grand conspiracy, Nate.

2760
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Yeah, okay.

2761
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Okay, okay.

2762
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Well, you know, it's a biological difference.

2763
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Like, I know that it would be basically the same thing, except the...

2764
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Oh, wait, to be fair to my point, women might be, like, promoted less.

2765
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
So, perhaps there is something to be said for that.

2766
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I get it.

2767
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Go on.

2768
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Go on.

2769
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I just feel like if the gender thing is the problem, and it's, like, kind of controversial

2770
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:36,000
and, like, maybe unfair in certain situations or maybe all situations to, you know, say

2771
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
to a trans person that you're not literally allowed because we don't, you know, society

2772
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,000
doesn't believe that you are the gender that you think you are or, you know, you've decided.

2773
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,000
If the difference is in physicalness and not gender, and gender is just usually, you

2774
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
know, it's a safe bet that a man would be stronger than a woman, therefore, separate them.

2775
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I think separating on something other than gender will solve at least the controversial

2776
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
nature of it, if you know what I mean.

2777
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Well, you know what I've heard?

2778
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I've heard a thought.

2779
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Basically, yeah, like, we could either get broader and, like, you got two ways to go.

2780
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
You can get broader and just say, like, everybody competes.

2781
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But the thing is that, yeah, I mean, it's going to make it harder for some people.

2782
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Women athletes will have a fucking tough time with that.

2783
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,000
The reason we have men and women's leagues is because there is a significant performance

2784
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
gap that would basically mean that women can't compete.

2785
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So the only thing you can do is you have to atomize, and currently we atomize basically

2786
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,000
on men and women, but, like, I've heard proposals that, like, let's atomize on specifically,

2787
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
like, we measure your testosterone and we use your, or, like, you have to be within a

2788
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
certain range of testosterone.

2789
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
You know, it's interesting you bring that up.

2790
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
But there's so many more things than just testosterone that do it.

2791
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

2792
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Testosterone alone does not account for all the differences.

2793
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Of course.

2794
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Of course not.

2795
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Well, Nate, it's interesting that you bring that up because I was about to bring it up

2796
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
because I saw a news story and I didn't read it because I didn't care.

2797
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I didn't know this was going to be coming up on the PCV.

2798
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
But there was a story of, like, some athlete who was a natural born woman and she just

2799
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
happened to have extremely high levels of testosterone.

2800
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Right.

2801
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
See, that's the thing.

2802
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I saw that on Twitter.

2803
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
She got disqualified.

2804
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Yeah.

2805
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
That's fucked up.

2806
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Like, that's straight up doing the thing, like, oh, well, people whose legs are too long

2807
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
can't compete in basketball because they're too naturally abandoned.

2808
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
That throws a whole other fucking fan of worms into this.

2809
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
See, there is no good answer here.

2810
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
There is no good solution.

2811
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I mean, I think my answer is the goodest because it, you know, ultimately, not much will change,

2812
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
but for the people that it doesn't, like, the normal male-female gap doesn't necessarily

2813
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
apply to, like a woman who's got a lot of testosterone is really strong, who can compete

2814
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:47,000
with men, can, like, fight their way up to the top of that bracket or whatever.

2815
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:54,000
No, no, no, you're pretty much just proposing that we eliminate the gender divide in the

2816
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
inathletic league.

2817
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I mean, which is how, well, I mean, yeah, I guess you could argue that, but, like, we

2818
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
all, we have women's leagues for a reason and it's because they would be, they would

2819
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
generally, in most events, they just, they just wouldn't play.

2820
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Sure.

2821
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
And I think on the one hand, that is a problem, obviously.

2822
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,000
But on the other hand, I think if all you really care about purely is merit and, like,

2823
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,500
there's only, like, two or three percent, you know, women participation, that means those

2824
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:26,500
two or three percent are good enough to compete and then you have as close to an equal playing

2825
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,500
field as you can get.

2826
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:34,000
I mean, the thing is, it's a nice idea in theory that it should be entirely a meritocracy.

2827
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Yeah.

2828
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:42,000
But I understand the rationale for dividing the league to give, you know, more people

2829
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
the chance to.

2830
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
It's a very damned if you do, damned if you don't, because right now you have, you have

2831
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
the women's league being pissed off because they get paid less than, like, nobody cares

2832
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
as much, but if you did the meritocracy thing, they'd be pissed off at, like, nobody could

2833
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
make the cut.

2834
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
They would be out of the league.

2835
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
You know, I ever hear the story about the universal tennis ranking or whatever, and Serena Williams

2836
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
once said, like, you know, I'll beat any man.

2837
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
But, like, in the universal tennis ranking, she's, like, below, like, the top hundred,

2838
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
because, you know, it's all fucking guys and some, like, I don't know, she was offered

2839
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
a chance to, like, fight some, like, college senior, like, like, not a pro, but like a guy.

2840
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And I think she returned it down.

2841
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
She's like, no, I can't beat this guy.

2842
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Or, you know what?

2843
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I might be misrepresenting her point, but the point is, like, they're different.

2844
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Men are different.

2845
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
It's just, yeah, it's unfortunate, but it's the sad reality.

2846
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And I, like, I'm being, I don't know, I guess I'm being feminist to hear, like, I don't

2847
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
want to fuck over women in that way.

2848
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And I have great empathy for trans people, too.

2849
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
But it's just, but how do we make a fair system?

2850
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And I have no idea.

2851
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I have no idea.

2852
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
But then, yeah, I don't know.

2853
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Like, I've heard, I don't know.

2854
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:48,000
This video that I watched about it was, like, a couple of trans women, like, placed really

2855
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
highly in, like, oh, fuck, it was like an Olympic qualifier, I think, for, like, a sprinting

2856
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
contest.

2857
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And they pushed out that girl, right?

2858
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Yeah, yeah, they pushed, they pushed out, like, this other girl.

2859
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And it's like, I don't know, doesn't seem right, you know?

2860
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Well, Nate, it's interesting you bring up that example with, like, the, what's your name,

2861
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
is, like, a hundred places below on the universal tennis thing.

2862
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Because if the gap is that wide, and we let trans athletes participate, like, over time,

2863
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
that'll just mean, like, all the benchmarks for women's athletics will just be out of

2864
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
reach for naturally born women.

2865
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Bro, bro, just the other day, a, a, what, I can't determine, sorry, it's like a male trans,

2866
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
like, okay, biologically one, whatever.

2867
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:34,000
No, no, wait, the other way, sorry, a biological male trans woman competed in, like, a weight

2868
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
lifting competition.

2869
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I don't forget the deals.

2870
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,000
But, like, shattered, like, every fucking record they have, because pure weight lifting is,

2871
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
like, one of the biggest ways men have a huge advantage over women, and just, like, like,

2872
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
what's going on?

2873
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I figured it out.

2874
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I figured it out.

2875
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
You rename the, the brackets, cis male, cis female.

2876
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
But that's, that's, that's, I guess, just, like, outwardly, quote, unquote, discriminatory?

2877
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Well, that, well, that would, that would basically mean you'd have to then have a trans

2878
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
league.

2879
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I don't want trans people to not be able to compete, it's just, but there's...

2880
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,000
No, no, no, no, no, the, the, the, you can, you, cis male plus trans...

2881
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
So, you'd have, you'd have a trans female participate with cis male, because biologically

2882
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
they were male to start?

2883
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I mean, like, like, if, if, like, I didn't care about, like, people's feelings, that's

2884
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
one of the ways.

2885
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Now you're speaking my language.

2886
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Well, like, I guess it makes sense.

2887
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
That's the way it has to be done.

2888
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Like, okay, okay, I, I guess it would make sense, right?

2889
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
If, if, like, the, the metrics or whatever say that, like, biological men prefer better

2890
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
men in a sport, and therefore, if you, you know, you got this one league, and you, maybe

2891
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:45,000
you call it the men's league, but you, like, it's, like, women can compete in it, right,

2892
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
including trans women.

2893
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Yeah.

2894
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
And then you got the female league, and, like, but, like, only, well, no, that's...

2895
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I don't see any solution here.

2896
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
That's exactly...

2897
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I think the thing that's, that's interesting is...

2898
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Well, I guess the solution is that, well, I guess that is allow trans women to compete

2899
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
in the men's league at, I mean, that's, you know, that's basically just saying, well,

2900
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
for all intents and purposes, biar sports, you are men.

2901
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Which, I mean, maybe for the, maybe for the sake of, of competition, that's just something

2902
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
you gotta do.

2903
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Yeah.

2904
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And if, like, there's any, because, like, the trans women that perform and break all

2905
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
the records, they're quite strong, obviously.

2906
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Of course.

2907
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Because, like, the most, the strongest female people, they could, they could rip me in half

2908
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,500
in any sport.

2909
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:36,000
Any sportswoman could, could, like, fold me in, like, origami, you know?

2910
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Indeed.

2911
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Indeed.

2912
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:44,000
So, like, what if a, a, like, a scrawny man like me, a small person would to, to, to,

2913
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,000
male to female transition, they would be more female, like, biologically, like, musculature,

2914
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:56,000
like, maybe they have more potential to, to grow based on, on, I don't fucking know,

2915
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
chemicals or whatever.

2916
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
But, like, it seems to be the only ones I ever hear about are male to female people

2917
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,500
who break super records.

2918
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:08,000
There's never, like, any trans women who go into the sport who are sort of, like, middle

2919
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,500
of the range or low, you know, tier, like, bronze medal winners.

2920
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,000
We probably just don't hear about them.

2921
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
They're, they're disadvantaged.

2922
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Well, they wouldn't be breaking records if they were, if they were switching the other

2923
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
way.

2924
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
The sort of people who, like, if they performed in a men's tournament, they would do terribly

2925
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,000
and if they performed in a female tournament, they would still not do perfectly.

2926
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Yeah.

2927
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Like, we don't see any of that.

2928
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And there's this, there's this, there's this, like, idea in the back of people's heads that,

2929
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
like, what if you're, you're transitioning, you've always wanted to be a sports person

2930
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
and this is just, like, a good opportunity to win some medals.

2931
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
That's, like, that's, that's, like, really, like, a mean thing to think.

2932
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Yeah.

2933
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Yeah.

2934
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
It's, it's just, I don't know.

2935
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
There's no solution, bro.

2936
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
We're not getting anything.

2937
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Everything we've thought has been a complete dead end.

2938
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
What's, what's interesting, yeah, what's interesting to me, though, is, is, it's that argument

2939
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
about, like, well, it's not fair to begin with.

2940
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
So I, whatever, fuck it.

2941
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And it's like, well, yeah, you're right.

2942
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It's not fair.

2943
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It's not fair that some people are taller.

2944
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Some people got more tea.

2945
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Some people got whatever.

2946
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,000
But if you just follow that logic to its conclusion, then you have to question the entire institution

2947
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
of male and female leagues.

2948
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
You absolutely do.

2949
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
So, like, yeah.

2950
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
You have to question the entire idea of sports in general.

2951
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
That's true, that's true.

2952
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Like, at the end of the day, isn't, isn't sporting, isn't athletics in the end just like,

2953
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,000
just sort of a big institutionalized litmus test for who is the tallest and who is,

2954
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
has the most muscular endurance and who has, like-

2955
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And frankly, take it to its extreme.

2956
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
This really goes to all inequality of any kind.

2957
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
None of us are our own designers.

2958
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
None of us, I don't believe in free will.

2959
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I don't believe any of us have earned anything by, like, you know, any, whatever, like anything

2960
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
we've done.

2961
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
We're just programmed this way.

2962
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
We didn't choose to be born with the genetics or the parents or the environment or the brain

2963
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
state that we have at this very moment.

2964
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And so I guess this is where it kind of gets into, like, you know, more socialist stuff

2965
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
of, like, nobody deserves anything.

2966
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So we need to equalize the experience because that's only fair.

2967
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
And, like, there is logic there.

2968
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
There is logic.

2969
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I mean, you say go to the logical extreme, but I don't think people generally do that

2970
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
except in conversations like this.

2971
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Well, that'll be my counter to every time they bring it up.

2972
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Like, in any implementation of the things we've been talking about, nobody would ever

2973
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
go to the logical extreme of anything.

2974
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
They would always try to find some sort of compromise.

2975
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I don't know what idea you're putting forward, Nate.

2976
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Well, I'm saying that, like, the point of inequality there, it's like, I'm just saying

2977
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
that on a larger level of, like, our entire lives, everything we do, basically, in life,

2978
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
is a competition.

2979
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
So, you know, I'm extrapoling beyond the sport thing.

2980
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I'm just saying.

2981
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Well, it doesn't have to be.

2982
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
We kind of made it.

2983
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
We kind of designed it that way, you know, capitalism.

2984
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Well, oh, right.

2985
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
There was no competition before capitalism was invented.

2986
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It's not like people competed for resources or land control.

2987
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Oh, sure, sure.

2988
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

2989
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I know lobsters have higher.

2990
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Good.

2991
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
The point is, not everything has to be a competition, but I understand that, you know,

2992
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:10,000
this natural, yeah, sports are naturally unequal as are many arenas in life.

2993
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
What were we talking about?

2994
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I'm trying to understand.

2995
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I have one more point.

2996
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:21,000
One more point about this, right, is that the reason that it would be unfair or, like,

2997
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,000
it would suck to have everybody compete on an equal playing field, men and women in the

2998
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
same sport league would be that men would win all the trophies and they would get the

2999
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
champagne balls and, like, be happy and smiling.

3000
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Yes.

3001
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And women would never feel the success of having a gold medal around their neck and it would

3002
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
suck.

3003
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I'm sure in some cases, but very rarely, yeah.

3004
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
But, like, the argument there is that...

3005
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Neither will you or I.

3006
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Why would you do a sport if you don't win?

3007
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
That is the argument.

3008
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Like, there's no reason to do the sport if you're not going to be the best of all time

3009
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
in a world.

3010
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I mean, the goal is to win.

3011
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Hey, did you know that the NFL has no rule against female players and occasionally people

3012
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
do try?

3013
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
It's just that they never make it anywhere because, you know, they got disadvantages.

3014
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
When are we going to...

3015
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Do we have any trans-female NFL players?

3016
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Oh, shit.

3017
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Would be my immediate question there.

3018
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Yeah, I mean, that could happen.

3019
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
It's only a matter of time then, right?

3020
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I'm sure it could.

3021
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Probably could.

3022
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Yeah.

3023
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Seems inevitable.

3024
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Yeah.

3025
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
By the way, I just want to shout out real quick.

3026
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:33,400
In I Shield 21, the quarterback of the final guys that the devil bats fight against, their

3027
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:37,320
quarterback is like the best quarterback in the world and she is a woman and she's like

3028
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:40,700
the only woman on the team but she's just so good at quarterbacking and like, I think

3029
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,000
this is the ideal we all want.

3030
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Is she just like so smart and tactical?

3031
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Is that her thing?

3032
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:51,000
You know, I forget her specific like a football-based superpower which everyone has in I Shield 21.

3033
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
God, I Shield 21 is the best.

3034
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I never got that far.

3035
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
No, you should finish it.

3036
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It was so incredible.

3037
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Yeah, I want to reread it all the time.

3038
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It's so good and I love the art.

3039
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
The art by One Punch Man, everybody.

3040
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Morata, who's doing the updated manga, just so everybody knows.

3041
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Because it's so weird to me that One Punch Man is like the thing everybody knows about,

3042
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
not I Shield 21 now.

3043
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Okay, but anyway.

3044
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It never made it to the West due to its weird racial shit.

3045
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Well, maybe that's not the only reason.

3046
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I mean, frankly.

3047
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Well, sure it got scan-leaded, but that's not like a commercial release.

3048
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
You're right.

3049
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I meant to say actually released.

3050
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Well, the racial shit in there is there, but in no way is it disparaging.

3051
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
It's pretty similar to what we're saying here.

3052
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Can you explain to me the weird racial shit, please?

3053
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
It's a little gauche.

3054
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Oh, Munchie, I'll tell you.

3055
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
There is discussion.

3056
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
They go into the inherent advantages of black people.

3057
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Being black.

3058
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Yeah, basically racist white coach just has to learn that, you know, in the end of the

3059
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
day, black people are superior athletes and you gotta make people.

3060
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
It is really funny.

3061
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I'm not kidding.

3062
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
That's pretty much true.

3063
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
It's pretty much true.

3064
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Oh, okay.

3065
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:57,000
But it was like, I liked that because people shy away from that.

3066
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I mean, it is, you know, it does seem to be losing Kenyan, you know, I don't know.

3067
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Fucking look at football players in general.

3068
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
You know, it's, you know, fact, fact, I heard this on the Internet.

3069
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
The thing about Kenyans running, it's not just Kenyans.

3070
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It is a like the marathon runners.

3071
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's a specific tribe from Kenya that is like disproportionately like good at marathon running.

3072
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Maybe that's a bad example.

3073
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
But like, if you look at like, that's fine.

3074
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I just wanted to point that out as an interesting fact to it.

3075
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Yeah.

3076
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Okay.

3077
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I thought that was neat.

3078
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Well, all right.

3079
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
That was relatively pleasant.

3080
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Yeah, I'll fucking, oh, just wait till after the show.

3081
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I'll fucking rip you apart.

3082
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Fucking.

3083
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Hey, I want to point out there is a, there are a couple of good videos.

3084
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
There's a series of videos from SB, you guys know SB Nation?

3085
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I don't think so.

3086
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Well, it's the company that John Boyce, the guy who did 17776.

3087
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Right.

3088
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
It's that company.

3089
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:53,000
These videos are not by him, but there's a series called Beef History that goes into

3090
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,000
like, oh, there's one about, there's one about A-Rod and God, what's fuck?

3091
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I forget who the guy that he had a long beef with.

3092
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
That one's really good.

3093
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
And there's another one about Serena Williams versus.

3094
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Jeter perhaps?

3095
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Yes.

3096
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Yes.

3097
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Jeter and A-Rod.

3098
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Jeter and A-Rod.

3099
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I thought you were talking about like the history of roast beef.

3100
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
No.

3101
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I wish.

3102
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It's the, it's the, each video is like the history of a particular beef between two

3103
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
like professional athletes.

3104
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Yeah, that's cool.

3105
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
There's a good one about A-Rod and Jeter.

3106
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
And there's another really good one about Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.

3107
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I'm not even a sports guy, but I like some of these, some of these, you know, because

3108
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
these videos are about like the narrative.

3109
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Right.

3110
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
It's about that human drama.

3111
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It is about that human drama.

3112
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Absolutely.

3113
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
John Boyce just put, John Boyce put out a video maybe a week ago.

3114
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Oh God, I forget the title of it, but it is an examination of Bob's in sports as in just

3115
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
like, he just tracks the prevalence of people named Bob in professional sports.

3116
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And it's weird because like you can see he tracks like in, like he tracks them like by

3117
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,000
sport and like overall, and like there's a huge spike in Bob's and it's suddenly, like

3118
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,500
there's only at its peak, there were like 600, there were like 600 Bob's in professional

3119
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,500
sports.

3120
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,500
Today, nine.

3121
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,500
Bob's are dying out.

3122
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,500
Oh my God.

3123
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,500
It's a genocide.

3124
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,500
It is.

3125
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,500
It's a Bob.

3126
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,560
This is the kind of Tism we need more of in the world.

3127
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:14,980
And he goes through a couple of noteworthy Bob's like Bob's Cyclone who lost like four

3128
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:19,960
15 professional boxing rounds and then retired having never won a single match.

3129
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,760
Rest in peace, Bob.

3130
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,800
But he kept showing up night after night.

3131
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:24,800
That's, I respect that.

3132
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:25,800
I respect that.

3133
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:26,800
He put, he put the time in.

3134
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,800
Too much Bob in, not enough weave in.

3135
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,800
He was a Bob.

3136
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:30,800
That's true.

3137
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,800
He was a Bob.

3138
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,800
He was a note in this symphony.

3139
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,800
He mattered.

3140
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,800
Fair.

3141
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,800
True.

3142
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,800
Valor.

3143
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,320
What do you say we move on to the voicemails, lads?

3144
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:40,320
Anybody, anything else?

3145
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,320
Are we good?

3146
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:46,420
I've been dying to move on to voicemails because it is a voicemail that I've listened to before

3147
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:48,900
the show that I know you have picked.

3148
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:49,900
Oh, you think so?

3149
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:50,900
Okay.

3150
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:51,900
I just guarantee it.

3151
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,380
And I'm going to have a lot to say about it.

3152
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:55,380
Oh, okay.

3153
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,380
All right.

3154
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:57,380
We shall see.

3155
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:00,860
By the way, just so everyone knows, I basically just picked them and generally nobody listens

3156
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:03,620
to them or like, you know, goes and checks on them beforehand.

3157
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:04,620
As far as I know.

3158
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:05,620
I, okay.

3159
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:08,780
Well, I actually listened to a few of them beforehand.

3160
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:13,440
What I'll do is I have notifications for the email for the procrastinators on my phone.

3161
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:17,920
So I'll always get notifications when someone uploads a voicemail.

3162
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:22,640
So if there's ever, listen, guys, if you want me to listen to your thing beforehand, if

3163
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:28,040
you really care, then get a really catchy, like, munchy, please read, please listen to

3164
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,320
this and then I will listen to it.

3165
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,320
So there you go.

3166
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,320
There's how you do it.

3167
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,320
There's how you do it.

3168
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,960
Although it's still, if you're not here for the episode, we probably still won't play it.

3169
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,580
So it's, you're still kind of up in the air, but do your best, everybody.

3170
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:40,580
Okay.

3171
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:41,580
Let's move on.

3172
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:46,620
Oh, before we get to the proper voicemails, we have a man on the case, a man on the hunt

3173
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,860
for the pizza party podcast.

3174
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:53,180
We've got some wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Nate, please before, before, before you say

3175
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:59,660
that, I just want to say that before like yesterday night, I was driving around with my friend

3176
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:04,180
who was in town again, and he turned to me and he said, said, munchy, so I've listened

3177
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,520
to the PCP and my heart, my heart dropped.

3178
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,440
To pity your stomach, yeah.

3179
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:14,440
And he says, what is this, like, where's the podcast meme?

3180
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,440
I don't know.

3181
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,440
Where is it?

3182
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:19,440
I started to sweat bullets and I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.

3183
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,440
I don't know what you mean.

3184
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,440
I don't understand what you're saying.

3185
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,440
Denied, denied.

3186
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:25,520
And then we're speeding down the highway and I get out of the car as fast as I can.

3187
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,520
Yeah, that's better.

3188
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:27,520
I start bromeling.

3189
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,520
You know, ducking around.

3190
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,880
Yeah, they roll down the incline.

3191
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:35,380
Oh, well, maybe we'll be able to have some answers for him after we listen to this voicemail.

3192
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:38,860
Okay, this is from Detective Kleiner Hut.

3193
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:39,860
Let's see what he's got.

3194
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:40,860
Go.

3195
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:41,860
Greetings.

3196
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:43,260
This is Detective Kleiner Hut.

3197
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:45,860
I'm a detective for the Bureau of Foreign Investigation.

3198
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:51,500
All right, so I've been getting a lot of foreign mail from an anonymous sender telling me about

3199
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:56,140
the case of a lost podcast, the pizza party podcast.

3200
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:59,940
Sounds interesting, but the hair up don't think it's important.

3201
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,400
So I've decided to take the party case into my own two hands.

3202
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:12,560
Problem is, I'm foreign and a tourist visa ain't gonna be enough to solve this case.

3203
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,560
It's a looseness.

3204
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:18,600
You guys just accepted gay marriage, so I beg of you.

3205
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,680
I might have to give a swap or two.

3206
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,800
I will become a homosexual for the case.

3207
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,280
Detective Kleiner Hut, I'm going to the US for the pizza party case.

3208
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:31,620
Tata for now, gentlemen.

3209
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:33,620
Oh, and Pia.

3210
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:34,620
Tata.

3211
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:39,580
The moment God told me to bring my tiniest hat or bad things are gonna happen.

3212
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:40,580
Huh.

3213
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:42,580
What's that I want, huh?

3214
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:48,300
Okay, so this guy, he's going gay so we can get a green card so we can come to the United

3215
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,980
States and search for the podcast.

3216
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:51,980
That's dedication.

3217
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:52,980
That's, yeah.

3218
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:54,980
He's willing to go full gay.

3219
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:57,700
Yeah, he's going all the way full gay.

3220
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:01,720
Maybe that's why I could never find the podcast because I wasn't willing to commit to that

3221
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,720
level.

3222
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,720
Yeah, that well.

3223
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,800
You know, the problem with gays is just they're marketing.

3224
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:11,040
The guy that adapted slogan, I've got one for you, go all the way, go full gay, TM, trademarked

3225
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,040
and whatever.

3226
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,040
Yeah, that's pretty good.

3227
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,120
I think we'll get a lot of converts as a result of that one.

3228
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,000
Just put that on the trans flag, like Times New Roman font up old.

3229
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Yeah, good idea.

3230
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,880
Let's put that on a t-shirt.

3231
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:22,880
Impact font.

3232
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:23,880
Impact font.

3233
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:24,880
White impact font.

3234
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:25,880
Black border.

3235
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:29,380
Dude, it's like a line structured like a meme.

3236
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:34,220
So at the top it's go all the way and then at the bottom it's go full gay.

3237
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:35,220
Exactly.

3238
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:36,220
Exactly.

3239
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,220
With an awkward penguin in the middle.

3240
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:41,620
Yeah, you're able to stick an awkward penguin in there just for good measure.

3241
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:42,620
Just throw that in there.

3242
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:43,620
Just pick a poker dad.

3243
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:44,620
Just pick a poker dad.

3244
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:45,620
Like a Mr. Mayhem.

3245
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,620
You know what?

3246
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:47,620
You've got to put a different poker dad on each stripe.

3247
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:48,620
Yeah.

3248
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:49,620
You know what I mean?

3249
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:50,620
Because they're different colors.

3250
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:55,420
I prefer the slogan I came up for the gays with on I Am Games, I believe it was gay

3251
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:59,400
the prey away and I stand by it.

3252
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,400
That's excellent.

3253
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,400
Yeah.

3254
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:06,160
Now that opens up many deep avenues of philosophical inquiry.

3255
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:08,480
And some atheist power move.

3256
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:11,040
Okay, let's move on here.

3257
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:16,200
We've got, speaking of this, we've got the real homosexual is calling in.

3258
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,200
So let's see what you have to say.

3259
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,080
This is the same guy calling in later after the last.

3260
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,080
It might be.

3261
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:22,080
It could be.

3262
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,080
Let's see.

3263
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,080
Go.

3264
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,500
I'm going to be seeking some advice.

3265
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:32,140
You see, I would like nothing more than to start a simple, modest, well speaking family.

3266
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:37,460
But I can't reconcile this with the additional fact that I just fucking love the cock.

3267
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:38,460
I crave it.

3268
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:42,460
And I won't be fucking slammed by a massive hook with a massive knob.

3269
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:43,460
Oh yeah.

3270
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:48,140
If you have any advice regarding this matter, it would be greatly appreciated.

3271
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:49,140
Thank you in advance.

3272
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:50,140
You're so cute.

3273
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:51,140
You're just hipping.

3274
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:52,140
I got two.

3275
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:53,140
I got two.

3276
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,280
The first advice, wait, it's that you're doing the right thing.

3277
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,480
The first advice is let the Welsh race die.

3278
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,480
It's the right thing to do.

3279
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,480
Okay.

3280
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:01,480
It's the only thing you can do for a just future.

3281
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:02,480
Yeah, please.

3282
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,480
But okay, Ben.

3283
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:04,480
What do you got?

3284
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,480
What do you got?

3285
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,480
Oh, that's way better than mine.

3286
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:07,480
I was going to say two.

3287
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,480
I was going to say two words.

3288
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,480
Trans husband.

3289
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:12,280
But no, I like yours better.

3290
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:13,480
Welsh genocide now.

3291
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,480
Win.

3292
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,480
Win.

3293
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:16,480
Literally win.

3294
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,680
We've been waiting for 10 years.

3295
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:22,400
Just release it already, please.

3296
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,620
This seems like, I don't know how real this struggle is.

3297
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,820
I mean, it probably is fairly rough.

3298
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:28,820
Like, I don't know.

3299
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:30,980
I have a strong paternal instinct, I think.

3300
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:34,660
If I just so happen to be gay, that'd really throw a wrench in the works.

3301
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:35,660
Wait, wait.

3302
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:36,660
I mean, can't you?

3303
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:37,660
No, you get a donor.

3304
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:38,660
You get a donor.

3305
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,420
You get an egg donor.

3306
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:41,420
You adopt.

3307
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:42,420
Yeah.

3308
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:43,420
You have to get them.

3309
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:47,500
You have to get them pretty young so that you can inject your accent onto them so that

3310
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,660
they can't help but be Welsh all the time.

3311
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:50,660
Indeed.

3312
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:51,660
That's true.

3313
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:55,200
Everything just plays Xenoblade Chronicles 2, where there's willed characters left,

3314
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,200
right, and center.

3315
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:00,680
Like, you have a kid and you want them to have the Welsh accent, so you lock them up

3316
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:05,320
and the only media you allow them to consume is Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

3317
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,320
Yeah, that's right.

3318
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:11,520
And then you come back in a few months of them being in the pit and uh-oh, they're

3319
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,520
Japanese.

3320
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,520
Oh, shit.

3321
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,520
We went too far.

3322
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,520
Damn it, we switched on the Jap dub.

3323
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,520
God damn it.

3324
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,520
We made a mistake.

3325
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,520
We forgot to disable it.

3326
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,520
Yeah, we had to turn it off.

3327
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:23,020
Yeah, another one bites the dust.

3328
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:26,660
Well, uh-uh-uh, you know, I don't know, look into adoption, yeah, I'm sure there's, you

3329
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:29,420
know, I don't know, there's fucking gay dudes out there, you've got big old families.

3330
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,420
Just get ahead of me.

3331
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,420
Just get ahead of me.

3332
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,420
Be the best dad you can be.

3333
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:33,420
Just get ahead of me.

3334
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:34,420
The proud gay dad.

3335
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:36,540
You know, we have two gay dads around here.

3336
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:38,980
The proud, proud tradition of two gay dads.

3337
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:40,140
Indeed, indeed.

3338
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:41,140
One day.

3339
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:42,140
One day.

3340
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:44,540
Welcome back to best dad ever.

3341
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:45,540
Who you are with.

3342
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,540
Maybe I'll have another child monthly.

3343
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:51,300
Well, we'll have you go with Barry's broods.

3344
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:52,800
I mean, it's only utilitarian.

3345
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,720
I have to have at least nine wives, I think, that's the math how it works out in order

3346
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:00,280
to, you know, be keeping the train running at any one moment.

3347
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:03,320
Maybe I'll actually make a fucking family.

3348
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,680
Okay, let's move on.

3349
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,280
We got a call from God.

3350
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,280
God is calling in.

3351
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,280
Oh, God, this asshole.

3352
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:15,280
Tom's had some harsh words for him recently, but, you know, maybe, uh, some harsh words

3353
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,280
right now.

3354
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:18,280
Okay, let's see what he has to say.

3355
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:19,280
Go.

3356
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,280
Hello.

3357
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:24,180
It is me, God.

3358
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:32,260
My question to the DCD is, if you were to meet me, God, what would you ask me?

3359
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:33,260
Yes.

3360
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:34,260
God.

3361
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,500
Can't you handle the reverb assholes?

3362
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,500
God.

3363
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,500
Turn down the reverb is the first thing I'd ask.

3364
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:40,500
Is that, that's it?

3365
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,500
That's it?

3366
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,500
That's it?

3367
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,220
I'd ask you from where you hail.

3368
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:51,240
I'd ask for a fucking, I'd ask to fucking leave me alone, please.

3369
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:56,880
Don't, don't, don't ever talk to me or my gate, my two gay sons ever again.

3370
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:01,120
I'd say, I'd say put dispenser here and I'd point nine.

3371
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:05,120
Tom, Tom, you've had some, some back and forth with God recently.

3372
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:08,320
What would you say if he appeared before you?

3373
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:11,120
Uh, fuck you, buddy.

3374
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,120
Yeah.

3375
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,120
I mean, okay.

3376
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:14,300
I hate God.

3377
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,300
What's the deal with this capitalism thing?

3378
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:17,620
What's with all this inequality?

3379
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:19,500
God damn it, God.

3380
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:23,260
I'm about to ruin the next, the voice down for the next two months.

3381
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:27,820
God, can you please put a wah-wah on your next, uh, your next recording, please?

3382
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:28,820
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3383
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:29,820
I take my answer back.

3384
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:30,820
I take my answer back.

3385
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,740
I have, I have the perfect thing to ask God.

3386
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:33,740
Okay.

3387
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:35,740
Where's the podcast?

3388
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:36,740
Yes!

3389
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:40,340
Oh my God, I couldn't, I had abandoned hope.

3390
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:41,340
I had abandoned hope.

3391
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,340
I didn't even think of it.

3392
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,360
No.

3393
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,360
That's true.

3394
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,360
You're right.

3395
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,360
You got to keep hope alive.

3396
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,360
That's, that's the litmus test.

3397
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,360
If he can't give you an answer, clearly not actually God.

3398
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:49,360
That was right online.

3399
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,360
Oh, that's so true.

3400
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,360
Atheism for the win.

3401
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,360
You got him coming and going, Tom.

3402
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:53,360
That's finesse right there.

3403
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:59,360
Uh, I would repeat the entire final cut scene of the Simpsons game for Xbox 360, the Simpsons

3404
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,360
Finland confronts God.

3405
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:04,760
And then I would challenge him to a DDR match and I would win using the Xbox 360's terrible

3406
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:05,760
D-pad.

3407
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:10,480
But I would still overcome any challenge in front of me.

3408
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,100
And I would destroy the Prey station.

3409
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,100
I would destroy it.

3410
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,100
Oh yes.

3411
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:16,100
Please do.

3412
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,100
Please do.

3413
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,100
Um, okay.

3414
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,100
Let's move on.

3415
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:21,340
Uh, the Japanese man, Yuta, uh, is calling it.

3416
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,860
Let's, uh, let's hear you say, go.

3417
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:23,860
Okay.

3418
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:24,860
Okay.

3419
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:27,860
So here's a D-D, a D-D bro impression.

3420
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:28,860
Uh-huh.

3421
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:33,860
So Japanese is in the middle of hell here.

3422
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:34,860
Stop.

3423
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:35,860
Stop this.

3424
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:36,860
Stop.

3425
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:41,720
Let's shut up fucking down, I hope.

3426
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:50,040
Nate, Nate, we trust you to get things for quality and experience at the best quality.

3427
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:51,040
There he goes.

3428
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,040
All right.

3429
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,040
Is that it?

3430
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:56,040
Is this the first inductee into the voice jail as we were discussing before?

3431
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,040
Get this guy on the teen CP.

3432
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,040
Get this guy on the teen CP.

3433
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:59,040
Get this guy on the teen CP.

3434
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,040
Oh yeah.

3435
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,440
We announced, we announced a new concept on the PCP.

3436
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,320
You've heard of the Hall of Fame.

3437
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,360
You've heard of the voice grail.

3438
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:10,260
The Gary for the voice jail, for when you're a shitty voice girl that we fucking hate,

3439
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:11,700
we're putting you in the voice jail.

3440
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:17,180
And you Japanese man, you're going straight to the fucking voice jail.

3441
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:20,540
If you get put in the voice jail, you have to double your patronage.

3442
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:21,540
You have to.

3443
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:23,540
That's how you get out.

3444
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:24,540
It's the only way to get out.

3445
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:25,540
You gotta buy your way out.

3446
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:26,540
That's right.

3447
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,780
The joke's on us because anyone in the voice jail is pledging nothing.

3448
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:31,860
There's already a zero dollar patron, so doubling it is still zero.

3449
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:32,860
Dammit.

3450
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:33,860
Nah.

3451
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:35,860
Plus 10.

3452
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:38,360
That looks amazing.

3453
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:43,760
We gotta define exactly how many PC pennies it takes to buy your way out.

3454
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,760
You know what?

3455
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:47,320
I mean, we can adjudicate on a case by case basis.

3456
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,320
We can levy fines.

3457
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,640
This guy's like a twenty dollar monthly.

3458
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:55,680
We're clearly on a first name basis with God now, so we can offer indulgences to anybody

3459
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,360
who's in the voice jail.

3460
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:05,860
We can offer them an affordable payment plan to mortgage their way out of voice jail.

3461
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:06,860
Okay.

3462
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:07,860
All right.

3463
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:08,860
Let's move along.

3464
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:13,020
We've got one from hashtag where's the megafauna?

3465
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:14,020
Let's find out.

3466
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:15,020
Go.

3467
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:16,020
I love megafaunas so much.

3468
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:17,020
Hey, everybody.

3469
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,780
Last week or so, y'all were talking about the domestication of the avocado, and I gotta

3470
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:21,420
say I love that shit.

3471
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:23,060
Let me tell you how it all went down.

3472
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:25,980
You know how fruits and shit have seeds, and sometimes we swallow on an accident?

3473
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:28,600
These were designed that way, so we could shit them out elsewhere and give them some

3474
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:29,600
fertilizer.

3475
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,200
Well, avocados were the same way.

3476
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:34,240
Central America used to be home to all sorts of megafauna, like giant sloths and shit,

3477
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,600
who could one-shot an avocado and crap out the pit.

3478
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,680
But then they all went extinct because of climate change and rise of man and shit, and avocados

3479
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,000
were like, fuck what now?

3480
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,840
But then people showed up and were like, I like this, and started farming them, and

3481
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:46,800
that's like the only reason avocados are still around today.

3482
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,040
Natural history gets me rock hard.

3483
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,040
Hell yeah.

3484
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,040
Hell yeah.

3485
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,880
Were we talking about the domestication of the avocado?

3486
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,680
I don't remember what we were saying about it.

3487
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:59,020
I have no recollection of anything before.

3488
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,420
It was the most important day of your life.

3489
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:02,420
To us, it was Sunday.

3490
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:03,420
Yeah.

3491
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:07,020
Oh, it's so true.

3492
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:08,020
It's harsh but fair.

3493
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:09,020
By the way.

3494
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:15,140
I love hearing stories about things that should not be, but humans have prolonged its extinction

3495
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:18,420
just for our own benefit.

3496
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:25,340
There are so many instances of plants or animals, or just things that we have just kept in the

3497
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:28,480
world to make ourselves happy.

3498
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:33,920
I bet that a natural avocado doesn't look anything like the thing we buy at a supermarket.

3499
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,920
You ever seen wild bananas?

3500
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:35,920
Yes.

3501
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,600
Like what bananas used to look for, like before we fucking...

3502
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:39,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3503
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,600
No, no, no, no.

3504
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:43,000
There are some crazy bananas that are like spheres.

3505
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
They're like all seed, and they look fucking nasty.

3506
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Did I want a sphere banana?

3507
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
How would you pull that?

3508
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
You don't.

3509
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
You don't.

3510
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Fuck it.

3511
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Here, let me find a picture.

3512
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I don't want to eat it.

3513
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,780
I know exactly what you're talking about, and they look like fuck.

3514
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:59,780
They're from Papua New Guinea.

3515
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:02,260
Yeah, oh god.

3516
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:03,260
They're really gross.

3517
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:04,460
They're really, really gross.

3518
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:07,860
Copy image, post in this in the...

3519
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:12,140
I had heard this somewhere, and I don't know if it's true, but the reason that banana-flavored

3520
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:15,500
candy doesn't taste like bananas, because it's a different kind of banana that doesn't

3521
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:18,460
exist anymore when they made the flavor, is that real?

3522
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:20,820
Yeah, yeah, there was another strain.

3523
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:21,820
This is bizarre.

3524
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:22,820
I know what you're talking about.

3525
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:23,820
This is always...

3526
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,820
Dude, okay, okay.

3527
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:32,320
Apples used to taste like raw potatoes when you ate them, but they used to bread them.

3528
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,040
We bread them to be how apples are now.

3529
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,040
That's fucked up, man.

3530
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:37,040
But also gross.

3531
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,040
That's not fucked up.

3532
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,040
That's delicious.

3533
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,040
Yeah.

3534
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,040
True.

3535
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,040
Hey, also, I've taken the liberty of...

3536
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,040
I just made a document.

3537
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,040
Oh, Cavendish.

3538
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,040
Wait, no.

3539
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,040
Cavendish banana was...

3540
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,040
Yeah.

3541
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,520
Well, I don't remember if Cavendish is the kind that survived or the kind that died out.

3542
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,520
No, no, no.

3543
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:51,520
Okay, okay, okay.

3544
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,520
So, Cavendish is right now.

3545
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:53,520
Yeah.

3546
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,520
Cavendish are modern-day bananas.

3547
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:55,520
Before modern-day bananas, it wasn't like...

3548
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,520
Was it Gross Michael?

3549
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:57,520
Yeah, exactly.

3550
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,520
Gross Michael.

3551
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,860
It didn't go from what you just posted, Ben, to our modern-day banana.

3552
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:02,860
There's been various iterations.

3553
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:07,140
And Gross Michael, fun fact, which I learned from my favorite YouTube channel, Laffy Pursuits.

3554
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:09,140
So when you taste banana candy, right?

3555
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:12,440
And you think, okay, I'm ready to taste some banana, but it doesn't really taste like

3556
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:14,100
banana, like modern banana.

3557
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,100
It has a very...

3558
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:16,100
It has a different taste.

3559
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,480
And you may think to yourself, that's just because, you know, it's artificial flavoring.

3560
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:19,480
It's different candy.

3561
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,480
No.

3562
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,480
Wrong.

3563
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,480
Wrong.

3564
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:26,600
You are actually tasting the past, because the banana candy flavoring that everyone

3565
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:32,120
uses is based off the Gross Michael, the past iteration of bananas, and it was flavored

3566
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:35,480
to be like the Gross Michael instead of our modern Cavendish's.

3567
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:37,600
How crazy is that shit?

3568
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,100
Fuck you, bananas.

3569
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:40,600
Why don't they update it?

3570
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,600
Whoa.

3571
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,600
Because that's what everyone is used to having candy taste like, you know?

3572
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,800
It would be like, oh, why is banana case different now?

3573
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:48,000
Is there any way to get the old banana back?

3574
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I want to try it.

3575
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Yes.

3576
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:56,140
But there are a few, you know, they are not widely distributed because of a disease that

3577
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:59,480
ripped through and destroyed like a lot of the banana population a while ago.

3578
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:03,320
So now, Gross Michael is like an oddity and a rarity.

3579
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:04,840
Banana Hitler didn't fuck around.

3580
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,840
No.

3581
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,320
I just made a document that's going to be in the show notes, people.

3582
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:13,240
It's the official PCP Hall of Fame slash shame slash voice jail, whatever.

3583
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:18,000
It got them snakes riddle my ass Batman, grail, sure, whatever.

3584
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,080
In the Hall of Shame, we've got the Japanese man, Yuda, and I'm sure there's others I'm

3585
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,080
forgetting.

3586
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,200
I'm sure there's got to be more.

3587
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,200
Okay.

3588
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,680
They didn't know they were committing a crime now.

3589
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,800
You guys know now that there will be repercussions.

3590
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:32,800
There will be repercussions.

3591
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,800
Yes.

3592
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:34,800
Okay.

3593
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,800
They've been made aware.

3594
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:36,800
Well, I don't know.

3595
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,800
This is really repercussions if we're going to be remembering them.

3596
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:38,800
Hey, what about one?

3597
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,800
Remember?

3598
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:40,800
Well, no.

3599
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,800
I don't want to comment.

3600
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,800
Talk about how terrible Yuda is.

3601
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,800
Talk about how he's a nightmare.

3602
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:44,800
Doc's Yuda.

3603
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,600
Everybody docs Yuda in chat right now.

3604
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:47,600
Okay.

3605
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,600
I think OneSpar should be on the Hall of Fame.

3606
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:49,600
I agree.

3607
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:50,600
He had a saga.

3608
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,600
Remember the OneSpar saga?

3609
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,600
Yeah.

3610
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:53,600
OneSpar Weekly.

3611
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:54,600
Fagely.

3612
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:55,600
Oh, yeah.

3613
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:56,600
He briefly became Wolfspar.

3614
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,600
Oh, okay.

3615
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,600
You know what?

3616
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,600
I do remember that now.

3617
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:00,600
Yeah, fuck it.

3618
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:01,600
All right.

3619
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:02,600
He's in.

3620
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:03,600
Okay, but no more reaction.

3621
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:04,600
You have to be current.

3622
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,600
You've got to be up-to-date next time.

3623
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,600
Yeah, okay.

3624
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,600
That's fair.

3625
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,600
That's fair.

3626
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:09,600
Okay.

3627
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:10,600
All right.

3628
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:11,600
But let's move along here, people.

3629
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,600
We've got lots to get through.

3630
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:13,600
Next one, we've got a voicemail from the humble John.

3631
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,600
Okay, let's see what John has for us.

3632
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:16,600
Big Bird?

3633
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,600
A one.

3634
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,600
Malina.

3635
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:19,600
Two.

3636
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,600
A one.

3637
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,600
Two.

3638
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,600
Three.

3639
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,600
This one's for Nate.

3640
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:30,600
You've said an expectation long ago, expressing your hate.

3641
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,600
I can relate.

3642
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,600
And I've been looking forward to this thing you mentioned on a podcast.

3643
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:36,600
You did with Diggy Bro.

3644
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:37,600
Yeah.

3645
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,600
About a terrible show.

3646
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,600
But the one I want to hear from you.

3647
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:49,600
One is the one that has this song.

3648
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:50,600
Yeah.

3649
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:57,600
So when are you going to make a video that destroys your favorite little sister show?

3650
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:04,600
They say be the change that you want to see, but you really don't want to hear from me.

3651
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:26,600
That was so good.

3652
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,600
That was so good.

3653
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:28,600
That was incredible.

3654
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,600
I think that's the Auremo theme song.

3655
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,600
I was going to say that's got to be the Auremo.

3656
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,600
It's got to be.

3657
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:34,600
Holy shit.

3658
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,600
That was so...

3659
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,600
Is that a voice grail right off the bat?

3660
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,600
I think that he does that.

3661
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:39,600
That's a voice grail.

3662
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:40,600
That's a voice grail.

3663
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:41,600
That is for sure a voice grail.

3664
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,600
That is for sure a voice grail.

3665
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,600
I'm going to put John Auremo.

3666
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,600
I'm going to put John Auremo.

3667
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:45,600
John Auremo.

3668
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,600
That's his name.

3669
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:49,600
Well, you've got to do it now.

3670
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,600
You've got to do it now, Nate.

3671
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,600
You know what?

3672
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,600
You spelled it wrong.

3673
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,600
The I goes before the M.

3674
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,600
Or a emo.

3675
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,600
Or a emo.

3676
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:57,600
Or a emo.

3677
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,600
Or a emo.

3678
01:48:58,600 --> 01:48:59,600
Man, I fucking hate that show.

3679
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,600
As you should, man.

3680
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:01,600
As you should.

3681
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:05,360
You know, there actually happened to be another voicemail about this as well, asking me about

3682
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:06,360
it.

3683
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:10,220
And so, people, I just want to remind everyone, you know, maybe I didn't say this with enough

3684
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:11,720
force before.

3685
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:16,300
I'm going full-time YouTubing, ladies and gentlemen, and what do you think I'm doing

3686
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,300
that for?

3687
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:20,600
What do you think I'm trying to do, but finally get this bugbear off my back?

3688
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:23,280
It's all about that Auremo, baby.

3689
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:26,840
So that's not my first project, but as everyone knows, it's in the works.

3690
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:33,520
So you will be seeing a lot more of best anime ever's from me in the future.

3691
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,080
So get ready to slurp them down deliciously.

3692
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:38,600
Everyone or emo, best anime ever, as everyone knows.

3693
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:41,840
So we'll, I'm excited to see more of that.

3694
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:44,080
One Spark, you could add some backing instrumental to that.

3695
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,080
If you can do that, buddy.

3696
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,080
That'd be great.

3697
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,080
Just see what you can do.

3698
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,080
See what you can do.

3699
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,080
Oblivionfall, you mean?

3700
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:50,080
Oblivionfall, you mean?

3701
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,080
Oblivionfall, what did I say?

3702
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,080
You said One Spark.

3703
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,080
You said One Spark.

3704
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:54,080
One Spark.

3705
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,080
Congratulations.

3706
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,080
Congratulations, dude.

3707
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,320
Yeah, sorry about Oblivion.

3708
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,320
Okay.

3709
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,320
Moving on.

3710
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,320
That was so good.

3711
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:02,320
He clearly wrote out lyrics.

3712
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,320
It was fantastic.

3713
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,320
That was really nice.

3714
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:07,320
That was a really nice job with the lyrics there.

3715
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,320
Oh my God.

3716
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,320
That was so sick.

3717
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,320
Okay.

3718
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:15,320
Parody songs are like sort of a difficult art where if you make them lame, they can

3719
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:16,320
just be really, really stupid.

3720
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,320
Absolutely.

3721
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:22,240
If you don't make the lyrics fit, if you don't make the lyrics funny and fit the tone of

3722
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,360
the song or the syllables, then you've made a shit product.

3723
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,360
For sure.

3724
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:27,360
We hate you.

3725
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:28,360
But if you make them good, oh.

3726
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:32,480
If you're doing a cover and you fall even a little short of nailing it with the lyrics,

3727
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:35,200
you just eat shit way harder, you know what I mean?

3728
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:38,960
I can say to this kind of my area of expertise is I've written quite a few of these over

3729
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:44,440
the years and hope to do more in the coming months and years, a lot.

3730
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,440
It's a very fine balance.

3731
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:47,440
I don't know.

3732
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,040
I do this a lot in my content in general.

3733
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,040
Maybe it stems from this.

3734
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:53,920
I did this first, I don't know, whatever.

3735
01:50:53,920 --> 01:51:00,120
When you're doing a parody, you can't be too overly sincere and overly saccharine about

3736
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,120
it.

3737
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,120
You've got to have a playful element to it.

3738
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:06,160
Then you've got to earn your sincerity if you're going to hit some at the end.

3739
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:13,920
I would say that the artistry of a parody song is in how you re-cajigger the lyrics.

3740
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,400
You've got to make the way you do that funny and clever and sound great.

3741
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,400
Remember?

3742
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:24,720
Remember the opening of keg reviews or the song at the end, blah blah blah.

3743
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,080
Let me see.

3744
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:33,120
I fear I told the little Fib about my being cool but now I'm 8 on the line so don't think

3745
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,160
I'm a fool.

3746
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:37,840
I wasn't quite the super alpha pony like I claim.

3747
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:44,960
The fact is that I was a nerd who everyone called gay.

3748
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:47,400
Now see, that's a classic line.

3749
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:49,320
Everybody love that.

3750
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:52,600
Is this R.A.E.M.O? I posted the thing.

3751
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,600
Oh, let me see.

3752
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,600
I saw this.

3753
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,600
Yeah.

3754
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:56,600
Yeah.

3755
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:57,600
That's her.

3756
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,600
The people know.

3757
01:51:58,600 --> 01:51:59,600
That's her.

3758
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,600
Okay.

3759
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,600
First of all, no.

3760
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:02,600
That's Umaru-chan.

3761
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:03,600
My little Umaru-chan.

3762
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,600
Oh, okay.

3763
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,600
Yeah.

3764
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,600
Possibly.

3765
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:07,600
Possibly.

3766
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,600
Hey, I don't know.

3767
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,600
They call Orange-chan.

3768
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:10,600
This is a similar little system.

3769
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:11,600
I hate Umaru.

3770
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:12,600
Oh, maybe even more.

3771
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:13,600
I don't know.

3772
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:16,200
As a person, Umaru is a significantly worse person than Kirino.

3773
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:17,200
Oh.

3774
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:18,200
I hate the program.

3775
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,280
I mean, I hate them both, too.

3776
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,780
I hate the entire endeavor.

3777
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:21,780
Yes.

3778
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:22,780
It's bankrupt.

3779
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:28,280
By the way, shout out to atstingercropes on Twitter who drew this funny picture that

3780
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,280
you should be looking at.

3781
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:30,280
A little link in the description.

3782
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:31,280
They're cool.

3783
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,280
I like them.

3784
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:33,560
It's got missed opportunity.

3785
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:34,960
It should say doomaru.

3786
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,960
You know, that's true.

3787
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:37,960
Because it's doom, right?

3788
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,440
Alas, get a better luck next time.

3789
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,440
That's it for your life.

3790
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:44,760
Better luck on the next Wheel of Reincarnation turn, my dude.

3791
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:45,760
Okay.

3792
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:48,480
Doctor Wolf II has left us a message, ladies and gentlemen.

3793
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,200
Oh my God, five on one.

3794
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,200
One was enough.

3795
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,200
Okay.

3796
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,200
I hope we see him at BaronyCon.

3797
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:54,200
I hope to God.

3798
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,200
Oh, he'll be there.

3799
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,700
But let's hear what he has to say.

3800
01:52:56,700 --> 01:52:57,700
You know, be there.

3801
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:59,800
Well, this is his big brother, Doctor Wolf II.

3802
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:00,800
Okay, let's go.

3803
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,800
Oh, it'll be Doctor Wolf I.

3804
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:05,520
Two episodes from when yesterday's playing.

3805
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:10,600
Another listener called in about a situation I'd like to coin in no offensive way as light

3806
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:11,600
cooking.

3807
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:12,600
Oh, yes.

3808
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:17,120
I mean, with everything y'all had to say, just about not being personally comfortable

3809
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:21,520
with a situation like that, but I'd like to get specific with my question.

3810
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:25,600
Let's say one of us, one of us is dating a model.

3811
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:30,440
It's in the realm of possibilities, so hear me out, humor me.

3812
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:34,960
Try to imagine that world where that's happening.

3813
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:39,800
How would that person cope with his girl receiving unsolicited messages that contain

3814
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:42,800
explicit materials on the reg?

3815
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,800
Thanks.

3816
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:47,800
So he's talking about me, obviously.

3817
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,120
My girlfriend is a model.

3818
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:50,120
That's pretty simple.

3819
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:51,120
Yeah.

3820
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:56,200
I mean, it's nothing to do, you know, they're unsolicited, what are you going to do about

3821
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:57,200
it?

3822
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,200
Indeed.

3823
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:59,200
What's to say?

3824
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:03,000
This is almost, so you know what, I actually, I did kind of want to respond, because frankly,

3825
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,640
I was thinking to myself that, I mean, I forget what we were talking about, like dating

3826
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:13,160
a porn star, dating like a, there was a voicemail about like companionship.

3827
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:17,800
Was this the same guy who was on the, God, what was that website called?

3828
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,800
Oh, Seeking Arrangements, I think?

3829
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:20,800
Seeking?

3830
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,800
Yes.

3831
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:22,800
Yes.

3832
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:23,800
Yes.

3833
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:24,800
Yes.

3834
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:25,800
This is not the same.

3835
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:26,800
This is way less of an interesting question, honestly.

3836
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:27,800
It is.

3837
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:28,800
There's nothing to discuss here.

3838
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:32,680
I mean, I thought it was, you know what, I'll say this though, okay, like on the spectrum

3839
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:36,240
of cuckolding, because that's really what we're talking about, and like, so this is a

3840
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:37,240
wide spectrum.

3841
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:42,280
And okay, like, I'll just say that frankly, the people who are like, involved with a woman

3842
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:46,720
who are being the least cucked, I'm not endorsing this, but I'm just saying that I think the

3843
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:52,240
truth is that it's basically like, like those like Islamic extremist people who like, force

3844
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:56,840
their women to cover themselves head to toe, so that no other man can see their woman.

3845
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:00,680
I think those are the least cucked men on the planet, because you know, they're obviously

3846
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:02,680
going over the top, and they're-

3847
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:04,480
No, that has nothing, no.

3848
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:06,480
That's dumb.

3849
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:09,480
Well, let me finish my point.

3850
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:10,480
Okay.

3851
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:15,920
Well, I object to your premise here, because that is something that the man is doing.

3852
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:20,960
Whether you're being cucked is not up to you, it is up to your partner, you know what I

3853
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,960
mean?

3854
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:22,960
I mean, I mean-

3855
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,960
It's entirely about their decisions.

3856
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:28,520
Theoretically, one way to avoid getting cucked is to like, you know, you could like, intimidate

3857
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,560
or imprison your significant other.

3858
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,760
I mean, in an amoral sense, one could do that.

3859
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:35,760
Yeah.

3860
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:36,760
But I mean-

3861
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:41,900
But that doesn't make them any less cucked than a man who doesn't do that, and whose

3862
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,760
woman isn't cucking him.

3863
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:48,100
I think if you're the sort of person who has to imprison people in order to make sure

3864
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:51,600
that nobody steals them away, or that they don't leave, then you are the biggest cuck

3865
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:55,640
of all, because you can't hold onto them with your own like, qualities.

3866
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:59,840
Well, I mean, I mean, in a sense, that's true.

3867
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:00,840
I think-

3868
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:06,800
I feel like that's so far down like the ridiculous angle that it's like, I don't know, what

3869
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:07,800
does he mean?

3870
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:11,840
I mean, I'm trying to get to the root of his point here, but like, I just re- I think

3871
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:17,960
that nothing, nothing you do can make you any less cucked.

3872
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:20,080
If you're cucked, you're cucked, and if you're not, you're not.

3873
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,640
Well, I don't know if I agree with that, because like-

3874
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:27,240
Well, I mean, I think like the inaction of like letting it happen and not like putting

3875
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:28,240
your foot down.

3876
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:31,920
If you're just like a shitty BF, and your girlfriend is like, fuck him, I'm gonna fuck

3877
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:35,120
Chad, then I mean, you know, you're involved in the process somewhat.

3878
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:40,160
Well, okay, then you've been cucked, but then it is, it is your, you know, then the question

3879
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,520
is, well, how do I respond to this?

3880
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:48,160
And the answer is with a fucking atom bomb, you got to turn that key, you got to put that

3881
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:52,040
key in the lock and hit that big red button.

3882
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:54,640
I mean, I'll follow my example, though, to the extreme.

3883
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:59,680
So first of all, on the whole like receiving unsolicited dick pics and whatnot, like there's

3884
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:00,680
no control.

3885
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:03,000
I mean, obviously that's, there's nothing she could do.

3886
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,200
And I mean, you could say-

3887
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,560
That's something, that's probably something that most girls-

3888
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:11,800
I was going to say, to once again put on my, well, to just go full feminist as I do every

3889
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:17,840
moment of my waking life, the, you know, women just have to deal with that in general.

3890
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:19,800
And like, what's the solution?

3891
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:24,120
Stop being an attractive woman who's on social media, is that the proposal?

3892
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,680
So again, I'm not trying to moralize, I'm just saying-

3893
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:31,480
I like this completely, like modest, like normal opinions are going full feminist, guys.

3894
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:34,440
Like deep down the rabbit hole.

3895
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:35,440
You know, maybe-

3896
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,880
Well, I did just endorse to Sharia Law, so, you know-

3897
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:41,800
There's some disbandages, maybe there are some, no, full feminist, full feminist, full

3898
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:42,800
feminist.

3899
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:49,720
But my only point is, okay, you know what, maybe, I will say it, I think that as a man

3900
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:55,840
who has a girlfriend who does, in fact, produce and distribute images of her looking, you

3901
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,680
know, relatively sexy, she's a sexy girl, obviously, but you know, in bathing suits

3902
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:04,920
and whatnot, do I think that that's slightly more on the cuckolding spectrum than someone

3903
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:06,840
whose girlfriend does not do that?

3904
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:12,040
Yes, yes I do, but that being said, like, let's not, you know, obviously this is a very

3905
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:15,440
slight degree, this is a very modest amount here.

3906
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:22,160
Alright, everyone start writing your think pieces titled, Nate Bestman admits to being

3907
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:23,160
cucked.

3908
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,160
To be cucked.

3909
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:28,920
I don't know, honestly I feel bad even saying it, obviously it's not actually the case,

3910
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:34,840
but I just gotta be honest, gotta be intellectually consistent here, and one who has like a modest

3911
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:40,640
at home wife who just like wears her big Victorian dresses that cover her 102%.

3912
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:41,640
Her hoop skirts.

3913
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:44,920
Yep, yep, and you know, dressed super modestly and all that.

3914
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:51,920
It just, it strikes me as funny to like come at it from a very intellectually like consistent

3915
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:55,280
perspective when this is very much an emotional thing.

3916
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:58,280
I mean, that depends on what she's writing to.

3917
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:00,840
What does it matter, what does it matter one way or the other whether you are technically

3918
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:02,520
cucked like a certain percent or not?

3919
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:05,760
I mean, I'm approaching it more in the technical sense than the emotional one, because I do

3920
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:11,760
not feel cucked, but like technically analyzing it, I think that there is, you know.

3921
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:15,520
Why would you even go to the effort of making sure that you are being honest with that when

3922
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,040
it, you don't feel it?

3923
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:21,000
Well, I just try to be intellectually consistent, and like maybe I'm wrong, but like this is

3924
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,920
just my thought process on the subject.

3925
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:27,680
Like, like, how do you know people like add up the numbers the same way you do?

3926
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:28,680
I don't.

3927
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:30,680
Here's my, here's my counter example.

3928
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:31,680
Okay.

3929
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:36,120
Say you got a couple that are in an open relationship and one of them fucks another person, that's

3930
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,120
not cucking.

3931
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:42,560
But again, unlike my technical analysis here, the whole relationship is kind of dual way

3932
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:43,560
cucking.

3933
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:44,560
Dual way cucking?

3934
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,560
No.

3935
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:46,560
That doesn't make sense.

3936
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:47,560
No.

3937
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:48,560
That doesn't make sense.

3938
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:49,560
No.

3939
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,360
You know, my worldview about this cucking spectrum is actually pretty flawed.

3940
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:52,360
I'm noticing.

3941
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:53,360
So, you know.

3942
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:54,800
It's a little, it's a little weird.

3943
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:55,800
It's maybe.

3944
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:56,800
Backpedal.

3945
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:57,800
Maybe there's some mistakes here.

3946
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:58,800
Undig that hole.

3947
01:59:58,800 --> 01:59:59,800
Undig that hole quick.

3948
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:00,800
It invites certain lines of inquiry.

3949
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:05,120
Cucking is such a vague thing that everyone means it in a different way, and it's hard

3950
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:10,120
to actually have a conversation about it because no one actually, you could mean actual cucking

3951
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:16,120
as a real thing that exists that has a proper name, cucking, you know what I'm saying about?

3952
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:22,560
Like more far removed, like the general sense of just cheating, if you just make it like

3953
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,280
a personality trait where dude, that guy is such a cuck.

3954
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:26,280
Fuck that guy.

3955
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:27,280
But people do use it that way now.

3956
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:29,800
So, it's hard to say that that's totally wrong, I guess.

3957
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:31,280
Well, I'm not saying that it is wrong.

3958
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:34,200
I'm just saying it's another definition that they're just playing out.

3959
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:37,880
That's a figurative cuck without being a literal cuck.

3960
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:38,880
I guess that's true.

3961
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:43,280
I was watching Joe Rogan the other day, and he had like a debate with the Adam Ruins Everything

3962
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:45,640
guy, and basically this was a discussion on like whether-

3963
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:46,640
Ah, yes, Adam.

3964
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:48,760
Well, Adam, I can't remember his name.

3965
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:49,760
Adam Conover.

3966
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:50,760
Yeah, I don't know his last name, but I know-

3967
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:51,760
He, um-

3968
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:52,760
It's Adam Conover.

3969
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:55,040
I confused him with Alton Brown all the time.

3970
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,040
Oh, yeah.

3971
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,040
Let's kill yourself.

3972
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,040
Well, okay.

3973
02:00:58,040 --> 02:00:59,840
Only Alton Brown likes you.

3974
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:05,920
They had a debate about whether or not alphas and betas like exist in human beings.

3975
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:12,280
And basically, I mean, it immediately seemed like Adam was using the like, like the biological,

3976
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:17,720
like inherent like wolves, like they have alphas and betas, like, you know, like a naturalistic

3977
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:18,720
sort of setup.

3978
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,600
And he's like, no, no, no, that doesn't exist in humans.

3979
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:22,360
Like we don't operate on that level.

3980
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:24,040
We're like far more complex.

3981
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:25,360
I have something to say about this.

3982
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:29,160
My only point is just that like Joe Rogan, like he was definitely saying like, no, no,

3983
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:32,680
like alphas and betas, like you got like a strong alpha dude and you got like a little,

3984
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:36,640
you know, intimate, timid guy, like that alpha beta dynamic is right there.

3985
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:40,400
But like, obviously he's just using kind of a different definition from what Adam's

3986
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,400
using.

3987
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,400
So like-

3988
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:47,320
Yeah, if you define alpha and beta to mean confident guy versus shy guy, then yeah, obviously

3989
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:48,320
they exist.

3990
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,520
So, um, think about, think about alphas.

3991
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:56,120
Did you know that that like wolf research was discredited and like that alpha, that

3992
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:59,480
actually doesn't exist in like wolf packs in nature?

3993
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:00,480
Okay.

3994
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,200
Don't like gorillas have it too though or something?

3995
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:07,360
Well, they have a, they do have a, I think they have like a, fuck, they have the-

3996
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:08,360
A big leader guy?

3997
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:09,360
Is it called the alpha?

3998
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:10,360
I think so.

3999
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:13,480
I think there's, I don't know if it's the alpha or if it's not, yeah, yeah, I think

4000
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:16,080
like a gorilla has a, has something like that.

4001
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:21,640
But like that, that research where the word came out of that like this happens in wolves,

4002
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:25,800
like that same researcher did more research that like invalidated his old hypothesis was

4003
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:28,160
like, yeah, all that stuff I said about alpha wolves doesn't happen.

4004
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:30,080
Just to be clear, I mean, what did he claim?

4005
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:34,000
Like there was like one dominant leader that would like get all the girls basically and

4006
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
that-

4007
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,000
It's something like that.

4008
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Okay.

4009
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Yeah.

4010
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,720
I mean, I've, I feel like wolves, they're very much more of a collaborative group effort

4011
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:42,720
sort of thing.

4012
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:47,480
I mean, I mean, all groups of animals that, you know, successful, they group together,

4013
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,480
but like-

4014
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,480
Even us.

4015
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:52,960
I've seen nature documentaries and it seems like they just work as like a team rather

4016
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:56,240
than one guy is big and the others are small.

4017
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:57,240
Um, yeah.

4018
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:01,360
Though, I mean, I mean, they're like, it's not, you know, not every naturalistic system

4019
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:03,240
is like, you know, even or whatever.

4020
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:06,280
So there's like, there's only so many like females to breed with or whatever.

4021
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:08,080
So it would make sense for there to be some-

4022
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:13,880
I mean, yeah, there's always the ones, there's the ones that are the most good for the thing.

4023
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:19,840
Like, I think alpha and beta, it means something a little different than just, uh, I'm talking

4024
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:20,840
out of my butt.

4025
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:25,780
I mean, even, even from the beginning, like as soon as people started using that like

4026
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:30,560
alpha dog, like wolf research and like mapping it onto humans, we were already like being

4027
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,560
figurative.

4028
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:32,560
Yeah.

4029
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:33,560
I mean, that's true.

4030
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:36,040
Like, do I believe that there are confident and less confident humans and that this impacts

4031
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:38,880
their like social graces and skill and achievement?

4032
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:42,640
I mean, yeah, but you know, if that's not what it biologically means that they, fair enough.

4033
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:46,360
By the way, are you guys aware of how hyenas are like structured socially, especially

4034
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:47,360
like men and women?

4035
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:48,360
Yes.

4036
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:49,360
It's fucked up.

4037
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,360
The men are repressed.

4038
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:55,240
Those poor repressed gamer hyenas need to rise up and overthrow the cruel matriarchy because

4039
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:59,720
the women are bigger and stronger and bully them and it's mean and I don't like it.

4040
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,200
Male hyenas are fucked.

4041
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:02,880
Dude, have you heard of spiders?

4042
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,880
Uh, a little bit.

4043
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:05,880
Is it just that-

4044
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:09,720
Male spiders are tiny and the females kill them and eat them after they impregnate, are

4045
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:10,720
impregnated by them.

4046
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:11,720
That's fucked up.

4047
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:15,720
Oh, wait, so, so the just like female hyenas are the bigger like more dominant ones?

4048
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:19,000
Yeah, they're bigger, stronger and dominate like the whole social hierarchy.

4049
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,160
I mean, really, what is it like?

4050
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:23,920
There's nothing inherently like more-

4051
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:30,560
Guys, we gotta stop all these trans male hyenas from competing in the male hyena arena.

4052
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:31,560
In the hyena arena.

4053
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:34,080
It's not fair to those poor, you know, natural-

4054
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:38,240
I'm a turf for hyenas for sure, coming down a hard stance.

4055
02:04:38,240 --> 02:04:40,160
We gotta have the male hyena leagues.

4056
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:41,160
Hyena.

4057
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:42,160
They can't compete.

4058
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:45,240
I'm a trans exclusionary radical hyenaist.

4059
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:46,240
A turf.

4060
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:47,240
A turf.

4061
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:48,360
A turf.

4062
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:50,360
Lion King 4 hyena arena.

4063
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:53,280
Guys, you aren't using the right term.

4064
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:54,280
Yeah.

4065
02:04:54,280 --> 02:05:01,560
We all know that saying hyena is just so 1990s, we have our new term.

4066
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:02,560
The phrase that comes up with it.

4067
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,560
You gotta say yin.

4068
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:09,400
Guys, I just love being a yin.

4069
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:10,760
Is this the furry equivalent?

4070
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:11,960
Is this like how they slang?

4071
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:15,960
Or is this just like the new, is this what zoomers call hyenas?

4072
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,360
This is slang for hyena.

4073
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:18,360
This is slang for hyena.

4074
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,360
Yo.

4075
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:20,360
You guys just love saying yin.

4076
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:21,360
Yo, me and my boys, we're chillin' in the safari.

4077
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:22,360
Say it right now.

4078
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:23,360
Say it.

4079
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:24,360
Say it.

4080
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:25,360
Say it.

4081
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:26,360
Say it.

4082
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:27,360
Say it.

4083
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:28,360
Say it.

4084
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:29,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yin.

4085
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,360
I'm yinin.

4086
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:31,360
I'm a big fan.

4087
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:32,360
So, like, so when you're on Twitter and you're retweeting your cute hyena pics and you're

4088
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:33,360
like, oh, look at that yin.

4089
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,600
Like, like, yin is to hyena as doggo is to dog.

4090
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,600
Exactly.

4091
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:38,600
I hate doggo.

4092
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:39,800
Doggy is better than doggo.

4093
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:41,880
Well, doggo is like the Reddit version.

4094
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:42,880
Well, yin tops it all.

4095
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:47,400
Doggo is like the mage version, which is good in some situations, but not all.

4096
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:48,400
All right.

4097
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,400
I'm thoroughly enamored with hyena arena.

4098
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,400
Yeah, hyena arena.

4099
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:59,800
Like hyena arena, hyena arena, hyena arena, hyena arena, or yin arena, yin arena for short.

4100
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:03,080
Yeah, we gotta save time, because we're gonna be saying these words a lot.

4101
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:06,800
In the jungle, the mighty savannah, the lion is a hyena.

4102
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:07,800
All right.

4103
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:08,800
Let's move on.

4104
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,800
Let's move on.

4105
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:10,800
Please.

4106
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:11,800
Yeah.

4107
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:12,800
Okay.

4108
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:20,200
We've got Hell No Fresh is calling in with Hell No Fresh Freestyle World Star Exclusive.

4109
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,200
Yeah.

4110
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:22,200
Okay.

4111
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,200
Shut the fuck up during all of this.

4112
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,200
Let's commence.

4113
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:25,200
Go.

4114
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:26,200
All right, Nate.

4115
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:27,200
I see how it is.

4116
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:31,800
I think you're a big, strong man, big, tough guy talking shit about instant ramen, huh?

4117
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:32,800
Yeah.

4118
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:33,800
All right, dog.

4119
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:34,800
I'll remember that.

4120
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:35,800
Yeah.

4121
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:36,800
See how tough you are in a minute.

4122
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,800
Throw a shade at my ramen recipe.

4123
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:41,120
I'll put it simply in soliloquy.

4124
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:42,120
You can rest in peace.

4125
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:43,440
Fuck a tutorial.

4126
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:44,440
I'm cooking up bars now.

4127
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:48,520
I'll shoot you into space like Joseph did the cars now, because you're the type of

4128
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:50,600
nigga that fuck with hearted bitches.

4129
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:53,120
It's all engagement till the social workers get you.

4130
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,120
Get the picture.

4131
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:55,520
I'm no longer fucking with you.

4132
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:58,520
Thought you could get away with shit and all my dishes, did you?

4133
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,520
Spit bars quick, instant ramen in the booth.

4134
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:03,120
How about you make like Sekiro a bunch of suicide tooth?

4135
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:04,720
I rhyme for my bootleg food.

4136
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:05,720
It's Hell No Fresh.

4137
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:08,320
Easy to follow recipes, John Favreau flex.

4138
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:09,320
You're dead.

4139
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:10,320
Now, I'm the best guy ever.

4140
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:11,920
You're just a ghost in the shell.

4141
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:12,720
Oh, well.

4142
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:13,720
Good luck in development.

4143
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:14,720
Hell, kid.

4144
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,720
Yo, shout some munchin'.

4145
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:18,720
The carbonara was fire.

4146
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,720
I think we're done here.

4147
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:21,720
Peace.

4148
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:22,720
Yes!

4149
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:24,720
My two favorite things.

4150
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,720
Hating Nate and loving myself.

4151
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:32,720
Wow.

4152
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:33,720
It's so cool.

4153
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:34,720
That's lame.

4154
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:35,720
Okay.

4155
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:36,720
Combination.

4156
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:39,720
Please allow me to have the floor, because this requires a lot of information.

4157
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:45,720
So to start this out with, I would say this, this beautiful song, you know, obviously anti-night

4158
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:50,520
which we can all get behind, you know, the working class and his past recipe on the last

4159
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,520
episode.

4160
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:52,520
Holy grail.

4161
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:53,520
Holy grail.

4162
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:59,320
However, however, Hell No Fresh, I've got something to say that I've got some follow-up

4163
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:00,820
for you.

4164
02:08:00,820 --> 02:08:07,020
So last episode, if you all recall, Hell No Fresh called in with a recipe for peanut butter

4165
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,020
instant ramen.

4166
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:11,520
So it was, you would make some top ramen, mix in some sesame oil, some red pepper flakes

4167
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:15,620
and some scallions and put some instant top ramen and get that chicken flavoring and

4168
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:16,620
the peanut butter.

4169
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:17,620
It would be delicious.

4170
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:22,720
Now, immediately upon hearing this, I thought to myself, sounds delicious, sign me the

4171
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:23,720
fuck up.

4172
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:26,220
But those of you who know, my kitchen was not working.

4173
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:27,820
So I had to wait a few days.

4174
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:33,520
And then the day that my kitchen became available to you, which has happened, everyone, that

4175
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:34,520
soggy is over.

4176
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:35,520
And I had to look.

4177
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:36,520
Hooray.

4178
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:40,720
Ready and willing, prepared to make this top ramen.

4179
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:41,720
The kitchen arc begins.

4180
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:42,720
Yeah.

4181
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:43,720
The kitchen arc ends.

4182
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:46,520
So I, this was going to be the first dish that I made in my new kitchen.

4183
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:52,720
Hell No Fresh, you had the honor of being the inaugurable person that would make the

4184
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:56,820
recipe for this brand new spanking kitchen that I had in my disposal.

4185
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:57,820
So I got all my greens.

4186
02:08:57,820 --> 02:08:58,820
I got the scallions.

4187
02:08:58,820 --> 02:08:59,820
I got the peanut butter.

4188
02:08:59,820 --> 02:09:00,820
I got the red pepper flakes.

4189
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:01,820
I got the spicy sesame oil.

4190
02:09:01,820 --> 02:09:02,820
I got the top ramen.

4191
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:03,820
I got everything.

4192
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:08,120
And I was ready to go full in all chips on the table.

4193
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:09,120
And so I got all my greens.

4194
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,320
I was chopping up the scallions.

4195
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:13,920
And so I thought to myself, wait a second, wait a second, hold on.

4196
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:17,520
This is, in occasion, this is a special event.

4197
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:20,520
You know what I had to do that I've been putting off for a while and since I haven't had a kitchen

4198
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:27,720
and I haven't been able to use it, I required, I acquired a chef grade knife from my girlfriend's

4199
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:28,720
father.

4200
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:31,680
He gave it to me because he took note of my cooking and so he gave me a really high quality

4201
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:32,680
sharp ass knife.

4202
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:35,180
Was this boards of like adamantium or something?

4203
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:36,180
What's the, yeah.

4204
02:09:36,180 --> 02:09:37,180
Okay.

4205
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:38,180
It's ultra sharp.

4206
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:40,980
And so I, you know, I'm going to use it for the first time on this.

4207
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:41,980
Hell no fresh.

4208
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:44,340
Listen, buddy, me and you were bonded.

4209
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:45,340
We're so linked.

4210
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:46,340
We're going to bet to J.O.

4211
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:47,340
And I'm at three seconds.

4212
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:48,340
Artquist crystals sink.

4213
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:49,340
Nice.

4214
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:52,300
And so I got down my chef knife and just, I want to point picture.

4215
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:53,300
I was so excited.

4216
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:54,300
Right.

4217
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:55,300
I was so eager.

4218
02:09:55,300 --> 02:10:00,500
I was so just ready to live the cooking lifestyle again, to be the chef that I was always meant

4219
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:01,500
to be.

4220
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,500
I had this professional grade knife.

4221
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:08,720
I had this recipe that I was so just interested in and I was so happy.

4222
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:11,360
I put my fingers a little bit too close to the blade.

4223
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:14,040
I didn't practice proper blade safety.

4224
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:16,320
I did not curl my fingers the way they're supposed to.

4225
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:21,640
I did not make the block so that my, the, the, the, the, uh, the braid would hit up against

4226
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:24,000
my, my midfingers and you know, knock on my finger.

4227
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,760
So I chopped down while I'm making the scallions.

4228
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:27,760
Oh God.

4229
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:28,760
Wow.

4230
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:29,760
What?

4231
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,760
Yeah.

4232
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:36,140
A slice of my fingers are gone and I'm not saying like, I'm saying a slice of my fingers

4233
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:37,140
are gone.

4234
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:42,320
And if you look at my fingers now, literally there is a deformation on my fingers.

4235
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:46,640
Even now there is like a slice of it visibly off nine.

4236
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:48,400
My hair now lopsided forever.

4237
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:55,240
My, my, my left middle just forever deformed because of chefs in general and specifically

4238
02:10:55,240 --> 02:11:00,280
you hell no thresh, but I will say, and because of that, I'm putting you in the hell and in

4239
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:06,680
the voice jail because of you cause, but wait, but wait, but wait, but wait, what's this?

4240
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,680
What's this?

4241
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:10,040
I've cut my finger and I'm really pissed off and it's bleeding everywhere and I have

4242
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:13,600
to go to the emergency room and I have to pay $75 for them to just give me antibiotic

4243
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:14,600
cream.

4244
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:21,000
I'm receiving the, I'm receiving, but with rage, but, but I can't let these scallions

4245
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,000
go to waste.

4246
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,960
What, what am I going to do?

4247
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:26,800
And so I had the bandages on the next day.

4248
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:28,560
I, I'm, I'm in pain.

4249
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,880
It's bleeding profusely, but you know what I do?

4250
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:32,320
You know what I do?

4251
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:33,760
I have to finish the fight.

4252
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:39,200
I have to, I, I, I, I just have to in the weird, weird L's words, just eat it.

4253
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:43,760
And so I go to town, I practice, I practice blade safety.

4254
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:48,000
I'm a master of this katana folded 10,000 times.

4255
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,320
I chop the scallions properly this time.

4256
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,560
I get rid of the dead skin and flesh.

4257
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:53,560
They're just residually on them.

4258
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:54,560
I wash them properly.

4259
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:55,880
I put in the top ramen.

4260
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:57,040
I put in the sesame oil.

4261
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,960
I put in the red pepper flakes and you know what I fucking do?

4262
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:04,240
You dumb fucking slut, instead of using water, I update this shit.

4263
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:05,960
I improvise on this shit.

4264
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:08,600
I use homemade chicken stock instead of that water.

4265
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,440
The chicken flavoring is off the charts.

4266
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:15,040
I fucking grill some new bacon and, oh, uh, uh, peanut butter goes right with bacon.

4267
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:16,040
Put that in there as well.

4268
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:19,800
So I'm eating this delicious fucking meal, hell no fresh.

4269
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:23,160
I'm eating this delicious meal that you have given me this recipe.

4270
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:24,960
Moff it to my own specifications.

4271
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:28,480
I take a bite and it is mind blowing.

4272
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:32,200
It is absolutely undescribable.

4273
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:37,640
The pleasure in which I am, in terror, terror taking in when I eat this peanut butter instant

4274
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:38,640
ramen.

4275
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:44,440
The, just the, the emulsification of the peanut butter just make this very light peanut butter

4276
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:51,160
sauce inside of the top ramen is so orgasmic.

4277
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:53,800
Why must, why must brothers quarrel?

4278
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:55,400
Why must there be division?

4279
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:56,400
Hell no fresh.

4280
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:59,600
You are in the voice grail for the rest of my life.

4281
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:00,600
Hit me up.

4282
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:01,600
DM me.

4283
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:02,800
We are brothers in arms.

4284
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:03,800
And you know what?

4285
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:06,800
I think we're going to have a long career together.

4286
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:09,720
And then that's the end of my tale and I've been waiting all week to sell.

4287
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,720
That's beautiful.

4288
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:11,720
That's beautiful.

4289
02:13:12,680 --> 02:13:13,680
Hell no fresh.

4290
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:14,680
Welcome to the grail.

4291
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:16,680
Welcome to the hollow fame.

4292
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:17,680
Yeah.

4293
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:22,240
I would say that rap alone was enough to get into the grail because that was devastating.

4294
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:23,360
It was Nate.

4295
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:27,520
I think you might have to leave the PCP soon.

4296
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:32,000
Or well you're just going to have to answer with a fire track of your own.

4297
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,520
That's the way you get around it.

4298
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:34,520
That's the only option.

4299
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:35,520
That's the way you beat a rap.

4300
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:38,600
Dude, me a mouth of a perfect time.

4301
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:39,600
Make a rap.

4302
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:40,600
Man, I wish I could rap.

4303
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:44,080
Sometimes I think about maybe I should try to compose a rap.

4304
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:45,080
That's too hard.

4305
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:49,240
Hey man, just download a beat as you know, Jesse and did you just do from the internet.

4306
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:50,240
Work on some lyrics.

4307
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:51,240
Yeah.

4308
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:52,240
And do it.

4309
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:56,120
I just have no idea how to like, how do you like write it?

4310
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:58,480
I want to figure out how to write that.

4311
02:13:58,480 --> 02:13:59,720
Is there like a structure you follow?

4312
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:00,720
I mean I'm sure you could do it any way you want.

4313
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:04,920
I've made some in the past but I felt too silly, too bad.

4314
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:05,920
You know what?

4315
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:10,440
In the same vein of munchy learning to cook and getting all into it or learning to code.

4316
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:12,000
I want to learn to rap.

4317
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,920
I want to figure out that shit out.

4318
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:14,920
I don't know where to start.

4319
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:18,240
I suppose I should just ask Digi but he's Digi.

4320
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:21,040
He might not have like the teacher sort of.

4321
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:22,040
Indeed.

4322
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:23,640
Not an ability to pass on his knowledge.

4323
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:24,640
The aspect.

4324
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:32,680
Nate, I want to move away from the ashes of the Hello Fresh debate and it may come up

4325
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:37,720
but I do want to move into the Forcing Nate to Cook arc which I am going to bring up every

4326
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:41,800
single episode until it happens because you know it has to be done.

4327
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:43,800
You know it has to be done.

4328
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:49,080
I don't care about cooking frankly, I just want to cook like the calories I need in the

4329
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:50,080
day properly.

4330
02:14:50,080 --> 02:14:51,880
I don't care about things that taste good.

4331
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:53,600
That seems like a waste of effort to me.

4332
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:55,000
Yeah, I agree, Nate.

4333
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I agree.

4334
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,880
It's easy to make something that tastes good and is calorie efficient if you can do it

4335
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:00,880
yourself.

4336
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:04,880
If you can make healthy food that's like, you hate your macros and whatnot and you also,

4337
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:08,840
taste great, that'll probably like keep the train running smoothly and you'll be like,

4338
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:10,240
I can't wait to make the food.

4339
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:14,040
Literally the difference between, let me give you a tip.

4340
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:22,480
Cooking tip, any vegetable, any vegetable at all, olive oil or butter, salt and pepper.

4341
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:24,960
Add it to that, roast it in the oven and it's delicious.

4342
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,640
There's like no exception to it.

4343
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:27,640
Indeed.

4344
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:28,640
It does, yeah.

4345
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:30,440
The salt just makes it good.

4346
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:32,480
Yeah, that's it.

4347
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:35,560
It's like all you need to do to cook like any fucking vegetable.

4348
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:36,560
You know what I've been doing?

4349
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:37,560
Yeah.

4350
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:44,400
A friend of mine sent me a care package, it was a giant box full of nuts, various nuts.

4351
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:48,280
Oh, it's so thematically appropriate.

4352
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:51,960
Did it have an unsalted variant of a popular nut?

4353
02:15:51,960 --> 02:16:00,080
She's specifically, well, she, yes, yes it did and there were a bunch of other timelines

4354
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:01,080
in there too.

4355
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:07,360
Bara nuts, there were peely nuts, there were like tiger nuts, whatever the fuck those

4356
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:08,360
are.

4357
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:09,600
They're trying to do tiger.

4358
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:14,920
But mostly there was like big ass bags of peanuts, cashews and almonds and what I have

4359
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:19,200
been doing is I spent a bunch of yesterday just like roasting trays of these peanuts

4360
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:20,360
because they're uncooked peanuts.

4361
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:24,880
I've been roasting and salting them myself and putting them in mason jars and they're

4362
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:25,880
so good.

4363
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:26,880
That's incredible.

4364
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,880
That's incredible.

4365
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:31,480
It's better when you roast them yourself than when you buy them in pre-roasted, oh, it's

4366
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:33,680
so good.

4367
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:40,960
It's like emotionally gratifying, making this raw material undergo this process and transmuting

4368
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,600
it into this delicacy.

4369
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:47,840
I feel like I'd be a healthier human if I cooked more, I'd just be more in tune with

4370
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:48,840
the world.

4371
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:49,840
Yeah.

4372
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:50,840
Seems like a real thing.

4373
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:57,840
Just cooking is so fucking, it makes you feel so sexy and desirable as a human being.

4374
02:16:58,120 --> 02:16:59,120
I agree.

4375
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:02,360
It's such a great feeling to be able to go downstairs and be like, what do I got in

4376
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:03,360
here?

4377
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:06,360
I got this and then just, I'll make this dish.

4378
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:11,280
Dude, fucking, we're making the peanut butter top ramen and I just like, I looked in the

4379
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:14,880
fridge and I saw that we had the carcass of a chicken and I was like, ah, shit, you know

4380
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:15,880
what I can do?

4381
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:19,240
I can totally make like a quick little sock out of this and it would be really easy and

4382
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:23,640
I can put some of the leftover like meat bits inside of the soup itself.

4383
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:27,800
Like just being resourceful like that while cooking is the best feeling.

4384
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:33,080
Munchy, walk that towards his fridge, third person over the shoulder camera, slowly walk

4385
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:37,600
towards it, looking at his ingredients, going, ah, shit, here we go again.

4386
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:38,600
There's the meme.

4387
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:39,600
Yeah.

4388
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:40,600
There's the one.

4389
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:41,600
With the chicken carcass.

4390
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:42,600
Oh, yep.

4391
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:44,240
Put a chicken carcass there, ladies and gentlemen.

4392
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:48,640
I mean, for me, more than feeling cool and sexy, cooking made me feel efficient because

4393
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:53,120
when I had, you know, when I had my, you know, Instacart all set up, I had my pipeline, like

4394
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:58,360
I knew my ingredients and stuff and I'm just like, okay, well, you know, time to, you know,

4395
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:01,880
I've got all my ingredients that I get and I know where to get them to get them for the

4396
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:02,880
best price.

4397
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,880
So they're all really cheap.

4398
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:06,560
So I'm eating for relatively cheap, but I'm still eating well because I'm, you know,

4399
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:10,000
I know what I'm putting into my body or whatever because I'm getting in myself and I'm, you

4400
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,840
know, just throwing that cauliflower and shit in a pan and roasting it up and putting it

4401
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:14,840
in a bowl and eating it.

4402
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:18,840
And I'm like, this is exactly what I want to be eating and it's all, it's all like sorted.

4403
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:19,840
Right?

4404
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:20,840
Yeah.

4405
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:25,320
So I've just cleaned out that, that pipeline, the, the nutrition pipeline has been, has

4406
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:29,760
been cleaned and efficient eyes and maximize to deliver nutrition unto me at a minimum

4407
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,760
expense.

4408
02:18:30,760 --> 02:18:31,760
I do want that.

4409
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:36,800
Well, well, I do love, you know, I'm just into cooking and like as, as like an artistry

4410
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:38,880
and like a passion and like a hobby.

4411
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:44,640
I completely agree that a lot of the joy of cooking is like finding like optimal strats

4412
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:49,960
to saved frames because, you know, I don't always want to like cook like a big ass fucking

4413
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:54,720
I just want to be able to, you know, throw something together really fast and, you know,

4414
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:57,520
get some something that's scrumptious and walk back upstairs.

4415
02:18:57,520 --> 02:19:00,200
It's not, it has to always be a federal issue.

4416
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:04,880
Now I'm thinking of like you getting your, you know, meal and then doing the Mario 64

4417
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:07,320
like back, like long jump back.

4418
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:08,320
Yeah.

4419
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:09,320
Yeah.

4420
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:10,320
You know what this reminds me of?

4421
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:11,320
Totally.

4422
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:16,000
Incidentally, I was happy to, I was in a thread about Oolulilia on V the other day and like

4423
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:20,640
in his description, I think this is not like his LinkedIn page or like some, no, it was

4424
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:25,200
his Facebook, I think, and he was like updating like his current work status and like he works

4425
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:28,800
at Walmart, I think, and he said something like, like, you know, he'd been a cashier

4426
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:33,680
for many years and he said something that was along the lines of like, yeah, like my

4427
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:38,960
skill level at like, you know, these like stocking shelves, like blah, blah, blah.

4428
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:44,320
Like these are all like, like, these are all high level, you know, achieved close to mastery,

4429
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:48,880
but when it comes to cashiering, I've maxed out my stats at cashiering.

4430
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:53,480
This is on like a Facebook post, like to his family and friends, he's a good man.

4431
02:19:53,480 --> 02:19:54,480
He's a good man.

4432
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:58,760
I've, you know, you know, I started this, this adventure, you know, I became a cashier,

4433
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:02,160
but I think I've done all I can do with the medium and it's time for me to move on to

4434
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:03,160
bigger and better things.

4435
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:04,160
Yeah, pretty much.

4436
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:05,160
Pretty much.

4437
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:08,520
It just like, just like, uh, Watterson retiring from Calvin and Hobbes because he'd done everything

4438
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:09,520
he could do with it.

4439
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:12,840
He's like, I'm going to go out at my peak, I'm going to go out at the peak of my cashiering

4440
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:13,840
career.

4441
02:20:13,840 --> 02:20:14,840
Okay.

4442
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:15,840
On top, baby.

4443
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:16,840
That's fantastic.

4444
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:17,840
Okay.

4445
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:18,840
Okay.

4446
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:23,520
Uh, uh, uh, uh, next call is from, uh, Patreon, serious questions, how to get bonus episode.

4447
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:24,520
Okay.

4448
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:27,360
So this one is just, I'll take any excuse to talk about the bonus episode.

4449
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:28,720
So let's, uh, let's listen to it.

4450
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:29,720
Okay.

4451
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:32,120
I have a serious question about the, like the Patreon and when you buy, like the bonus

4452
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:33,600
episodes, how do you get them?

4453
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:37,840
Is it like a private YouTube set of videos and then you get the links to them?

4454
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:40,960
Or is it like MP3 shits you have to download?

4455
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:48,040
It's like, I just want to know how you, what ways you get the episodes so I can know how

4456
02:20:48,040 --> 02:20:53,760
to like be able to do them because like, what if I buy the thing on mobile and then it's

4457
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:58,080
like a fucking file that I can't download or some shit, you know, like, let me know

4458
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:01,320
how to, what happens once you buy the bonus episodes.

4459
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:05,360
Like what happens, you know, what, what do I, what happens, you know, what the fuck.

4460
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:06,360
Okay.

4461
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:09,160
We need to convert this potential customer to a full real customer.

4462
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:10,160
And here's how we do it.

4463
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:12,360
We want to change those players into payers.

4464
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:13,360
That's exactly right.

4465
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:14,920
We, uh, uh, okay.

4466
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:15,920
Here's what you do.

4467
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:19,360
So all you got to do on Patreon, you got an account or whatever you sign up and you click

4468
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:21,200
on us wherever you say you want to support us.

4469
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:24,640
You got to say, uh, like the $5 tiers, the one to get the bonus episodes.

4470
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:28,800
And once, once you are there, once like Patreon says like, ah, here's a user who was logged

4471
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:34,560
in as a $5 member or whatever, uh, what the bonus episodes are, they are YouTube videos

4472
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:38,240
that are hidden and only people with the link can get there.

4473
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:42,600
And like, if you, if you are a person, you're a $5 patron, like the bonus episodes are just,

4474
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:43,600
they're on Patreon.

4475
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:47,120
You can click them and play them there on the website, I think, but there's also just

4476
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,240
links from there to the YouTube.

4477
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:52,640
And once you're on YouTube, there's a playlist of all the bonus episodes.

4478
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:53,640
And really that's the thing.

4479
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:56,600
A lot of people keep track of it because that's easiest for them, but you can just do it all

4480
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:59,640
through Patreon when there's a new episode released.

4481
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:00,760
So, so there's your answer.

4482
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:01,760
That's how you do it.

4483
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:02,920
Be a patron mostly.

4484
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:05,720
We release the episodes there, you know, the end of the month or whatever.

4485
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,200
Uh, so that's it.

4486
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,760
Now, give us your money, please.

4487
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:10,760
Uh, uh, I, I have something to say.

4488
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:11,760
Sure.

4489
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:12,760
I have something to say.

4490
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:21,160
Now, it is probably, it is probably possible with the right connections to, uh, this is

4491
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:25,400
like one of those things, Ben, that's like, uh, this is like jury nullification, like

4492
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:29,120
it exists, but if you speak it, you are disqualified from existence.

4493
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:33,080
Well, I just want to, well, I just want to say, I just want to say that, uh, you know,

4494
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:38,920
I know that is a thing that people would probably do and I don't blame them for that,

4495
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:44,040
but consider the fact that we're only asking $5 for like 40 fucking bonus episodes.

4496
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,880
There's 25 out now, 25.

4497
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:50,200
So if you, so if you engage in that kind of activity, no judgment, but if you enjoy the

4498
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:56,320
content and you want to, and you want to say thanks, I will like, I will pull you up little

4499
02:22:56,320 --> 02:22:57,320
bench.

4500
02:22:57,320 --> 02:23:02,080
I've been known to go to Napster.com and download a hot M peg or an MP3 once in a while.

4501
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:06,360
So, so I, I get it kids, I get it, but, uh, yeah, I mean, you know, certainly appreciate

4502
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:07,360
this.

4503
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:08,840
Maybe, maybe I shouldn't, maybe I shouldn't even said anything.

4504
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:09,840
Oh, no, it's fine.

4505
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:14,200
It is what, and, and you know what, uh, bleep that'll allow bleep, bleep everything Ben

4506
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:15,200
said.

4507
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,200
Don't cut it, but just bleep it.

4508
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:20,080
I put some safety measures into place and here's what it is guys, even if those leak,

4509
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:25,040
I've taken the sneaky move of, so normally with PCB episodes, we have, uh, uh, an ad

4510
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:29,760
every half an hour, I decided as a compromise in case people decided they wanted to leak

4511
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:30,760
the bonus episodes.

4512
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:35,000
What I've done is I've placed ads at the very beginning and the very end, but not throughout

4513
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
the episode.

4514
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,680
So even if like people want to pass around bonus episodes and they, you know, whatever,

4515
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:44,360
like just the guy that got a ton of views or whatever, we would still get some money.

4516
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:46,440
So it's not like a total loss or anything.

4517
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:50,680
Oh, that's, that's not going to, I mean, it's not going to make a difference, but it's

4518
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:54,240
going to make, that's going to make, I mean, we got like, we got like, I mean, how many

4519
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:57,240
patrons we have a couple hundred or so something like that.

4520
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:58,240
Yeah.

4521
02:23:58,240 --> 02:23:59,240
So like, I get it.

4522
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:04,240
So if that number gets, if that number gets boosted up to a solid 500, we're going to

4523
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:07,480
make, we're going to make a cool 20 cents a piece on each of those.

4524
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:08,480
Okay.

4525
02:24:08,480 --> 02:24:09,480
You know what?

4526
02:24:09,480 --> 02:24:12,320
You might be making a fair point, but the other thing is just that, uh, we can also

4527
02:24:12,320 --> 02:24:14,880
see just like the view counts on the bonus episodes.

4528
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:18,280
So like if it goes more than a couple hundred, we know that like, okay, some shenanigans

4529
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:20,800
are up here, but, uh, but that's like never happened.

4530
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:25,160
So I've, uh, I've been pretty, feel pretty confident that most people are, uh, not stealing

4531
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:26,160
it.

4532
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:27,160
Although there was that one episode.

4533
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:32,080
And I'm just saying, I'm just saying pledge to the Patreon for the bonus episodes, sure,

4534
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:35,800
but also just if you like what we do and if you want to support us.

4535
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:38,720
My Patreon, my personal one is just to support my work.

4536
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:41,960
So that model is, it does, it's not, not terrible.

4537
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:42,960
Uh, okay.

4538
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:43,960
Let's move on.

4539
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:44,960
Next one.

4540
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:48,720
We've got a call from, should I make a move on her?

4541
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:49,720
Uh, let's see.

4542
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:50,720
No.

4543
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:51,720
Strong no.

4544
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:52,720
Next question.

4545
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:56,600
I'm going to see detective Pikachu with a girl.

4546
02:24:56,600 --> 02:25:01,080
Should I make a move on her like holding hands?

4547
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:02,080
Hmm.

4548
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:03,080
Let me know.

4549
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:04,080
No.

4550
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:08,360
Well, Detective Pikachu, it's nice that you're bringing, you know, fucking like Clefairy to

4551
02:25:08,360 --> 02:25:12,280
the premiere of your, your movie, but I don't know, man.

4552
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:15,520
I mean, the thing she resists is you, you know, type.

4553
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,520
Yeah.

4554
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:18,560
What are you going to, what are you going to tell your grandkids 50 years down the line

4555
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:21,960
and tell you to, oh, I met your grandma at Detective Pikachu.

4556
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:22,960
No.

4557
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:23,960
You're right.

4558
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:24,960
You're right.

4559
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:29,960
Are you going to tell your fucking dog next year that you snogged your girlfriend while

4560
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:32,960
watching Pikachu snogged Ronald Reynolds?

4561
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:36,920
You know, you know, these men speak wisdom instead of all that.

4562
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:42,960
What you should do is tell no one as you're alone on your deathbed about all the times

4563
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:46,120
you didn't go talk to the girl that you wanted to talk to.

4564
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:47,120
That's a much better solution.

4565
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:48,120
That's right.

4566
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:49,120
Yeah.

4567
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:50,120
I think that's right.

4568
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:53,640
You, you only you and God will know how pure you are.

4569
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:54,640
Holding hands would be all right.

4570
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:57,000
I would say you should try holding hands.

4571
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,640
If she's like, get a, get away, get away from me.

4572
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:00,640
I hate you.

4573
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:01,640
Then it's probably something up.

4574
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:08,080
Look, obviously any, any approach or like anything that you do to any girl, like, like

4575
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:12,560
it could be like a great date thing that you're totally into, like, or it could be some kind

4576
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:13,560
of sexual assault.

4577
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:17,120
I'm just saying like, like if you just walk up to a random girl, say nothing and grab

4578
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:18,120
her hand.

4579
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:19,120
That's like technically assault.

4580
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:22,840
Well, no, the city is already going to the thing with a girl.

4581
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:25,960
I mean, even if you're going to a girl that you like know and your friends with, like,

4582
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:30,160
if she's not thinking of you romantically in any way and you just like make a move, then

4583
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:32,120
like you're just setting yourself up for failure.

4584
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:36,760
So you got to, uh, I mean, yeah, like, like, okay, I'll just, here's the little crash course.

4585
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,320
You can test the waters here.

4586
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:41,600
And a lot of this is just sensing how she's vibing and if she's into it.

4587
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:45,920
All you got to do is like, like it's little things like, uh, like if she's comfortable,

4588
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:46,920
okay, what do you want to do?

4589
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:48,840
You want to establish physical connection.

4590
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:51,840
I'm just going to let, ask you to let you, let her read your palm, read her palm.

4591
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:52,840
Oh yeah.

4592
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:53,840
Okay.

4593
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:54,840
That's the classic one.

4594
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:57,840
That one's a little corny, a little corny, but like things like read that palm, read

4595
02:26:57,840 --> 02:26:58,840
that.

4596
02:26:58,840 --> 02:26:59,840
Here's a weird thing.

4597
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:00,840
Okay.

4598
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:02,960
If anybody's ever gone out and like try to hit on girls and stuff, you may sense like

4599
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:08,040
a weird wall appear and it's the wall of like the mutual recognition that neither of

4600
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:11,200
you have ever physically touched the other person.

4601
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:15,920
And as long as that like is there, like there's going to be like a weird kind of aura going

4602
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:17,840
on if you're like trying to get to know this person.

4603
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:21,080
So what you want, you want to smash through that quickly and a lot of guys who are friend

4604
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:24,840
zoned or not necessarily friend zone, but haven't made a move or anything, they don't,

4605
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:25,840
they don't know about this.

4606
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,320
And I'm not saying like, grope up girls.

4607
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:30,200
What I'm saying is like, there's nothing wrong with like, when you're hanging out with

4608
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:34,440
a friend, like, you know, whatever, like touching them on the shoulder briefly or like something

4609
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:35,440
like that.

4610
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:36,440
Give her a fucking, give her a high five or whatever.

4611
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:37,440
Yeah.

4612
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:42,760
You know, there's any number of ways to break that, that, that initial like touch barrier.

4613
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:44,520
I'm guessing you are at that place.

4614
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:46,960
But even if you're beyond that, maybe you're, maybe you've hugged or whatever.

4615
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:48,920
It's not weird between you or anything.

4616
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:53,640
But I mean, yeah, just, you know, you got to vibe it out, like have fun, get her laughing.

4617
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:57,320
And then I don't know, I, at some point you got to make the commitment, I guess to try

4618
02:27:57,320 --> 02:27:58,600
for the smooch or something.

4619
02:27:58,600 --> 02:27:59,600
Just go straight for it.

4620
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:00,600
Okay.

4621
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:03,160
Don't even make it a big like anime Disney like kiss moment.

4622
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:05,080
Like be silly and playful.

4623
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:07,960
And like when you're having fun, when you're goofing around, you've established physical

4624
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:12,440
connection and you're having fun and laughing like, go for like a cheap kiss, like be silly

4625
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:13,440
about it.

4626
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:14,440
Like call it a joke.

4627
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:15,440
But you know,

4628
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:19,560
you're the kiss until Mr. Mime appears on screen and that's your moment, that's your

4629
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:20,560
signal.

4630
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:21,560
I don't know.

4631
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:25,200
Also in general, here's a movie going power move.

4632
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:29,560
You stand on top of the seats in front of you and you just, you like with your arms

4633
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:30,560
crossed.

4634
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:31,560
Oh no.

4635
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:32,560
Yeah.

4636
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:34,120
You T-pose while watching the movie.

4637
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:38,920
In front of your, of your, so she's so that she's looking through your legs at the movie.

4638
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:43,080
You don't, you do not move.

4639
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:44,800
Embracing your sexuality passively.

4640
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:45,800
The entire time.

4641
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:46,800
Yeah.

4642
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:47,800
That's the way to do it.

4643
02:28:47,800 --> 02:28:48,800
Yeah.

4644
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:49,800
Give some of that a try.

4645
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:50,800
Well, let us know how it goes.

4646
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:51,800
Yeah.

4647
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:52,800
I don't know.

4648
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:53,800
Let us know how this advice works out for you.

4649
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:54,800
Please do let us know.

4650
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:55,800
Cause I'm curious.

4651
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:57,800
You got, you got to take the, take the leap at some point though.

4652
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:01,080
You know, you can't, you can't, uh, you can't get a girl unless you risk losing her.

4653
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:02,960
I mean, that's absolutely true.

4654
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:06,120
And like, you know, it's not like pin her down and make out with her and not that, not

4655
02:29:06,120 --> 02:29:10,840
that kind of risk, my dude, uh, you know, it's not, not unless she signs a waiver.

4656
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:11,840
There's going to be a point.

4657
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:12,840
In triplicate.

4658
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:13,840
Yeah.

4659
02:29:13,880 --> 02:29:14,880
And like, I don't know.

4660
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:15,880
I remember struggling with this a lot.

4661
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:19,480
We're like, you know, you're not like letting a girl know you're into her, but at some

4662
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:23,080
point she has to be made aware that you're actually into her.

4663
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:29,560
Um, and I say playfully approaching that like in a humorous way, uh, while, you know, doing

4664
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:32,000
a little physical contact, I think is the way to go.

4665
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:43,280
I would recommend a red nose, white makeup, rainbow wig.

4666
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:46,280
And one of those flowers that you squeeze and the water comes out.

4667
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:47,280
Yep.

4668
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:48,280
Yep.

4669
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:49,280
Just get her nice and moist.

4670
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:50,280
Say it on a unicycle.

4671
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:51,280
You know, that's the new, that's the new shirt.

4672
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:54,080
If you wouldn't say it on a unicycle, why say it at all?

4673
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,080
You know, have the car.

4674
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:56,080
Haha.

4675
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:57,080
I like you, honk.

4676
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:58,880
New, new, new shirt on the, on the teespring.

4677
02:29:58,880 --> 02:29:59,880
Say it on a unicycle.

4678
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:03,680
I get a custard pie through her in her face the first moment you see her.

4679
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:05,200
Hey, that's contact, right?

4680
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:06,200
Break.

4681
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:07,200
Well, not really.

4682
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:08,200
Okay.

4683
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:09,200
Whatever.

4684
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,200
All right.

4685
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:11,200
Hopefully that's enough.

4686
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:12,760
And just be cool.

4687
02:30:12,760 --> 02:30:15,240
And that's honestly 90% of it.

4688
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:16,240
Just be yourself.

4689
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:17,240
Lol.

4690
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:18,240
Okay.

4691
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:20,240
Let's move on.

4692
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:21,240
Haha.

4693
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:22,240
That'll, that'll fuck him up.

4694
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:23,240
Sure will.

4695
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:28,560
We've got a call from Nate is a hypocrite spelled with kooky capitalization one.

4696
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:29,560
Okay.

4697
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:31,960
H H I P P O C R I T.

4698
02:30:31,960 --> 02:30:32,960
That's correct.

4699
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:34,640
Let's see what we've got.

4700
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:38,960
Let's go at the risk of reopening a can of worms.

4701
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:46,440
Uh, I would like for Nate to clarify his stance in regards to the whole, uh, subscribe

4702
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:51,480
to PewDiePie meme shut down topic from last week's episode.

4703
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:57,680
Um, cause I hear some, uh, some contradictions with Nate's philosophy.

4704
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:01,200
And I just want to give him more credit for more credit than that and, uh, let him defend

4705
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,200
his position.

4706
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:07,840
Steelman me, Nate has been a staunch defender of the capitalist market and the capitalist

4707
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,480
system.

4708
02:31:09,480 --> 02:31:14,800
And this is a perfect example of that, uh, people in the market decided that something

4709
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:16,760
was not profitable anymore.

4710
02:31:16,760 --> 02:31:20,920
You know, the, the image of subscribed to PewDiePie and all the baggage that comes with

4711
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:24,480
that, they made the decision to outwardly not support it.

4712
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:29,280
And then the market changed, uh, and this became completely untenable.

4713
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:36,080
So PewDiePie made the capitalist financial decision to change his mind to, uh, respond

4714
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:39,520
to the market so that he could make more money and continue to be a viable brand.

4715
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:46,680
Um, I don't really see the issue here because in a capitalist mindset, this is how social

4716
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:51,960
ideas are, are propagated through, through the whims of the market and through the market

4717
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:53,560
forcing good ideas through.

4718
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:56,640
Um, so I don't know, I'd like you to clarify, Nate.

4719
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:57,640
Okay.

4720
02:31:57,640 --> 02:31:58,640
Quick, quick response.

4721
02:31:58,640 --> 02:31:59,640
This will be very simple.

4722
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:07,560
Um, you, in your question there, you are embedding the fact that like PewDiePie had to do this

4723
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:13,240
because there was a giant, you know, whatever, like, like his brand was suffering.

4724
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:14,840
Like, okay, like, I get it.

4725
02:32:14,840 --> 02:32:16,160
I understand your point there.

4726
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:18,440
Like, I, I don't quite agree with all those points.

4727
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:23,320
And just, just in short, uh, all I want to say is that like, what you're doing is you

4728
02:32:23,320 --> 02:32:27,160
are, you're criticizing or you're, you're coming back to me on like the economic level

4729
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:31,200
of, you know, this is the way the social landscape was.

4730
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:36,120
And PewDiePie reacted to it in a way that made sense logically in, you know, don't you

4731
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:37,120
endorse capitalism?

4732
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:38,600
Don't you endorse the free market?

4733
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:43,640
My criticism has nothing to do with people choosing to do what they want in response

4734
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:46,040
to market, market forces or anything.

4735
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:52,360
My criticism is solely having to do with the social framework that led up to that decision.

4736
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:56,560
And it is simply that like, I don't feel that things needed to go this way.

4737
02:32:56,560 --> 02:32:59,200
And so, so that is the focus of my criticism.

4738
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:00,640
Obviously people can do whatever they want.

4739
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:01,640
And yeah.

4740
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:08,080
So you are not, so you do not think, so you're not criticizing PewDiePie for saying, for

4741
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:12,480
backing off from the, for saying, don't say subscribe to PewDiePie.

4742
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:19,320
No, I kind of am, but only in the facet of like, I feel that he is validating this point

4743
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:26,520
by like acquiescing to, you know, this, this is something I realized after the discussion

4744
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:32,360
and I left a comment on the, the episode explaining why I think there was so much arguing during

4745
02:33:32,360 --> 02:33:33,360
that.

4746
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:40,120
It's because there is two sort of angles to take this from there's the viewer's perspective

4747
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:44,720
and then the content creators perspective, like this guy's talking about, it's more logical

4748
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:49,920
and capitalist to do this stuff, which is what I was arguing at the time.

4749
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:55,600
But Nate is more arguing about the fact that socially he wishes that this just wouldn't

4750
02:33:55,720 --> 02:33:56,720
happen this way.

4751
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:57,720
Yeah, that's true.

4752
02:33:57,720 --> 02:33:59,040
My comment is more in depth.

4753
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,880
If you go back to the episode, you'll see it.

4754
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:01,880
Okay.

4755
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:03,200
Well, I mean, that's all I got to say on this.

4756
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:04,520
So I mean, frankly, we can just move on.

4757
02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:08,240
Well, I don't wait, wait, no, I'm going to prod you because I don't think you've answered

4758
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:09,240
this guy's question.

4759
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:10,240
No, I think I did.

4760
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:14,520
No, because like, well, you said, well, you said that, yeah, you still think PewDiePie

4761
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:15,520
shouldn't have done it.

4762
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:16,520
Yeah.

4763
02:34:16,520 --> 02:34:21,440
But, but not for like, not because I'm actually being counter to myself and being anti-capitalist.

4764
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:23,800
I understand you have to do with the market dictates.

4765
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:28,000
My criticism is of the social like reality.

4766
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,480
I'm like, I like, basically my point is I wish people would not let these things, you

4767
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:34,200
know, let the influence them.

4768
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:36,960
So you're, so you're not criticizing PewDiePie's decision.

4769
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:40,760
Ben, no, in part I am for one reason.

4770
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:43,400
On the other hand, I understand why he made it.

4771
02:34:43,400 --> 02:34:44,400
That's my point.

4772
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:49,240
Well, if you understand why he made it and it was the right thing to do for capital

4773
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:50,240
God damn it.

4774
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:51,400
Why would you criticize it?

4775
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:53,120
You must understand nuance, right?

4776
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:54,480
There are things to be discussed.

4777
02:34:54,480 --> 02:34:55,480
It's not just one topic.

4778
02:34:55,480 --> 02:34:57,960
I understand that you're, I understand that you're trying to have it both ways here.

4779
02:34:57,960 --> 02:34:58,960
Ben, what the fuck?

4780
02:34:58,960 --> 02:34:59,960
I don't want to talk to you for a minute.

4781
02:34:59,960 --> 02:35:00,960
No, no, no, no, no.

4782
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:01,960
This is exactly why we sent the conversation last time.

4783
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:02,960
This is one different answer.

4784
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:03,960
Why won't you fucking answer my question?

4785
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:05,200
I answered you three times, Ben.

4786
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:06,200
But no, you haven't.

4787
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:07,200
The answer is clear.

4788
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:08,320
We can all understand what Nate's saying.

4789
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:09,320
We can all understand.

4790
02:35:09,320 --> 02:35:10,320
No, I can't.

4791
02:35:10,320 --> 02:35:12,280
But everyone else understands except you.

4792
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:13,280
You're the problem.

4793
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:14,280
You haven't, you haven't.

4794
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:17,280
No, you're trying to draw in the ways that are trying to make him look bad all the time.

4795
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:20,160
No, you've just given a, you've just given a non-answer.

4796
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:24,160
The answer is that he doesn't have an issue with that side of the debate.

4797
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:27,840
He does not have a problem with the fact that PewDiePie made it for an economic reasons.

4798
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:32,840
He has issue with the fact that he was forced to make this decision not because of the market

4799
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:38,240
problem, but he just upset that the social, that's what the social plane is like right

4800
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:39,240
now.

4801
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:41,240
Ben, I'll give you your answer.

4802
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:44,160
So what's to criticize about PewDiePie's decision then?

4803
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:46,520
It's about the social aspect of it.

4804
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:47,760
That's not what he said.

4805
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:52,120
No, for fuck's sake, there is two aspects to PewDiePie's decision.

4806
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:57,040
There is both the capitalist, good money management thing and the social thing.

4807
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,040
It's not one or the other.

4808
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:00,800
So I'm sorry, but my answer is I'm conflicted on it.

4809
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:05,240
That's my, I'm so sorry that I don't have a clear yes or no, and it's not about that

4810
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:08,320
I just actually hate fucking capitalism.

4811
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:09,320
It's actually wrong.

4812
02:36:09,320 --> 02:36:11,560
Gotcha, gotcha, Nate, gotcha.

4813
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:12,560
This is retarded.

4814
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:13,560
Let's move on.

4815
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:14,560
Okay, whatever.

4816
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:17,960
Because it's, it's, it's that it has both aspects.

4817
02:36:17,960 --> 02:36:22,800
One, the capitalist, Nate agrees with the other, he doesn't agree with, therefore conflicted.

4818
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:23,800
Yeah, but-

4819
02:36:23,800 --> 02:36:24,800
I mean, I get it.

4820
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:30,880
But then, but you, okay, I'm just confused because when I say that, you, like, it seems

4821
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:35,480
like your criticism of PewDiePie is something that other people did.

4822
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:40,560
No, no, no, no, okay, because I said before, my criticism is that I feel he acquiesced

4823
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:42,960
and I think that strengthens their argument.

4824
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:46,720
And I, I mean, again, I might have done the exact same thing because I'm not like an invincible

4825
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:51,480
super god of, you know, I wouldn't even say morals, like, of whatever, standing up for

4826
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:54,240
myself or, you know, fighting on my own behalf or whatever.

4827
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:59,680
But like, but I, to me, I, what I see is, you know, a little bit of giving in and I,

4828
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:04,240
you know, I'm just, just, they say in my piece, I don't, I wish he hadn't, but that's, that's

4829
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:05,240
how it seems to me.

4830
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:06,240
That's it.

4831
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:07,240
Is that more reasonable?

4832
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:11,320
But that, well, no, but let's continue.

4833
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:12,600
Okay.

4834
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:15,000
Gangster's PCP Paradise.

4835
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Please save us.

4836
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Oh no.

4837
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Bro, have you guys seen the Sonic Movie Trailer?

4838
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
It looks so fucking radical, dude, like, radical, tactical.

4839
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Oh my God.

4840
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Holy shit.

4841
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,000
I love it.

4842
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
It's Gangster's Paradise.

4843
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,000
That's the song.

4844
02:37:41,320 --> 02:37:54,880
Hey, all right, you did save us, Gangster's PCP Paradise.

4845
02:37:54,880 --> 02:38:00,680
Let's talk about how mad I am that people are happy that they're fixing Sonic's character

4846
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:01,680
design.

4847
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:06,360
Well, okay, so there's the artistic, like, okay, you could say like, hey man, respect

4848
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:07,680
the artist's vision.

4849
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:10,920
So you know, just let them do what they want, but on the other hand, I mean, I never thought

4850
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:12,700
this one looked very good.

4851
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:17,000
So I guess I don't think it, I, well, it's not that I think that you need to respect

4852
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:18,360
this artist's vision.

4853
02:38:18,360 --> 02:38:21,080
It's not that I think this is sacred, it shouldn't be changed.

4854
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:27,640
It's that, like, it's like, why would you be happy about anything related to this?

4855
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:30,440
If it's changing, it might improve, I guess.

4856
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:33,640
The design could get better, but I think the problem is the entire thing.

4857
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:34,640
Oh, I get it.

4858
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:35,640
I get it.

4859
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:37,840
It's just seems so doomed to begin with.

4860
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:44,280
If I had seen this trailer and Sonic had looked like Sonic, would I have been like, oh, looks

4861
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:45,280
good.

4862
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:46,800
Well, yeah, I guess not.

4863
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:48,120
I know it's not.

4864
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:53,560
I've heard, like, like, probably baseless rumors, but it was interesting as a thought

4865
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:56,520
that Christian came out in the movie.

4866
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:57,520
Yeah.

4867
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:03,720
No, that this initial trailer was made as deliberately really bad and they had like

4868
02:39:03,720 --> 02:39:05,680
a backup better looking Sonic.

4869
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:08,560
And this was all to build hype for the movie, to get people talking about it.

4870
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:11,200
You know, these are the kind of nimbus who would do that shit, the Sonic 2.

4871
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:16,400
I don't think that corporation, like, that seems like a really risky move that I don't

4872
02:39:16,400 --> 02:39:17,880
see a big company taking.

4873
02:39:17,880 --> 02:39:22,880
It's risky, but it's also risky to, like, remake the whole of the animation as well.

4874
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:25,280
That's a lot of money that I'll have to spend to do that.

4875
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:26,800
It's, yeah, true.

4876
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:28,880
It seems that way, though.

4877
02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:29,880
I don't know.

4878
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:31,840
I don't think companies are competent enough.

4879
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:35,440
I would probably say that this was not a scheme, but, like, it worked out so well.

4880
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:39,560
Like, people are so hyped to hear that, like, they're changing the character design.

4881
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:40,880
It seems like it was planned.

4882
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:42,320
It's like the new Coke thing.

4883
02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:47,800
Like people that the Coke introduced new Coke just so they could bring back a classic Coke,

4884
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:49,560
which I don't know, it's possible.

4885
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:50,560
If so, it was an incredibly risky move.

4886
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:53,840
These are very large brain moves that I cannot follow, but I mean, maybe.

4887
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:58,120
I think the reason people are excited in the first place, is it even because, like, oh,

4888
02:39:58,120 --> 02:39:59,360
the movie's gonna be great now.

4889
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:05,360
I think it's just the fucking amazing fact that, like, oh, this big Hollywood machine

4890
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:10,600
that just shits out bullshit is actually listening to constructive criticism, instead of just

4891
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:14,560
calling out everyone for being fake fans and being gay and yelling at everyone for complaining

4892
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:15,560
about something.

4893
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:16,560
I mean, if I had to guess.

4894
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:17,560
That is shocking.

4895
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:18,560
That is actually happening.

4896
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:22,600
I think that's where the kind of rejoicing is coming from.

4897
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:27,320
It's like, wow, there's actually a dialogue happening on this platform designed for dialogue.

4898
02:40:27,320 --> 02:40:28,320
What company is making this?

4899
02:40:28,320 --> 02:40:29,320
Paramount.

4900
02:40:30,280 --> 02:40:31,280
Paramount.

4901
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:34,280
They're all owned by Coke, anyway.

4902
02:40:34,280 --> 02:40:38,080
I want to say a small thought that has come up with the Sonic movie.

4903
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:45,920
Okay, so this is gonna get a tiny little bit philosophical, but when you are a person

4904
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:54,080
with ideas and an ideology, and then you reach a point in your life when you want to reject

4905
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:58,880
those ideas that you've had before in your life, and you think to yourself, no, this

4906
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:00,720
is not how I should be anymore.

4907
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:07,160
I have to stop some of the vices which I have been displaying.

4908
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:10,560
I have to make some changes in my life.

4909
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:15,960
Then it's easy to look at the way you act and the way that you feel and say, time to

4910
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:17,280
do the opposite.

4911
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:18,760
This is not working out for me.

4912
02:41:18,760 --> 02:41:24,160
I need to pull back, and pulling back can be a gradient.

4913
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:28,840
It doesn't have to be, you know, you completely turn heel and then whip the other way.

4914
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:35,680
The reason I say this is because I agree with the people who say there's too much cynicism

4915
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:37,040
in the online space.

4916
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:43,080
There's too many people who are too willing to just shit down movies or art in general

4917
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:44,640
or online creations.

4918
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:48,880
People are too cynical and mean and write things off too easily.

4919
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:53,880
But that doesn't mean that everything needs to be happy.

4920
02:41:53,880 --> 02:42:00,720
That doesn't mean that you have to always try and just, you know, steal a man or look

4921
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:03,640
on the bright side of some issues.

4922
02:42:03,640 --> 02:42:08,720
Sometimes, knee-jerk reactions are valid.

4923
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:14,120
You don't have to just pretend the SOG movie is going to be good for the sake of being

4924
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:15,120
positive.

4925
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:16,120
That's true.

4926
02:42:16,120 --> 02:42:17,120
Stop it, please.

4927
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:20,120
I don't know, maybe you'll surprise us.

4928
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:21,120
It will be glorious.

4929
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:24,120
It will be glorious when it's a tough dumpster fire.

4930
02:42:24,120 --> 02:42:26,120
The thing is, I've never liked Sonic.

4931
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:27,120
Like ever.

4932
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:29,120
Yeah, in any way.

4933
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:33,120
We can't encourage people, we can't encourage people to go see the movie.

4934
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:35,120
Just morbid curiosity, just to see how bad it is.

4935
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:40,120
Yeah, we should pull a little more money into the pockets of this company because it's

4936
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:44,120
going to be so funny to laugh at them as they laugh all the way to the bank.

4937
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:45,120
Yeah, that's true.

4938
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:46,120
On my dollar.

4939
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:50,120
What I'm trying to say is that, like, I've seen people, I've talked to people who are

4940
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:54,120
like, um, but you know, it won't be, you know, there's some problems, but you know, like

4941
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:58,120
look on the bright side, like no, no, I won't, we don't have to do that for everything.

4942
02:42:58,120 --> 02:43:02,120
I agree that there could be more of that in general, but it's the Sonic movie.

4943
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:07,120
Look on the bright side, I could spend money, I could spend money to a big corporation,

4944
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:09,120
I let the bright side.

4945
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:11,120
Somebody's going to buy a yacht.

4946
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:13,120
Isn't that, isn't that beautiful?

4947
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:14,120
Isn't that lovely?

4948
02:43:14,120 --> 02:43:15,120
Yeah.

4949
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:17,120
I contribute to some guy's yacht.

4950
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:21,120
Some guy, some guy deserved it, you know, for making the Sonic movie.

4951
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:25,120
He took the initiative, he made it happen, and God bless him.

4952
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:29,120
I'm sure whoever stole my bicycle is having a better time with it than I would in the

4953
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:30,120
industry.

4954
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:31,120
Oh, that's so true.

4955
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:32,120
Yeah, yeah.

4956
02:43:32,120 --> 02:43:33,120
He's going to have happiness.

4957
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:34,120
That's not like an Alturid comic.

4958
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:39,120
Those big-wig fat cats are going to enjoy my money more than I would have.

4959
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:41,120
What was that Alturid comic?

4960
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:45,120
I believe you're talking about bike-cuck, based.

4961
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:49,120
He's enjoying my bike more than I would have enjoyed still having it.

4962
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:52,120
By the way, slide it into my Sonic stance.

4963
02:43:52,120 --> 02:43:53,120
I just want to go on the record.

4964
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:58,120
I played Sonic Advance 1, 2, and 3, and those were great games, so I don't hate Sonic entirely.

4965
02:43:58,120 --> 02:44:00,120
I just think that he's kind of lame.

4966
02:44:00,120 --> 02:44:01,120
That was fucking amazing.

4967
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:02,120
But okay.

4968
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:06,120
Sonic was shit because I played it on my flip-flop, and it was the best time of my life.

4969
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:07,120
All right, that's sick.

4970
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:08,120
Okay, but check this out.

4971
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:12,120
Next voicemail is from Elmo recommends a sword game.

4972
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:15,120
So let's see what he's about.

4973
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:16,120
Go.

4974
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:17,120
Yes, please.

4975
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:18,120
Hello, everybody.

4976
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:23,120
I have heard that you all love sword games.

4977
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:28,120
The best one Elmo has played is the owner.

4978
02:44:28,120 --> 02:44:31,120
It has directional combat.

4979
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:33,120
Hey, we were talking about that.

4980
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:42,120
It's like Dark Souls if it was actually good.

4981
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:43,120
Yay.

4982
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:48,120
I know what the best looks like with a controller.

4983
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:53,120
So the swords to release are easier to point.

4984
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:57,120
Elmo hopes you all have so much fun.

4985
02:44:57,120 --> 02:44:59,120
Goodbye.

4986
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:00,120
Bitches.

4987
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:01,120
Bye.

4988
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:02,120
Bye, Arlo.

4989
02:45:02,120 --> 02:45:03,120
Hello.

4990
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:05,120
Here's some canon lore.

4991
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:08,120
That is Red Man's cousin.

4992
02:45:08,120 --> 02:45:09,120
Elmo.

4993
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:10,120
Yeah, that sounds right.

4994
02:45:10,120 --> 02:45:11,120
That sounds right.

4995
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:15,120
I think Arlo was blood this whole time.

4996
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:23,120
We're going to Arlo to call in, guys, I just watched the last episode of the PCP, and I

4997
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:28,120
just wanted to comment on Ben St's keto recipes.

4998
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:30,120
That's what I want.

4999
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:31,120
He's a keto man as well.

5000
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:33,120
You don't know the half of it.

5001
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:34,120
I don't.

5002
02:45:34,120 --> 02:45:35,120
Look at his physique.

5003
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:36,120
Ben second.

5004
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:37,120
Oh, my God.

5005
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:38,120
Look at those blue feathers.

5006
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:42,120
He's not a hardcore keto, but didn't I tell you about me getting that recipe for keto

5007
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:43,120
pizza crust?

5008
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:46,120
Yeah, I just didn't know if that could have been kind of a coincidence if he was doing

5009
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:47,120
keto something.

5010
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:48,120
I mean, he's not full keto.

5011
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:51,120
He just wanted to lower his carb intake.

5012
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:54,120
Arlo is what happens when you go full keto.

5013
02:45:54,120 --> 02:45:57,120
So he's a coward, basically.

5014
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:59,120
What is the deal with Elmo?

5015
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:00,120
Why do kids like Elmo?

5016
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:02,120
I mean, because they're babies and he's nice.

5017
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:06,120
Because he's got a high voice and they pushed it really hard, I guess.

5018
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:07,120
I know.

5019
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:10,120
I've met babies who just fucking are apeshit for Elmo, and I'm like, dude, what's the

5020
02:46:10,120 --> 02:46:11,120
deal?

5021
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:13,120
And I'm like, what's even the disarmed kutzwerk at work here?

5022
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:14,120
I don't even fucking get it.

5023
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:18,120
You go down to your local vape shop and all the babies are in there.

5024
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:19,120
Vape it away.

5025
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:21,120
You start up a little conversation with them.

5026
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:22,120
They're talking about Elmo again.

5027
02:46:22,120 --> 02:46:23,120
Oh, these guys suck.

5028
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:25,120
It's like, hey, explain it to me.

5029
02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:26,120
Explain Elmo.

5030
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:27,120
I want to get it.

5031
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:28,120
I want to understand.

5032
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:29,120
Like, tell me what it is.

5033
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:30,120
Like, what am I missing here?

5034
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:34,120
They go Google GaGa and they take a hit of that vape.

5035
02:46:34,120 --> 02:46:35,120
All right.

5036
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:36,120
Let's get the hell out of here.

5037
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:38,120
She's a cookie monster on the whole plane.

5038
02:46:38,120 --> 02:46:41,120
Wait, cookie monster, total killer.

5039
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:42,120
Yeah, that's true.

5040
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:43,120
That's true.

5041
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:44,120
No, no.

5042
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:46,120
Cookie monster's a big rowdy.

5043
02:46:46,120 --> 02:46:49,120
He eats baked goods.

5044
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:52,120
Therefore, he can't be a killer because he's not keto.

5045
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:54,120
I think Big Bird's a killer, though.

5046
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:56,120
Big Bird's a juvie.

5047
02:46:56,120 --> 02:46:57,120
Kermit, Kermit the Frog's a killer.

5048
02:46:57,120 --> 02:46:58,120
Kermit?

5049
02:46:58,120 --> 02:46:59,120
Yeah.

5050
02:46:59,120 --> 02:47:00,120
I don't know.

5051
02:47:00,120 --> 02:47:01,120
He seemed like a real juvie to me.

5052
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:02,120
He's like a neutral arbiter of wisdom.

5053
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:03,120
Oh, yeah.

5054
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:04,120
I don't know.

5055
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:05,120
I don't know.

5056
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:06,120
Oh, God.

5057
02:47:06,120 --> 02:47:10,120
You know, the thing about, the best thing about living in Slime City is that you can change.

5058
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:11,120
You can betray your faction.

5059
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:12,120
That's true.

5060
02:47:12,120 --> 02:47:13,120
You can contain multitudes.

5061
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:16,120
You can be whatever you want to be in New Los Angeles City.

5062
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:17,120
One can be many.

5063
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:19,120
You can watch the slime economy crumble in Neo-Milwaukee.

5064
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:21,120
You can hear this juvie stomach's rumble.

5065
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:22,120
Well, on that note.

5066
02:47:22,120 --> 02:47:23,120
Quotes.

5067
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:25,120
Oh, fucking quickly.

5068
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:27,120
Animal, Red Man's uncle.

5069
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:28,120
Oh, animal.

5070
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:29,120
Oh, yeah.

5071
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:30,120
Okay.

5072
02:47:30,120 --> 02:47:31,120
They're all canon.

5073
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:34,120
There's a full Sesame Street lore tied in with Red Man.

5074
02:47:34,120 --> 02:47:35,120
Don't even get him started.

5075
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:36,120
Yeah.

5076
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:37,120
Okay.

5077
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:38,120
Here we go.

5078
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:41,120
I should try and find out how to buy a Muppet of Red Man.

5079
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:45,120
Unsee Arlo as the chief Muppet man on YouTube.

5080
02:47:45,120 --> 02:47:46,120
Okay.

5081
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:47,120
Here we go.

5082
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:51,120
She-Pollution role-playing as a PCP member.

5083
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:53,120
Let's commence.

5084
02:47:54,120 --> 02:47:57,120
How many more voicemails do we have to listen to?

5085
02:47:57,120 --> 02:48:00,120
I don't know what these fuckers are doing, but I got deadline.

5086
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:03,120
I got people waiting for me for my next big project.

5087
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:04,120
It will be great.

5088
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:06,120
It will be the best thing they'll ever see.

5089
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:10,120
But I can't finish it as long as these fucking voicemails keep coming up.

5090
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:11,120
And they all suck.

5091
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:12,120
All the voicemails suck.

5092
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:13,120
Oh, I hate them.

5093
02:48:13,120 --> 02:48:17,120
I wish they all died in a shit.

5094
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:20,120
A shitty poopy shit.

5095
02:48:20,120 --> 02:48:21,120
Yes.

5096
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:28,120
So my question is, how accurate does this describe you?

5097
02:48:28,120 --> 02:48:32,120
Not necessarily right now, but just in general, when you're recording an episode and you're

5098
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:37,120
nearing the end, how much do you want it to end so you can continue working on your project?

5099
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:42,120
Ironically, 100% this is the most related I've ever been to personally.

5100
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:43,120
Yeah, yeah.

5101
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:44,120
Right now.

5102
02:48:44,120 --> 02:48:45,120
Very specifically right now.

5103
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:50,120
Well, I spend the voicemails waiting for real my ass back.

5104
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:54,120
Well, you're in luck there, Ben, because we've got one coming up next right here, baby.

5105
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:55,120
All right.

5106
02:48:55,120 --> 02:48:56,120
Yeah.

5107
02:48:56,120 --> 02:48:57,120
Let's get into it immediately.

5108
02:48:57,120 --> 02:48:58,120
Here we go.

5109
02:48:58,120 --> 02:48:59,120
Riddle my ass, Batman.

5110
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:00,120
The song continues right now.

5111
02:49:00,120 --> 02:49:01,120
Wait, what?

5112
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:02,120
Okay.

5113
02:49:02,120 --> 02:49:03,120
It didn't work.

5114
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:04,120
Wait, sorry.

5115
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:05,120
Hang on.

5116
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:06,120
Hang on.

5117
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:07,120
I don't know what that was about.

5118
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:08,120
Okay.

5119
02:49:08,120 --> 02:49:09,120
Copy.

5120
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:10,120
Riddle my ass, Batman is canceled.

5121
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:11,120
And okay, let's try again.

5122
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:12,120
Go.

5123
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:13,120
Is your eye better, Batman?

5124
02:49:13,120 --> 02:49:14,120
Yes, Riddle.

5125
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:15,120
Good.

5126
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:19,120
Because I want you to see the next poor soul you failed to save.

5127
02:49:19,120 --> 02:49:22,120
You, Riddle, let's go ahead with the riddles.

5128
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:27,120
I have four legs on which to stand.

5129
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:31,120
It's my eyes skimmed by, watching on the slide.

5130
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:35,120
When I'm hungry, it's grass I eat, soaking in Africa's heat.

5131
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:38,120
Big and fierce, but cute as well.

5132
02:49:38,120 --> 02:49:41,120
It's well known that I yell, yawn and toot.

5133
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:43,120
Who am I, Batman?

5134
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:47,120
It's the first riddle you give me that doesn't suck, Riddle.

5135
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:49,120
The answer is hippo.

5136
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:50,120
Very well.

5137
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:52,120
Riddle at least a minute.

5138
02:49:52,120 --> 02:49:53,120
Thank you, Batman.

5139
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:54,120
Thank you, Batman.

5140
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:55,120
Thank you, Batman.

5141
02:49:55,120 --> 02:49:56,120
Hippo.

5142
02:49:56,120 --> 02:50:00,120
I just want you to know that when a dating sim comes out, I'm choosing you as my lover.

5143
02:50:00,120 --> 02:50:01,120
Wow.

5144
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:02,120
Whoa.

5145
02:50:02,120 --> 02:50:04,120
Thank you, Batman.

5146
02:50:04,120 --> 02:50:05,120
Crash.

5147
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:09,120
Holy heartwarming, heartwarming hippos, Batman.

5148
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:11,120
I never paid you as a hippo fan.

5149
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:12,120
Why not?

5150
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:13,120
He's the funniest.

5151
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:15,120
By the way, did you bring the stuff?

5152
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:16,120
Yes, Batman.

5153
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:17,120
Yeah.

5154
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:19,120
Robin finally arrived in the battlefield.

5155
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:23,120
Well, the supplies he brought me enough to save the merinimias of the PCP to the next

5156
02:50:23,120 --> 02:50:24,120
time I find out.

5157
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:26,120
Same PCP time.

5158
02:50:26,120 --> 02:50:28,120
Same PCP channel.

5159
02:50:28,120 --> 02:50:29,120
Whoo.

5160
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:30,120
Oh, the glorious.

5161
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:35,120
That's why you're the chief of the Hall of Fame.

5162
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:36,120
Yeah.

5163
02:50:36,120 --> 02:50:37,120
Goddamn.

5164
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:38,120
Once again.

5165
02:50:38,120 --> 02:50:39,120
Every time.

5166
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:41,120
What was that about taking you as his lover?

5167
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:42,120
In the PCP dating sim.

5168
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:44,120
In the PCP dating sim.

5169
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:45,120
Oh, yes.

5170
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:46,120
He's a fan.

5171
02:50:46,120 --> 02:50:49,120
He's following at PCP dating daily.

5172
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:50,120
Wow.

5173
02:50:50,120 --> 02:50:51,120
Incredible.

5174
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:52,120
That was great.

5175
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:53,120
As always.

5176
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:54,120
I'm flattered.

5177
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:55,120
What a...

5178
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:56,120
And I'm safe.

5179
02:50:56,120 --> 02:50:57,120
Yes, you are.

5180
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:58,120
Most of us are safe now.

5181
02:50:58,120 --> 02:50:59,120
For now.

5182
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:00,120
For now.

5183
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:01,120
Who's still there?

5184
02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:04,120
I'm sure this is all part of Riddle My Ass' plan.

5185
02:51:04,120 --> 02:51:05,120
It could be.

5186
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:06,120
So it's all part of his grand plan.

5187
02:51:06,120 --> 02:51:07,120
I think so.

5188
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:08,120
I think he's building to something incredible.

5189
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:09,120
But let me see.

5190
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:12,120
I think Jesse and Digi are still up there.

5191
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:13,120
Anybody else?

5192
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:14,120
I can't think of anybody else.

5193
02:51:14,120 --> 02:51:15,120
I don't know.

5194
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:16,120
The Davoo.

5195
02:51:16,120 --> 02:51:17,120
The Davoo.

5196
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:18,120
No, Davoo's been saved.

5197
02:51:18,120 --> 02:51:19,120
Davoo saved.

5198
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:20,120
When have we got Davoo?

5199
02:51:20,120 --> 02:51:21,120
Oh, did we?

5200
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:22,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

5201
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:23,120
I think that was last episode.

5202
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:24,120
Davoo saved.

5203
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:25,120
I think everybody else is saved.

5204
02:51:25,120 --> 02:51:26,120
I think there's only those two left.

5205
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:27,120
Unless I'm forgetting something.

5206
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:30,120
But the sagas nearing its conclusion, ladies and gentlemen.

5207
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:36,120
Will Batman be able to continue to puzzle out these epic reasoning games?

5208
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:37,120
We'll see.

5209
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:40,120
It seems like Riddle My Ass Batman's riddles are getting better.

5210
02:51:40,120 --> 02:51:41,120
They are improving.

5211
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:42,120
He's growing more powerful.

5212
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:43,120
Yeah.

5213
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:48,120
The problem is with only two people left to choose, it really narrows down the focus

5214
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:53,120
of who's going to be the answer.

5215
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:55,120
He's going to have a tough time with that last one.

5216
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:57,120
There's only one person left.

5217
02:51:57,120 --> 02:52:01,120
Well, it'll be Digi, and Digi will have not been on an episode in months, and so he'll

5218
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:02,120
forget that he's a member.

5219
02:52:02,120 --> 02:52:06,120
He'll be like, uh, uh, Jeff, no, no, gone.

5220
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:08,120
Well, we'll see.

5221
02:52:08,120 --> 02:52:09,120
We'll see what happens.

5222
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:12,120
But anyway, I guess that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
