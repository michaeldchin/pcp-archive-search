00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am the best guy ever, which is a temporal designation, cause cool things used to happen, but I've always been the best.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, I longed for those days when I was the best, which is also now. Also, Hippocrit is here.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I forgot how it went. The bad leg, that's why you're sitting there, I kicked your leg out.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Fuck you. You ruined it, Davoo. You ruined everything by fucking up your audio.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's a good intro and it's gone now. It's gone forever.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Jesse's here, Endless Jess.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I am the mighty toer, a hinga-dinga-derigan. I love the Swedish meatballs.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Tommy Oliver. What's up, dude?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I got to recover my formula to defeat the Jews. It was there and now it's gone.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh god, without context, it just sounds like you're an anti-Semite.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh no. I mean, he is.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And our mutual mortal enemy, Davoo. Thank you for joining us.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So we're all feeling very nostalgic today. That was the topic of the episode.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We recorded an intro, you guys. It was a glorious intro, but it died. It was deleted.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's in the sands of history at the sands of time now.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The thing that's quite apt is that it wasn't even that good, but we all love it because it was in the past and it's gone forever.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh my god. That's so apropos. That's absolutely true. It was total shit.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Garbage. It was garbage.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But I love it. It's my intro.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes. Many shit intros, but that one was ours.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But anyway, let's just, we're going to talk about nostalgia. What's the fucking deal with it?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And luckily, we have the world's foremost expert on nostalgia, Hippocrite, here with us to tell us everything we need to know.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The nostalgia critic's here?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh no. God, please.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He critiqued my video. That's what he did. That's all he's known for.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Wow. That epic review of one video made by Hippocrite.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hippo, what is nostalgia? What is it?

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It is. I love for a simpler time, usually an earlier time.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I mean, it's probably an earlier because you can't have nostalgia for the future.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But the point is, it's a time before, and you really wish you could go back.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And things from that time are sort of, they make you feel good just by reminding you of that time.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And that's generally, I think, what it is.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, you know, I looked up the definition on Urban Dictionary, and the description is boring, but there's something interesting here.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So the top definition of nostalgia on Urban Dictionary just says,

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And also, the condition of being homesick, homesickness, and there's no examples.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So this is one they didn't really give a shit about.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But underneath it, it just says photos and videos, and there's just one picture there, and it is a PlayStation 1.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I'm like, yeah, dude, yeah, that is so fucking apt.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know what, speaking of PlayStation 1, the thing that always gets me, that like hits that nostalgia bone,

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
is when you actually plug in the PlayStation 1 and press power, and you get that BOOM!

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah!

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's the best.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't get why consoles don't do that shit anymore.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When did they give up?

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Like, did they give up after Gamecube, which was the best one?

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Like, I just thought, okay, we're done now.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know, that PS1 sound was like the coolest sound of all time.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And then it started the game, and then it had like a sequel like Little China.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, there were two of them on the PS1.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm so fucking ready!

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And then the game was never as good as that sound.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And like, even like when you would play like PS1 games on like the PS3 when it was backwards compatible,

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
it would have the second one, it would have the second one of like the logo, but it didn't have the BOOM!

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It didn't have that part.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, you know what? I've been playing like PS1 games on PS3 for so long.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I forgot that that was the first blang.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, it was the first blang!

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You know, when I think of that sound, I always inevitably follow it up in my mind with, there's that

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And then after the PlayStation 1 thing resolves, I just hear that

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The Final Fantasy IX intro is what comes to my mind immediately.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That was the first PS1 game that I got super invested in, so yeah, I'm exactly the same.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hey, you know, Final Fantasy VII would have taken it, but there is no like song that plays when you get to the title screen of Final Fantasy VII.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's why it's the worst game.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I still have my original PlayStation, and I just like, not even plugging it in, just clicking the open the latch button,

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and it goes kching with the spring sound.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And you love that shit.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And like the fucking Game Boy transitioning to the DS was the same problem where the Game Boy Advance was

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Dwaaaang.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then the DS was just dun-nun-nun-nun-nun.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, it was pretty shit.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What the fuck?

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It was definitely less cool.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It was like way less cool.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What was interesting was that the Game Boy Advance, like visual that a Component had more like visual complexity than the DS one.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The DS one just kind of faded in, but like the Game Boy was like, look, we could do 3D-esque things now.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Isn't this cool?

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I wonder why they stopped doing that.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I know why.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll tell you why.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll tell you why.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's fucking big government.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's what this problem is.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Big government coming in here.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Fucking crippling our beautiful game intros.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You know what's funny is that I was actually questioning it myself, and I was actually thinking of a not ironic answer

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
that was kind of similar along the same lines.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh yeah?

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you want to hear my logic, but that's not really the topic of today, so.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I was thinking it's my aesthetic sensibilities have changed.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, I think it might be more to do with the fact that they're also making like huge menus

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
for consoles instead of just like, you know.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Honestly, I was honestly like unironically thinking it may have something to do with the Sherman Antitrust Act.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Wow.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What do they do?

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What's your, what's the connection there?

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, because I was thinking about Microsoft, right?

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because like Windows 95 had all this personality.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You know, its intro was like Brian Eno.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How'd it go?

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No, no, no, that's the fucking Game Boy one.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You know, dude, fuck, I can't even do it.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's such a complex melody.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I can't even enunciate it.

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's pretty, I know the one.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In the 2000s, they just kind of gave up on that shit.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I'm like, hmm, what changed about Microsoft in that time period?

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, well that would have been when Bill Gates was kicked out of the leading role,

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and that's when the government cracked down on their supposed monopolies,

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and they had to rearrange a bunch of shit.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So maybe the government said, don't have personality.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't lead people to think you have personality.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And then like all the other tech companies followed from Microsoft's example.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So yeah.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
All I want to say to that taboo is correlation does not necessarily imply causation.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, it's the best theory I can come up with.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, I mean, Apple still has that chime that they've had since like the early 90s.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, they haven't like done anything with it for like 10 years, though.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah, but they're a bunch of fucking millennial scum, Apple.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I wasn't trying to defend it.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I wasn't trying to defend it, but they haven't fucking...

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The sound is boring.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I haven't fucking...

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I haven't really liked Crash Bandicoot 3.

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
They still use the same goddamn phones and the same design.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You know, you jump around, you spin.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Who, Apple?

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's so cool.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You want to talk about nostalgia.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You know, first level of Crash Bandicoot 3, you get the wizard,

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
you hit him with your attack.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's good.

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
My...

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
When we...

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
When we bought a PlayStation 1, I remember this day so well.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now, this is a day I'm very nostalgic for.

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We had had like a Super Nintendo and like a Game Boy and a couple little...

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And an original Nintendo for a few years.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But we went, we...

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Me and my brother pooled our money, bought ourselves a PlayStation 1.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
My dad, out of the kindness of his heart, bought us a dedicated TV to use with it.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Whoa.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And the two games we brought home, this old-ass tube TV that's still in my house and works to this day,

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and we bought ourselves Crash Bandicoot 1 and Final Fantasy 7,

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
were the two games that we brought home that day.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That is a solid story.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It was a magical...

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It was a magical day.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll never forget it.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Writing in the car home with my family that I loved, that was great.

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know, what...

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That reminds me of like a feeling I've had that I've missed,

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
is like the idea of just having a console and having just a couple games on it,

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and just switching between them, because like you don't have real money.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Like you got...

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh yeah, if I'm tired of playing Crash, then let's go for a fucking epic Final Fantasy sort of.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It forces you to like explore every nuance of what made the games good.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
As opposed to now, you've got 20,000 Steam games, so you play them each for like two minutes,

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and you don't really get the worst.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, what I was thinking is, because I've long felt that I don't have like nostalgic feelings,

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but like lately I'm thinking something I definitely have nostalgic feelings for is video games,

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
but not video games in general, but like specific moments or aspects of very specific video games.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Because like I've been playing through Earthbound for the first time,

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and there's so many moments where I'm like, oh sweet, that's cool.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That was like a fun little charming moment.

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And then I think, man, if I had been playing this when I was nine,

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
which wouldn't have been possible, it wasn't localized.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If I'd been playing this like ten years ago.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Are you talking about Earthbound or Mother 3 or something?

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, Earthbound, yeah, yeah, Mother 2.

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And like every single one of those moments would have been like amazing to me at the time,

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
because it would have taken me like so much longer to figure out, you know?

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's true, that's true.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That was a key of like having a lot of nostalgia for so many moments for Mario and Luigi Superstar Sack.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It was because I hadn't played any RPGs before, so I had no idea how to play them,

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and I didn't know like where to look up to like get hints.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So like I would get stuck on certain moments for weeks,

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
just pouring over all the little details of everything,

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and not having any other entertainment to go to.

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So yeah, it was really like being stuck in this like void with nothing but you and this one thing,

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and this one little problem you have to figure out.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And you spend so much time on it, you really get attached to it.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But now, now that I have gaming skills, they all just kind of come and go so quickly

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that they don't leave as much impact.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I've got to cut in and just remind the people out there that yes,

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I too have nostalgia for Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga.

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That does not mean it is not also just objectively the greatest game ever made.

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It is a really good game.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There is no amount of nostalgia will color the fact that it is the best game ever made,

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and fuck you if you disagree.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, it's a really good game.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
As Nate said earlier, like I'm an expert on nostalgia,

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
because only I think because I made a video called why nostalgia is a good thing.

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can't actually remember what I said, but I think what the point was,

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
was there's a difference between a nostalgic enjoyment of something

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and an actual enjoyment in a way.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I think, actually, forget it.

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I can't remember whether that was my point,

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and I don't know whether I even agree with that video.

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, we should all go watch that video again.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Everyone go to Hippocrates, like the first video on the channel.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, do go to Hippocrates.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No, do it. You have no choice. Go watch it.

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But I was going to expand a little bit on what Jesse was saying before

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
about how I definitely agree that just the changing dynamics of the game's market,

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
having flooded, just flooded games like Duck Game and things like that

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that are built to be like sort of like popcorn games,

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
like consumable party games that you don't really necessarily have to spend a lot of time with.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
They're designed to be like let's played once, and that's right.

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Like that's like their whole source of revenue,

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
is people watch goofy let's plays and buy them and never play them,

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
because they're garbage games.

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I got way more out of Duck Game than I get out of most online multiplayer games.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't know about you.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Duck Game is pretty fun, but I don't really have any of the popcorn games out there

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that are made just to be less played, like I Am Bread or something.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Like nobody actually cares about that game, but it was made for like one week.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't have to speak for...

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't have to speak for...

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Definitely that kind of game for sure.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Right. I can only speak for myself here, but I much...

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I mean, okay, this is literally just me, and I don't know how many people this applies to,

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
but I way prefer like playing games alone, a single one-player experience,

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
getting absorbed in it.

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I have been playing this last week or two near Automata,

228
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and I near as a great series because it gives you the thing that I crave most out of a video game,

229
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
like it incentivizes you with in-game rewards to basically 100% it.

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And that is the best thing that every game gives you, that a game could give me.

231
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It encourages me to explore the breadth and the width of the content of the game,

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
both in terms of story, in terms of mechanics,

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
it forces you to figure out how to do stuff the optimal way.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It gets you to be invested in all the characters,

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and found out all the little side stories that have been planted there.

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So like, you know, this was something that was kind of forced on us.

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Doesn't IM's breadth also force you to explore the breadth of the game?

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh!

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Well, it was just...

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Back in the day, we were kind of...

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Back in the day, you didn't really have to force players,

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
at least when we were kids at the very least,

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you didn't have to give strong incentives for people to explore all of games,

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
because you would just do that because you had five games.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Of course, you're going to play them a thousand times and figure it out.

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But in the current market, I really think it definitely pays,

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and gives your game the kind of longevity and the good long runtime

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
to give, to structure it in such a way to encourage fully exploring it.

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There's a number of times where I'll decide I'm going to just play a video game

250
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and not do anything else for a day,

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and not accomplish something by being able to focus that much.

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And I'm like, wow, this is kind of sad that attention span is so scattershot

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and tiny now because of social media and shit,

254
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
that I legitimately feel accomplished by playing a video game consistently.

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, something that was not hard.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Like 100%ing a game, or like beating a game,

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
now like to me, just turning on a game and sitting down and playing it for 10 minutes

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
feels like something I worked for.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It feels like an accomplishment.

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's like a huge library of games that I haven't touched.

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And it's weird because we're talking about nostalgia

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and how we used to be way more invested in games back in the day.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And I think so much of it is just that, like we were saying,

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
because we don't have a lot of money and you only had a few options.

265
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Because it's not even, I don't think so much that games are designed differently now.

266
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I think it's just because I have disposable income.

267
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Because I have like, right now I have 15 PS4 games,

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
50 PS3 games, and 70-something PS2 games

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and I've played like maybe 10% of each of those.

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And like, those are the games that like, they have depth.

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
They weren't designed for like, let's plays.

272
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Like most of them predated let's plays.

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But I just play them for like 10 minutes and I'm like,

274
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
oh, we're both the next one.

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Or I just don't touch them at all and they just sort of shelf them.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's impossible to not be nostalgic like just for video games as a whole as you get older

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
because you have no fucking time to play them anymore.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It feels like you have to force yourself to relax.

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And like you said, they still make games that have a lot of depth,

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that like reward a lot of investment.

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I've had the last Guardian since November.

282
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I haven't played it yet.

283
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I have Breath of the Wild.

284
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I haven't beaten it yet.

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm only like a little bit into the game.

286
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What do I do every time I turn on the fucking PS4?

287
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I just play Binding of Isaac for an hour.

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's all I can fucking do every day.

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's the same game.

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's the same fucking thing every time.

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's just running around in room shooting shit.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But it's the only fucking thing I can invest in anymore

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
because fucking putting my brain into a Zelda game for 40 hours

294
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
seems more taxing to me than playing 40 different hour-long runs of the stupid Isaac game.

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, I feel like a little bit of reason.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I hate you Binding of Isaac.

297
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I hate you Florian.

298
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You'll never be in Binding of Isaac.

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Florian really.

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's all your fault.

301
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I feel like a lot of the reason I do like a video game review show

302
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
is so that I can play games because there's a reason to do it.

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Like Let's Plays, they take a lot of time,

304
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
which is why I turn to streaming now for like,

305
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
oh yeah, I want to play an old game,

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
but I can't be bothered because I got stuff to do.

307
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And the games I'm like reviewing,

308
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
they're also games I have to play and I enjoy doing,

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
you know, recording them and playing them for stuff.

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But the streaming is like, that's like, yeah,

311
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I could sit down and play a game for a few hours

312
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and it can be fun and it won't even be feeling like I'm an idiot.

313
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And it's great.

314
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You know what this kind of reminds me of?

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's just, I know I've said it before,

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
but even something like this podcast basically exists for the reason,

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
at least to me, for forcing us to be able to talk to each other

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and do something together.

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Like that's why I like to do it in order to get this game out of it.

320
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I cannot motivate myself to do anything ever

321
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
if it is not feeding into some grand design goal

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
that will pay off in five years.

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I think that is probably the big fucking mental change

324
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that has happened with social media and stuff.

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I feel like now that nothing I do or say has any sort of legitimacy

326
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
unless it's projected onto some social network so strangers can see it,

327
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and it's really weird,

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
because I've just been doing a bunch of work for myself

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the last couple of weeks in the beginning.

330
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I was really jonesing on it,

331
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and now I just feel like desperate for validation of what I've done.

332
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's just like a disgusting degeneracy of the mind,

333
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
being conditioned by like,

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
you have to have the clicks, you have to have the likes,

335
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you have to have the views,

336
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and it's just like, I can't just do shit anymore.

337
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I think it's why I don't play video games or anything anymore,

338
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
because I have to stream it or I have to make a video about it,

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
or what's the fucking point?

340
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, for me, I don't need attention.

341
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I don't need people looking at it in the meantime.

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It just has to be feeding towards something,

343
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
which I've been using game design as the excuse.

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm like, well, I want to make a game with this, this, that, that,

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and this mechanics in it.

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But I want to make sure I've played all the important games

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
that have these mechanics in them,

348
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
so that I know I'm doing it right.

349
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So I just wrote out a giant fucking list of all the games

350
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I've been wanting to play my whole life,

351
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and I'm like, I have to play them now.

352
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So Earthbound was first on the list pretty much.

353
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So for me, I'm having a great time.

354
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I found the perfect excuse that's just an endless well

355
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
of perfectly, mentally, and emotional justification

356
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
to play all the stuff I've always wanted to play.

357
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well, that's good.

358
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But it is sort of a similar motivation to what Tom was saying.

359
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It is towards an end goal.

360
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, I think, I don't know whether all of that

361
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
is necessarily like a downward sort of thing.

362
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It used to be better when we were kids

363
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and we would just do something for no reason.

364
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I think it was where I didn't like it as much

365
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
as when I was a kid, because I felt like, even as a kid,

366
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I was just sitting around trying to come up

367
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
with some sort of grand design for my life,

368
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and I couldn't come up with anything at the time.

369
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well, yeah, I mean, what I'm saying is like nostalgia

370
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
is not necessarily inherently better than the current.

371
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I think sometimes you look at the past

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and you're sort of like rose-tinted goggles

373
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
or whatever you say.

374
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, I have no rose-tinted goggles for anything.

375
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I think everything in my life is better now

376
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
than it was when I was younger.

377
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, yeah.

378
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah, but things like this, like streaming,

379
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I actually legitimately enjoy it a lot,

380
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and I don't think it's too bad that I feel the need

381
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
to play a game on a live streaming platform

382
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
instead of by myself.

383
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's just fun.

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's like somebody's talking with me in the room,

385
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
like, yeah, I got friends over, kind of.

386
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And it's kind of a replacement for, like,

387
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
because I don't actually have friends in real life.

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, but...

389
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah, those are gay anyway.

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's...

391
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You know, it's...

392
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know.

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think things are good.

394
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
War has changed, dude. War has changed.

395
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The way that we conduct ourselves

396
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
is social media has changed the game forever,

397
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and I don't know if we'll ever go back to the way it was.

398
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean, there's a lot of...

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Nier Automata is an oddly appropriate game

400
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
to have just played, because there's all this stuff

401
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
about how, like, all the robots,

402
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and it's fucking robots doing shit,

403
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
like, they're all networked,

404
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and they all kind of relate to each other

405
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
in different ways than a human-talking,

406
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
you know, person-to-person does,

407
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and, like, you're able to...

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're able to kind of use your consciousness

409
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
through different bodies.

410
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's this whole complex thing,

411
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
but all I'm getting at is that

412
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
the way that we relate to each other

413
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
by having this electronic network of communication

414
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
as opposed to just verbal,

415
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
or, like, fucking smoke signals or whatever,

416
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
it's way different,

417
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and it's only getting more different

418
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and more different than, like, humanity was

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
at its inception,

420
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and these are real fundamental changes

421
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
to us biologically in the way that we live in this world.

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I think the way I see it is, like,

423
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
is that, like, you know,

424
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
hanging out with people in real life

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
with no fucking cameras anywhere, no recording.

426
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's still good.

427
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You know, that's the classic.

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's been around forever.

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You can still enjoy it,

430
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
but, you know,

431
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
talking to people,

432
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
having an extended Twitter rave about something

433
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
is also fun.

434
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's a new thing.

435
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You know, one does not have to permanently

436
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
kick out the other,

437
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and, you know,

438
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
sitting around playing a video game for 10 hours

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
is also a thing that you could do with your time.

440
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't walk away from any one of these activities

441
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
feeling more or less satisfied than the others.

442
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's like, if I just play the video game for 10 hours,

443
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I have this feeling in my mind of, like,

444
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
oh, God, I didn't do anything,

445
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
but play a video game for 10 hours.

446
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
But, like, if I just hang out with, like, friends all day,

447
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'll end it with the same feeling of,

448
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
wow, I didn't do anything,

449
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
but hang out with friends all day.

450
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Like, it doesn't matter.

451
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
After I hang out with friends,

452
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I feel like ending it too, my man.

453
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I know what you mean.

454
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's just, like, there's just, there's just nothing.

455
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
In my opinion, there's nothing,

456
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
there's no one thing you can do with your time

457
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
that feels like the definitively perfect thing

458
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
to do with your time.

459
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Everything you do is shutting...

460
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Everything you do is closing the door

461
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
on everything else you could be doing with your time, you know?

462
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So everything is a huge trade-off.

463
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Everything lacks something.

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So just don't worry about it.

465
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's my philosophy.

466
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I've, uh...

467
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hmm.

468
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I've heard the...

469
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't know if I agree with that,

470
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
but I can respect it.

471
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hmm?

472
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Because, like, I don't know.

473
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I guess in my opinion,

474
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I guess at the top of that up now.

475
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's the end of the PCP podcast.

476
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's over.

477
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
At last.

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I don't know if I agree with that,

479
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
but I can respect it.

480
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No more shows.

481
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
No more episodes.

482
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
All right.

483
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We're done.

484
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, I mean, I guess, I guess because me,

485
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I just, like, my...

486
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I just...

487
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Working is always, like, the number one thing,

488
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and if I'm not working on something,

489
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
like, if I'm not working on, like, an animation

490
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
or a drawing or a writing or something like that,

491
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
something productive,

492
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
like, there's always this creeping feeling in the back of my mind

493
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
that, like, you should be doing that.

494
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So I'll play video...

495
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Like, I used to play video games for hours and hours

496
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and hours and hours.

497
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Like, I wouldn't do homework in high school.

498
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I would, like, lie and say,

499
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I have no homework.

500
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Like, for, like, two months now.

501
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I just play video games,

502
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
like, until I have to go to bed.

503
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh, well...

504
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh, yeah.

505
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Don't misinterpret.

506
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
There are lots and lots of things

507
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I don't feel very happy doing.

508
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I basically listed off three of the only ones.

509
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's see.

510
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

511
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Saying really interesting stuff on Twitter,

512
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
like, making a really interesting narrative

513
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
on social media that will always be great

514
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
to go back to.

515
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I guess on Twitter,

516
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
it's hard to go back to it.

517
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What the fuck ever.

518
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Playing with good friends

519
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
who are interesting to talk to.

520
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Playing an actually good video game

521
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
that isn't, like, just, you know,

522
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
fucking one of those fucking, like,

523
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
roguelike games.

524
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Those fucking meme games, dude.

525
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Those fucking meme games.

526
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, one of those roguelike games, like,

527
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I was getting kind of depressed

528
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
playing Nuclear Throne too much back in the day.

529
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I was like, okay, I need to cut this out.

530
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's the same shit every time, you know.

531
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And also working on a project.

532
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Nuclear Throne, is that called

533
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Donald Trump simulator?

534
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, ho, ho.

535
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, ho.

536
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, shit.

537
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, shit.

538
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh, man, I am so nostalgic

539
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
for Donald Trump jokes.

540
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Remember back in the day

541
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
when we used to,

542
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
when everyone used to make fun

543
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
of Donald Trump.

544
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What happened to that?

545
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Bring it back, I say.

546
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Oh, yeah, bring it back, please.

547
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We need more.

548
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Not enough making fun of Donald Trump

549
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
on the internet.

550
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You know, ever since I'm with her one,

551
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
ever since Pokémon Go to the polls won,

552
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
it's been, you know, just boring.

553
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You know, we've just been Pokémon

554
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
going to the polls every day since,

555
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,560
And no one's been taking time to stop smell the roses and make fun of Donald Trump

556
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,020
Did you guys know that his skin is orange like Cheeto dust?

557
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,720
What what tell me more?

558
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,320
Also, I have it on I don't believe you. I have it on good authority

559
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,680
His hands

560
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,920
Well are small big oh

561
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Oh

562
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,840
Wait, but how does this affect his dick size? What's the relationship here? I mean well

563
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,240
That's the real heart of the matter

564
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,480
I think I think the issue is that his hands are smaller than like a regular man's hands should be so maybe also

565
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,040
His penis is smaller than a regular man's penis should be which see that's why he's not my president

566
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,920
That's why I should have my election. That's why we all Pokemon went to the polls. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm feels good

567
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,480
It feels good to be a an active member of the

568
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,880
Socialist liberal agenda trying to you know anarchist for life. It's uh, it feels good

569
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
I don't know how true this is

570
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,120
I'd like you all to comment on whether you think it's true, but I've heard that

571
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:01,480
Millennials and 90 kid 90s kids or whatever they feel more nostalgic for their youth than previous generations

572
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,200
Because I've got a reason for that because the okay, go ahead things have like

573
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,360
technology and stuff has just

574
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:18,600
Accelerated during that time to the point where you you grow up playing with toys and then you're an adult and you've gone through

575
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,480
So many consoles and video games and things and now it's just so weird like

576
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,720
We're like mm-hmm because like our generation like

577
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,720
Guys my age like 25 to 30 or whatever like we are the very last

578
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,640
Generation that will ever have existed without the internet

579
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,640
Yeah, and I can remember a time in my life when like the internet entered my life and changed everything forever

580
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,720
And I remember what it was like before that line wire Dave line wire

581
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,960
That's why I feel like I feel this like weird like disconnect with people who are even like like four or five years younger than me

582
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:05,040
Because they they grew up they have this there's this culture and this language of like everything's fucking ironic

583
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,560
Everyone is like taking pride in being an autistic or like a shitty person and it's just a tag irony is a purely destructive force

584
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,480
It's it's weird like I

585
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:21,360
Like the this feeling that like that like people get for like generations 20 years their junior of like all these these young kids

586
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,280
Nowadays, they don't know shit. They're all fucking weird and psychotic

587
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,880
I feel that way about people five years younger than me because there's like a huge fucking divide

588
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,560
In and it's like a whole new way of thinking. Oh god. I just hate them. I hate young people

589
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,300
That's it. I'm with you and I agree with you on all that the technological

590
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,280
The rapid technological advancement, I mean you had definitely has created a a cultural tag the young all sex and nothing else

591
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:58,920
There is the the real phenomenon that the Millennials are the first generation in like I possibly ever

592
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,340
I think that actually has a worse economic

593
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,340
Foothold than the generation that came before them. We're over the tipping point with our generation

594
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,080
Well, that was hopefully it doesn't stay that way, but that's where it is

595
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,800
That was a point that I made a while ago

596
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,120
I don't remember where but I was just like I wonder if the reason the Millennials are so nostalgic for the 90s and shit

597
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,560
It's because we're the first generation that has nothing really to look forward to it's because when we were kids

598
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,440
We didn't have to worry about you know all kinds of bull. I mean that was I'm like the case for people who were born in the 30s

599
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:35,360
Like hold on. There was that whole 10-year period where the economy was total shit. So I'm sure it was the same thing for that

600
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
I don't know what that is

601
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
Well

602
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,240
Say to say it's the only time it's like an exaggeration

603
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,560
I think we're we're the first generation to really have some perspective on how doomed we are as a species because we're the first

604
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,360
Generation to like have the knowledge available to us that like in 20 years the fucking one world

605
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,400
Government is going to be raising all of our children the internet. Yeah, it's something

606
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,560
I think that is really fucking with our generation because it's fucking with me and I hate it because it's something that I never

607
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,080
Stressed to it when I was a little kid and it was it only started when the internet happened is this really like

608
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,720
broad world-wide perspective of how mediocre I am

609
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,920
Hmm because because like like back in the day before the internet you could do stuff

610
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,560
Like you know like when you sat down and play Pokemon with your friends or whatever

611
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,360
You're like, oh man

612
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,760
I'm like one of the best people at Pokemon or it's like I think there's 10 people I knew who played Pokemon now like I want to

613
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,440
Like make videos and do drawings and shit

614
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,880
I have access to the internet and I can see people in like fucking Taiwan who are like 10 years old who are gonna be better than

615
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,360
I'll ever be in my entire life and it's completely changed this perspective of like how good you are at things

616
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,160
What the like the bell curve of talent is and also like it set expectations

617
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:59,000
That like the the exceptions to the rule have risen to the top in this interconnected world and become the new norm

618
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,760
So it feels like that's the standard. I feel like I feel like some of that a lot of that came through from TV

619
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Anyway, like TV and magazines

620
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:19,160
Cuz like with TV like the celebrities were at a distance, but now like Pewdiepie is just a dude in his fucking room

621
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:26,320
Well, like I get that I get that like the um, you know that that there's like a worldwide perspective of how mediocre you are

622
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,600
Like you said, I don't think you're mediocre by the way, but that's what you said

623
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:37,040
Um, I like I feel the opposite like for me the problem is that I have this worldwide perspective on how mediocre the world is and how

624
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
I'm just

625
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,560
Everyone is psychotic and like everyone is evil

626
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,360
It's it's that's that's my nightmare and it's awakened like I wake up to every morning

627
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,080
It's kind of similar to I was just having an existential crisis about this other day

628
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,080
And I mean I always know this on an intellectual level

629
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,880
But it really hit me as I was again playing near and which deals a lot with like the role of humanity and the end of civilization

630
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,280
All that shit like no matter what I do in my life

631
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,040
None of it will matter at all because even if humanity lives a billion years the universe will end and nothing will

632
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,280
Absolutely no traces will be left no matter what I do

633
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,600
I'm I'm fucking banking on the idea that we're gonna have like a billion years. We can hop dimensions. We can hop dimensions

634
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,640
Theoretically, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm that's what I'm banking on is that I mean like

635
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:35,320
Okay, our civilization was able to figure out how to break our gravity and then land on our moon within like 12,000 years of civilization

636
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,360
And only like a hundred thousand years of our species with a billion years

637
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,760
We can figure out dimensions. No biggie. You know, it's not fucking you know

638
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,440
I'll give it to you that my my more pressing concern is that will destroy ourselves. That is my main concern

639
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,960
Honestly when it comes to stuff like that

640
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,880
I think of what the human race will be that the language will have morphed if I were to travel to the future

641
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,040
English would be like no longer English

642
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
People would have you know change, you know

643
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,160
Strange or if they live on other planets, they'll be really yeah stuff if there's lower gravity or whatever

644
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,400
And it'll be it'll be so alien to me that it may as well not even be the human race and at that point

645
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,840
I don't really care, you know, that was another thing I was thinking about where I I have this thing where I really care about

646
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,960
Humanity survival and I like I root for humanity to go out and colonize space and then I just thought to myself

647
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,000
Why am I really so dedicated to team humanity?

648
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,960
Why is it not okay for like a superior alien race to just yeah, like that's my go with it

649
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,120
You know, that's my hope is that somewhere out there?

650
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,480
There's a there's a better race than us because if we're the best the universe has to offer the universe is fucked

651
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah, I want to I want to be on Picard's team where Picard's like

652
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,720
Humanity has so much potential we can evolve so we can we can you know learn from our mistakes

653
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,520
We can improve ourselves and I'm just like I'm out looking here at humanity day after day and I'm just not seeing it

654
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,480
It's pretty obvious that Hobbits were better than

655
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,120
Regression when I look at humanity, I think people are getting worse as time goes on

656
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,720
We could just be a slump. It could just be a slump. Yeah, I mean you never know

657
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,760
Well, I guess it's interesting that we're talking about this whole like humanity thing because that's never been something like I can I can

658
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:23,120
Understand your enthusiasm and your investment on like a logical level, but I just don't care like I guess I'm just too much of an

659
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,880
Individualist where I'm just like I don't like I want of course

660
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,640
I think it's cool like conceptually we have humanity to succeed and do all this crazy shit and become Starfleet

661
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,800
But like I'm not invested in that struggle because I'm gonna be dead in like 30 to 40 years

662
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,640
That's and it doesn't have anything to do with me like even if we succeed in a billion years

663
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,440
I'm not gonna be here to even comprehend it like you know

664
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,840
I'm with you on all that but to make things even more depressing

665
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,920
What is even the point of Starfleet to just spread humanity like a fucking cancer over the other planets and galaxies?

666
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:59,040
Like what's the point? What are we serving we really have a separate podcast for about futurism and the idea of what should really do?

667
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,880
We should I actually was gonna suggest this a couple days ago, and then I fell asleep interesting

668
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,240
Cuz I actually suggested it in a let's play that me digi and Ben and monkey Jones recorded last night

669
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
I actually

670
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,800
Well, let's not out yet is it? Oh, well, we're totally off topic right now

671
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,400
The only thing I can really say about nostalgia is basically just to bloat that like I've secured

672
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,360
I've been privileged enough both like emotionally and financially that like I've just succeeded at life

673
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,200
And like everything is better for me now

674
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,520
So like basically the only way I could imagine just talking about this is just for someone to name something that

675
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,960
So you should hypothetically be nostalgic for from the past that I'm totally not and just go down the list dude

676
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,840
What about what about back in school when you drew the little s

677
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Anything

678
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,920
The way I see nostalgia is that I mean I

679
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:01,320
Especially hate it whenever anyone says it or implies. Oh my god. You didn't do or know this thing. You didn't have a childhood

680
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,720
That's yeah, who didn't have a childhood. He didn't make the s's

681
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:13,160
You're doing a funny old joke here, but I really hate that I really really hate that anybody who in who pushes their

682
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,920
Does anybody mean that seriously this and has anybody ever met that legitimately

683
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,600
They need to be punched in the face. No, no, no people people all were all the time. I mean, who does it?

684
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,440
Well, I mean do people who were born in labor wrong generation

685
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,040
I'm not I'm not I'm not even denying that you're I'm not even saying you're wrong

686
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,840
I've just never encountered anyone seriously meaning that

687
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,800
No, you mean but like I've gotten over it since then so yeah another thing is better about my life now is not caring about things

688
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,480
I was going somewhere but I figure I'll just come up with the other thing I was gonna say is that right now

689
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
I'm on my laptop and

690
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,640
That's because I'm away with my family at a like a weekend sort of holiday thing in the countryside

691
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,760
And it's really nice and it's stuff and it's just reminding me of like family holidays

692
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,960
Because we haven't been on a lot of those mom and dad have been going on holidays by themselves

693
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,560
For the past few years because like I don't know it's just sort of like it's weird

694
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,520
Just keep going on family holidays every year, and but now we're doing it again. It's like yeah

695
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,320
I'm not nostalgic for family holidays the last couple ones of my family had were like really boring and hard

696
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,560
That's like I just want to I just want to work on my dang videos. Yeah

697
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,440
It's not just the family holidays thing

698
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,600
But it's just like reminding me of all the stuff that you don't do or I did before like technology

699
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,840
And I'm thinking of like yeah, I used to really like

700
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:47,160
Stuff and places and things and and frogs and castles and and wind and trees and I like all that that's good

701
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,000
Fresh air is nice. Yeah, I sure wish I had more of it

702
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,040
one thing that I'm I don't know if I'm just I guess it's nostalgic but

703
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,440
When I you know I was living in Massachusetts my whole life my dad at a boat and we'd go out in it

704
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,840
And I never really like enjoyed going out in it because it took like all day and I would actually you know

705
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,560
I never looked forward to it, but once I was out there usually had a great time

706
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,600
But I would I used to really really enjoy going down to the marina where his boat was and just standing there feeling the sea breeze

707
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,320
And the first thing I noticed when I moved out to the Midwest and I'm in Ohio is

708
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:27,160
How much I fucking missed the ocean and just standing on the shore feeling the smelling the salt feeling the breeze feeling the fucking sun

709
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,880
That's where I want to be. I want to be there all the time

710
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,600
I think it's important to remember that the real world is pretty good if you're just yes. Oh, yeah, I love the real world, too

711
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,680
Yeah, fucking I I'd be going on walks all I'm gonna go on walks all the dang time as soon as my ankles finish healing

712
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
That's a good. That's a good thing

713
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
if I could live on like a

714
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
What's the word like a beach house

715
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,160
Right next to the fucking ocean where I could go swimming if I want and be able to come inside go into a little studio and like record

716
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Podcasts and videos and edit shit. Oh

717
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,960
That'd be and then at night I could leave the windows open feel the cool ocean breeze and smell the sea

718
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,280
Oh, that would be the perfect life. That's what I want for me one day and have a big fat slut in my bed

719
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,160
Big just a real hambeast a big monster. Yeah, just smother me to death every night. That's what I want. That's what I want

720
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,320
That's my dream beautiful

721
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,880
And I guess you'd call it nostalgic. Yeah, that's like a nostalgic fantasy

722
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,040
Fago and a car full of fat chicks. That's the American dream

723
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,520
That's right

724
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,360
It's funny you mentioned the ocean because I did something rather similar like remembering how much I liked the ocean cuz um

725
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,240
I you meet me my family used to go to the beach all the time because we're in Massachusetts as well

726
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,720
So we go to go to the cave

727
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,520
We go to like Brockport like beach and stuff like that because I was really close by and go to horse neck

728
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,760
You ever go to horse neck beach? I never went to horse neck beach. Okay, just one. I missed out on that one

729
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
but um back when I was a kid

730
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,200
The more I got into video games the less I wanted to go to the beach because like video games beach didn't mix

731
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,760
So I was like fuck that I just want to play video games

732
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,760
And I remember like as I got older I really disliked the beach

733
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,760
but then my friend came over and

734
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,960
She lives in Missouri, so she'd never seen the beach ever in her life

735
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,040
This was like last like like last year never never gone to the beach and she's like I want to go see the beach

736
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,880
I might have fucking beaches gay who cares, but I guess you've never been there

737
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:28,640
So I guess we should probably go and we go and she just like freaks out and like holy shit and just like and like and like

738
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,840
It's it's it's cold. It's like it's in the winter. It's water's freezing

739
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,720
She's still like fucking runs into the water and just like

740
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,360
Experiences it. I'm just standing there and like it's the first time I've been on the beach and probably like seven or eight years

741
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,240
And like like the same kind of things like the smell of the salt and like just being there and feeling the breeze like it triggered like this like

742
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,960
Like yeah, you just look down you just look down there and you just think to self. What a fag

743
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Exactly

744
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,400
It was you kind of remember what you liked and to see someone else kind of like

745
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,960
Experiencing the joy you used to have there was really really interesting. That's anything. I don't know. I appreciate it all over again

746
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,680
That's really interesting because I'm also from Missouri

747
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,400
And I also saw the beach for the first time like six months ago when I moved in with Digi and I went there and I was like, yep

748
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,100
I don't know why I'm able to be such an asshole being

749
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,120
Contrarian about every single thing people are talking about today. It's just for some reason

750
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,720
Deville you've created life and turn us all into wrestling. Well, that's all you're the mortal

751
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,880
That's where the arch nemesis of the PCB are villain from within. Yeah, you know, it's fine. We expect it

752
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,240
It's I mean, I was there when you first discovered sand and that was quite weird

753
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,200
Yeah, to see someone discover sand like big amounts of sand on under your feet

754
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,120
That was a sand box and it was like a different kind of sand. I was like, oh different texture

755
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:52,400
Yeah, I was pretty interested in the sand the beach part, which I guess I guess a beach is half sand half ocean

756
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
So I guess I was half interested in the ocean now

757
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,120
It's cool

758
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,600
I like when you go out on to like a playground and

759
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,360
And there's like the tarmac and there's like little girls there and they're like not being watched by their parents

760
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
And you can just like

761
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,200
Go to the playground and you sit and it's like a summer day and the playground's been all like heated up

762
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,240
That's all right guys secretary just walked in. She's being a goddamn bother

763
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,760
Well, shut up secretary. I'm telling a story

764
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,280
I'm telling a story about how I like it when you go sit on a tarmac and you got your hands and you put it on the ground

765
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,680
Yeah, that's hot, but then it's okay after a while. It's like, yeah, I know the exact feeling

766
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,480
And it's like there's no one around because it's sort of the end of the day

767
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,360
And then parents are taking their kids and you're like still there

768
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,000
Because you know, you're a little bit older and you're allowed to stay out a little longer

769
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,840
And it's like, yeah, I'm I really enjoy the playground and now I can't go there anymore because it's gay and I'm a pedophile I guess

770
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,920
So this meme of of raping children is bad go away

771
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,920
When will that me man, you know, I'm ready for it to swing the pendulum to swing the other way for a while

772
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Sex with the child's

773
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Whoa

774
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,760
Like yeah, that's right. That's you you got some

775
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:29,240
Every every day I run the risk a little bit more of them discovering all these things and me getting

776
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,480
I'm getting a little bit of heat for it, but not so far so good

777
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,560
So feels feels good and you know what I kind of want it so that I'll be fired and be forced to be a YouTube's man

778
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
So, you know kind of a

779
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
Playgrounds did anybody like

780
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,600
Using the monkey bar that said no one tell them no one tell them

781
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,280
Did anybody use the monkey bars? I was like a monkey bars champion. I can yeah, I was fucking outlawed those shits

782
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
I don't know in America

783
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,520
Because you know, it's it's lobbyists with their conflicting goals

784
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,400
It's like you got the you got the bureaucrats office and waiting to meet in

785
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
Damn big

786
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,120
There's the there's the very concerned mother gonna talk about obesity with children

787
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,720
But then there's a very concerned mother talking about the children who get hurt whenever they go out and be active and burn calories

788
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,480
And I guess just last decade the fucking burn calories getting hurt mom was just more upset than the other one

789
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
So that's how things yeah

790
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:35,080
What about right when you when you're a little kid and you fall over and you scrape your knee and it's like ow and there's blood and

791
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,120
Then you come home, and then it's like a day later or half a day later. There's like a scab. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah picking that that's scab

792
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,000
That's a nostalgic. I don't get scabs anymore. You know what you're powerful

793
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You were talking about being nostalgic for like monkey bars and stuff, you know that reminded me

794
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,080
When I was a kid in elementary school, we used to have monkey bars

795
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
Monkey bars

796
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,520
That guy's weaseled his way into my fucking brain

797
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,240
He's changed my perception of monkeys forever

798
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,720
But uh, you know we used to have monkey bars

799
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,920
We used to have like a real playground at a certain point like they renovated the playground and like they tore everything down

800
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,760
And like made new stuff and the new stuff was like

801
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,960
It was like all wooden it was like there was like a big like monster made out of tires

802
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,560
And there was like you know everything was like made out of like tires and rubber and wood and stuff and at the time

803
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,040
You were like oh wow this new playground is even cooler, but looking back on it. That was just garbage

804
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,600
They just built the playground out of old tires and shit. Oh, yeah, my whole life has been we were playing on garbage

805
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,600
You know what I'm I am

806
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,920
Nostalgic for actual good playgrounds

807
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,000
I will say because that is something that has definitely declined in my lifetime like because of safety concerns

808
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,920
Mm-hmm all playgrounds. They get renovated and become boring and shitty like gay grounds

809
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Okay, you know what the problem is here. The problem is people are our two hyper

810
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:05,160
Individualized they're not folks enough on community and I mean this sincerely cuz everything go in a communists back again

811
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,120
One mom sees her child a trip and get a splinter on the wooden playground

812
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,920
She decides this is this needs to stop this can never happen to her child or you know

813
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,600
I get maybe any other child ever again

814
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,120
So they tear that motherfucker down and they build like a stainless steel

815
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,480
Monstrosity in its place

816
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,000
Vaccine and you know what it's amazing that how like one out of every

817
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,640
100,000 kids will die from a vaccine and that mom is super good remember vaccines guys. That was great

818
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,200
I miss all right. I love autism. I'm all about autism

819
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,400
But anyway Jesse, what are you saying? That sounds like the opposite of what you're saying is it sounds like if you're saying

820
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,100
No one else can have the playground because they might get hurt like Mike did that sounds like putting the

821
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,320
community before individual rights

822
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,600
Well, it's like okay. The everyone loves the playground is what is the is the fictional thing?

823
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:05,420
I'm constructing my brain everyone loves this playground one child gets hurt in a way that any child could get hurt at any time

824
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,680
And they decide that the playground is like a threat and should be

825
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,600
Personal responsibility just like I didn't take good enough care of my kid

826
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:22,360
So I'm gonna blame it on the state and their shitty playground or people need to accept if my child fucking

827
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:29,720
Accidentally hung himself by his fucking shoelaces on the playground. That does not necessarily mean the playground is dangerous

828
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,760
Humanities need to find a someone to blame in every situation

829
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,600
Someone needs to take the fall when my child accidentally strangled himself when my way child accidentally

830
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,480
Was masturbating and choking himself and he died that's on the monkey

831
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,100
Accidentally choked himself masturbating on the monkey bars and was reborn as

832
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,680
And that's the canon origin

833
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,080
See but that's what I'm talking about like

834
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:12,680
People need to people need to see that like okay just because this thing happened doesn't mean even if it was legitimately the things

835
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,800
Faults if it does more good than bad. It's still worth having even if there is a threat

836
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,400
Just I don't know make people aware of it. I don't know this this always drives me crazy people think like that

837
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:29,520
Something similar to playgrounds is a big old play places with with the climbing frames that you just yeah

838
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,800
They're still around I'm sure but they they seem to be

839
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,800
they aren't they're like they were like a

840
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,480
supposedly like a

841
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,160
Not a biohazard, but it's like they were they weren't sanitary so they got rid of them. Yeah, well all of them

842
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,240
Pretty much at least in America. They're pretty mean. I'm talking about like play places for McDonald's

843
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,740
Yeah, you can't go to like

844
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:58,680
Well, I've never been to a McDonald's. I had one of those but oh yeah into a couple places that were specifically

845
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,520
Like like like a warehouse where you could just set your kid loose. Yeah, like um well play places

846
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,360
I know they don't build any more of those but like here well in the Midwest where I used to be

847
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,760
I still saw plenty of those. They just never tore them down, right?

848
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah, I think there's one particular the one that used to be my hometown where they did tear it down

849
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,640
And they replaced it with this thing

850
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,120
It was like that was like

851
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:26,760
Still was kind of a play place in that it was literally just one tunnel that led to one slide and that was so and that was it

852
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:32,120
I was so fucking pissed and most of it most of it most of it was video games

853
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,880
And I'm like yep. This is this is what's wrong with the world, you know, this is

854
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,080
This is what's wrong with you. This is what's wrong with talking about okay

855
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,240
Finish your fun. This is what's wrong with fucking parental guidance where it's like everyone's like man

856
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,560
Why are all the Millennials us sitting around in their houses?

857
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:51,120
I mean, maybe it's because Millennials were told if you fucking go out of the house where we can't see you you will

858
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,080
Trip and fall and break your nose and then get abducted and molested

859
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:01,480
And so all you can do is is play in this like three by three, you know back there are there are dramatically less

860
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,920
Crimes committed in America including like kidnappings and you know pedophilia charges now

861
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,240
Then there were in like the 50s and yet now we have far more regulation than ever on all this shit

862
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,880
So like what what what the fuck? Oh, I think it might have been

863
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,160
I mean, I think the regulation might have helped a bit because since there were no key there were less kids out

864
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,240
Right exactly like maybe it was just died out. They just walked around until I mean

865
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:34,680
I advocate that we need to sacrifice some children to the pedophiles in order to save them in order to avoid large pedophiles

866
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,680
You know

867
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,000
Pedophile dance like like you've tied the pedophiles

868
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:47,480
Great pedophiles we sacrifice days to you the giant pedophile king comes out of the mountains

869
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,800
Yeah, I think video games are good enough. I can I can be in my room all the time

870
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,640
I don't fucking do it speaking of fucking nostalgia

871
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,160
I just had a had an acid flashback to in a McDonald's play place

872
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,040
There was this like I can't really remember what it was, but there was like this weird

873
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,080
Game slash like animated cartoon thing that played barbaran by the fucking beach boys

874
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,320
And there was like a story of like a guy trying to like woo this nurse girl

875
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,080
I think and he couldn't get her

876
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,920
But then he was about to die because he was doing some stunt to impress her and then she saved him

877
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,280
Then they were like happily ever after in love. Oh my god

878
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,480
That's are you sure that was it's been it's been in my brain for like 20 years

879
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,520
It was a it was like part of some interactive McDonald's play place thing, man

880
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,760
I just trip. I just I'm nostalgia for recess recess was fucking cool

881
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,800
ban it

882
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:43,880
It's it's it's ableist recess is ableist the the kids who are in wheelchairs can't play dodgeball

883
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,200
so I have I have a lot of nostalgia for

884
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,960
Play we called it play time

885
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,240
Because we go out and play and there's like

886
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,440
There was a whole game. I don't know. I don't know whether

887
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:01,760
There's probably not a game that was like anyone ever plays, but we had like and we had like a

888
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,240
Lines on on the on the playground for like football and basketball or whatever

889
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:14,640
Yeah, and sometimes there would be like a couple squares and we put we would play this game called to square with like up to four players

890
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:20,200
Where you get a ball and somebody just spikes it or like or hits it like as if it was

891
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,720
Volleyball, but not like an actual volleyball hit

892
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:28,400
They just hit it however they like and the other person just has to get the ball onto the other square and have it bounce once

893
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,640
It's like a combination tennis, but without a net and we call that we called that four square

894
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,560
Yeah, that's the exact same game, and I was the fucking champion. I'll fight anyone in four square

895
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,800
Well, yeah, we had four squares. It was divided to four instead of two

896
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,800
I guess I will fight anyone at a four square at any time. I'm a fucking planet and

897
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,960
When we went I wasn't at school because not you know people weren't always playing it

898
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,720
I wasn't really the sort of person to grab a ball and get people around to play to square

899
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,880
So I would just get like a ball with my brother at home

900
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,360
Just randomly and we would go on to the driveway and we would play there

901
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,240
And it would that would be I would just do that for hours

902
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,520
I'll that would be the the funnest thing ever just to play to square on the driveway with a ball

903
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,440
Fuck video games over my video games. I don't even like them. They're not even cool. What do we talk about?

904
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,400
You know, okay, I'm with it

905
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,560
We talked all about a bunch of nostalgia shit, but let me let me ask you guys

906
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,080
I wanted to this we've touched on this a few times already

907
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,480
But like so and it gives video was kind of about this so is nostalgia

908
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:36,680
Actually a good justified thing and or is it just a shitty thing that as an adult you have

909
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:45,160
Is there any value I haven't answered this weird demonization of nostalgia is just like a weird contrarian cynical internet culture thing

910
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,160
And I think it needs to die. I

911
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,880
Think I say in my video that people generally think nostalgia goggles are

912
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,720
Like something to be ashamed of or avoided and it's like who cares. It's it's something you like it makes you happy

913
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,880
So what are the well as long as your arguments are sound? Yeah, that's for me

914
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,400
Nostalgia that nostalgia that I feel for specific video games is

915
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,720
Like lately like can be a reason to go back and play the video game

916
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,440
But nostalgia like is like a fuel source that does get burnt out by going back to the game, right?

917
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:22,400
Like I've I've gone black back and played Superstar saga out of nostalgia like probably two or three

918
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,400
Well a bunch of times and eventually it's like I've played the game so many times, you know, it's a linear RPG

919
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,400
It's a single-player RPG. There's not that much replay value 13 times

920
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,320
Is enough time just that's what people I think people accuse you of like nostalgia goggles when they're trying to like

921
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,240
Shit on something you like or like, you know, they say you just think it's good because of nostalgia

922
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:48,120
But that's not true like like Final Fantasy 7 for example, they'll be like, oh that game is not even good

923
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:53,720
You like it because you're nostalgic for like no, I'm not I play it like every year

924
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:58,520
I've played it like a billion times. Maybe the first time I went back and played it there was nostalgia

925
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,920
I have no fucking nostalgia for that game anymore whatsoever. It's just a good game that I like

926
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,720
Yeah, yeah

927
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
There are definitely things

928
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,520
That are not good that I have nostalgia for and that makes me think that they're good

929
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,960
But as an adult as an adult a

930
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:21,560
I try to figure out whether it's nostalgia or not and if it is nostalgia

931
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,840
I will still let myself enjoy it, but I won't tell anybody that it's good

932
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,960
I will just tell them that I'm nostalgic for it and that will sort of make sure that they don't

933
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:35,660
Hate it like but sex, you know, you always look back on but sex and you have this nostalgia for it like yeah

934
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:39,960
Yeah, totally cool. I want to do that again. They do it again, and you're like, oh wait. Yeah

935
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,560
Oh, yeah, this is a butthole where poop comes out of this isn't good at all. Why do I have nostalgia for this?

936
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,760
You always go back to the but

937
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,100
95 shit that I'm nostalgic for and if I see it again

938
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,040
I'm gonna be like whoa

939
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:01,240
I remember that and then like in the course of like 20 seconds the amount that I care because of the nostalgia is gonna wear

940
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,760
Off into nothing. It's like it's you know, it's it doesn't last that long the nostalgia trip

941
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,520
Is there anything wrong with that? No, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm just saying that's how it is for me and

942
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:17,080
There's a very simple test. I think I feel like there are some people who like just because their lives went to shit

943
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:24,320
Like they really depend on the nostalgic memories to get by like I feel like people like movie Bob kind of come off that way to me

944
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:30,320
Sometimes we're like he's just so endlessly obsessed with Super Mario Bros. 3 and I'm like, you know

945
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,360
There's not that much of Super Mario Bros 3, but it's just because you know, I mean he's fat

946
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,720
So he needs this, you know, that's true. He is very happiness. He came. I'm sure he has

947
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:45,400
Yeah, exactly. I feel like I feel like it's because there are definitely certain people out there who have like like too much

948
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:52,880
Fixation or like like like like um people liked the nostalgia critic who Doug Walker started that series because he was 25 and

949
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,880
Going through a nostalgic phase. That's what he said

950
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,240
But it ended up becoming a this arch platform that he then made into his job

951
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:07,280
And so he's had to continue like like like dwelling on that nostalgic phase for like ten fucking years now

952
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:14,280
And so I think when people see that they sort of get this perception that there are these people who just drown in nostalgia endlessly

953
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,040
And I think it's probably the case for some people

954
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,200
But it's mostly just because it makes for a good YouTube show in the mid in the late 2000s

955
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,280
And so they get this they get this perception that like oh, you know when they see Jesse

956
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,480
They're like, oh, he's still talking about Final Fantasy 7. It's because he's just like that, you know

957
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,360
I think that's where the misconception comes from for some people

958
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:39,680
If you can defend I mean whatever point you make ever if you ever if you're accused of fucking nostalgia

959
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:45,320
Just like if you can defend your point intelligently, that's it there. There is there's no case

960
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:53,240
Like what nostalgia just means like you remember something fondly from your childhood like even if it's fucking shit

961
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,880
Like like I watched and loved as a kid the dub of Monster Rancher and I watch it now

962
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,120
And it's fucking the worst shit of all time. Yeah, but you know what?

963
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,680
I still remember that fondly because I like that is

964
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,520
Something there's you don't need like to put together some like

965
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,840
So here in like five-page essay arguing why you like it

966
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,760
I think that if someone did you bro if someone is saying that what you like is not good

967
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,920
Then the burden of proof is on them

968
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,880
If you're saying that something is bad and people shouldn't like it then you're the one who should have to fucking state your case

969
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,080
Intelligently and if you can't then fuck you get the fuck out of here

970
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,400
My hope

971
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:39,040
YouTube channel is based on the idea that I want to figure out whether my nostalgia is there is valid or not

972
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,360
Because I want to figure out whether the game is good despite the fact that I really like it

973
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:50,640
That sounds like my all-time favorite youtuber cat Icarus. It's time to find out which games need to be salvaged or slaughtered

974
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,880
He's got the two guns

975
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,960
He's got he's got the salvage gun and he's got the slaughtered gun. You ever see that? Oh god

976
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,120
My final fantasy 7 I think is Frogger

977
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:12,520
He's back the the Frogger remake from the late 90s that I played the shit out of as a kid and like the only real difference is that as an

978
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,680
Adult I'm I can understand why it's so good like it really is um, but not good

979
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,520
It's not good in the way that most people would agree with it just so happens to like do almost everything

980
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,600
I want a video game to be I have a that reminds me of a

981
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,360
of a

982
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,800
Story with a point about nostalgia or something probably it's probably vaguely related to this topic

983
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,920
I don't I don't fucking know but I don't know maybe I've even told the story before I don't fucking know

984
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:45,080
But when I was a kid it was like like Easter or like 1998 or some shit Easter or 1998 one or the other it couldn't have been

985
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,520
Those two things contradict each other

986
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:54,120
But you know, I really wanted my mom was gonna get me like a present

987
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:00,280
And I really wanted the legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time for the n64. That was the the hot new

988
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,480
Game the the hot new mobile app as we call games today for all you

989
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,200
Yep, so I really wanted Ocarina of Time and I'm like, okay

990
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,360
Give me can you please give me this game mom and she she comes back from the store and she goes

991
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,760
Well, I thought at the store instead of getting you just one sixty dollar game

992
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,920
Oh, I'll get you. Oh, no two thirty dollar games

993
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,420
So it's even better

994
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,140
It's two games and your mom is part of the reason that those red box

995
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:40,760
Those red box ripoff movies like Atlantic Rim exists, right? And and uh, well like what an indictment

996
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:52,000
The story yet the two games that she got me instead of Ocarina of Time

997
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,560
Get out of my drawers. What are you doing?

998
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:01,840
The secretary get around here. She's going through my pajamas. She's putting on my clothes

999
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,240
She's fucking digging through my fucking my stuff. She's stealing my toys and my games

1000
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:13,120
She's playing with my money toaster on the table. She's pocketing all my fucking loose dollar bills. What are you doing?

1001
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
No

1002
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,840
Gasol women

1003
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,240
Now she's she's got her pants off now, I don't know what she wants

1004
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,920
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm offended. This is

1005
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,360
I'm still telling the story, but I'm looking at a pussy right now and I want to touch it

1006
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,360
I'm still telling the story. Nobody interrupt me

1007
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,360
Okay, go

1008
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,840
Get out of my PJs

1009
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
Oh

1010
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,920
Man we're off the rails now

1011
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,680
They all have holes in the crotch if you want to wear my pants you have to deal with

1012
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,920
You're not gonna find a pair in there. That's magically intact

1013
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,320
It would take it would take magic to find pants, which don't have a hole in the crotch

1014
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,000
It would take you know what I'm packing. You know the power

1015
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,840
It does the pants

1016
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:32,200
I'm gonna touch your bus if you if you don't stop getting naked. He's just putting out all my pants

1017
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,360
None of my pants are safe. He's just switching between pairs of pajamas

1018
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,600
We're never gonna know

1019
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,000
I really want to know these two games

1020
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,840
Was it shinobi 2 and 3

1021
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,480
Was it earthworm Jim

1022
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,640
Okay, now she's in my bed. Hopefully she's fucking satisfied for now. She's dead

1023
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:04,160
Even though a woman has never been satisfied when in your bed previously, but maybe this would be the exception

1024
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,800
Nate stop projecting

1025
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
Never okay

1026
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:22,040
So so she gets me these two games I'm still tongue story. This was all part of the story everything that

1027
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,000
That part happens every time I tell the story

1028
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,040
Important chapter in the tail

1029
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,480
There's like a flash forward to like when I'm 27 and there's a secretary in my room

1030
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,920
It's a narrative device. It's like that Ferris Bueller story. I mean not Ferris Bueller fucking Princess Bride

1031
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,720
It's like a story being told from the future. Yeah, it's the framing device of like right, right

1032
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,080
So the two games she got me instead of Ocarina of Time we're bust a move to and

1033
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:02,280
Frogger on ps1 and so what ps1? I love bus to move. I love bus to move

1034
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:07,760
Yeah, so like I was like really disappointed like what is this shit was the other one bust a move in Frogger

1035
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,720
Bust a Frogger whoa

1036
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,960
You were just talking about Frogger and how great it is and now you're acting like you don't know what it is

1037
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,600
You're your audio your audio cut it a weird way. That's all

1038
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,880
God damn it

1039
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,520
So let's just clarify bust to move to and frog. Yes the frogger. Okay. That's got you

1040
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:33,680
Got you. I was audio literally edited your fucking audio connection literally edited you into saying bust a frogger on my end

1041
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,680
That's true. It literally did

1042
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,720
Bust a frog. Well, we all know that if you bust a frogger every day, that's his source of power

1043
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,080
So I was disappointed there's the point of the story

1044
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,600
I was like all these games are probably not good and not even good and not even good

1045
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:53,120
I wanted the other game, but you know, I played them and it turned out they were pretty good

1046
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,720
I had a lot of fun them and I'm still very nostalgic for those two games to this day

1047
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,920
And that is the point of the story and that's how it goes into the topic at hand which is nostalgia and I'm sorry

1048
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,600
I even told the story. I'm sorry. I even try to say everything

1049
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,060
If we ever do a let's play it should be fucking frogger for ps1

1050
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,640
That's I agree sure

1051
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,640
Because I came I want to do bust a move to

1052
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,800
Yeah, let's do a bust a move to play because my mom loved bust a move and got me

1053
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,680
It's like the only video game ever that my mom got me into well the only video game ever

1054
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,480
Yeah, it's the one it's the one video game

1055
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,840
I have heard of it. What does it you do? Do you bust a move?

1056
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,920
But no, you know, it's the game where you bubbles and it's like bubble-bobble

1057
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,920
It's the same like little mascot characters from bubble-bobble if you ever heard of that shit those little cute little dinosaur guys and

1058
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,200
And you fucking and it's like a puzzle game

1059
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:50,320
There's bubbles you and you got to match the colors you shoot them out of a little cannon and you match three of them

1060
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,320
And you can get combos and fucking you

1061
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,680
Fuck up. It's sort of like Tetris only you combine colors

1062
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,520
Yeah, and you know what?

1063
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,800
You reminded me of how

1064
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:07,240
Mad I was I didn't get my money's worth with the Nintendo Wii because neither of my parents enjoyed it at all

1065
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:11,600
Unlike what the commercials said like that for me was the biggest betrayal of Nintendo

1066
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,880
Just because my parents are too fucking old even for the Wii like my dad top 10 anime betrayals

1067
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,280
Yeah parents did not enjoy my dad said like there's just no video game that I can relax to and that's

1068
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,280
The only reason he consumes art is to relax

1069
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,720
My dad's remember the Nintendo Wii

1070
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:35,080
Yeah, that's what they actually used to call it. It's like you're in

1071
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,280
The Mario Galaxy was a fun game

1072
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:47,080
I actually do have nostalgia your referencing old AVG in episodes that are from the future from the past

1073
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:54,040
Well, yeah, I'm nostalgic old man nostalgic for that episode. I'm also nostalgic about the Wii and also

1074
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:00,080
Specifically playing golf with my dad on the Wii golf. That was cool. He really liked that. That's cool

1075
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:10,720
The angry video game nerd was like was a guy like nostalgic about old games and now most of us are really nostalgic

1076
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,320
About the early angry video game nerd episodes. I know right? He still does. Yeah, it's still great

1077
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:20,480
But you know, but particularly the old old episodes. There's just something there's just a timeless quality to them

1078
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,040
Of course

1079
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,440
It is I kind of ironic that the nostalgic critic hasn't ever made anything that's good

1080
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,360
Disagree, I think he's made some okay. What I mean is a not nostalgic for any particular episode

1081
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,240
He's not as rewatchable. You know what I'll give you I'll give him one thing

1082
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,560
I really liked of his was I mean, okay, his reviews are all the same

1083
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,480
He just talks about shit that happened. But yeah, when he reviewed

1084
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,240
He's an integral part of what got me into the room so much

1085
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:52,360
Yeah, I watch his review of the room and so it's always been part of the room experience for me

1086
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,200
And I'll watch that to this day and laugh

1087
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,480
It's a good one. See I'm nostalgic for one thing that he's made. There you go. There you go, Doug. You're welcome

1088
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:05,040
I'm nostalgic for kikassia and all those things. Oh, yeah, kikassia was fun

1089
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,040
But I mean like it wasn't I don't know what that is

1090
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:14,920
Well, I'm the first big that guy with the glasses used to do I mean big old crossover movies, which

1091
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,600
Progressively got more and more elaborate and stupider

1092
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:26,000
It was always like me the only good part about the about any of them was Spoonie because he was the only person on the website

1093
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,200
Who was funny and like had any kind of charisma

1094
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,280
And eventually they like fired him from the site and so then there was no reason to ever go to the site again

1095
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:39,320
We see my problem is that like I just fundamentally hate 90% of the people on that website at any given time, right?

1096
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:44,720
So like when the third one happened and Todd in the shadows showed up. I'm like, oh sweet finally. There's like, okay, Doug

1097
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:52,360
Nostalgia chick. I like her and fucking Todd in the shadows. That's like three guys. Fuck. Do you guys all like Todd in the shadows?

1098
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,840
He's writing is terrible. He's boring as fuck. I don't like anything about you, Nate. I hate him

1099
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:02,320
He's not a good boy, but I don't know why these guys like you and did you talking about how much you like Todd in the shadows

1100
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:07,400
And you get people like like Phyllis and people like other they're all just fat white guys, you know

1101
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,920
And it's just like oh, they're all the same fucking born

1102
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:15,600
That the thing I liked though. Are you saying that you like him because he's not white? Is that your reasoning here?

1103
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:22,360
The thing the thing I I am I liked about the fact that so many of them were annoying and stupid is that I could imagine myself

1104
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,920
You know as a young

1105
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:31,080
Loser kid like becoming an internet reviewer and joining the site just so that I could be there and do it better than they could

1106
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:36,280
Yeah, unfortunately, I got disillusioned to the whole thing by the time I'm actually making yeah now

1107
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:40,960
You're doing the AVGN style in my opinion kind of sort of better than the AVGN does

1108
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,440
In my opinion if hypocrite reviews becomes like 50 episodes long

1109
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:51,000
Then I think I would if it becomes a hundred episodes along then I would like it then more than the first hundred episodes of AVGN

1110
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,000
Slightly but still hmm just my opinion man

1111
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,280
Get in Gib. I am right now

1112
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,280
Well, I'm not right now

1113
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:06,960
Well, okay, I feel like we've gone pretty deep into that. How about we shifted to questions? Is that is that cool?

1114
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:11,480
Let's go. I just want to say that revenge of Shinobi on PS

1115
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:17,280
I mean on PS on Sega Genesis was the fucking coolest and I'm nostalgic for that first level

1116
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:23,560
Because it's really hard but it's really cool and we didn't talk about 16-bit games because you're all fucking young and I hate all of you

1117
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,800
Yeah, yeah, I'm with you there. We didn't talk about anything important. We just talked about a bunch of we need to do

1118
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:33,200
You know that thankfully we should just do like another nostalgia podcast in like a couple weeks

1119
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:39,080
And then we can be nostalgic for this podcast and then also talk about the actual nostalgic stuff that we all neglected this time

1120
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,920
I think I think I might be even though we spent

1121
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,320
I think I might be one of the only

1122
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:55,000
Procrastinators that didn't grow up on 16 bit at all. I didn't even know what an SNES was for like you didn't grow up on SNES

1123
01:08:55,240 --> 01:09:01,480
Well, no, I I the only reason I know about what an SNES is is because the ABG and talked about it

1124
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:16,800
I primarily grew up on PC and I just didn't play any good games. I had like only three good games for my childhood

1125
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,440
It's so easy to not be nostalgic because like all the games I played were shit

1126
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:27,280
Haha, hey, you have nostalgia for your trampoline. No, I only got a trampoline when I was like 14

1127
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,200
That's a number of years

1128
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:36,240
Not long enough to be nostalgic because like mainly the memory I have is spending my childhood wishing I had a trampoline

1129
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,480
Okay, well, do you think okay? That's interesting

1130
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:47,160
Do you think when you die you will have more internalized the feeling of wishing you had a trampoline or actually having had a trampoline?

1131
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:54,400
What's more to the being of Davoo honestly the main the main feeling that sticks out to me is like everyone liking that video more than I do and

1132
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,360
Like me being so mathful that how much people like that video and let me in like well, okay nice

1133
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:06,440
Totally surprises me for all it was just a nice. It was just a nice wholesome like yeah, this is why trampolines are good

1134
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,560
I'm like yeah, it is I get it though

1135
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:15,440
It's got no other pretenses of them to be night a nice little funny video about trampolines. That's true. That's true

1136
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:20,220
It's not like a guys. Here's my epic Zelda breath of the wild review. It's new. It's a video

1137
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,960
loves video games

1138
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,900
Let's what what last thing before we go to questions. I just remembered this anyone else

1139
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:35,040
Nostalgic, I know you are I know the answers. Yes, there is some porn out there that I am super nostalgic for like

1140
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,560
Anyone remember Heather I have I deep throat calm. Come on

1141
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,720
Everyone that she's the deep throat Queen everyone loves Heather Brooke. She's a champion

1142
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,440
It was like the first porn I was ever introduced to by outside friends

1143
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,800
I am change the game nostalgic for like a few early

1144
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,480
Bang bros things

1145
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,680
Did you ever watch Bruno be I remember Bruno be that is I was just like a

1146
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,760
Never I've never to this day watched or read Naruto, but whenever I see the character designs

1147
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,960
I think about a lot of my early masturbation. That's for sure

1148
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,480
Shout out to shout out to acid head does some shout out to porn

1149
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,480
masturbation I get nostalgic for Naruto

1150
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:31,600
Also in Bible black also the one of the first hence I ever saw also the best that there are I can fire emblem fan art

1151
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,320
The first the first inclination I ever had the people could draw

1152
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,560
Characters from things in sexual ways

1153
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:48,640
No, I remember fan art right flourina specifically. She had her panties show in I was like what you can see that

1154
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,640
Oh, no

1155
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,560
Christian sensibilities, no

1156
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,440
All right, well there you go

1157
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:05,720
Yes, so let's let's go to questions. Here we go. It's do it. Okay. We got a bunch here

1158
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,600
Here is okay. Here's a question. That's that's I think is interesting

1159
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,120
Is there any okay, right at an untitled ab

1160
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:21,160
Abrogda, it's like an untitled abridger, but it's weird Tony this this guy tweets the procrastiners all the time

1161
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:28,960
He says is there anything is there anything good about politics favorite political leader? Yes of any definition slash

1162
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,160
All it takes are cool until it's like

1163
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,520
300 million people right

1164
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,160
Like when you watch like maybe like some TV show that involves politics and it's like it's like okay

1165
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,560
Okay, the fucking chairman election art from the end of hunter hunter

1166
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:47,320
It's like it's like politics, but only like 300 people are involved and it's got a lot of it's a clash of really interesting

1167
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:53,080
personalities with a lot of really interesting shit and like when you see those tiny countries of like three million people

1168
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,400
There's still a lot of personality that comes through

1169
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,400
But you know how like the more

1170
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:03,000
Participants you get in something the more it averages out like the more that you flip a coin the more it becomes 50 50

1171
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:10,800
Like the problem with America is it so many fucking people that the only people who can end up becoming nominees are like these weird fucking

1172
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,920
Bullshit blends of different opinions that make no fucking sense and it becomes utterly depressing

1173
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:21,120
So the problem with America is it's too big and that's why our politics are so annoying now

1174
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:29,240
It is it is possible that in our in our internet age that we're in now like human beings are in maybe maybe human beings are

1175
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,720
Like what's the word? I'm looking for lethally tribal

1176
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,280
And that as we're more and more exposed to the other people that actually share the country with us

1177
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:43,880
We're finding out like holy shit. I share the country with these people fuck that and it's it's gonna cause more dissent

1178
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:49,160
There's too many people and the people are too uneducated and that's the problem

1179
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:57,640
Politics forms is nothing but a mental cancer and once it's in people's brains it invariably turns them into worse human beings

1180
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:04,120
I don't disagree. I just want to say lethally tribal Aurora mage

1181
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,020
Lethal lava land from Super Mario 64

1182
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,200
Yes, I I want to actually defend politics for a second and

1183
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,040
Cuz you're gay

1184
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,400
All I have to say is remember Ross you from

1185
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,880
Fucking girl

1186
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:36,080
What Ross you represents is is well, I would I would normally say like a what's the word a

1187
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,360
God, what's the fucking word for someone who like Bush benevolent a benevolent despot is the word?

1188
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,360
I was looking for which is a term for like a

1189
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,520
Dictator who like has the legitimately has the best interests of the people in mind

1190
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,720
But Ross you wasn't even a dictator or like a despot or anything. He was just elected

1191
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:59,600
Doing it, but so like if you I'm doing it everybody's possible. What do you do it on my secretary's pants? That'll fucking show her

1192
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:08,160
Both agree that the only way to defend politics is better than my pants. Yeah

1193
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:16,560
They're all elastic and I think I think it's because political intrigue is interesting politics is dry and boring

1194
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,360
No, no, no, but see the the okay, but the thing about Ross you is Ross you as a hero

1195
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:28,480
Spends Ross you was a politician who spent like 50 fucking years just toiling and toiling and toiling to make sure that you know

1196
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,920
All the spiral races work together and shit

1197
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:36,280
And we see exactly none of the hard work that actually went into making sure everything went smoothly

1198
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:40,280
So that everyone didn't kill each other and like just like in real life. We're bored

1199
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:46,280
We're endlessly bored by by the nitty-gritty of what it takes to actually run a society properly

1200
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:50,480
And so in the anime they fucking skip that and they just tell us it was really hard

1201
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,480
But it went well, but what it it's in real life

1202
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:57,520
You have to actually like live the life of a guy spending a thousand years

1203
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:03,560
I see most politics is interesting, but most politicians are boring because like they

1204
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:08,240
Like what it takes to make a politician you have to like yeah, I sure have a static

1205
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,120
before the

1206
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,840
Yeah, I just wanted to talk about how cool Ross you is

1207
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,960
That's I that's the answer. He's he's a hero guys. He's a hero next question. Okay next question. Um, okay, what?

1208
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,960
Oh, what's his face at?

1209
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,200
kick

1210
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:33,240
Can kink kuck kink kuck right kink kuck asks what is the best fast food?

1211
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,720
Restaurants five guys also why a restaurant so shit. They're all terrible guys. They all don't deserve to exist. I

1212
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:44,920
Agree, I mean you say five guys five guys like tastes like an actual burger that was made at home basically

1213
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:51,520
What counts as fast food if it doesn't carry house cuss count as fast food

1214
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:58,880
That's like sit down. That's like a sit-down place. Yeah, I usually order that in or take away. It's like

1215
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:07,120
Reasonably quick. I'll say it counts. Yeah, whatever. I'm gonna say Domino's pan pizza because I'm getting that as soon as this podcast is over

1216
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:12,160
I would have already ordered my store is currently unavailable for online ordering and I'm kind of wait

1217
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:18,320
I got it online ordering right now. I got it fish and chips the the English classic fish and chips

1218
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,160
Wait, that is chips. Is that a restaurant? It's fries. It's no, it's just a food

1219
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:31,720
It's battered fish with with fried chips and it's it's fast and it's food and I like it and efficient chips is efficient

1220
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,520
Yes. Oh

1221
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,640
Nice nice. I by the way, I got a fish in my shoulder. I

1222
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:43,520
Hate I hate fast food. I think it's a cancer on the world and

1223
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,840
What one time I was watching some show on the food network that was like it was like chopped

1224
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,840
it was like a competition between cooks and

1225
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,960
There was one cook there like the others, you know, they try to make tasty food

1226
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:00,920
There was one there whose whose main emphasis is to make healthy food that people will feel good and improve their lives when they eat

1227
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:08,160
She got voted out in the first round because she didn't load enough salt and oil and bullshit into her food and tried to actually care about

1228
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,820
The people who she was serving to whereas the other people only gave a shit about what instantly was the most

1229
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:17,480
Instant gratification eating it and I think that really speaks to humanity at large

1230
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:21,600
We treat food like it's something to make us feel good and not fuel cells that we need to power

1231
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:28,100
I'm absolutely a hundred percent on board with you. I think I think taste buds are the worst thing and they should be genetically

1232
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,400
Added out of

1233
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:36,300
I think the worst thing that we that we have in our bodies is the butthole

1234
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,820
Because we

1235
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:00,540
I would here's the fucking tier list for fast food, right?

1236
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:00,980
It's like okay

1237
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:05,340
There's Burger King which tastes terrible makes you feel terrible makes you want to go on a killing spree

1238
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,500
Then there's stuff like McDonald's and Wendy's which has like this like half second

1239
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,980
Mmm, tasty when you put it in your mouth, but you just feel gross during and after it feels unsatisfying

1240
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:16,740
I don't know if I put McDonald's above Burger King

1241
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:20,780
I definitely I put Burger King way below all the others. It doesn't even taste good

1242
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:24,620
But anyway, so then you have stuff like five guys, which is like it tastes great

1243
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:30,740
And then I feel great as long as I haven't been eating just this right as long as it's in the occasional

1244
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:34,900
The exception to the rule when I eat something giant and greasy and ketchup now to boo

1245
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:41,100
Oh, man, this is a very typical argument to have here. You're advocating for like that. Oh, I'm a I'm a I'm a free American

1246
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,100
I can eat whatever I want

1247
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:46,780
But the fact of the matter is fast food is garbage and no one should eat it at any time in their life

1248
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:50,260
I don't want people to have the freedom to eat it. It's not much worse for you

1249
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:53,900
Good for your soul SpongeBob SpongeBob's dead because I murdered him so

1250
01:19:54,900 --> 01:20:01,540
Is your tear list based on the amount of tears you cry when you absolutely freaking Lutely, yeah, yeah

1251
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:07,400
Here's a here's a question that's never been addressed before at sis white scum 69

1252
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,900
What is your favorite mud in video games?

1253
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,100
What's going on with mud

1254
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:22,700
Do we have any experts here who can answer this question actually wait, um, isn't there a mud track in Mario Kart?

1255
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:28,940
DS yeah, warrior. I believe warrior. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you included the warrior one in the list hippo

1256
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:33,460
But there's another one. That's like chocolatey. It's like a chocolate mountain in Mario Kart. Oh, yeah

1257
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:35,820
That's the isn't that the 64 well

1258
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,700
DS one, but I guess I guess it's

1259
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:44,660
Yeah, that's why I didn't put it in I remember a great mud level

1260
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:51,980
There was this game. Uh, there's this game called conquer on the n64 where you run up this whole mountain made out of mud

1261
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:59,220
And then you you know you go inside the mud mountain and you fight like a giant mud man and the mud man throws toilet paper at you

1262
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,300
For some reason I never understood why he was throwing toilet paper. His name was the great mighty mud

1263
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:09,060
Yeah, it was a good wholesome game for a young developing boy like myself

1264
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,360
It made me the man I am today wholesome and full of values

1265
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:16,020
And that's why you have so much mud in your pants at any given moment

1266
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:20,420
Wait a minute

1267
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,980
It was crap

1268
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:28,900
That explains why I'm the crappy pants man

1269
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:32,740
My cannon origin at last

1270
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:38,340
I am actually curious if anybody knows of any other games that have cool mud in them because I couldn't really

1271
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:41,740
I really thought about it when I watched your video and I'm not sure I'm trying

1272
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:47,820
I feel like there's is some game that I played that has mud in it that I just didn't remember like getting on the character and thought

1273
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:50,680
It was gross, but I cannot for the life of me or call what it was

1274
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,960
Is there a mud in the Lion King for Super NES?

1275
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:08,640
This is my favorite thing about you Tom that you are the one remaining like Sega warrior champion against Nintendo

1276
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,160
Decades later. It's you do my life. You don't understand

1277
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:19,880
Tells the full tale. I tried to buy I bought a Super Nintendo like years later, and I was so offended that it was in my house

1278
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,600
I just sold it to my friend. I'm like, I don't want it anymore. Oh, I hate it

1279
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,720
Man, man, you know, we should have a PCP about

1280
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,560
Arguing and fighting for the sake of it being fun because like when I was like 13

1281
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:37,920
I was all console worry, but like totally as a meme like I was my god, dude. Yes

1282
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,880
I was on GameSpot forums all the time lemmings and cows and sheep. Yeah, man

1283
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,240
I was like it was like when the Wii was coming out

1284
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:49,240
I was all like, oh dude like this is the future of gaming and like all that online multiplayer shit is just going in the wrong

1285
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:55,880
Direction and like I thought it was fucking funny and then like years later or recently or soon afterwards you get people like guys

1286
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:02,040
What's up with the console war stop being such petty assholes? I'm like you killjoy dumbass. You don't know what this is

1287
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,720
Let's let's do it

1288
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:11,280
I want a fucking episode of us talking about fights and how people do it all wrong like people take stuff seriously when it shouldn't be and

1289
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:18,600
People stick to have not serious. I should be because like because like so much fighting on the internet is like someone like see something on Twitter

1290
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,320
And they go that's gay then they type like ergue

1291
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:28,680
You're a big asshole head, but then smarmy YouTube people are like look at all these people being so worked up about it

1292
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,600
You know like they think that that guy's like all worked up

1293
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,800
But he's he just typed a bunch of exclamation marks in his tweet because he thought it was funny, you know

1294
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:40,600
That's it's it's hard to tell when people are serious and a lot of people are just assumed to be serious all the time

1295
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,160
That's tough. Yeah, we should educate the people on that. That's a good idea

1296
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,480
Um, here's a shit. There was one more that was decent

1297
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:57,120
Filling time filling time get through a sea of not good questions

1298
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,360
It was it was here god damn it

1299
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,880
Hurry up. I want to get my pizza. I found it. I found it. Okay. Here's our last question

1300
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,480
No, you mate

1301
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,680
We got to get out at no you mate asks how okay, this one might get real so

1302
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:24,840
How satisfied yeah, how satisfied is each one of you with their work right now? Oh my

1303
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:36,120
I think my work is the best it's been in a while at least in terms of productivity, so I'm pretty good agreed

1304
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,600
Uh, all of my work is garbage. It's retarded

1305
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:46,520
Uh weird meta content that appeals to absolutely nobody and has no point and the only good stuff

1306
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,680
I make is stuff that I just write and that that never sees the light of day that no one ever gets to see

1307
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:56,280
um my satisfaction with my current output would be um

1308
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:04,040
Like a light eight which is editing digi's videos, right? That's pretty good. My satisfaction with like my workflow

1309
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,280
is like

1310
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:13,640
All is like a strong nine and my satisfaction with where I think my work is going like the direction that my output is going

1311
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,280
I would say is also like a 9.75. So I'm pretty sad

1312
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,080
Fuck you people being happy

1313
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:27,960
Yeah, that's the meme that needs to die if i'm not happy nobody yeah me and tom are going to start our own podcast called the

1314
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,200
Everyone's do happy

1315
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,760
Tom feel like also we love old video games

1316
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,600
Jesse and tom should do like a jessie and tom cast me as a way for me, okay?

1317
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,720
Feel free the reason we're not happy jess is we played too much shinobi and killed all of our joys

1318
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:46,280
It's a new weekly podcast on this channel the airing of grievances with tom and jess

1319
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:50,920
Every week after the pcp. We just shit on everyone for real

1320
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:58,440
I I'm also uh, I I I hate how I'm actually I you know, here's a here's a confession

1321
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:03,480
I'm like learning now how to make fast videos. I don't know how to make fast videos

1322
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:08,200
I'm trying to figure it out. Dude. It's really hard. We're all perfect do it like that forever

1323
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:13,960
Those are good. Those are good. It's I'm kind of used to giving myself space to take as long as I want

1324
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:17,960
Can't do it can't do it anymore. It's because you don't like fast food. You go to take inspiration

1325
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:23,960
Oh, I gotta go to burger king first. Yeah, I gotta gotta go back to eating at burger king

1326
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,840
But pita

1331
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:03,880
