00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
Hey everybody, welcome to Episode 2 of the Bustercast, the only podcast where we've ever

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,840
me and Ben have done something by ourselves.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
Is that true?

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,840
I think it is.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,120
Is the Bustercast the only other one?

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
That could be true.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,680
I think we've done other things, not PCP related, but when it's just us two, I think Bustercast

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,440
was the only thing.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,680
I think you're right, actually.

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,880
We did have the little D&D back and forth at one time, but they were two separate videos

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,920
so it doesn't count.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,120
Nothing counts.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,880
So what is it?

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,400
It's July 5th, and what is it going to be like a month now, since YouTube deleted our

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,640
videos for no reason, and has just told us, like, no, we'll fix it.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
No, we'll fix it.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,960
No, our internal team is going to take care of it.

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,840
No, don't worry about it.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,680
Much like the government responding to COVID, saying everything is fine, and then doing

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,640
nothing and letting it get worse.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:08,120
YouTube is modeling that style for success quite well, unfortunately, and here we are.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,920
If they were going to fix it, they could just do it.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,200
And if they don't care and aren't going to do it, they could just not answer our emails.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Right.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't understand this weird middle ground, and I don't know why it should take this long.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,360
This is how they keep the peons in their place.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,760
They pretend to care.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,520
There's just some algorithm that just is appeasement.exe and just sends out those emails.

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,120
Just why even pretend?

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,200
Why even pretend?

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
It's just making me matter.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,320
It's just making me matter.

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,920
But we're not, we're not rebelling.

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,240
We're not going to YouTube HQ and shooting it up like someone else did, because we have

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,120
this tiny thread of hope, keeping us from going on a riot.

37
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,720
I mean, there will come a time when words will no longer be sufficient.

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
That's true.

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
An action will have to prevail.

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,480
I guess we're not there yet.

41
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,520
Like they're just delaying the inevitable.

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,360
They, they, it's so bizarre.

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,760
The way this whole thing has transpired is so bizarre.

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,200
Like there was no need, there was no need for any of this to happen.

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,280
They just like someone like read an email wrong or something that was like, oh, this

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,720
channel was hacked, better delete all their content.

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,800
It's like, no, this was solved already.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
You solved it.

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,680
And then you came back and unsolved it.

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,400
It's very incredible how like, oh, we're going to delete this entire channel.

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,880
Then we're going to bring it back.

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,440
Then we're going to delete a quarter of an entire year's worth of uploads because like

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
that seems like it would be more effort.

54
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,600
Like it seems like something you'd have to go out of your way to do as opposed to be

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,680
like a, a consequence of some automated system.

56
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,080
It seems something so fucked that automation couldn't be responsible for it.

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
And yet here we are.

58
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
I just don't know.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
I do.

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
You think it is automate?

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,680
You don't think like a human being sat down and was like, let me decide which of these

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
things need to be deleted.

63
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Yeah.

64
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,760
I think if it was by a human, there would be like patches in between those two dates

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,360
where things stayed, right?

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,080
Cause like it's just like everything from 195 forward was deleted.

67
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,840
Except for that one stream inexplicably, that one, the radcon opening ceremony stream

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,120
escaped it.

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
No reason why.

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,400
So I think one exception.

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,840
I think unfortunately it's, it's after four weeks of time, I think it might be time to

72
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,480
finally bring up the question.

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
What do we do?

74
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Yeah.

75
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,080
If they don't come back, not going to be solved.

76
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,040
It seems as if, but they, but they keep telling, okay, like I understand, but they keep telling

77
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,360
us through email, they keep saying, no, no, we're going to fix it.

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
No, no, we're going to fix it.

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,080
Well, I mean, corporate CEOs keep telling me that if I work hard, I'll be rewarded.

80
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
And yet I'm still poor and not rich yet.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,440
I, yeah, but I understand the motivation for keeping you poor, Tom, that makes perfect

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
sense to me.

83
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,560
And if I were in their position, I would do the same.

84
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,440
But this, their motive, I don't understand their motivation for just telling us they're

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,440
going to solve the problem if they don't intend to, I guess it's just part of their

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,080
long game to keep me poor.

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,760
I guess it's all my fault.

88
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,680
I think if they really just weren't going to do anything, they would just say we can't

89
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,160
do anything.

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,360
I don't understand why they wouldn't just do that.

91
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,200
Do we just need to yell more?

92
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,680
Like if we just not yelled enough, I do think that it's like, I was going to yell on Twitter

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,960
some more, but then I saw that like Nate had been like emailing them like fairly, you know,

94
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,440
somewhat regularly, and he had gotten a bunch of responses from them.

95
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,960
And so I was like, okay, I guess they are still talking.

96
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
I guess they're still communicating with us.

97
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,640
We don't really need to raise a stink on social media, but like a month is a long time.

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,960
And I just don't believe that it takes this long.

99
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,160
Yeah.

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm so confused.

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,880
I'm so confused why they're going to, why would they make any promises?

102
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,880
And then just ignore, why not just ignore us completely if that's what they want?

103
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,120
Like, I don't know, man.

104
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,960
It's a mystery, my dude.

105
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Hmm.

106
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:36,600
I mean, if the day comes when we are like, okay, the videos are never coming back.

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:47,640
I think, I don't know, maybe all, but at the very least, most of the content, people have

108
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
it like saved.

109
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,680
Like, like I've heard, I have had people on Twitter and there have been people in the

110
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,080
YouTube comments saying, hey, I have some of the Radcon stuff saved, or I have some

111
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,360
of the streams saved or whatever.

112
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,880
So worst case scenario would be, yeah, we lose the initial videos, we lose the initial

113
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,240
views and comments and stuff and all that, but we can re-upload it.

114
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,120
I really don't want to do that.

115
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,600
No, I do not either.

116
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Yeah.

117
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,120
I mean, you in particular, right, the Animorphs lecture, if it, like, it would get like 200,000

118
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
views more.

119
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,840
I don't think it hit 200 yet, but it was getting there.

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,880
It was like 180 something, I think.

121
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Yeah.

122
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,000
It was going on 200,000 views and without that, you know, it's a big loss.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,840
Which is why I'm willing to just kind of hold off and be like, let's see, let's wait and

125
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
see what happens.

126
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Let's wait and see what happens.

127
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,080
It took them forever for us to, for them to fix the hack the first time.

128
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,720
And by the time they finally did it, I was convinced they weren't going to.

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,040
So I guess maybe I'm a little more hopeful this time because I was proved too pessimistic

130
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,560
in the past.

131
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,000
But that is, you know, we have that option.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,560
And I think that probably, so if you're listening to this and you've got some shit saved, you

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,560
know, hang on to it, there is a real possibility we'll have to put out a fucking call to be

134
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,320
like, hey, everyone, if we have anyone who's got our old shit saved, we'd really appreciate

135
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
it.

136
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
That's all we can do.

137
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,440
We, I mean, I have some stuff saved, but not most of it.

138
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
Yeah.

139
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
You know?

140
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Yeah.

141
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Like I have some of my own stuff.

142
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Coconut milk.

143
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Excellent.

144
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Yeah.

145
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:40,560
Um, boy, it's frustrating though, boy, it makes me fucking mad.

146
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
It's pretty, pretty bullshit.

147
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Pretty lame.

148
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Pretty lame and gay.

149
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,760
Not cool.

150
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,520
So that's the situation with that.

151
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
How's, how's your week been?

152
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
Were you, were you on last week?

153
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,480
It was you, me, hippo, right?

154
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Yep.

155
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Yeah.

156
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,480
So how's your, how's your week been in the time since then?

157
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
It's been, it's been chill.

158
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,960
Just kind of working, grinding, doing a bunch of projects that I'm playing close to the

159
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,640
chest right now, trying to learn things and get smarter and cooler and better.

160
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Are they a zoomie related?

161
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,240
Are they not a zoomie related?

162
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,920
A little bit of both, a little bit of both, assuming and not assuming related.

163
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
Okay.

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,200
Um, yeah, it's pretty cool.

165
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Pretty neat.

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,160
Hopefully someday they'll see the light of day.

167
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,800
That's kind of the idea.

168
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,280
Did you finally said she's going to mail me all the posters so we can get those out to

169
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,800
the rad con backers.

170
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,920
I can't wait to do more grindy work.

171
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Right.

172
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,720
She said she, she said she mailed them, right?

173
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Yeah.

174
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,440
They'll probably be here in a few days.

175
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Cool.

176
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Cool.

177
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Cool.

178
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Boy.

179
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
Um, that's pretty sick.

180
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Yeah.

181
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,600
It's nice to see that the patron shit or not the patron shit, the Kickstarter rewards are

182
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
going out.

183
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Very exciting.

184
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,840
Um, from, uh, on my, on my side of the aisle, uh, my, my Kickstarter is, is also, I'm getting

185
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,640
ready to send that because I have all the vaporettes, Tom.

186
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
I have all the vaporettes.

187
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
My God.

188
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
I have all six of them.

189
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Yes.

190
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,160
So last night Jade sent me hers and she was the last one.

191
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,320
Now I got it.

192
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,600
Uh, I have to like just put the pages together and like decide if I want to put in some like

193
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,600
bumper pages to like keep things like even like keep the left pages versus right page

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
alignments or whatever.

195
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
What's like, what's like the page count?

196
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,600
What's like the, the final page count is it depends on whether I want to put any of those

197
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,880
in, but it's going to like, like 55 to 60 or so, which is, um, it's funny because like

198
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,000
Vapors two is only 15 pages long.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,800
So it's like mostly guest content, uh, which is kind of how I hoped it would be.

200
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,840
Uh, I'm very happy.

201
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,520
A lot of the, a lot of the vaporettes are long.

202
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,720
A lot of them are like six, seven, eight pages.

203
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Um, pretty cool.

204
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,840
That's how you do it in value.

205
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Yeah.

206
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,360
It's going to be like 55 pages.

207
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,920
I sent, I've sent all the guest artists their, their money.

208
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,040
They're fat stacks of that Vapors cash.

209
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Uh, fuck yeah, um, it's a, it's a, I don't know, like if I can finish, if I can finish

210
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,080
doing the layout stuff today, I will send out for a test copy to be printed, get that

211
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,760
in the mail, look it over, be like, yeah, it looks good.

212
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,400
Then I will send out for them to make like 500 of them and then I want to be fucking

213
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,200
in time to do all that shit.

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,880
Time to fucking address envelopes and start like doing doodles and people's copies and

215
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
stuff.

216
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,880
I can't believe it.

217
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,320
You gotta, you gotta do everything through stamps.com so much easier.

218
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Stamps.com.

219
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,480
You've told me about this.

220
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Yeah.

221
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
That's what I use for all the rad con stuff instead of like handwriting all the labels.

222
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,200
I just, cause you can imp, you can export a CSV file of all the patron information and

223
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,600
the stamps.com file, then import it and then you just kind of go through and you, for each

224
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,800
one you say this is the package weight and then it'll just print out labels for you.

225
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,320
If you print them out on the label paper, you just slap them on there and have a good

226
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
time.

227
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,800
I, I understand why that would be an efficient way of doing things, but I just kind of like

228
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,280
labeling things by hand.

229
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,000
Just like that personal touch.

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,920
I like to give it the little personal touch.

231
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Yeah.

232
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
I don't know.

233
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,080
You like, like, did you see the envelopes I sent for the first one?

234
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,320
They were like black with like silver sharpie, right?

235
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,440
They were, they were written in white out on a black envelope.

236
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,600
They're using like a white out pen and they, and they looked sick and I'm going to do that

237
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
again.

238
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,280
So, you know, no shortcuts for me, Dab, I'm going to do, I'm going to try and do a similar

239
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,400
thing with the, the RFCK Kickstarter.

240
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,760
I'm going to try and, I have green envelopes.

241
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,560
I'm going to try and make them fancy.

242
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,680
You're juggling multiple Kickstarter's.

243
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Well that one I won't have to ship out for a little bit.

244
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,520
They are still in the process of like actually making the like tests, like the sample items.

245
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:17,320
So I'll have to get those made, approve them, and then say like, yes, make hundreds, please.

246
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,600
So yeah, like they will probably be shipping out at around the same time, more or less.

247
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
But I don't mind.

248
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,520
So like addressing envelopes is like thoughtless busy work that's kind of relaxing to do.

249
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm not even like, I'm not dreading it at all.

250
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,480
I'm kind of looking forward to it.

251
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Yeah.

252
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Like, I like that shit.

253
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
It's easy.

254
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
The label stuff is pretty, pretty Zen.

255
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,240
You just kind of like put on like some music or a podcast, just get it done.

256
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Exactly.

257
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,200
The only thing that sucked is that for the rewards for GradCon, you had to like match

258
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
up shirt sizes.

259
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,560
So it wasn't just like put label on, toss out of the way, you had to like go and sift

260
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
through them all.

261
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,080
Just a little bit annoying, but yeah, it's fine, whatever.

262
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:05,360
This time, because like the first time I sent out the Vapors Kickstarter books, not like

263
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,200
a lot, but like a significant number, like maybe like a dozen different envelopes ripped,

264
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,240
like the envelopes just ripped.

265
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,920
Maybe it was because they had a pin in them or something.

266
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,160
And like a lot of just people's like stuff got damaged and transit.

267
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,000
This time, I bought bubble wrap.

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,360
So I'm going to put, I'm going to tuck bubble wrap in there.

269
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,840
I'm going to wrap the little pin in it just so it doesn't like prick its way through the

270
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
paper.

271
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,440
It's going to be, it's going to be fucking great.

272
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,000
I have big rolls of it over here next to my bed.

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,880
It's probably not enough.

274
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,360
I'll have to get more, but that's fine.

275
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,600
No, it's going to be plush.

276
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
It's going to send it in plush.

277
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
It's going to travel in comfort and style.

278
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,680
Yes, yes.

279
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,320
Hey, I've been working on, I think I mentioned this last week, but I have I've kept working

280
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,520
on, um, slime and punishment finale.

281
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,320
That's going pretty good.

282
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,840
It's probably about half done.

283
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,600
I think last time I said it was not quite half done.

284
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,280
I've probably passed the halfway mark.

285
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,760
It's going to be exciting.

286
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
What's, what's the ETA on that?

287
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,280
Do you think?

288
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,960
Uh, definitely before the end of the month.

289
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,240
Um, yeah.

290
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,240
Um, I should probably do a bunch of work on it tonight.

291
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,280
Maybe after I do the vapors layout stuff, it will.

292
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,400
When I get like, when I get into the zone with it, it actually goes pretty fast.

293
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,360
Um, when, but it's getting into the zone is hard and takes like time.

294
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,120
I have to like block out time to like sit down and be like, okay, I'm going to make

295
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,800
this shot.

296
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,760
I'm going to, I'm going to make this scene or whatever.

297
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,560
Uh, there was a particular, there was one shot that required making it goes really

298
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,680
fast when there's not, when it's about like video editing, but when I have to like draw

299
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,920
something to put into the scenes, that's what takes a lot of time.

300
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,000
I had one shot that took me forever to draw because it was all these figures that

301
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,800
had to do two different frames and they all sort of move together.

302
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,320
And that took me like four days to just draw this, draw all, draw these figures

303
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
all out in both different poses.

304
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, mostly it was actually putting them into the scene and having the move easy

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,880
took like less than an hour, but the actual drawing was like, oh, I got to fill

306
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,520
the scene with bullshit.

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,040
The labor scenes are always a pain in the ass.

308
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,040
They, they are, they are.

309
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,600
I hate them.

310
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,240
Man, why can't I just, they look cool.

311
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,080
Yeah, but like, man, why can't I just have a bunch of like close up on a face

312
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,320
and shot reverse shot?

313
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,280
That shit's like, that's, it's easy.

314
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,640
George Lucas did it and made millions of dollars.

315
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,240
What the fuck?

316
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,640
Yeah.

317
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,920
Yeah.

318
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
He had the right idea.

319
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,720
He invented, he literally invented it.

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,320
Okay.

321
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,720
Oh, he pioneered shot reverse shot in Star Wars episode one.

322
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,080
He copyrighted it.

323
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
So now I can't use it.

324
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,600
I have to pay him royalties.

325
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,360
That's why that's why I have to do work.

326
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,160
That's why he's not making them anymore.

327
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,240
Disney bought them and they bought shot reverse shot.

328
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,400
So he's just like, I don't even know how to make movies anymore.

329
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,560
Like I, I copyrighted movies.

330
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,200
I copyrighted editing.

331
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,520
I can't do it anymore.

332
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,040
Shit.

333
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,440
I wouldn't put it past Disney.

334
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,200
They're working on it.

335
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,480
They got their lawyers chipping away.

336
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,200
And like, can we just like own the movie format?

337
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,040
We should probably abolish copyright.

338
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,360
I just think, I just think laws should only apply to people that have more

339
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,960
and they should never be used against like people should be allowed.

340
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,680
Like I was about to say abolish copyright.

341
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,720
But I was like, no, no, no, no, no, don't abolish copyright,

342
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,880
but just only make it apply to Disney.

343
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,480
Like Disney can't steal from anyone, but anyone can steal from Disney.

344
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,400
I think that's fair.

345
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,160
There's I think that's completely fair.

346
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,880
Laws are more strict, the more successful you are.

347
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,800
Yeah, yeah, one hundred percent.

348
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,480
That should be how it works.

349
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,680
If you're already making like billions of dollars from your intellectual

350
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,600
properties, there should be a there should be a gradient.

351
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,200
It's sort of progressive intellectual property ownership where,

352
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,920
where and it's like, OK, you've made a certain amount on your property.

353
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,960
Like you can't own it anymore.

354
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,200
It's fucked up.

355
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,360
Like, isn't California kind of like doing that with like stealing and shit?

356
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,160
Isn't like if you like steal something under nine hundred dollars in value,

357
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,240
it's just a misdemeanor and they they can't do anything about it.

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Isn't stealing.

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,320
I mean, that sounds like it would be a misdemeanor anyway.

360
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,920
God, what was it?

361
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,200
There was like they changed something in California with stealing.

362
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,800
And it's just like if it's under nine hundred dollars,

363
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,520
like they can't prosecute you or anything or you can't be arrested.

364
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,520
That sounds like something.

365
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,040
I mean, that totally sounds believable.

366
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,480
I feel like there's already places that have laws like that.

367
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,680
Well, like what you're talking about, like shoplifters, right?

368
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I guess I just know that there was like a big stink about it a few months back

369
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,120
as people are just like going into stores and just like walking out with shit.

370
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,840
And there was nothing anybody in the store could do about it because it was like.

371
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,280
Yeah, the thing about that is that it's a totally victimless crime

372
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,600
and everyone should do it, whether it's legal or not.

373
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,240
I feel like that law should apply to big box retailers,

374
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,680
but like you shouldn't go to a mom and pop shop and like steal all their shit.

375
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,080
But you can go to Walmart and like it's all free and less than a thousand dollars

376
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,720
or more, basically. Yeah.

377
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,800
And even then, if you're like, if you if if you'll like promise you'll be good,

378
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,240
they should just let you off with a warning.

379
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,120
You see, everybody should get one. Everybody should get one.

380
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,360
Yeah, everybody gets one freebie where they can go in and steal

381
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,920
like a like a hundred inch flat screen TV or whatever.

382
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,400
Sick is that in California, the PlayStation five will be free, fucking base.

383
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
Wait, what?

384
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,320
Think about it. If it's under nine hundred dollars,

385
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,080
the PlayStation five will be under nine hundred dollars.

386
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,560
You can just walk in there and fucking take one.

387
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,520
I see. OK.

388
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,680
Wait, hold on.

389
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,480
It's not. Is it law or is it just like company?

390
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,200
Because I know that a lot of stores have have like don't know chase company policies

391
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,200
where like technically you're supposed to like stop a shoplifter.

392
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,920
But company policy is like you don't actually like follow them.

393
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,000
Like if someone just picks up some stuff and walks out with it,

394
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,240
you don't do anything. You say, hey, sir, stop.

395
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,960
And that's it.

396
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,080
Like that's the only thing you're expected to do

397
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,320
because it's like a it's like a bad idea to do anything.

398
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,040
You're not a law enforcement officer.

399
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,720
You don't have the legal authority to like tackle someone.

400
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,840
And even if you did, you wouldn't want your employees doing that

401
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,560
because you don't want your employees getting fucking injured on the job.

402
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,240
Like that's just going to that's like leads to more problems for the employer.

403
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,400
I'm looking. I'm looking at it.

404
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't know. Maybe this is a different thing because this is from 2014

405
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,080
that must be older.

406
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,640
It says California Proposition 47 is what they were talking about.

407
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,680
Some of these articles, but maybe that's not.

408
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,960
I don't know.

409
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,440
I'm not in California.

410
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,280
We're in the other liberal bastion, you know, on the other side of the country.

411
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,360
Yeah, hell, yeah, dude.

412
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
We haven't done it yet.

413
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
Shoplifting is good.

414
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,920
Well, we know you have a personal vested interest in history with the subject.

415
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,160
We looting is good.

416
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,920
Antifa is the good guys.

417
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,360
I mean, whatever.

418
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,040
You guys all know what I think at this point.

419
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,360
What I don't even need to show.

420
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,240
I don't even need to show up or say anything.

421
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,200
It can all just be my opinions can all just be taken for granted.

422
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,160
Eleazar can just insert like quotes from past episodes.

423
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,960
Eleazar, just just just just paste in a bunch of times when I said that,

424
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,680
like, we should eat the rich and then it's fine.

425
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,960
That's you get the idea.

426
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
No problem.

427
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,320
We just added, like, another 45 minutes of the podcast, just with that one edit.

428
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,920
Yeah, yeah, it's like every time to go to voicemails.

429
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,320
Finally, I feel like what's the thing?

430
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,520
Was there anything like that in the news this week?

431
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,760
I mean, like, bullshit happened.

432
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,440
Oh, I went to a fucking I went to like a protest yesterday.

433
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
I broke I broke it.

434
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,640
Yes, I broke out of quarantine and I went and I did a march through Boston.

435
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,440
I quit being a pussy.

436
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,960
It was pretty funny.

437
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,160
I actually got there really early because I had been out with

438
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,240
Munchie and Kazi the night before and I had, like, stayed over it.

439
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,880
Like, like, slept on, like, their, like, dad's couch or something.

440
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,040
Oh, God.

441
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,920
As in Kazi's dad, not Kazi and Munchie's dad.

442
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,560
They don't they don't share a dad, as a matter of fact.

443
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,080
Not yet.

444
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
Lamal.

445
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,040
But I have, like, stayed over there and I so I had to go through the city

446
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,800
and it was the fourth and I knew that there was there was an event going on.

447
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,960
I was like, well, since I have to fucking risk infection to travel anyway,

448
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,200
I might as well stop in the middle and like do this thing.

449
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,880
So I got there really early and I had to just walk around

450
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,320
and wait for like several hours.

451
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,560
And I ended up getting I bought I bought a big bottle of hand sanitizer

452
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,360
to keep hands, you know, disinfecting myself with.

453
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,480
But I forgot to get sunscreen.

454
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,600
So I was out all day in the sun and I forgot to sunscreen and I.

455
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,360
And I'm all red and it hurts really bad today.

456
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,120
But that's but that's fine.

457
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,920
It was worth it.

458
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,520
And the march was very it was pretty fun.

459
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,120
It wasn't it was like three or four hours, which is like, OK, whatever.

460
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,480
It was kind of long, but not like unbearably long.

461
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,640
And it was a little bit.

462
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,720
It was a little annoying because they slipped in a bunch of

463
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,160
they slipped in a little bit of some like hippie dippy spiritual nonsense.

464
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
You know what I mean?

465
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh, no.

466
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,480
There was.

467
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,320
I mean, they did some like did some like African chanting,

468
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,640
which like that's fine. That's cool. I get that.

469
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,760
But the the ladies that led it, they called them.

470
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,800
They called them the healers, which is like, OK, that's fine.

471
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,960
And like and for the most part, you know, they they invoked

472
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,960
some kind of like spiritual sounding stuff, which is like, yeah, fine, fine, fine.

473
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,200
But there was a part when we stopped at the Harriet Tubman Memorial.

474
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,640
This was like near like a house that I guess she lived in.

475
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,040
I don't know the fucking history of my own city now.

476
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,640
But this was a Harriet Tubman Memorial.

477
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
And we stopped and they sort of had like a moment of silence

478
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,200
and like some deep breathing exercises and like a like we want to honor.

479
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,760
They were they're going to honor the spirit of Harriet Tubman,

480
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,000
which like got it makes perfect sense.

481
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,960
But then they added these a little bit more.

482
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,760
They were like, we want to honor the spirit of water

483
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,200
because water is such a powerful elephant in the elephant,

484
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,640
such a powerful element in our tradition.

485
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,240
As you like, you know, these water spirits, these merfolk,

486
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,880
you know, followed our people across the sea.

487
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,000
If they slave ships.

488
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,440
Whoa, whoa.

489
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
Like whoa.

490
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,440
Do you want to honor their merfolk?

491
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,640
Clearly they didn't do much to help.

492
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,720
Yeah, yeah, they just were they just watched.

493
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,120
They were fucking centrists.

494
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,640
They were like, hmm, slave slave owners.

495
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,520
I can't tell the difference between these people.

496
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,240
Maybe they're both a little wrong.

497
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,440
So I don't know.

498
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,800
So there was there were a couple of little bits like that.

499
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,560
But, you know, whatever is fine.

500
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,320
It was very cool.

501
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,720
We went in front of we went in front of the police department.

502
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,360
I think it was the police department headquarters.

503
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,720
It was near Ruggles and it's this big.

504
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,120
It kind of it's like a big blue, like sort of semi-futuristic box.

505
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,480
It kind of reminds me of the IDPD headquarters from Nuclear Throne.

506
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,680
It looks a little bit like a prison and a little bit like a car dealership.

507
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,120
That sums up the police pretty well.

508
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,800
Yeah, I thought so.

509
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,840
We went right in front of it and we chanted, we chanted, you know,

510
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,600
no justice, no peace, abolish the police.

511
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,520
It was pretty cool.

512
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,800
They didn't do anything.

513
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,240
It was perfectly peaceful protest, which means that it accomplished nothing.

514
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Nobody cared.

515
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,320
But whatever, we made our statement.

516
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,840
Unfortunately, nobody broke any windows.

517
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,320
Cy, nothing was set on fire.

518
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,400
Maybe next time.

519
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Well, next time we get to get some of the Murfolk involved.

520
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,920
That'll that'll rile things up.

521
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,000
We got it.

522
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,600
We didn't invoke them hard enough.

523
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,760
I guess not.

524
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,680
The Murspirits or whatever the fuck they called them.

525
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,800
I don't know.

526
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,560
I get it's hard.

527
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,760
It's harmless enough, but it's a little it's a little

528
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,560
feels like a little bit of a waste of time, like I don't give a shit.

529
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,120
I don't give a shit about spirituals and I'm not here to fucking

530
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
I'm not here to fucking worship the elements.

531
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,200
I'm here to fucking defund the police and get the issues and get killer cops

532
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,080
put in jail. That's all I want.

533
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,280
And you're fucking it up.

534
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,000
But it's fine.

535
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,160
Cop killers, not killer cops.

536
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,640
Exactly. Exactly.

537
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,920
Thank you. That's that's going to be your fucking sign you bring out next time.

538
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,640
I somebody gave someone was handing out signs and I kind of wanted.

539
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,400
I don't know.

540
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,760
So I was holding up a sign, but it wasn't one that I made.

541
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,200
And then I ended up just picking a kind of generic, just like BLM one.

542
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
I was like, OK, this is fine.

543
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,440
I kind of wish that I had made my own and I could have made it a little more

544
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,520
pointed, you know, about specifically about like defunding the police or something.

545
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,120
But I don't want to get confused with the Murfolk.

546
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,520
No, I'm not with them.

547
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,000
There's like there's there's the defund the police people and there's the

548
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,240
Murspirits followed us from African people and we have nothing to do with each other.

549
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,840
That's that's interesting.

550
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,760
I don't know.

551
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,920
These these healers are a little whatever, they were fine.

552
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,440
You know, you know, they they went to all the trouble to organize this.

553
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,800
I'm sure it was a lot of work.

554
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,320
Do I if I if I had been making the speeches,

555
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,080
would I have said the exact all the same things?

556
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,680
Maybe not. But that's OK.

557
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,560
The doer is it is the doer of deeds, you know, who matters, not not the man

558
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,600
who stands aside and says how they do or could have done them better,

559
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,920
whatever that Teddy Roosevelt quote is.

560
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,760
Are we allowed to quote him?

561
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,840
Isn't he a bad person?

562
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,720
Isn't everybody a bad person who wasn't born like 10 years ago?

563
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,600
Um, Teddy Roosevelt is like you can he's, you know, everybody's problematic.

564
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,520
Everybody's got their issues.

565
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,840
I think Teddy is like pretty good for the time.

566
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,960
Like, is he a little racist?

567
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,080
Like, yeah, sure.

568
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,440
But he wasn't like a slave owner or anything, you know?

569
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,080
He wasn't like, like, I mean, there's like that Edward Colton guy

570
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,200
who they pulled down the statue of in London that one time.

571
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,840
And like, he like literally owned like a slave trading empire.

572
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,720
And then there's like Ulysses S. Grant, who owned one slave,

573
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,160
but only because like his wife already owned the slave and he just married her

574
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,400
while she owned it. So it's like he technically did.

575
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,520
But like, you know, there are there are degrees.

576
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,040
There are degrees. That's a little that's a little that's a little.

577
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,840
Am I am I being a little problematic here?

578
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,080
Just a tiny bit. You might want to.

579
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,880
Oh, oh, he only owned that out.

580
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
Oh, oh, he only owned one slave.

581
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,120
Like, oh, die, Ben St.

582
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,040
canceled like, no, but come on, but come on. All right.

583
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,560
Like, yeah, Teddy Roosevelt was a little bit racist,

584
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,040
but he was like that like paternalistic kind of racism that's like, ah, you know,

585
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,280
he was he was wasn't perfect.

586
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,480
But, you know, most most people were worse, you know?

587
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,520
He was pretty he was pretty progressive in his own way for his own time.

588
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,640
So I think that you can only be as progressive as the culture you were born into,

589
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,240
you know, 20 years from now, the fucking post zoomers will be talking

590
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,120
about all the problematic shit we did without realizing it.

591
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,960
I think you're right. I think that's true and untrue.

592
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,040
Like, I think I think that anyone probably,

593
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,240
if they really cared to like take a long, hard look,

594
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,040
probably should have known that slavery was always wrong.

595
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,800
But on the same time, you know,

596
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,840
if everyone's doing it, it does make it harder.

597
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,960
It does make it harder to be like to take a stand and be like, you know what?

598
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,200
I won't own people. I'm going to buck this trend.

599
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,840
Yeah. So I guess so I guess I see it both ways.

600
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,720
I guess if it's like that deeply ingrained, you know, it's kind of like us here,

601
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,360
like money pretty bad, probably should get rid of it. Federal Reserve die.

602
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,520
But it's like, what are you going to do?

603
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,760
Just stop using money like you can't really.

604
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,920
So I guess I'll just keep taking my hand out from the government.

605
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,680
Like, like, um, yeah, I don't know.

606
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
But slavery is bad, though.

607
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,640
Slavery was definitely in case in case I'm making this podcast going on the record.

608
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,280
To say it's official position, bad.

609
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:59,360
The official position of the PCP is that the slavery cringe, pretty cringe.

610
00:29:59,360 --> 00:29:59,840
Not at all.

611
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,760
Based where we map slavery on our three dimensional chart.

612
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,560
Yeah, it'd be cringe, smoothbrained.

613
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,520
Oh, that one.

614
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

615
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,280
Cringe, smoothbrained and what's was the other axis?

616
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,960
Virgin, very virgin, definitely virgin.

617
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,480
Super virgin.

618
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,800
Mm hmm. The worst corner.

619
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,560
Yeah. But.

620
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,880
So that's me. I'm no longer a pussy.

621
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,440
I did the thing.

622
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,600
I did an activism and I feel good about it.

623
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,720
You risked the Rona, which you you were worried you had for a while.

624
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,280
But clearly that that doesn't seem to be in the case.

625
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,240
Did I talk about the Rona on last episode?

626
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Did I talk about that ice cream?

627
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,800
I don't think so.

628
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,120
Well, in brief, I bought a tub of ice cream and I ate it.

629
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,440
And then I was real, realized, like, wait a minute, the seal was broken.

630
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,360
Oh, my God.

631
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,800
Somebody opened my ice cream and licked it to give it the Rona and put it back.

632
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,480
And I have been I am the victim of terrorism.

633
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,000
However, I don't think that's true.

634
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,560
I think it was just a factory defect.

635
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,760
I went back to that same store and I looked at the same flavor of ice cream

636
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
and they all have a broken seal.

637
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,160
And in fact, and in fact, the next one I bought not only had a broken seal,

638
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,880
it was like half empty.

639
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,200
So now not only was I exposed to the Rona, I was also ripped off.

640
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,120
So I need to go back and be like, excuse me, I want to talk to your manager.

641
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,960
This tub of keto ice cream was only like half full.

642
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,080
And I would like a replacement, please.

643
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,240
Thank you very much, essential worker risking your life to serve me.

644
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,040
But please, but please fix this immediately.

645
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,840
I mean, if you're if you have the Rona and you want to spread it to the most people,

646
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,880
you're not going to go for the keto ice cream.

647
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,840
That's definitely, you know, you're not maxing your potential damage.

648
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,640
You're right.

649
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,840
I would want to I would want to lick something that was like guaranteed to sell

650
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,600
that day, like because because if you let it sit, it's, you know,

651
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,920
the Rona only only lives for so long.

652
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,800
Although I do think it lives longer in the cold.

653
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,840
I would assume so.

654
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,400
So well, I would have assumed that like sub freezing temperatures would kill it.

655
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,240
But I don't think that's the case because it's not like it's not like a living

656
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,640
organism, it's like a virus, which is basically just like a glorified molecule.

657
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,040
So I do think it can survive sub freezing temperatures.

658
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,640
But I think it just kind of naturally decays and like heat speeds that process along.

659
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,960
So like living in the freezer is probably where it would be the worst

660
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,160
and where it would last the longest.

661
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,200
So, you know, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous stuff.

662
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,440
Although I don't think there's any cases of it having been spread in that way.

663
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't think I was looking it up because I was afraid.

664
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,880
And I think there's like no confirmed cases of it being spread through food at all.

665
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,160
And like also cases in Massachusetts are like way down now.

666
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,160
Like we are one of I think we're one of only two states that is like

667
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,200
still decreasing, has not fucking fucked themselves with like a poorly planned

668
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,720
reopening. The Commonwealth works, I guess.

669
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,240
Commonwealth fucking works.

670
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,640
Wait, let me let me check right now.

671
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,920
Massachusetts coronavirus cases.

672
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,400
Are we still are we still in the decline?

673
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,760
Are we still in the decline?

674
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,120
It's like, oh, we were doing great until some crazy people started protesting

675
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,440
about merfolk yesterday.

676
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,000
Now it's a huge spike again.

677
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,200
Wait, I don't see the fucking I don't see the fucking graph.

678
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,920
No, Massachusetts.

679
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,720
If there's no graph, it didn't happen.

680
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,040
Did I misspell Massachusetts?

681
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,280
Mast Massachusetts coronavirus cases.

682
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,400
I just want I just OK.

683
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,720
Here we go. Confirmed cases.

684
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,280
110,000 Lamal.

685
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Um, deaths, 8000 Lamal base.

686
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,120
OK, OK, Massachusetts new cases in the last 60 days.

687
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,880
Oh, my God, show me the graph.

688
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,440
Show me the fucking graph.

689
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,680
My viewers are not allowed.

690
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,680
Oh, here we are. Here we are.

691
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,720
OK, we've actually ticked up a little bit.

692
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,520
But at the lowest, we were getting like 100 cases a day.

693
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,280
Now we're kind of up to like two to three hundred socialists and confirmed

694
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,160
not working, but I mean, at the worst, we were getting like thousands of days.

695
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,840
So, you know, it could be could be worse.

696
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,160
I guess it's all right.

697
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,080
It's OK. It's going to be fine.

698
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,240
It's going to be fine.

699
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,840
We're going to make it.

700
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,080
Maybe someday.

701
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,040
Dude, I was reading, I saw something on Twitter about apparently in Florida,

702
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,840
there's like new cases of this like amoeba

703
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,080
that like goes in through your nasal cavity and like starts breaking down your

704
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,520
brain and there's been like 163 cases ever since it was discovered.

705
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,840
And only four of them weren't fatal.

706
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,800
And it's like happening.

707
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,800
And if you go in the water, this amoeba can go up your nose

708
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,400
and start breaking down your brain to ease your brain.

709
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,560
Oh, oh, no.

710
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,600
Yeah. I was just like, well, it's a good thing I never go to the beach.

711
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,120
And now I definitely never will ever in my life.

712
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,760
Oh, no, that sucks so bad.

713
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,120
Dude, it was like the worst.

714
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,560
It's like, oh, man, like, please, no, let's not do that ever.

715
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,840
I'll see if I can find the link and put it in the show notes.

716
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,280
But it was it was pretty fucking bad.

717
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,440
That's pretty cringe, dude.

718
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,520
Yikes. OK.

719
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,680
I mean, a little bit more Chad than slavery,

720
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,280
but it definitely is pretty close to the bottom of our.

721
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,680
It's it's it's yeah, it's a little more Chad and a little less Virgin,

722
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,760
but it's still pretty cringe. Yeah, that's definitely not good.

723
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Definitely not good.

724
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,480
I'm that I've watched like some shitty YouTube video one time.

725
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,200
It's like, oh, top 10, like stupid deaths.

726
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,880
And one of them was like a guy bet his friend to eat a slug.

727
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,160
And the guy ate the slug.

728
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,520
But the slug had like, oops, the slug had a brain parasite in it.

729
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,800
And he got a brain parasite and it ate his brain.

730
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,480
What a fool. What a nerd.

731
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,080
Like, he really fucking lost the the Darwin award.

732
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,320
Won the Darwin awards that and I'm like, oh, my God, a brain parasite.

733
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,360
I'm going to cry.

734
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,320
I'm going to cry just thinking about it.

735
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,560
I'm so upsetting.

736
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,720
I found the thing I never ate a slug.

737
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,600
Yeah, probably not a good idea.

738
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,960
At the very least, if you have to eat a slug, at the very least cook it.

739
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,360
Cook your food, God damn it.

740
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,040
Yeah. Also, don't and don't make slugs your food.

741
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,440
I would recommend I was looking through.

742
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,120
I was I was trolling through Twitter a little bit last night trying to see

743
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,960
if like there were any pictures of the march yesterday that I was in.

744
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,520
I didn't find any, but I might go through again today

745
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,520
and see if anyone posted any like late pictures that have me in them.

746
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,280
I did take a few of my own, but like it's a little cringe.

747
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,440
You're like, haha, I took a selfie. Like, haha.

748
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,760
No, no, I need to let I need to let someone else do it for.

749
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,040
Yeah, if you do it, you're just like, you know, trying to get attention.

750
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,280
But if someone else did it, it's just evidence that you were powerful.

751
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,600
That's right.

752
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,800
But I stood up for justice. Exactly.

753
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,720
Oh, man.

754
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,840
J.K. Rowling's back.

755
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,040
Oh, back with she's back with more turf shit.

756
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,600
Really? Yeah.

757
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,400
Just doubling down, just doubling down her old shit.

758
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,120
That's really the only move you have to make once you're in her position, I suppose.

759
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,800
It's it's that or apologize and, you know,

760
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,360
I think it's just like at this point,

761
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,840
there's just so much bad blood that apologizing would lead to nothing.

762
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,280
Like no one no one would care.

763
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,160
They would still be mad.

764
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,200
So she's probably just like, you know, well, I don't really feel sorry.

765
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,520
So I'm just going to double down.

766
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,680
You know what? No, I don't agree.

767
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,360
I think if at this point J.K. Rowling like really like

768
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,400
looked into matters, decided she was wrong.

769
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,000
Like like like understood, like understood the point,

770
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,120
like understood why being a turf is bad and then came out and was like,

771
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,720
hey, guys, I was really messed up.

772
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,520
The stuff I said was wrong.

773
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,480
I got bad information and I had some like, you know, bad ideas

774
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,320
that I needed to like get over and understand why they were wrong.

775
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,240
But now I've done it and I've completely changed my tune

776
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,760
and I renounce everything.

777
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,360
I think she'd be a fucking hero.

778
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,320
I think everyone would be people would be like dancing in the streets with

779
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,360
that people like, oh, we.

780
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,360
Yeah, I do.

781
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,920
Like people would people wouldn't have to like people were so upset about

782
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,200
they're like, oh, we millennials sure do love Harry Potter.

783
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,320
And oh, but now our now our fave is problematic.

784
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,720
Like, oh, I guess that I guess people our age would definitely

785
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,040
cut her some slack just because of Harry Potter.

786
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,720
The millennia.

787
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,120
Oh, the Zoomers probably would.

788
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,960
The Zoomers would not.

789
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
They don't give a shit.

790
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,320
They would. That's true.

791
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
That's true.

792
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,520
OK, like obviously some people would never forgive it,

793
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,400
but I think a lot of people would and I think a lot of people want to forgive Joe

794
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,520
and would take any opportunity they could.

795
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,880
But, you know, she's just she's not interested in that.

796
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,560
Kanye West is running for president.

797
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,960
Incredible.

798
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
You see that?

799
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,600
Yeah.

800
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
That sucks.

801
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,520
Well, it's pretty amazing.

802
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,960
I don't know. I don't know.

803
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,080
Twenty twenty year that just keeps giving, you know,

804
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,760
there's always something new to look forward to.

805
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,440
I don't know if I think that like more if that's is that going to split

806
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,560
the Biden vote or the Trump vote more?

807
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,800
I don't really know.

808
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,920
I think it'll probably it'll probably affect them both relatively equally,

809
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,920
I would assume, right, because nobody really knows where Kanye stands at this

810
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,600
point, because he was like on Trump's dick for a while.

811
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,720
And then it was like, ha, ha, I deceived all of you.

812
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,480
So it's like, that's so fucking stupid.

813
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,720
Do you know what's true?

814
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,760
What's false?

815
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,640
Nobody knows.

816
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,280
I was only pretending to like, is he really like, you know,

817
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,840
like a Bible thumper kind of guy?

818
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,080
Is he really into God or is that a lie, too?

819
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,000
We just don't know.

820
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,560
Well, the conservative Christians want to go with the guy

821
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,160
who's talking about God, but it also, you know, not white.

822
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,840
Like we just, it's there's so many questions.

823
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,720
I don't know.

824
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,200
I don't know.

825
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,600
I I I think it'll probably cut pretty hard both ways, but also probably

826
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,360
not very much at all.

827
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,440
And it won't matter.

828
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,640
It's fine.

829
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,480
It's fine.

830
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:46,920
It's fine.

831
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
It's fine.

832
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,120
I'm just saying, I don't give a shit.

833
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,280
Kanye versus Trump would be.

834
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,400
Did you?

835
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,640
I mean, would would you not like, I feel like, OK, if Biden, if something

836
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,880
happens and Biden can't like be on the ticket or whatever, or just like

837
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,120
becomes irrelevant and it just ends up being endgame Kanye West versus

838
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,800
Donald Trump 2020, like 50 years from now in the history.exe tablet

839
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,240
because books will be destroyed with this point.

840
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,680
It'll just be like the end of politics in America.

841
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,760
This is when it'll happen.

842
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,480
Like this is when like politics literally just died and reality TV is politics

843
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,040
because it's just like the system has completely broken down at that point.

844
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,960
Yeah.

845
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,640
Yeah, being a little bit.

846
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,160
I mean, it would just kind of be a continuation.

847
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,080
It wouldn't even be that shocking anymore.

848
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,480
No, that's the whole thing.

849
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,120
That's kind of like reinforces the point.

850
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,480
It's like, if Kanye West versus Donald Trump, like would you be surprised?

851
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,000
You'd be like, mm-hmm.

852
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,720
Did did you see did you see Kanye?

853
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,680
I think it was this week tweet out like this like emotional tweet.

854
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,200
It's like, I'm so proud of, you know, my beautiful, gorgeous wife.

855
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,160
Cart Kim or what it right?

856
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,360
I'm so proud.

857
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,440
I'm so proud of my wife, Kim.

858
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,480
She's officially a billionaire.

859
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,440
I love her.

860
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,640
And, you know, I knew she could do it, right?

861
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,760
And like, and there was like a little like artsy little photo.

862
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,240
He made a little collage for whatever.

863
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,680
And it's like, dude, you fucking monster.

864
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,120
I hate you.

865
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,400
I hate your wife.

866
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,800
Read the fucking room.

867
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,600
You miserable piece of shit.

868
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,840
You are a fucking moron and I cannot fucking stand you in the slightest.

869
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,880
You are a blight.

870
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,240
Oh, it made me so it made me so fucking mad.

871
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
Like it would make me mad.

872
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,360
Like if that were true, it would make me mad.

873
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,240
And I'm sure it is true.

874
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,000
That fact alone makes me true.

875
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,520
But the fact that he like thinks that he should tweet it and be like, yes,

876
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,000
this is a cause for celebration.

877
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,560
It's like, just kill yourself.

878
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,680
Like just die.

879
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,320
That's just like the bourgeois version of getting a million subscribers.

880
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,200
You know, they're just that's the kind of excitement of the lists.

881
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,400
I feel like even under normal circumstances, it's gauche to be like,

882
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,480
guys, my wife's officially a billionaire.

883
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,080
Like fuck off.

884
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,760
Like I've seen I've seen YouTube channels be like, hey, guys, listen,

885
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,840
like I've seen them embarrassed to make the announcement that they have like

886
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,240
paid off their student loans, right?

887
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,560
But like they're not poor anymore, right?

888
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,720
Like that's embarrassing for some people to ask.

889
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,760
Like like that's the kind of situation we're in.

890
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,520
And then you take your con and you're like, dude, I gotta let everyone know

891
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,080
I'm already a billionaire, but now I don't know.

892
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,160
My wife is one, too.

893
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,440
This is they're all going to be so fucking happy for me.

894
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,240
It's so gross.

895
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,800
If your wife is so fucking gross, if you're a billionaire and you're married

896
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,800
to your wife, isn't she automatically a billionaire by like default?

897
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,720
Um, I think, um, I mean, I think some people don't have joint accounts, right?

898
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Connie is like, I got to keep my shit safe.

899
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,040
I don't even trust her.

900
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,240
I mean, maybe I guess, I guess like generally it's considered that

901
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,160
when you, if you get divorced, like you split your ass, you split assets 50 50.

902
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,840
But if like maybe they have a prenup where that's not the case or maybe they

903
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,400
just have like split accounts.

904
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,120
So like, even though that is the case, like, I guess it's probably just

905
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,800
to her business, they're not, they're not evaluated at a billion dollars,

906
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,800
like they're not, they're not technically her assets yet or something or whatever.

907
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,520
These are questions that I've never had to contemplate and never will.

908
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,680
It's, it doesn't matter.

909
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:29,640
Like, uh, I saw, I saw a tweet from this guy.

910
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,560
Um, I think his name is Benjamin Dixon, sort of like a political guy.

911
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,200
He shows up on CBS sometimes.

912
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,160
He shows up on the news every once in a while.

913
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,120
He's a fucking good socialist boy and he made like a tweet.

914
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,880
It was like crying emoji.

915
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,480
And it was like that face when you got it, that face when you got it.

916
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,040
Oh, what was it?

917
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,400
Like you, you got to like, I'm going to misquote it.

918
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,200
But it was like when you, you got to criticize hip hop because hip hop is

919
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,440
like all about that grind and hip hop idolizes capitalism and just says,

920
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,560
if you're poor, you're just not working hard enough.

921
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,280
And I was like, yeah, that sounds about right.

922
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,880
That sounds about right.

923
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,440
And Kanye is also like that.

924
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,160
Kanye is all about the brag rap.

925
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,880
I mean, not exclusively.

926
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,280
He does sad raps too.

927
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,560
I mean, he's kind of his own beast, I guess, but he does, but he brags about

928
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,400
his money like a lot of people do.

929
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
And I hate that shit.

930
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,040
I hate it so much.

931
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,120
Uh, uh, uh, I hate, I hate that, uh, I hate that there's a certain segment

932
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,600
of the population that doesn't think you should be embarrassed to be a billionaire.

933
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,080
Those people are cringe.

934
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,680
They are the problem.

935
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,760
They are, uh, uh, uh, I hate them.

936
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,400
I hate them.

937
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,240
I just hate them.

938
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,680
It sucks.

939
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,560
It just seems like even if you are proud to be a billionaire, not something

940
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:50,440
you should probably be saying right now, considering the social political climate.

941
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,440
You might want to keep that in the back pocket for now.

942
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,120
What is it?

943
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,200
Like, like, um, you know, like form, like, is it four million people are

944
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
unemployed right now?

945
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,440
And like something it's saying like that, but, and that the, like, there's

946
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,400
another statistic, like it's like, like the top, like the top 1% has like

947
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,120
increased its wealth by like, uh, you know, 25%.

948
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,720
Like, like, like some, like some vast amount of money has moved itself from

949
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,640
ownership of like the proletariat to like the hyper elite bourgeoisie.

950
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,680
Like this is, this is just a fact.

951
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,960
The nor the normal flow of capital has only increased the normal flow of

952
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,200
capitalism, which like, you know, they did the cares act, which like did all the

953
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,920
like extra, um, um, uh, unemployment benefits for people losing their jobs,

954
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,800
which was good, but like a much bigger part of the cares act was just bailouts

955
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,160
for corporations and, and stuff reverse the bunch of tax laws.

956
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,760
So like all the, the tax money they would normally lose, they'd get back.

957
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,640
Yeah.

958
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,160
So, you know, that, that happens.

959
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:53,880
Yeah.

960
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,320
It's just the system doing what it does best.

961
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,880
And it's like, Oh, but like all this money is going to the poor.

962
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,440
It's like, yeah, but the federal reserve just creating this money.

963
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,080
So it's not like it's anything's being redistributed.

964
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,920
They're just making new money, giving it to you, but they're also making

965
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,600
your money less valuable because of the natural result of inflation of adding

966
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,280
trillions of dollars to the economy.

967
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,560
And so longterm, you're, it's just the billionaires making out like bandits

968
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,160
again, and it's like your pittance is worth less with every dollar they

969
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,560
print every month to keep you substantiate you.

970
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,120
They threw us a bone, but they threw the people that own your asses away

971
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,040
bigger bone.

972
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,760
So like you appreciate the bone, but like understand that they are fucking us.

973
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,080
A lot.

974
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,720
It's like they serve, they serve the bourgeois, they're, they're a silver

975
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,880
platter dinner and then threw us the scrap once it was done.

976
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,760
Yeah, that's exactly, that's exactly it.

977
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,120
That's exactly what they did.

978
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,680
Most of it went to them.

979
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,280
They try to obfuscate it so you don't realize that you're just getting

980
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,000
table scraps.

981
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,960
It's like, Oh, Donald Trump cares about me.

982
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,480
He personally signed my check.

983
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,720
He's $1,200.

984
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,080
Dude, what a piece of shit.

985
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,520
He personally signed the check.

986
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,120
I can't, that's fucking funny.

987
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,600
That's just fucking funny.

988
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,080
Donald Trump, funny guy.

989
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,280
Kind of like him, honestly.

990
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,640
Four more years, MAGA.

991
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,440
Clip that, clip that, put it everywhere.

992
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,360
Hashtag canceled and saying it's happening.

993
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,080
Hey, I actually have to pee all of a sudden.

994
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,360
I've been drinking coconut milk and coffee.

995
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,920
Do you want to spit, do you want to ad lib for a minute?

996
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,760
Sure, I'll try.

997
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,120
Freestyle, lay down a beat.

998
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,120
All right, I'm not doing that.

999
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,360
Not, not in these sensitive times with race relations, am I going to try

1000
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,760
and appropriate black culture?

1001
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,400
No, this is going to be a perfect time for an ad segment.

1002
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,000
Hey, guys, you're listening to this on Spotify or some podcast platform.

1003
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,720
And you're like, man, the procrastinators are not uploading on YouTube anymore.

1004
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,600
And since the procrastinators aren't uploaded on YouTube, I literally

1005
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,040
have no reason to go on YouTube.

1006
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,720
Well, worry not, because I have continued the hyperbolic wine chamber,

1007
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,280
my own personal podcast that I used to do on the procrastinators channel,

1008
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:05,120
on its own channel, and it uploads three times a week.

1009
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,840
So if you are just like, man, I really wish I could get the best PCP member

1010
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,960
me to be more active and do more things and be on YouTube.

1011
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,640
So I don't have to tab over to Spotify or wherever, because it's just so much

1012
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,640
fucking work and I'm a lazy zoomer and I've just been conditioned by easy

1013
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,240
fucking internet culture.

1014
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,200
We'll just go on over to search hyperbolic wine chamber on YouTube

1015
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,120
and you'll get podcasts three times a week.

1016
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,680
And do it.

1017
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,560
Do it. It'll be fun.

1018
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,360
It'll be a good time.

1019
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,560
And if you're a patron, you get early access a week early and you can get

1020
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,920
the 50 episodes of the bonus podcast where you get to decide what the topics

1021
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,960
are every week.

1022
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:41,800
Do it.

1023
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,280
Wait, Tom, did I just leave to go pee and I come back and you've

1024
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,200
taken the opportunity to plug yourself?

1025
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,600
Yeah, it was an ad segment.

1026
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,000
Why don't you go plug your yourself?

1027
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,520
When you shove it up your asshole is what I'm saying.

1028
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,200
Sure.

1029
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,160
That's OK.

1030
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,000
That's fair.

1031
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,880
OK, cool.

1032
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,280
All right.

1033
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:01,600
That's fair.

1034
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,080
Considering pretty bad.

1035
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,720
Hey, funny story.

1036
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,760
I was we were taught.

1037
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,120
OK, about the unemployment thing and the cares act, right?

1038
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,160
It was called the cares act cute acronym.

1039
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,960
They're doing they're doing like another one that I guess they're still

1040
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,480
debating the like the minutiae of and this one is called the heroes act.

1041
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,600
Very cute acronym cringe.

1042
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,440
I saw I saw another one.

1043
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,640
This was a story about like, oh, I might be misremembering the details.

1044
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,600
I think it was that like a law was passed.

1045
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,240
Criminalizing hair discrimination in the sense of like.

1046
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,920
You can't discriminate in some place in their hairstyle.

1047
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,560
The idea being that like black people wear their hair differently and you

1048
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,360
can't like you can't discriminate for jobs based on that, right?

1049
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,120
OK, which is fine.

1050
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:02,360
But this this act, it was called the crown act, as in like the crown of the head.

1051
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,160
And I'm like, how are all these fucking pieces of legislation have these cute

1052
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,600
ass acronyms like they fucking get away with it?

1053
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,680
I think they're just like like 90 percent of the time and effort is put

1054
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,680
into thinking up a cute little acronym for it, because they know that's how

1055
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,560
like people will read it in headlines and it's like the name's really important.

1056
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,080
That's how we get public support.

1057
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,680
I do think that maybe there is a there is a certain amount of effort

1058
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,920
that you have to spend.

1059
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,880
It's like, yeah, you can write up a really good piece of legislation,

1060
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,960
you know, and like maybe make it, you know, work on like, oh, is it bipartisan enough?

1061
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,080
Like, will it pass the Senate and Congress or whatever?

1062
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,600
Like, OK, it was a good, good, good.

1063
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,760
But also, does it have a really catchy nickname so that people will know what it is

1064
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,600
and remember it and it'll like get people talking about it, right?

1065
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,360
It'll make it sound better, you know, like, yeah, if it was just like

1066
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,520
government stimulus four, seven, six, three, that's like cold and uncaring.

1067
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,560
But if it's the CARES Act, I cared about the HEROES Act.

1068
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,880
I'm a hero.

1069
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,960
I'm working hard out in covid and I'm not getting paid any extra money.

1070
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,680
Nobody cares, but but I'm a hero.

1071
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,880
And that's what this bill says.

1072
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,040
So I'm OK with it.

1073
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,960
I will vote yes for the HEROES Act.

1074
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,160
I will vote yes for Donald Trump in 2020, CAG.

1075
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,080
I just love it.

1076
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,240
You know, I just love just MAGA and CAG.

1077
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,440
They're just fun to say, you know, they got that marketing down.

1078
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,600
Yeah. Yeah. CARES Act, HEROES Act, Crown Act.

1079
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,520
Yes, please. How could you vote no on any of these things?

1080
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,520
Names are important. Names are important.

1081
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,720
At the very least, I wouldn't have even remembered that that hair thing,

1082
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,160
except that it was called the Crown Act.

1083
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,240
And I just thought that was so that was so funny.

1084
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,080
Tisk, tisk. Mm hmm.

1085
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,640
Mm hmm.

1086
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,560
Um, what else?

1087
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,120
What else is going on? What else is going on in the world today?

1088
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,520
Oh, God, the world is just a fucked up, weird place right now.

1089
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,440
Sure, sure. It's good, good, good times.

1090
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,960
I don't know about that.

1091
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,440
I don't know if I can agree with you on that much.

1092
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,920
You know, being a little facetious, a little facetious there, but it's OK.

1093
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,840
I'm still trying to do 3D printing.

1094
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,560
3D printed a couple more things. It's pretty cool.

1095
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,840
I can't wait to make a model that I'll actually be able to 3D print.

1096
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,560
I have this great idea for this cool, like diorama print

1097
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,520
I want to make with all my characters based off a splash page of a comic

1098
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
that I'm thinking of also doing. Oh, it'll be cool.

1099
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,160
What do you mean a diorama print? What does that mean?

1100
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,760
Well, basically, the idea is like there's like I'm working on an Izumi project

1101
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,800
and like the last page is like this big single illustration

1102
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,200
of like these two characters facing each other down.

1103
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,640
And I'm thinking like if I take that and like print it,

1104
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,880
you could have like a full like a little diorama of this,

1105
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,840
because it's just going to be a 3D environment and two 3D characters.

1106
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,680
So you just put that in a little slicer, then I can print that page out in 3D

1107
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,200
and then have a full like 3D physical version of the last page of a comic book.

1108
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,160
And I just think that's pretty cool.

1109
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,440
And I want to try and do that. Hold on.

1110
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,480
What do you mean by 3D exactly?

1111
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,240
So like I'm going to I do like 3D models, right?

1112
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,920
Yeah, that's like my art now. I do like 3D.

1113
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,960
Yeah. So if I'm doing a, do you mean it's like Magic Eye?

1114
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,840
No, no, I mean, like literally 3D print it.

1115
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,120
So it's like a three dimensional sculpture.

1116
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,240
Oh, God. Wait, how big would it be?

1117
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,400
The printer doesn't print super big.

1118
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,400
I think it can print up to like an eight by eight cube.

1119
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,840
OK, it would be really funny if you were like,

1120
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,600
it's going to be a Magic Eye, you can hang it up.

1121
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,080
Well, now you've given me the idea.

1122
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,840
I wasn't sure if you meant that it was like that 90s kid money.

1123
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,680
I wasn't sure if you meant that it was like stereoscopic 3D, like red and blue,

1124
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,160
you know, or if it was like, you know, 3D, as in like it's 3D sculptures, right?

1125
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,520
As in it's like rendered, like rendered.

1126
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,280
3D is used in so many variations now, you can never be sure.

1127
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,400
Right. Right. People do that on Twitter.

1128
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,520
Like there are guys like you can you can do stereoscopic 3D renders.

1129
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,760
So like it'll render the thing twice.

1130
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,920
And then if you like squint your eyes, it'll make it look like popping out at you

1131
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,840
because of the way like your eyes work and how like there's a slight bit of separation.

1132
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,840
And so there are people who are like, we'll just upload to Twitter,

1133
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,600
like 3D models, like a turnaround.

1134
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,480
But like two of them slightly off center from each other.

1135
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,640
So if you so you like cross your eyes and yeah, it merges into one thing

1136
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,000
and it pops out of the screen at you.

1137
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,080
And I'm like, whoa, space age tech right there.

1138
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,840
The future is now permanently fucking up my eyesight

1139
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,440
just to have this pseudo 3D effect on Twitter.com.

1140
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,520
Hell yeah.

1141
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,240
Ah, man.

1142
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,520
It's cool. Too bad.

1143
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,800
Too bad the world is broken.

1144
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,160
Arts. Art sucks, dude. Art sucks.

1145
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,160
What a waste of time. No, no.

1146
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,520
What a fucking boring. I mean, it is a waste of time

1147
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,680
and it is boring and it is gay, but it's still pretty. Thank you.

1148
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,280
Thank you. You're right.

1149
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,280
No, I agree with everything, but not that.

1150
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,240
That's not cool. Nothing is cool.

1151
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,480
Everything's fringe.

1152
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,480
It's boring and it's gay and being cool is impossible.

1153
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,480
So therefore, boring and gay is all that's left.

1154
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,040
See, if you put if you put art on our cube grid, you know, our chart,

1155
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,960
it is it is all the way in the cringe.

1156
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,560
It's cringe, virgin and smooth brain.

1157
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,200
It's smooth. I don't know if it's smooth brain.

1158
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,680
It's not smooth brain. You have to get smooth brain.

1159
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,400
No, I think caring about art is smooth brain,

1160
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,080
but being able to do art itself,

1161
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,040
you got to be kind of not smooth brain to do it.

1162
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,080
It takes like effort, you know?

1163
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,240
But like it's in that corner so much in like the cringe corner

1164
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,280
that it like punctures through until like, you know,

1165
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,880
a parallel universe Mario 64 style and now it starts becoming based.

1166
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,080
No, that's just that's that's the

1167
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,920
that's like the death rattle of someone who's so cringe

1168
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,480
that they can't that they know they're never coming back.

1169
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,240
Oh, no, I'm actually so cringy that I circle around and being basic again.

1170
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,560
No, no, you're just an idiot.

1171
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,240
You're just a fucking nerd and you can't escape from that.

1172
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,840
You're in the fucking cringe basement and I've locked the door

1173
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,000
and you'll never come out to the people.

1174
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,480
It's leave a comment below.

1175
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,960
Oh, wait, you can't.

1176
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,360
We're not uploading this to YouTube.

1177
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,760
And absolutely pathetic.

1178
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,640
I bet they look to you.

1179
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,760
I bet they. Oh, can I can I can I scroll down the.

1180
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,080
Oh, oh, no, because I'm listening to this on.

1181
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,040
Wait, is it on Spotify?

1182
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,640
Because I'm listening to this on the procrastinators podcast dot com.

1183
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,200
And such a thing is impossible.

1184
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,480
Yes. Alas, someday the site will be worth going to.

1185
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,680
Maybe. I mean, it's worth going to.

1186
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,760
It's worth going to right now because it's where the podcast.

1187
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,360
It's worth going to if you just want to see a list of the fucking things

1188
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,160
and also see, oh, I see that.

1189
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,320
Wait. Oh, I see that this is like this is something

1190
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,040
that I would not have noticed in the description before.

1191
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,600
But there's a link here to a video by Oblivion Fall

1192
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,200
saying like how to like have good audio quality for.

1193
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,920
I forgot that was there.

1194
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,560
Yeah, I forgot that was the thing.

1195
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,280
But I see it pop up on the website because like of the way it like handles links or whatever.

1196
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,840
We also have this really aesthetic plant.

1197
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,040
With a nice bouquet background.

1198
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,040
Where you go to the website, it's right there.

1199
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,320
Did I like the header image for some reason.

1200
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,800
Did I did I tell you about the aloe?

1201
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,520
Did I mention the aloe about about how I got sunburn yesterday and my

1202
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,640
and I needed like aloe to rub on it and my roommate has an aloe plant.

1203
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,520
And he just like cut one of the leaves off and gave it to me.

1204
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,240
And I just had to like squeeze the leaf and like squeeze all the goo out of it

1205
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,560
and just like rub it on my body.

1206
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,440
Just raw.

1207
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,760
And, you know, I was disappointed.

1208
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,040
Is a little slime adjacent, do you think?

1209
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,280
Aloe is aloe is just full of slime.

1210
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,720
It's just full of slime.

1211
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,120
It's kind of true.

1212
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,760
But here's the thing.

1213
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,400
Have you ever had like an aloe drink?

1214
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,440
A few times.

1215
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,480
Not exactly my favorite thing, but I like this.

1216
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,960
I like them a lot.

1217
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,880
So I was like, well, I'm going to taste with this raw aloe taste like.

1218
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,960
And I was like, maybe it'll be a little sweet, but probably not.

1219
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,520
It'll probably just kind of taste like grass, because I know that like,

1220
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,000
you know, they add sugar and stuff to an aloe drink.

1221
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,480
I didn't think it would taste like the drink.

1222
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,120
Turns out it tastes so bad.

1223
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,000
It actually it actually tastes like you're like biting

1224
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,240
into like an aspirin pill or something.

1225
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:45,800
It's that bad and bitter legendary person known for

1226
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:52,560
not endorsing eating slugs, but consumes aloe of his own volition.

1227
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,640
It's a plant. Yeah, it's a fucking plant.

1228
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,600
Yeah, it's like, oh, boy, what wacky.

1229
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,480
Like, oh, what did you what did you find?

1230
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,520
Like a we just plucked a fruit off a tree and ate it.

1231
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,160
Like, boy, what a what a crazy thing to do.

1232
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,080
It could. It could have a fucking brain.

1233
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,960
You know, Miba in a dude you never know.

1234
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,240
You're you're right. You're technically right.

1235
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,360
Look, I just wanted to taste it.

1236
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,480
And you know what? I did. And I'm not sorry.

1237
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,560
But aloe is very much slime adjacent.

1238
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,520
It is an extremely slimy plant.

1239
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,160
And you know what? I think it might have worked.

1240
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,760
I think rubbing its blood all over me actually helps

1241
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,120
because I don't feel too sunburny.

1242
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,360
It's pretty killer. It's pretty killer.

1243
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,160
Yeah, cutting something open and rubbing its medicinal blood all over you.

1244
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,920
It was just like, you know, it had it was slime time,

1245
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,240
like just like in slime and punishment, you know, the cop killer

1246
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,240
has got to have his slime time and I had it and it was based.

1247
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,440
Do you want to go to voice? Do you want to go voicemails?

1248
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,000
Yeah, we've we've done an hour.

1249
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,520
We've done our due diligence.

1250
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,440
I think so. I think so.

1251
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,760
Speakpipe.com, my friends, if you want to stick it to the man

1252
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,120
and leave a voicemail, even though we should be paying for it, but aren't.

1253
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,640
Speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.

1254
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,840
And hey, maybe go to the procrastinatorspodcast.com

1255
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,680
and check out that informational video by Oblivionfall

1256
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,360
about how to get good audio quality if you want to impress us.

1257
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:24,320
All right. So first one we got this week is from Send Ducking Help Motherfuckers.

1258
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,320
That's a big ask.

1259
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,800
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it, frankly.

1260
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,320
But let's see what he has to say. All right.

1261
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,360
Three, two, one, go.

1262
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,800
I did a blunt, two dabs, a round of pipes,

1263
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:45,040
Jameson, whiskey, bourbon, beer.

1264
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,280
I did everything under the fucking sun except the toad.

1265
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,000
And now I'm out of work, motherfuckers.

1266
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,720
Send fucking help.

1267
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,040
Send fucking help, motherfucker.

1268
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,600
Oh, OK.

1269
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,480
So that's just starting out strong today.

1270
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,000
Was that riddle my ass?

1271
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,400
That sounds like riddle my ass.

1272
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,360
I think that was just riddle my ass, Batman being drunk at work

1273
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,960
and calling it just miss messaging the voicemail.

1274
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,000
You know, sorry, I think it's too late.

1275
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,680
This was sent six days ago.

1276
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,600
Sticking to the band, though, I appreciate.

1277
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,160
I respect the the effort, you know, absolutely.

1278
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,200
We need to unionize and get ever when everyone

1279
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,920
the the constitutional right to be drunk at work, I think, you know,

1280
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,400
that's construction workers, you know, truckers, Uber drivers.

1281
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,360
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

1282
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,320
What's the worst that could happen?

1283
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,480
Why it it's a human right.

1284
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,760
I just think it's a human right. That's all.

1285
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,640
All right. Another one for riddle my ass, Batman, halfway sober this time.

1286
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,880
This one's 50 seconds long, so I might get bored.

1287
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,480
But let's let's find out three, two, one, go.

1288
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,880
Hey, PCP, two things.

1289
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,640
One, if you played the help me, motherfucker, I need help kind of video.

1290
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,600
That was not a joke.

1291
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,400
I really was fucking obliterated.

1292
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,160
We could tell.

1293
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,480
We know. And second.

1294
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,880
I'm still lying over.

1295
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,640
And second, I'm thinking about doing a comic

1296
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,960
like in a comic.

1297
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,160
So for the drawboys out there, I have a question.

1298
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,160
Yeah, like, would a.

1299
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,400
Comic about the riddle my ass Batman series be a good idea?

1300
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
And so where do I post it?

1301
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,800
How do I go about that?

1302
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,000
This question is too long.

1303
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,560
Sorry. Awesome. It's fine.

1304
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,560
It's thank you. All right.

1305
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,240
Well, we just had a long discussion about how art is gay and the worst thing ever.

1306
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,840
So my answer is definitely yes, do it.

1307
01:03:54,920 --> 01:04:00,040
If you, I mean, if you want to do it, then that means you should do it.

1308
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,760
So like, that's it.

1309
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,920
Like, that's the beginning and the end of answering the question for me.

1310
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,080
Do it if you want.

1311
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,000
Wanting to do it is all the reason you need room where to post it.

1312
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,400
I mean, what do you think?

1313
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,360
Where do I mean?

1314
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:21,600
You know, there's a you can post it on like to pass web web web web

1315
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,960
tune, tapas, posts, I would definitely put it on Twitter and at

1316
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,440
yeah, people. Yeah.

1317
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,800
So that's a good way of discovery.

1318
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,600
And then you can have the full thing on something like to pass or web

1319
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,920
tune or shit. Yeah. Yeah.

1320
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,120
Post it and all posted like on every platform you can

1321
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,680
and on everywhere you post it link to all the other ones, right?

1322
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,480
Yep. Like that's that's how you.

1323
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,960
You got it. You got to break.

1324
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,720
You got to break your way in somehow and you might as well

1325
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,840
just do the biggest all out like social media blitz you can.

1326
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,400
There's no reason not to.

1327
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,480
Yeah, post it everywhere.

1328
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,800
That's the answer.

1329
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,680
OK, next one is from a new bit.

1330
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,000
Three, two, one, go.

1331
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,120
What's up, game?

1332
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,880
It's just got back from the gym.

1333
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,800
Ready for another Daily Q&A first question this week.

1334
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,400
Fuck yeah.

1335
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,320
If podcasts only come out every week, how will you do a Daily Q&A?

1336
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,640
What's something about like dog?

1337
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,160
God, this lost all its momentum.

1338
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,600
Wow. You can tell these new with this.

1339
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,760
That's OK. It wasn't very funny.

1340
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,000
Come back next day for another Daily Q&A.

1341
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,520
God, fuck. Oh, God, you had me.

1342
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,520
You had me so high.

1343
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,040
Damn, that was it.

1344
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,120
It was like that was a huge drop off.

1345
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,120
It was like a vertical drop.

1346
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,120
This video this this voicemail was designed to be like, dude,

1347
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,720
we're in for a treat now.

1348
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,960
I like, oh, where's it coming?

1349
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,880
What's going to be the punchline? Oh, nothing.

1350
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,520
Oh, I lost the thread. Oh, what am I?

1351
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,720
Sorry, I made this voicemail, guys. Goodbye.

1352
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,640
Close, though, close.

1353
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,960
He had he had it.

1354
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,080
All he had to do was ride that wave to the end.

1355
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:05,240
He couldn't he couldn't stick the landing as the person who invented the Q&A.

1356
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,840
My potential.

1357
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,200
But you got to you got to spend more time in the gym,

1358
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,400
both working out and working on your bit.

1359
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,760
Tom invented the Q&A like George Lucas invented shot reverse shot.

1360
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,520
Exactly. Every time you use it.

1361
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,120
You have to pay for our time.

1362
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,920
Speaking of the gym.

1363
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,480
Well, today, you know, I got walking around Boston yesterday, marching.

1364
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,920
I got more exercise than I got than I've gotten in months.

1365
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,040
Maybe I wonder if now is the time to capitalize on my like

1366
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,800
on my on my on my on my and crew of energy.

1367
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,080
Yeah, because like you say you can't wait to go back to the gym.

1368
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,440
I have no excuse because my gym is in my basement.

1369
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,640
Will today be the day?

1370
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,440
Probably not today.

1371
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,440
Maybe tomorrow will tomorrow be the day.

1372
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,520
It's not a good sign.

1373
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,640
No next week.

1374
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,600
Everybody. I know my feet hurt.

1375
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,600
No, my feet hurt.

1376
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,640
Oh, when I'm sunburned.

1377
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,440
It hurts.

1378
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,120
It's hot.

1379
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,840
Oh, God, you're dropping rungs back into the cringe.

1380
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,640
No, that's not true.

1381
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:07,080
No, if I go down deep enough, I can circle back around and be based again.

1382
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,520
No, I just get impossible, physically impossible,

1383
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,320
conserving the law.

1384
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,000
This universe operates according to a certain law,

1385
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,200
and that law is known as the conservation of cringe or of base.

1386
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,880
And and and and one one thing can only become cringe as something else become base.

1387
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,200
You can't just you can't create baseness out of nothing.

1388
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,560
Therefore, therefore, there's no such thing like like there must be a gradient.

1389
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,560
You must follow an gradient.

1390
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,800
OK, there's no fraction of reserve cringing in our system.

1391
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,120
I don't think so.

1392
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,120
How unfortunate.

1393
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,920
I think if there was, we would have seen it by now, and they just we just don't

1394
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,920
have the evidence. It's fair enough.

1395
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,160
So next one is from Toa.

1396
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,840
Three, two, one, go.

1397
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,880
Hey, can I see your feet?

1398
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,080
Can I see your feet?

1399
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,560
You know, I was really hoping this is going to be a bionicle thing.

1400
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:13,520
Totally let down completely couldn't be a bigger disappointment.

1401
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,240
Toa, buddy.

1402
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,120
Yeah, DM me restraining order is in the mail.

1403
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,760
Also that OK, next one is from a message to Ben.

1404
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,120
So this is going to be this is going to be a difficult boy.

1405
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,240
This is going to be emotionally challenging.

1406
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,800
So shame Ben's on on the podcast three, two, one, go.

1407
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,360
Hey, Ben, three things.

1408
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,720
Please stop using Twitter like Twitter is cringe, bro.

1409
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,360
It only makes people sad or angry.

1410
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,280
Second, it's not wrong.

1411
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,000
You keep asking, what's the point?

1412
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,120
There is no point.

1413
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,200
There's no point to anything.

1414
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,640
And that's a hundred percent base.

1415
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,680
I know, man.

1416
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,680
I stop saying so much.

1417
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,800
You say like 20 times an episode, like every five minutes you make.

1418
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,400
Oh, yeah.

1419
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,000
And that's true.

1420
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Thank you. Love you.

1421
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,800
But damn, right on all points, he absolutely demolished you.

1422
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,520
In fact, I think he is right on all points.

1423
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,520
Well, what was the first one?

1424
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,960
Oh, stop using Twitter.

1425
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,920
I know. Absolutely true.

1426
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,760
I actually have kind of stopped using Twitter.

1427
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,600
I haven't I've barely posted the last three days.

1428
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,480
I've like made a couple of retweets, and that's about it.

1429
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,840
I know. Yeah, whatever.

1430
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,600
OK, yeah, he get he wins. He wins.

1431
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,640
I lose. He wins.

1432
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,400
OK, message to Ben, more like a message to base.

1433
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,720
All right. Message received.

1434
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,840
Message received episode of Steven Universe.

1435
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,640
Next one is from Darren the Rad.

1436
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,720
Three, two, one, go.

1437
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,960
So I'm going to say something super controversial,

1438
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:08,160
but video games are the worst hobby, fucking build shit.

1439
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,920
Um, agreed, hard to agree.

1440
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,480
I don't know.

1441
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,440
They're the worst hobby, but they're definitely not productive.

1442
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,600
I'll give you that for sure.

1443
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,160
What does he mean by build shit?

1444
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,800
Because like you could you could be technically building shit

1445
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,360
if you're like building like model trains or something.

1446
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,680
And like that's equally unproductive.

1447
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,800
Like that also doesn't accomplish anything.

1448
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,040
I guess I guess you could say you're you're kind of like

1449
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,600
learning how to like, you know, construct things.

1450
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,080
And I wouldn't say it's like super valuable.

1451
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,400
I would say in terms of if like video games have zero percent value,

1452
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,480
that's like one percent value.

1453
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,040
If you wanted to, you could go and be like,

1454
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,920
oh, video games improve your and hand-eye coordination.

1455
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,240
That seems like a myth to me.

1456
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,800
Well, that's how I feel about the, oh,

1457
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,880
well, like you're learning to do construction

1458
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,080
or you're learning how to push it together.

1459
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:06,240
I think if you say build things, you mean like create something.

1460
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,440
That makes more sense to me.

1461
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,760
Like build like a business or a side hustle

1462
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,760
or something like that, do something productive.

1463
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,560
Even then, I wouldn't go so far as to say the video games are the worst.

1464
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,720
I think there are plenty of equally pointless hobbies.

1465
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,560
Oh, for sure. For sure.

1466
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,160
But in essence, I agree.

1467
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,680
The video games are the worst thing in the world.

1468
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,960
And nobody and you shouldn't touch some of the ten foot pole.

1469
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,560
They ruin my life.

1470
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,560
Yeah.

1471
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,160
Except a Pokemon showdown.

1472
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,440
Fight me on Pokemon showdown.

1473
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,040
There's exceptions to every rule. Of course, of course.

1474
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:49,280
Next one is from lack of Ben solo cast makes Araylo sad.

1475
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,960
Oh, I see what they're doing here.

1476
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,160
I see. I get it. I get it.

1477
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,880
Three, two, one, go.

1478
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,320
Where is the Ben solo cast?

1479
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,080
Ben St promised it.

1480
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,520
He even said at one point it was a semi Ben solo cast.

1481
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,120
But here we are without any conversation about the best Star Wars character.

1482
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:10,680
Ben solo, please help us, Ben St.

1483
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,120
You're our only hope.

1484
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,320
Disney has left Ben solo out in the cold, only selling bad guy,

1485
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,840
Kylo Ren merch, and yet we only have fans stuff to turn to.

1486
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,240
And the promised Ben solo cast

1487
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,560
still isn't even here.

1488
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,640
Little like a little like Giggle at the end.

1489
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,640
Yeah, I get it.

1490
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,960
Funny, funny joke, funny pun.

1491
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,880
The Ben solo cast was about it was going to happen today,

1492
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,640
but then Tom joined at the last minute and ruined everything.

1493
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,480
So I'm sorry.

1494
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,400
Ralo is crying right now because of you, Tom.

1495
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,640
You know, I'm proud.

1496
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,520
It feels great. Fuck the Ralo's.

1497
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,640
OK, there you go. I said it.

1498
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,680
Cool. Well, there you have it, folks.

1499
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,400
All right. Next one is PCP

1500
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,520
diss track from Do Not Play

1501
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,200
if there are less than three people on call at fuck you dot com.

1502
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,600
Anyway, I'm going to play it three to one go.

1503
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,200
I don't think you guys are ready for this.

1504
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,520
OK, there's a link. There is a link.

1505
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:26,160
I don't think. OK, I opened the link earlier

1506
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,280
and it is it is like a four minute long song.

1507
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,640
It is a it is an anti PCP diss track.

1508
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,520
It is a it is, you know, it's laying the smack down on our asses.

1509
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,040
I didn't listen to the whole thing

1510
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,200
because this was like a minute before the podcast started.

1511
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:45,280
But I will put the fucking link in the description

1512
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,960
if you want to go and check it out.

1513
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,880
This is this is from the this is from the the procrastinators anonymous.

1514
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:55,040
The pro and on cast.

1515
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,560
So it's on their channel.

1516
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,160
They guess they wrote it.

1517
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,600
They are criminals.

1518
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,360
But I'm looking at it now.

1519
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,240
My my face is not in the thumbnail,

1520
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,680
so I would just have to assume that I am not being dissed.

1521
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,960
The thumbnail is give give Nate, Jesse,

1522
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,160
Munchie, me and Digi, and you're not in it.

1523
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,520
So get fucked.

1524
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,680
It just means I'm not.

1525
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,160
They don't hate me.

1526
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:25,800
Maybe that's that's how I'm going to that's stupid.

1527
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,840
That's so fucking stupid.

1528
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,840
From what from a little I've heard of the pro and on cast.

1529
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,800
They stand me pretty hard over there.

1530
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,320
Really? Yeah. Amazing.

1531
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,200
Feels good. Why? Why?

1532
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,120
I can't know why I don't get it.

1533
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,200
Look a gift horse in the mouth.

1534
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,160
What reason could they possibly have?

1535
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,800
OK, whatever. As good as mine.

1536
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,800
Stupid.

1537
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,080
The next one is from Cool Skellon.

1538
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,360
OK, this is this is a minute 30.

1539
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,520
We're in for a long call on this one.

1540
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,600
All right.

1541
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,600
Well, we'll see. We'll see if it's worth the time.

1542
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,240
All right. Three, two, one, go.

1543
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,240
Hey, the progress, natives.

1544
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,920
I just did a bit of a science experiment last night,

1545
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,960
and I wanted y'all to know about it.

1546
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:16,720
So I was just listening to a PCP episode 123.

1547
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,520
I'm a bit behind, I know, but I'm getting there.

1548
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,960
And I heard about, you know, when you're talking about,

1549
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:28,160
oh, your phone just listens to you, right?

1550
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,840
And it picks up advertising data that way, as opposed to I know this.

1551
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,760
I know what he's going to say.

1552
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,240
Gay and shitty and bad.

1553
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,040
We use them and they're good.

1554
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:43,240
But I last night for like 30 minutes, I was high as fuck, right?

1555
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:51,680
And I was just I was monologuing at my phone about how much I want to see.

1556
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:58,680
Cool skeletons, cool skeletons, skeletons with sunglasses,

1557
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:04,720
skeletons on the beach with a margarita or perhaps one of those fucking

1558
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,040
seagrams fruit, like beverages with alcohol, like a tiny, tiny,

1559
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,120
like five percent alcohol, not even that kind of thing.

1560
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:18,800
And we'll like a skeleton in a Hawaiian shirt, a skeleton in Ray Bands,

1561
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,880
a cool fucking skeleton.

1562
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,840
And I got it.

1563
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,280
I got the skeleton.

1564
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:30,680
I opened up Facebook the next day and it's a bunch of those personalized shirts.

1565
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,800
But is it up like a like a.

1566
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,200
Was that it?

1567
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,200
Oh, I guess he got cut off.

1568
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,560
Damn.

1569
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,320
Sounds like the experiment was a success.

1570
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,960
This happened to me recently as well.

1571
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,240
I was congratulations on your cool skeleton.

1572
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,480
Yeah, yeah, go on.

1573
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,920
I was talking about how I was just talking to my sister about how I was like

1574
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,280
having like a shitty time sleeping because she was kind of come over.

1575
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:59,520
I had something I had to give her and my phone just immediately popped up

1576
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,480
like 10 minutes later.

1577
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,960
It's like five apps to help you sleep.

1578
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,760
I'm like, oh, please never do that again.

1579
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:05,760
Five, five, what?

1580
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,760
Five apps to help you sleep better like a personalized.

1581
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,000
So I immediately went in and turned off microphone access to all the apps.

1582
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,280
I'm sure it doesn't actually work.

1583
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,040
It makes me feel a little better.

1584
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,080
Um, somebody.

1585
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:23,800
Wait, it was someone on Twitter, someone on Twitter messaged me.

1586
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:31,040
Oh, this guy, nobunty on Twitter said that listening to the PCP and hearing

1587
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,120
me talk about gummies infected his Amazon recommendations.

1588
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,000
And now he gets and now he gets his Amazon recommendations are full

1589
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
of like Xanthan gum and stuff.

1590
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,000
This is some fucked up shit.

1591
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,360
Yeah, world gone mad.

1592
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,960
Wait, wait, hold on.

1593
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,520
Hold the phone.

1594
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,360
Pause. Pause the podcast.

1595
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,600
Wait, really? News.

1596
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,880
OK. Oh my God.

1597
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,520
Uh, before this podcast started, I put it up something on Twitter saying

1598
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,880
I had a new T-shirt available, the Pixel Sunset T-shirt, because everyone

1599
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,040
thought the background from Ninja Suffering was really cool.

1600
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,720
So I made it an all over print T-shirt.

1601
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,360
Two copies have already been sold.

1602
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:09,160
Two shirts confirmed sold in the time this podcast has been recorded.

1603
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,040
Oh, amazing.

1604
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,000
Incredible. They're on Teespring.

1605
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,240
These are Teespring all over prints. Teespring.com.

1606
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,080
I am merch. There it is.

1607
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:18,800
And it looks great.

1608
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,480
It's aesthetic.

1609
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,440
It took a long time to make the design because the way the template is

1610
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,040
designed is really weird, but it's there.

1611
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,120
It's cool. It's dope.

1612
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,400
Success, dude.

1613
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,440
Fucking sick.

1614
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,160
Capitalism, I'm part of the problem.

1615
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,680
Have you have you purchased a T from Teespring before?

1616
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:38,800
I got a free sample from Teespring of one of my own items.

1617
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,200
What did you think of it?

1618
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,200
It was OK.

1619
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,320
It wasn't like the best thing in the world, but I don't know.

1620
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,880
I feel like everybody tells me that they think that Teespring's T-shirts are bad.

1621
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:54,560
I have gotten like four T-shirts from them and I like them all.

1622
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,960
I think they're actually pretty good.

1623
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,120
I do. I do get I get like the the V-neck.

1624
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,080
I get like the clap.

1625
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,560
I get like the premium V-necks.

1626
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,160
So maybe I'm getting like, you know, the choice, the choice cuts or whatever.

1627
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,640
Well, they say they're bad.

1628
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,720
Do they mean the quality of the print or the quality of the shirt?

1629
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,640
I mean, I think.

1630
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,920
Generally, I've heard people complain about the quality of the shirt.

1631
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,080
More than the more than the print.

1632
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,800
But I might have heard both.

1633
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,120
I don't know.

1634
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,280
Because I thought the print quality of what I got was not great.

1635
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,000
It was good, but not great.

1636
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,560
But I got I got a I got a hoodie and the hoodie was pretty comfortable.

1637
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,880
I have not really had any big.

1638
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,760
I think I think there was one shirt that I ordered for them with a print quality

1639
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,960
was not great and the colors didn't come out quite as like vibrant as I hoped for.

1640
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,160
But mostly it's been fine.

1641
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,240
So I don't know.

1642
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:52,400
I I still use for not using CMYK funds.

1643
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,840
Maybe. Yeah, maybe.

1644
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,880
I never do CMYK, even though I should.

1645
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,320
Does that help?

1646
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,280
I mean, CMYK is formatted specifically to be printed out in physical items

1647
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,520
as opposed to being on screen.

1648
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,520
That's why it exists, huh?

1649
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,160
Interesting, neat, curious, very curious.

1650
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,720
I went to college for graphic design.

1651
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,720
That's how I know that.

1652
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,360
Forty thousand dollars well spent for knowing about CMYK

1653
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,760
and choosing not to use it anyway.

1654
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,640
Yeah, cool.

1655
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:26,960
Interesting, interesting.

1656
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,880
OK, good to know.

1657
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,800
I'm going to make a mental note of that.

1658
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,240
So wait, we got we got one more.

1659
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:38,480
This is another one from Margar, who called last week.

1660
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,760
And I forget what they said.

1661
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,240
But here, let's let's fucking do it.

1662
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,960
They closed out the show last week, too.

1663
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,680
They did. They did.

1664
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,680
Weird.

1665
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,000
I this was I think maybe this is their this is their M.O.

1666
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,200
Maybe they just listened to the episode like a long time into the week

1667
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:57,800
or they must just listen to the episodes at the right time on like a Saturday night.

1668
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
That just must be their schedule and it lines up.

1669
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,840
It's true. But OK, so here we go.

1670
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,440
Three, two, one.

1671
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,680
Either PCP.

1672
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:12,240
I have a question about the state of the lectures that are yet to come out.

1673
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:18,520
Because I know there are a few lectures that haven't been released yet.

1674
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,600
And with the state of your YouTube channel and other circumstances,

1675
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,200
do you plan to still release those on your YouTube channel?

1676
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:33,640
If not, what's the plan for going into the future with the lectures?

1677
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,160
I would assume they would all be continuing to be going off

1678
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,560
by everyone's individual channels.

1679
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,920
The only one who didn't do that was me, because a hippo.

1680
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,440
Oh, yeah, hippo did, too, with the risk of lecture.

1681
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:50,240
Fuck yeah, because like collectively those brought in like over two thousand

1682
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,680
new subscribers to the PCP.

1683
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:56,920
Um, I would assume that.

1684
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:05,240
We were like, I think Digi was going to upload hers on the PCP channel.

1685
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,640
I think that was the plan.

1686
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,880
And so I would assume that, like.

1687
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:15,240
I mean, best best case scenario, our videos get restored.

1688
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,880
We post all the content that we have not been posting there, you know,

1689
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,640
retroactively, and then we continue posting there.

1690
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,600
And, you know, that lecture, for instance, goes up there.

1691
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,680
I think Munchie was going to post his on the channel, too.

1692
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,920
I'm not sure about that.

1693
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,720
I'm not. I'm not a team player.

1694
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,520
I'm I'm an asshole.

1695
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,080
I'm I'm bow guarding mine.

1696
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,120
I'm keeping it on my channel.

1697
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:44,960
And the the OK, so that's the best case scenario.

1698
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,920
Worst case scenario, I guess, would be that the videos never get restored.

1699
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:53,040
But I think even in that case, we're still planning on, like, at some point,

1700
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,320
just calling it a loss, calling in as many of the lost videos as we can from,

1701
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,640
you know, people that might have them saved, reposting them and then,

1702
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,440
you know, continuing to post anyway.

1703
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,760
So I think in either case, yeah, the videos that we're going to go up

1704
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,600
on the PCP channel will still be going up there.

1705
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,600
So, yeah, that's the plan.

1706
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,960
And it's mostly just a question of, like, when will we know?

1707
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,520
What the plan is for the channel?

1708
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:26,160
And the answer is whenever YouTube decides to do the thing,

1709
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:30,120
it's been saying for a month that it's going to do and that they could do

1710
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:34,160
in minutes, but there's the guy that it doesn't matter.

1711
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,640
Dude, it makes me OK.

1712
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,400
Let's let's close out this fucking episode of the roundabout YouTube.

1713
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,800
It makes me so fucking mad that on Twitter,

1714
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,000
they, like, answered me saying the channel has been terminated or,

1715
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
like, no, they answered me saying, hey, the channel came back,

1716
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,720
but the videos are still gone.

1717
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,640
All our Radcon stuff is gone.

1718
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:58,920
And they were like, give it give it 48 hours.

1719
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:03,160
We already see the Radcon content back because of that one stream.

1720
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,520
They saw that the one stream was was there and that it had the same word

1721
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,800
in the name just assumed that that was what I was talking about.

1722
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,280
And we're like, oh, no, no, no, OK, he's already wrong.

1723
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,880
No, this idiot just doesn't know what's going on with his own channel.

1724
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, the problem is fixed.

1725
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,600
He just has to figure out that we already fix the problem.

1726
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,160
This fucking idiot, like, no, no, they didn't fucking fix the problem.

1727
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,800
And they don't care.

1728
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,000
And and I. Oh, my fuck.

1729
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,360
Like the fact that the fact that I know exactly and they had a little

1730
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,680
fucking smiley face, I'm like, haha, silly, that's not real.

1731
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,560
You just imagine that there's a problem.

1732
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,240
We fixed everything. We haven't handled.

1733
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,360
You fucking didn't.

1734
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,600
You fucking ruined it for no reason.

1735
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,320
There was no reason at all.

1736
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,560
The case was solved.

1737
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,840
You you fucked up the first time, right?

1738
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,680
Well, we fucked up and then you kind of fucked up.

1739
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,760
You took a while to fix it, but you fixed it.

1740
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,920
OK, and then you came and you were like, hmm, uh, hmm.

1741
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,160
Why don't I just ruin it again for no reason?

1742
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,840
And that's what they fucking did.

1743
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,760
And now they're like, all being all tweet about like, uh, no, no, no,

1744
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:07,320
no, we understand the urgency of fixing this problem.

1745
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,720
We understand that you want your content back.

1746
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,720
Don't worry, our internal team is handling it.

1747
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,320
Oh, so we already see the video back.

1748
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,320
Like, no, it's going to be finally.

1749
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,640
Haha. Oh, I hate it, Tom.

1750
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,960
I hate them so fucking much.

1751
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,920
Yeah, YouTube is a goddamn nightmare.

1752
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:28,080
I mean, it's like I've said it before, but as soon as as soon

1753
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,680
as the videos come back, if they do, I'm immediately setting up a library

1754
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,440
account, everything will be mirrored on there.

1755
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,080
And this won't happen again.

1756
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:40,520
And God in heaven, please stop YouTube is shit.

1757
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,600
They can't keep getting away with this.

1758
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,520
Like, people's entire livelihoods are on this website and there's

1759
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,480
just no communication at all.

1760
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,560
It's like, seems impossible, yet here we are.

1761
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,960
Yeah, I.

1762
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,760
Part of me wishes they would part of me wishes they would just say, like,

1763
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,000
now we're just not going to restore it.

1764
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,520
Like, stop emailing us just just so we would know.

1765
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,480
Like, just so we could be over and we could, like, move forward.

1766
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,240
You know, I do think.

1767
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:15,800
The fact that they're they're continuing to correspond

1768
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,760
does make me think that they at least intend to fix it.

1769
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,200
I think it's giving them a lot of credit.

1770
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:28,080
Well, but when I say that intend, I mean that whoever is sending these emails

1771
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:33,760
probably has faith or at least is paid to present as though they have faith

1772
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,120
that the system will work itself out.

1773
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,200
You know, it's just appeasement.exe sending emails.

1774
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,440
I do think they are written by a person.

1775
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:48,320
I don't I don't I don't think they are fully algorithmic.

1776
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,840
There are algorithms are pretty advanced.

1777
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,440
They can make reservations over the phone with a real voice

1778
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:58,360
that sounds like a human being doesn't seem out of the out of the realm

1779
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,840
of possibility to be able to write emails algorithmically.

1780
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:08,040
I guess, especially when they said there's like basically nobody working

1781
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,560
at YouTube right now because of covid.

1782
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,280
God, what a fucking dystopian nightmare that would be

1783
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,840
if like it has just been a robot auto responding the whole time.

1784
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,280
Do you think that's likely?

1785
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,240
It's possible. I mean, this is if any company was going to do it,

1786
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,680
would be Google, right? They're the ones.

1787
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:30,200
Yeah, algorithmic ties, everything.

1788
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,840
Yeah, and now would be the time when like people aren't work.

1789
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,560
They don't have as many employees.

1790
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,400
Like now would be the time for them to roll out those algorithms

1791
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,240
to cover up the work shortages happening, right?

1792
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,400
Because like you would think they probably have a thing set up where like

1793
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:46,640
an algorithm is responding to all these emails and mask and then flagging.

1794
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,600
And then they have staff that goes through those flags and makes changes.

1795
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,320
But if nobody working there, it would explain why nothing is happening.

1796
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,960
Yeah, it's just sending flags and there's nobody in the office

1797
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,680
to actually examine the problem.

1798
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,520
Meanwhile, the robots just like, we're working on it.

1799
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,680
We're working on it. We're working on it.

1800
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,840
And no one's actually there to do the work.

1801
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:10,640
The. OK, the the weird part or a weird part about that is like,

1802
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:15,560
I don't want to read the whole thing, but like there was a point in the emails

1803
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:20,680
where it claimed to change identity.

1804
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,280
This is OK. There was one.

1805
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:27,440
OK, all the correspondence has been with someone calling themselves Martin,

1806
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,960
except for one email two days ago, which claimed to be from April,

1807
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,400
filling in for my colleague.

1808
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,320
This is April filling in for my colleague.

1809
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,480
The colleague is presumably Martin.

1810
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:44,720
And they both they both have like a little Google YouTube team logo

1811
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:48,440
at the end of the email, but Martin has a little extra blurb

1812
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,440
with like links to like protect your YouTube channel with two step verification or whatever.

1813
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:58,360
It's all very weird, you know, and like that seems like a person thing

1814
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,920
that could be true.

1815
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,160
But then like you watch their presentation of that like voice thing

1816
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:07,960
I'm talking about, and they purposely add in like they go out of their way.

1817
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,600
But yeah, we want to make it sound more human.

1818
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,200
So we have it say, um, and stutter sometimes to sound like a human speaking

1819
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,600
so you don't get clued in that it's a robot.

1820
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,760
So it's like they're thinking about these things.

1821
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,600
There's there's there's no way to know.

1822
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:23,040
Like, yeah, I I think it's a person.

1823
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,240
But I can't.

1824
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,040
I don't know.

1825
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,360
I can't pretend like I'm super confident that it is.

1826
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,560
We're getting fucking Turing tests.

1827
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,720
Yeah, seriously.

1828
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:41,120
That's what they've used this entire code as a baby test their AI message to Ben.

1829
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
I'm sorry, I keep sighing.

1830
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,520
I just caught myself doing it.

1831
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,080
I apologize.

1832
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:49,360
It seems it seems worth it in this particular context.

1833
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,400
This is a sigh worthy conversation.

1834
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,080
What can I say?

1835
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,440
I'm just I'm listless.

1836
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,640
This is this is this is removing all my lists.

1837
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,040
No complaints about me burping, which I also do all the time.

1838
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,640
Well, that's funny.

1839
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,720
Yeah, sometimes.

1840
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:09,600
And they're and it's based and it's and it's it's Chad.

1841
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,840
Mm hmm.

1842
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,080
Oh, OK.

1843
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,480
Well, I don't know, man.

1844
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,680
And we've come to the end of the voicemails.

1845
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,360
Indeed.

1846
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:22,320
You got anything else you wanted to any of the grievances you wanted to air

1847
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,760
a live on YouTube and by live, I mean, prerecorded,

1848
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,360
prerecorded, not on YouTube.

1849
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,360
Right.

1850
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,200
Correct.

1851
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,360
So that's it.

1852
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,840
That's exactly what I meant.

1853
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:37,240
I think I think I'm good.

1854
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,600
Everything is fucking weird and just taking a day by day as are we all.

1855
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,960
Just do the best you can out there, everybody.

1856
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,200
Yeah, yeah.

1857
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:52,120
And try not to sigh too much, you know, it's annoying.

1858
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,880
Give yourself a sigh every now and then.

1859
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:54,880
Don't bother it all up.

1860
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:55,720
It's unhealthy.

1861
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,640
Sure, sure.

1862
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,160
There's a health.

1863
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,920
There's a healthy medium to be struck here.

1864
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,600
And, you know, thanks for thanks for tuning in.

1865
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:07,880
If you want to hear a whole bunch more bullshit.

1866
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,440
What's our fucking Patreon?

1867
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:15,000
Patreon.com slash the procrastinate.

1868
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,520
Procrastinators.

1869
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,400
That's right.

1870
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,400
That's right.

1871
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,400
Yeah, fucking fucking join that shit.

1872
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:28,120
Get a whole bunch of get a whole bunch of fucking doodah,

1873
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:31,360

1874
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,240
What would you do?

1875
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,200
Do we do a bonus episode last month?

1876
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,880
The last one, I believe, is guns versus swords, which was deleted.

1877
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:41,560
Oh, right.

1878
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,880
OK, cool.

1879
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,480
But it's still up on.

1880
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,320
Wait, is that up on like iTunes?

1881
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,520
Do the bonus episodes go up on iTunes?

1882
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,320
I don't know.

1883
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,880
They don't. So they're just gone.

1884
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,520
So when well, when?

1885
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,440
Well, when the algorithm fucking

1886
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,320
deans to deal with our problem,

1887
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:00,120
then there will be a new bonus episode every month.

1888
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,720
That's when we fucking do it, lads.

1889
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,520
All right.

1890
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,000
Become a patron and we love you and thanks for listening.

1891
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,840
And we'll see you next week, everybody.

1892
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,640
Peace. Peace out.

1893
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,040
Good night. God bless.

1894
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,240
Sweet dreams. Stay.

1895
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,200
Whoa.

1896
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,720
Stay and stay on Zoom, stay on Zoom.

1897
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,760
Bye.

1898
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,760
Bye.
